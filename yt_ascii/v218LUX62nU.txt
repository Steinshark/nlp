and here we are with a new talk from me for the conference i will go through the interesting parts of the survey which is now running since 2020 and we will start just with a general overview what is technically behind the things that you kind of understand where data is coming from and i during the recording now i try to have a bit of an audience interaction so if you have any questions on the survey or like survey specific questions or want to see some specific question from the survey or some field some topic standards you know what there's 88 questions in total but i you know talk about that soon please tell so in the chat and with that hello to everyone who's listening live or in the conference and so let's go and let's see the tour quick word on myself of course i organized a conference and so i don't know if during this talk i can follow this along and so put your questions in the q&a tab and i will be canceling them there i try to be in the launch but we'll see you can take the survey on the website survey. meting cpp.com will let you take the survey and will basically you know go to that website in a second when we're done with introduction and basically you know people is what forms c++ and for a long time i have the feeling that we don't know enough about our community not enough details there is so much stuff which we didn't measure and there's still a lot of unknown unknowns and i wanted to have some data on that and the goals of this talk is to give you an overview on the statistics which we have now and there's a lot of other statistics i have in total it's 88 questions so one hour is not enough to like you know and will be boring to just go through all of them take the be logged in if you can it's around 80 questions or 88 questions as i said 50 minutes for this talk so we're going to see which subset we choose the audience has like a wish i it can make that wish true you know but quickly also a word on other service since sometime every year isoc cpp.org and jetbrains do their yearly service surveys and they're great please participate and then also shout out to btek who does on the end of the year or this end of the year's survey and i i do think that's great and i i wanted to kind of you know also do surveys or i've done surveys also in this time frame this is how the whole idea for a survey tool came along because i did surveys on twitter and linkedin and they're quite limited you have four options here you can ask like have you been on a user group meeting and you can ask have you turn to c++ conference and then this runs for a week or a day or whatever time you want it's like i think the limit is is a week and then you can combine it but it's always a single choice four answers and with twitter kind of being short it's kind of difficult to get the question right and to also you're very limited by the lengths you have for answers and so i was like yeah would be better to to have something where we actually have control over the data and can do more things with it and so the idea for the community sty came in 2020 the survey launched i implemented it more or less in december 2029 and it's a continuous survey so it's not like a yearly survey or doesn't really have an end i draw a yearly aggregate from it so that we know that this like these are all the answers from this year but basically there is not the goal that you answer all the questions for the survey now and then we release the results of the survey in like two or three weeks that's not what we do here questions are single and multiple choice multiple choice is the one thing that twitter linkin unfortunately still not support and on the right you see that yeah you can skip a question you can answer the question and then you see the result which is usually a b graph technical details so i decided to make the session based so you're you have a voting session and i determine if you're logged in and if you're just not logged in you're just voting that's that's two different sets i then saw that i can combine questions i can take the set of one question and look into the voting session and say the you know the the buckets of the first question get sorted into the buckets of the second question and then i can say like you know i have a question on continents and then i can say like who works for what on which continent something like that or which standard is used on this continents and stuff like that and then there's like other questions i have 88 questions and i can combine them with 8 with 87 other questions right so there's even more options to present on i could basically if i wanted to present every combination basically present the whole conference on it but not every combination makes sense the pl feature i had is like a time based reporting i have this and i used it once i think for cpon talk right now it's more like that i plan to have a better use for the aggregates because it's now four years was closing of 2023 that i kind of want to you know have a different view on those aggregates to see the trends better and generally the votes are saved as an aggregate and as the vote itself then you know gets a session and the date and so that way i know every vote but also there's an agregate and this kind of has an advantage and that's also kind of how the combining of question works technical details if you answer a question it's stopped for 30 days if you skip a question at stoed for 60 days and i'm kind of thinking about increasing those times reans answering a question in the same session which if that happens if you locked in usually does not add to the aggregate yeah finding the the questions for the service has been sometimes a bit difficult because you know you also need the correct set of answers which makes sense and it's kind of an odd form so but you know just let's dive into the actual website and look a bit on what we have available there that's also kind of where the audience now is important to you know know let me know your questions i'm generally going to take a look into hub below and going to take a look into linkedin to see how's the comments going and then i need to stop the screen share and i need to unfortunately this is like the limitation of the tool i use i have to find the window know now which is this one let's see yes hey that worked good so here we are with a community survey and if i tap over in the window you see we have a question which standards do you you currently use in your projects and basically that's yeah the mod standard right bit of 20 actually not i could skip the question but you know not present what what does it that's kind of boring and here we see now the survey results we see that right now c++ 17 is still in the overall result very popular and c++ 20 is gaining and this is like when we have the yearly aggregates it's probably like one of the trends we can see like how every year c++ 20 once it has been added to the survey you know i think it wasn't there from the beginning has gained popularity and similarly probably will see like how c plus 11 and 14 have trends in that time and below here we see the next question which we could answer that's when you do the survey of course but for let me see here we are what i wanted to to do now is now basically go through the results because you know i don't need to do the sur again the very first question i have here is the question on jason libraries i don't know why i put that in but i think it was like the first thing that came to my mind as a test question when i started the survey and t you see just you know it's not everyone uses json libraries and then json for modern c++ is the most popular one followed by rapid jason interesting like the the specialized libraries like ardino jason and s jason are not as popular you know s chason is really really fast and i would expect it to be more popular but it seems to be more interesting for other people to use the well established and well-known things in the community already boost jason is also something which hasn't been there from the beginning and finds heavy adoption a boost users which we're going to look a bit into because the next question if i go in the next result that's boost and you see like yeah this is like kind of where we can collect the the data and also we can for for some time this has been the only data on boost but i recently added questions on library usage of boost which just started gathering data and like comparing here this is the questional cute but as you can see i think that's over here i can go in the survey results which i am i'm looking for this one this is a listing which of course makes it way easier to find interesting questions for you and you see there's all the 88 questions scroll through down here are the newest question which are on boost library usage and this one is the oldest currently has 50 seven people answering this and there we see that yeah 10 people have answered for bo recx is the most popular with that but not even that gets 50% but this 57 answers is is not statistical relevant and those categories come from boost itself and this is like something i saw this summer because for a long time i thought that it's impossible to collect data on the boost live itself because there's over 100 boost liaries and was the categories i kind of at least you know can make a make sense for that and so we can get some data on boost otherwise i'd have to use the combined questions feature which i can show you here where you can say hey boost users yeah let's just go for jason liaries what jason libraries use boost users and here can say it's percent or just overall numbers and like let's go for the overall numbers and here we see just like the first question the boost question is now this is a set which is filtered for people in the same session answering the json library usage question okay and if you go down we see that people that never use boost it's even like one person which doesn't use boost but they use boost jason okay so but you see that there's like a strong correlation for boost jason with having heavier boost usage and also like rapid json is then also kind of popular along the way and the other popular libraries of course are al heavily used and i find it interesting that those who use often and daily boost also are very very often using json that the majority here which we also saw in the other question like never people that don't use boost and don't use are also not very you know often using jason and this is like the the leading group until often and daily so we can see quite often some interesting things if you look at this combination feature but it is of course also very hard to find the right combinations which are interesting there's a lot of questions which are not as interesting in the combination and generally if you have any questions or want me to show in a combination if you think about something i'm happy to and yeah so i'm going to go now a little bit into the questions here with you and there is some questions about the standard let's just start with the standard i think we already saw here like the this is the the question on what standards do people actually use in their projects and this is a similar question but like which c++ standards do you have experience in so we see c++ 11 is still very popular and then 14 and 17 and the other way around 17 is and i have a single choice question this one so if people have to choose the standard and this case it's the most used at work in the moment we see that c++ 17 in the overall survey since 2020 is the most us standard and there's even like a good amount of people already having you know more than 10% having c+ plus 20 as their main workhorse versus as their main standard they're using so it's not just a few people which use c++ 20 and i expect this this number of course will grow over time right everybody expects that and i'm looking forward to to see this in the data in the future i could go now into build systems and frameworks and so i have like a question on sanitizers because i found like yeah it's hard to to have data on that and so let's ask that question i found an interesting and easy question because we only have a limited set of sanitizers and at least for the overall service data it is still the case that most people don't use sanitizers which is kind of scary but also kind of probably due to the setup they have most used sanitizer address followed by leak and no memory then le ubn okay not not everybody has a useful threat sanitizer i understand that but that's an interesting question if you go into compilers we also see the normal compilers let's like gcc is the most popular one clang v++ and you know visual studio visual c++ and sometimes i ask questions twice because i for example for build systems let me look for the here is it the other question on this all right so take a guess with the which which is orange graph right what what is it this is the multiple choice question here so people choose cake because they use it order tools is in this question more popular than basil make second place but go make and make are probably going to you know cannibalize on each other i recently added gn for the reason that someone told me that this is a build system and that might be news to you it was news to me it's a build system from google which might become more popular but basil is also heavily google associated build system which still you know is popular in some areas i saw recently cine adding a support for it but it's like when we ask like what people actually think is their favorite sim make everyone hates sim make but when i when i ask what's your favorite they show see make that's interesting right but at least basil is now more popular than auto tools that's something and then yeah there's people which likees n c ms build is not a big surprise but yeah cake has become the standard build system i see someone mentioning cake and package managers i have a indeed a question on this so let's go for the package managers it's up here direct at the beginning this is also an easy question which i had in mind when i started the survey yeah people using the package manager is still a trend which is coming you know and it's a thing of the future in the current survey result coran is really popular and v package of course these are the big two i added in this year because jason turner is actually also now had integrated it in his cmake template and so i was like well this is serious enough and good to use for cakes that i use i should add the cpm package manager i've added a few other ones like build 2 spec bakaro from facebook hunter i think hunter is even discontinued but i can't remove options from i can add but i cannot remove this is kind of a thing which i have to see if i write toage to remove something but it's right now not possible that's like one of the disadvantages of the survey but no big surprises here but let's go for idees and there we have the other question also two questions like of course i need to know what id you're using and here we see visual studio and visual studio code are here since 2020 there's a lot of a trend for for visual studio code which i hope to be able to show you next year when i basically have the yearly aggregates and we can see like the the rise of visual studio code c lion and crater are not as popular as whm in this question and most popular is visual studio which is not very surprising i guess and here we see the same question in the same order but as single choice not multiple choice and here we see now c li is better than cute creator and this question but still visual code ise in second place of everyone else except visual studio and interestingly vm has its fan club of course that's and emex is there but when when you only can choose one what is your favorite not everyone that uses vm thinks it's a favorite let me close some of those and maybe we can get another inspiration from chat and so there's actually some other questions which i want to go into and that is the questions which you know most of those questions some of those questions i so far covered are also covered in the other service but one of the goals with this survey is to be able to ask like all the questions and it came to my i think it started with a container question let's go for the container question i was like wait a minute we we have no idea what people do with the containers right and how often and we still don't know what they do with it but now we know like which which containers are used and it's not a big surprise that vector is being used the most followed by map and array but now we have data on it before that we didn't have data like for example like this is like list more popular than deck yes seems so with c++ 11 forward list came and it's kind of yeah if you have the use case it's a good thing to have but the rest is not that important and this question is also like a great example that sometimes you need to put something in a question where some people may think it's a container and other people will say and tell you well why it's in the question because i i' like to also have data on span and of course there's like you know priority key and stti is a thing but span indeed is it's not a container but i thought it's in this context interesting to also collect data on span to see if span is used and we see that span has usage and maybe over time we will see that the is used more see there's a comment in the chat i see there's a q&a question well these questions are not about the survey so this is a recording all right so i'll continue with a with with a survey so please please ask questions about the survey and not like like yeah if you have ideas about questions you want to ask just you know send me an email i'm always looking for new questions to add to the survey of course or if if somewhere is something missing then i can add it and so once i had the container question i was interested to see how is it was a standard features something else that we didn't have any data on and so for c++ [music] 11 we now see that unique pointer andfor shed pointer are the top two features i understand unique pointer why shared pointer and that threat is not as popular as share pointer is interesting to say the least and of course there's some not so well known things or maybe not so well usable things like asn rec x reference rapper is not everybody's things random has a user interface which you have to google every time you use it future is my opinion debatable in c++ 11 and the whole things if people you know want to use future from the standard or do they this i etc user library and if you go into the library features no these were library features now we on the language features we see that auto is the most but it's like small lead followed by lambdas followed by n pointer a line as and other like long long end new string lit of course those features are not as popular that's not surprising right try to to get excited for us it to find lals if you don't have a use for it but then there's you know this this way we we know that like you know what is the popular features of of a standard with c++ 14 that's a bit more difficult because no such things as big features were in the library actually was the language is a bit different but was the library there's shar time mutex standard user defined lits which are in this case very popular two addressing vi type and other and het look up in hativ containers if we go into c++ 17 but first i should go in the language features right right here the feature of you know what came with 14 is also kind of kind of interesting generic lambas is such a thing which everybody is used to know but it's it's actually nice to see that this is the feature which takes the first place here and then there's things like variable templates function return type reduction member in your civilization which i think a lot of people now take for granted and might not even there's like one feedback i have gotten is like some people don't know especially like if you if you start with c++ 17 they have no idea what feature came with a with an earlier standard so this bit of history if if if you happen to you know know all of those that's a small group in our community now we go to 17 and this is the library features again start with the library features optional is most popular file system is fourth third is variant and string view is second place and then there is of course everything else which came with 17 if i have a question on signed unsigned no i think at the moment i don't have that and i i'm not sure if that would make sense of course you could ask like what people use that might be an interesting one to add indeed i don't have a question on that would be interesting if i one i could show you that we but at the moment of the opinion that i don't but let's look for no no but hey sign brings us to design patterns let's look at the design patterns i've mentioned that i added the last questions about boost but last year here like one year ago i added in october september questions about design patterns because jason turner wondered in twitter what data do we have on design patterns and i was like why i didn't ask this question prior but now we have like after one year this is now is 500 answers getting into the range of being significant in statistical meanings and this exists again in the favorite and the so single choice multiple choice so that you kind of you can can see a difference here and here we see like factory and singleton i think in are both the top two and then strategy when when you have to choose one is popular and ob server is popular a visitors is popular and if you go into the classic design patterns and the multiple choice which in my opinion is really the interesting question here right what what do people use we see that observer now is higher than strategy strategy actually is not as often used in in this visitors still of course yes this this variant visitor will probably become more popular even factory and singon again on the top two singon is a bit sad it's nobody nobody wants to have that truth but that's yes and momento is the least popular one and of course a question to the audience what is a mento pattern do you know maybe it's also the less known one so this is kind of you know what do we question here like does everyone know everyone every single design pattern in here if i do an interview with you can you implement them all i think that you know maybe cla eagleburger which also kind of you know this with this book popularized patterns again in our community might be able to implement them all but if you don't that's that's okay in summer i added another question we will now see that we are bordering on significance a little bit but not yet this will become interesting over time the other source for c++ statistics i have since two years is a meeting c++ online job fair and there is a job submission form where you can share your cv and or resume and this form has two fields where i ask the skills you have in this case and this is a standards it's some frameworks it's unit testing it's operating systems so this is like and package managers this is like and there's build systems in here it's like everything right this is like the complete thing which might be important or well known or should give you like a profile for the recruiter and i can then pull the aggregate and do the graph but it occurred to me that it would be interesting to add the question even if it's like a lot of answer options to the survey in order to compare the job-seeking population to the overall community population you know statistically speaking the other question i have is on industry fields fields of work but first like st with skills c++ 11 is always the most popular one or has been has actually changed in the recent times but this is now a bit different with with the overall there there is some differences but i want to wait until there is like significant statistic statistical answers in here and then i probably you know will compare this in a talk probably in the first quarter next year and which industry fields have you worked as c++ st in is also an interesting question and similar or equal to the job seekers it's desktop and embedded this is a multiple choice question also of course it's the two two top ones and then it's a wide field in this case automotive gaming industry video processing science server telecommunication and people working or coming or being on university being in science ai not being as popular as interesting hpc not being as popular finance not being as popular that's all things where i wonder how this shapes when you know we continue into having maybe a thousand vots in this and there's so more so many more questions i can you know show you here i have one question i should probably now show you is the continent question because there there's like i should tell you about the bias the survey has a huge bias towards europe 2third of the survey are from europe and then it's kind of you know asia north america and the rest of the world this is improving slowly over time but it's also kind of showing that yeah most of the traffic from ser from social media and this is clustering algorithms and so mostly i reach europe because i'm you know my ip is from europe and so i mostly get to cluster around people seeing my questions and generally being on meeting c++ from europe which yeah i i would like to really change that but that's like one of the biases which i have which i found i knew about this bias but i didn't thought that strong and when we go into the work related questions i have a question on how much people earn that's always interesting right so the median and that's mostly influenced by europe is 55k and if i go and use a combination feature on this one we use the continent and then here i should fairly easy be able to yeah okay so now we see like this is kind of this is interesting stuff now we see like how people actually earn on the continents not surprising that people in africa don't earn that much and we don't have a lot of data on africa so i cannot say anything about africa actually we have data on asia europe and north america it's like the the differences so of course people in asia don't earn that much and we have the most data on europe so you kind of see the the median also here is 5k one thing that keeps true is that like you know in europe it's like people up 250k okay but in north america that's basically you know where people start and there's some some other people which make less but it's like the the big majority of people here is really in the 100k to over 200 okay might be a heavy bias towards silicon valley where you need to pay those salaries to live so you you make the money and you directly spend it on your living you know on your apartment which costs nice dollars every time and so it's bit hard to correlate those but it's just you know interesting data which we can see through this combination feature in the survey and yeah programming languages is actually something we could take a look on that's that's a good idea because i i do have a question on programming languages and this is this doesn't include c++ okay because everyone doing the survey should know c++ so which other programming languages do you know well and e kind of know you use it in work in the work context and then we see that it's like really of course c and python is the big ones and then followed by java bash some people do assembly c javascript rust do something which gains popularity and would be interesting to generally over time see how you know this changes and see how because this is now an aggregate since 2020 and the yearly aggregates doing something useful with source aggregates actually becomes more interesting this every year and that's why i actually want to tackle that next year [music] i have a a sampler question which i can show you with been sampler so i i want to like you know yes c++ performance assembler that's close but do people actually use it and we know got bol has popularized people being able to understand the sampler and people not having a use for it and got bol is a majority then rarely and yeah often and daily are you know this is my categories for this kind kind of question so people use it but if if if you don't use it in your job and it's not a work requirement for you it might become one in in in the future but that's an exception wait you set exception yeah error handling is another popular one right so yes people do use exceptions they use bool and error codes and f objects and otherwise i think this is a difficult question to ask i think also have like a question on rtte that's not that interesting i think question on cute versions like we can really go do in you know statistical things i was interested in like how many people do folks actually work with and this is not the question this is the question how many companies employers do people have had in their career and here we see it of course you know people starting or having just found the right employer at some time as a majority and then it drives again with eight or more and there's some amount of people which are looking for a job and are like students you know and let's look at the h group question oh this is the age group for the survey the median is in the 30s and then 40s are strong i think to be expected but you also see that there is some people in the in the 20s and even below so overall healthy i think anyways i think there is still some slides i want to go through and let me look in the chat if any i see lots of comments on the programming language questions and let's go into the survey there's still like some things which i have in this in the slides and i think i'm going to continue with the slides because we've been through the interesting questions now oh oh there's like of course there's more interesting questions here so let's bring up the slides again there yep all right let's go so back to the slides plans i've mentioned some of that but one thing i haven't mentioned and i think i have never shown is this slide it's votes per sessions and most sessions only vote once well there's a lot of question question sessions which only v months so i you know and it's even true like if i check on the votes which are from a loin account which is a separate data set and at some point you know we have now 491 people with a lo in having voted so we're kind of you know coming close to having interesting results here don't need like 500 people in this case but it's would be nice to to have more people with a log in which is like really like unique and better data than not but the other plan for next year is to basically to purge the sessions which only voted like one twice three four maybe five times you know this will remove some of the overhead from the survey and reset kind of the overall survey state but the aggregate still has like the data which what they voted for right and i think that will improve a bit of the the data which we have in the survey for the overall question the yearly agregates are becoming more and more important and are the interesting data points for the future i think because we have now four aggregates when 2023 closes and then that is basically where first trends should show and where we can go from a bar graph into a line graph and have various options to you know what what you want to f how how you want to filter the data and this will be a more complicated inter interface yeah that's is a slide and generally if you have questions i try to be on the lounge but you know this is a pre recording so if you want to put your questions in the q&a tab i will be able to later answer those questions but i saw that we had question in the q&a tab during the recording session so i will go into the this tab and see yes there are some questions so let's sort them by most voted so first question what are the the challenges and learnings out of building and running this survey project [music] it's actually a good question i think one of the biggest takeaways for me is the actual data which we now have which we lacked and that you know it's like also kind of the takeaway from me is like that we have to my data is biased and always will be biased and it's kind of how the survey works deet brains does a lot of work on not having as much biased data and they have very nice numbers but they are bound by their commercial and way of doing the survey and that there a onetime survey and you only can have i don't know 20 questions okay maybe 30 questions but i can have 88 i can ask you every single boost library and if you answer or not it doesn't matter it's more a shotgun approach and so is something they are difference they are sep difference and there's differences in statistics which i think is interesting to learn from me and i hope with a yearly statistics we actually see the trends which was also one of the motivating questions behind that because like it's the one thing to see like what do people use in this here but it's the other thing to actually see like c++ 20 is actually rising and this is the standard adoption we had for 17 and we la the data for most of the last decade and for this decade we will have the data and then we'll see adding questions to the c++ survey there is the best way probably just to contact me if you have my email or you know mention me on social media send me a message on linkedin and you know tell me what what your idea about a question is and ideally you have a question and the answers um question on continuous survey how would you understand repeated votes over a period of time using boost sometime can change to often overtime right yes but if you vote in the same voting session that will be substrated okay so this is accounted for but if you're not in the same voting question if you're not logged in it easily happens that you're not in the same voting this is kind of the the downside and that's why i say that i want to purge the sessions which only answered a few questions and we probably have a lot better data on that and otherwise when when we have more than a thousand answers in a question there's a lot of questions which have only be answered once by that person so we get the we still get we still get to the statistically significance i think to the answer we want if that answer is 100% correct no it's not it's more it's a bit fuzzy but if you if you think about it yes that's that's how the survey works and it gives us an answer to a lot of questions we would not have an answer to and it's not interesting if 10.1 or 10.2% use list for example okay at least from my point of view yeah so we had the question on sign un no i' i'd be interested to to see what questions we can get out of this unsigned and signed and maybe generally in this this field yeah it would be interesting question on c++ 14 yeah so not as as i mentioned not everybody knows what came with with standard constant expression was introduced with c++ 11 but it was very restricted you could do not a lot it was basically basic operations but i think like even like in a function you could only return once and and things like that and this was relaxed that's why it's called relaxed with 14 and it has been further relaxed and improved and things added to it with every standard and every standard has some some sing this constant expression in it and in 14 the one of the names for that is relaxed constant expression restriction oh yeah on a question on i have i do have question on user group and conferences a lot let's quickly go into the slides from the slides again back to i can show you that let's let's finish the talk with with going into those questions i need to go in the studio sles be gone and we're back here yes this is a user group question it's yeah people attend but it's not as popular as you think there's like you know the the famous dark meta developers which also don't answer this question but then yeah it's i have data on that i've showed it in the beginning so yeah the of course the survey has questions on that and c++ conferences and this is like a perspective from 2020 today i probably also would like to to add like online and on site or to split this somehow but this is basically still an interesting question to you know how people attended i have a question about learning we also user groups is here mentioned i think yeah so you see this is multiple choice so people learn through books blogs conferences a bit but yeah it's you know conferences it's not every every employer sends their people to conference and not every student applies for student tickets and so that's okay online communities is also like almost like conferences videos is and more popular which you know those videos often are available through the conferences online tutorials paid online courses not as possible interestingly and yeah quote examples which just is yeah and and i do actually have like this is like one thing future plans two questions on conferences because i was curious like and i i us this as interesting data to know like who has been at meeting c++ and i have been more than five times there's like a certain amount of people which has not been yet but wants to be in the future probably and then there's the folks which unfortunately you know don't have the option to come or don't want to for some reason and i have the i have this for accu i have for cp here cp con accu and if we quickly look at those it's more or less the same deal right cpp con is a bit more popular so more people want to go there yeah this doesn't mean that you know people don't want to go to asu it's just a different set of people answering my questions asu actually has their call for talks out so if you want to give a talk you just submit and i kind of want to retire some of those questions that's the other thing i want to do next year to retire some of the question we have now 88 questions and i can think we have some questions which will not change anymore like rcpp do you read readit that was an interesting question in 2020 but it's basically answered now some questions are answered and i kind of at least for the time retire and i think this brings me to the end yes this is the end slightly over time now i see but that's fine as i said if i'm able to come to the lounge i'll quickly be there but it's probably better if you're the conference if you actually have questions put them in a q&a tab and i'll be able to answer them in text there which i have time after the conference okay thank you for listening and the next talk in the online track will be me again with csv file imports see you there
