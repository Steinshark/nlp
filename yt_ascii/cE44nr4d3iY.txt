puzzle from one of the greatest puzzlers of the last two centuries perhaps, just putting it out there; this guy called sam loyd. you can look him up. this is one of his most famous puzzles and he patented it and sold millions of, sort of, physical copies. so i've made myself a physical copy; it's quite hard to get the originals and if you do get an original, worth a lot of money. the puzzle's called 'get off the earth'. the the centre bit moves, and i just made it with a paper clip and printed this out. but the racial stereotyping i want to move away from. so there are some equivalent puzzles which i'm going to show you, i made the digital copy. and i found one that sam loyd also made to do with a bunch of bicyclists, 
they're boys with flags around a bicycle and it moves in a similar way. i invite you to count the number of cyclists around this wheel.
- (brady: 1, ) (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ) (10, 11, 12, 13.) not rocket science? on card i'd just be spinning the inner wheel; and the same question now brady, count them. 
where do you want to start? (the b. 1, 2, 3, 4,) (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,) (12!) i can see his face. the text underneath says 'turn the disc so the arrow points to a and count 13 boys, then move the arrow to b and there are only 12 boys'. so they agree with what you've just said and the question is, which boy has vanished and where did he go? let's just check. (count heads.)
- okay we'll count heads: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. definitely 13 heads. shift it around; heads yeah? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 heads. so you wanna count legs? 
- (i don't ) (it's- the situation's gonna change. i) (still think it's something to do with) (the way the boys are drawn but-)
- something to do with the way the boys are drawn? do you want to say more about your instincts here? you've got good instincts today brady, your instincts are are important. so what is it about the way they're drawn that you think you're suspicious about?
- (i just think- i just) (think something that was a head turned) (into not a head.) (like a shoe or something.)
- really? yeah.. i mean let's find a candidate right? so this head get- gets cut in half but then there's a bit of a head here that it kind of joins with, right? it joins up there. and it got- replaced the other half of the head here and this one gets lost a bit, but they're still there. some funky things- you know, this leg here i think is a left leg, and when i slide it's now a right leg. that's interesting, i don't know if that messes up your count but it shouldn't change how many heads there are in my opinion.
- (the key is) (there where the two are together.)
- what, here? (that's gotta be key.) well, but there's still two heads right? and they're just separated, there they are they're still there, there's nothing tricky going on. (but it's- that's- i think that's the key.) this is one of those puzzles that's frustrating, and it caused a stir back in the day because it feels so simple, there's nothing tricky going; it's a piece of paper, you can actually touch it, you can move it around, there's nothing to conceal really. but something surprising is going on, you start to doubt your counting ability, you start counting from different places; you count the heads, maybe you count the flags. and it's one of those puzzles that feels insulting to your intelligence and that's why it splits people into like really annoying, something tricky is going on, and fundamentally doubting the very core of your being - like i can't count to 12?? nothing should change when you spin that so it- there's something subtle going on and i thought i'd explain it. there's some other variations of this puzzle, i thought i'd show you. so martin gardner wrote about this one and i found one that he made. this time it's not in a circle, let's do some counting together brady. how many faces? 
- (six.) i agree. how many faces?
- (five...) so which face disappeared? (i mean there are still six hats.)
- and i can shift back. (ahh but there's only five chins.)
- well the chin's just a horizontal one there. the first thing to comment is that, like a magic trick - this is done less as a magic trick more of
just like, what's going on? but that's what magic really is. the question of how many faces is a valid question, but it has two different answers in the two configurations in the spinny version or this version. the second question which is, where did the bicyclist go? which one disappeared? or which face disappeared or which face appeared, that's the misdirection. i think that question is invalid and that's why you should ask it to sort of apply misdirection. because if you ask someone to describe what happens to the faces you get a different bit of attention. tell me about these faces, maybe compared to those faces; maybe tell me about the height of them.
- (they're) (different heights.)
- they're different heights, yeah. in fact they're different faces, none of the original faces are still there. there's six faces, none of those faces exist anymore, there are five new faces. so that's why that question is misleading i think. 
which face disappeared? all of them. and we made five new faces which are fundamentally different, in fact they're a bit longer. do you begin to see what's going on? when you simplify it this much it begins to get insulting. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 - agreed? (yeah all right.)
- so in the other puzzles i shifted something, i'm just gonna shift something on this diagram. now i know you saw what happened, but how many lines are there? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and there were 11 just now. i'm going to go back again, 11 lines, which line appeared, 
disappeared, is a nonsense question agreed?
- (i don't) (really know, i'm kind of baffled.)
- this is so simple that it's baffling. there are definitely 11 lines here. and what i've actually done is i sliced them along that line and i just shifted everything along the line, slid it there. and now there are only 10 lines but they're all a bit longer. so which line disappeared? none of them. that's the effect we're happening, when you say which line disappeared, well 
it's a nonsense question. actually i've just made 10 new lines from bits of the old ones that are a bit longer. so imagine that situation, put the lines at different heights and slice horizontally - so here's just another version of the same thing. you count the lines but then you shift them; different number of lines. some of them are different lengths. i've done this randomly and now it's really obvious that some of them have fundamentally changed, it's just a different set of lines with a different number going on. and that wouldn't be impressive to anybody. what you could do though, let's work this around a circle, like the first two things we saw were done on a circle. so it's basically taking that line that i've sliced some lines and wrapping it around. you can see that i get a rotational thing here. so let's just count the lines here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and they're all a certain length. 
if i then switch it round we have a little bit of a conflict. you can see there are two lines next to each other, they could be counted as one line but if they were more identifiable you could see that they're they're two different lines. there's two lines of roughly that length: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. if you start getting clever wrapping this cut around a circle, and realising all that's happening is you're making new lines appear which are slightly longer; and if they're not a lot longer they look very like the old lines, you get a little glimpse of what an artistic version of this could look like. so we'll go back to the face. 
imagine these are lines, there are six lines. and if i shift them over, now there are only five of them but they're all a bit longer. and so if you design the faces cleverly, this guy is- his eyes are there, they look a bit like eyebrows, but they actually become eyebrows on this guy's face. so there's some artistic cleverness to make the identifiers a little bit subtle. and now there are five faces where there previously were six but they're different faces, they're all a bit longer, it's exactly equivalent to the lines. if we go back to our bicyclists we've gone back to the circle idea. we've drawn 13 boys, and you can see they're getting they're getting further and further in on the circle, a bit like our lines got shifted. and when you shift it we're just splicing together bits of boys; all the boys disappeared and 12 new boys appeared which are all a bit longer. but they're designed artistically enough so it's really hard to tell. on a bit of paper everything's slightly imprecise and artistically we forgive any sort of slight misalignments, and there are quite a few. 
- (so tell me with the boys,) (where did the 12 to 13 heads change?) (because heads aren't lines.)
- heads aren't lines, but there are definitely 13 heads. except some of them are very clear heads and obviously they're not changing, this one up here is not changing and the ones inside are not changing; but the crucial thing is around these edges where the head is intersected by the line. that's where we splice together bits of two other heads and the new head we get is slightly longer, or slightly shorter, or just slightly smaller. and if you- like you can see that this this guy's head here is quite fat, and when i shift it it's even fatter, like a super fat head. and that's happening in a subtle way all around the body parts, the legs,
the heads - this is a really lovely mixture of a really simple piece of maths, like you can splice lines and they look similar but a bit longer, done artistically into a way that completely bamboozles clever people who have their wits about them. they know how to count 13, and 12, and yet that little shift changes the fundamental reality of the number here? it's it's a nice example of a puzzle that's been around a long time but even when you understand it there's still something slightly bamboozling about it. a great thing about the puzzle in today's video was how it was interactive; you could slide it back and forward, look closely, like on your own terms. and that's also a great thing about the courses on brilliant, today's episode sponsor. these are from brilliant's pre-algebra course; as you can see pretty interactive, but as you can also see here there's plenty more where that came from. if you want to get smarter, to give your brain a workout that's both fun and educational, you can't go past brilliant and its huge range of courses, puzzles, daily challenges. a brilliant premium subscription, which unlocks all this great stuff, is also a great gift for youngsters and lifelong learners. go to brilliant.org/unmade, it's there on the screen for 20% off that subscription. you won't regret it. our thanks to brilliant. special thanks to these people for supporting us on patreon. you can join them, go to patreon.com/numberphile. but not just them, thanks to everyone who's taken the time to watch this numberphile video.
