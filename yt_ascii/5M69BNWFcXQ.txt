when we realize in christianity would we have is instead of seeing multiplicity as maya or ultimately as illusion we rather see how its connection to the center and to the divine is what fills it with reality but that that feeling of reality is is real it's not an illusion it's not a it's not something that's evanescent and which will disappear when we go up into heaven but rather it is a kind of solidifying of the of the world in a good way making it glorious and that's what the heavenly jerusalem ultimately represents is the idea that no all these things can participate if they're properly aligned can participate in the glory of god and will be will be full of glory and not not in the way that it will dematerialize them but rather in the manner in which it makes them more real and you see that i think c.s lewis had great insight about about that as well he talks about you know the idea of the the the blades of grass in paradise being too sharp for us something like that like they're actually too real for us and you see in the church fathers they say in the eskatan saint paul will be more saint paul and saint peter will be more saint peter as they enter into more and more of their theosis and becoming god more and more they'd also become more of themselves this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world and then slowly as i became orthodox i kind of moved away from you know obviously and then with more maturity seeing some of the limits of his thought and some of his positions let's say and so it's wonderful to rediscover you at this moment well likewise i am very interested in the subject of sacred art and in fact i hope we'll have a chance to talk a little bit about it today because i think it's very very important and it's an area where i come from the catholic world where the catholic world can learn important lessons from the orthodox i think the orthodox have been far more successful in preserving sacred art than we in the west so i'm very eager to hear what you can tell us about that wonderful so before we get started i wanted to do a fairly extensive introduction this time around for people who might be joining us who aren't familiar with with all of these gentlemen and it's going to take a few minutes so if you want to skip this part you'll be able to go to the time stamp and and go right into the discussion so as you can see i have a distinguished panel here today to talk about how to bring meaning back into our broken world and for those who are new to these thinkers i have a fairly as i said comprehensive introduction so dr wolfgang smith graduated in 1948 at the age of' from cornell university with three degrees in philosophy physics and mathematics that always amazes me and two years later he obtained his masters in physics from purdue followed by a phd in mathematics from colombia he he worked as a physicist at the bell aircraft corporation researching aerodynamics and the problem of atmospheric re-entry and was a mathematics professor at mit ucla and oregon state university doing research in the field of differential geometry and he was widely published in academic journals retiring from academic life in 1992. dr smith is a member of the traditionalist school of metaphysics exploring the philosophical underpinnings of the scientific method and emphasizing the idea of bringing science back into the aristotelian framework of traditional ontological realism and away from the bifurcationism and physical reductionism of scientism and is a proponent of a new interpretation of quantum mechanics called vertical causation in addition he's the author of many wonderful books including cosmos and transcendence the vertical ascent ancient wisdom and modern misconceptions along with many others and his newest book soon to be published is physics a science inquest of an ontology jonathan pegeot graduated with distinction from the painting and drawing program at concordia university in montreal during the late 1990s but quickly disillusioned with contemporary art he discovered icons and traditional christian images along his own spiritual journey he then studied orthodox theology and iconology at the university of sherbrooke his carvings have been commissioned by churches bishops priests and lay people in the united states canada europe and asia jonathan is also a writer and public speaker giving workshops and conferences all around north america as well as teaching icon carving with hexameron is that the right person hexameron through his youtube channel and podcast the symbolic world he also furthers the conversation on symbolism meaning and patterns dr richard smith did his undergraduate work at the university of california in berkeley his phd in system science and his dissertation on generalized information theory in addition he has studied complexity science neural networks genetic algorithms dynamical systems and systems thinking in addition to being an entrepreneur helping people be better investors he is also president of the philosophia institute foundation which represents the work of dr wolfgang smith so gentlemen i welcome you i'm eager to get started on this conversation since you gentlemen are meeting each other for the first time i thought it might be helpful to start with dr wolfgang smith talking a bit about the icon that represents your concept of the tripartite cosmos and then we can follow that by jonathan talking a bit about an icon or icons that are important to him so then i thought we could use this discussion of icons to get into a wider discussion of symbolism and modernity does that sound okay yeah very good let's get to it so dr smith you want me to share the icon yes karen yes for sure so let me try to explain the idea of the icon i should say that i'm basically a platonist and so this icon could be regarded as a platonist icon the ontological ideas is platonism as well as i think the major metaphysical traditions of antiquity have conceived of this integral cosmos is tripartite this i believe is a very important idea which has been largely lost even in in academic circles and and needs to be revived so what are then these three basic components or levels of the cosmos well starting at the lowest what i call the corporeal world this is the world as we normally experience it in our waking state so it is a world subject to two conditions two bounds namely space and time so we the corporeal world is a spatial temporal world now on the other end of the spectrum namely the avital you have a realm i call it the ev eternal which is subject nicer to space throughout the time so this is a a a state implicit in platonist philosophy and i think actually implicit in all the great philosophies of the world in one way or another and between these two extremes you have something called the intermediary world which is subject to time but not to space now let me say that in certain parts of the world these ideas have still been current in my day but in the west in the western world this is long forgotten but i have focused upon this trichotomy and i have found that it is remarkably fruitful as a metaphysical principle it sheds light on many things that otherwise we would not be able to grasp and let me point out immediately that the striped peptide division of the macrocosm is reflected in man himself in the anthropos because the anthropos is likewise tripartite in traditional terms this is a trip edition into corpus animal spiritus body soul and spirit intellect so that this icon applies to the microcosm as well as to the market causing we are tripartite beings in a tripartite universe and so i've tried to revive this tripartite understanding of both men and cosmos and apply it to various questions of interest beginning with the philosophy of physics the philosophy of physics is greatly a deeply impacted by this idea of the tripartite cosmos to give just one example in a sense the most striking of all it can be rigorously affirmed that the mere existence of the intermediary domain in other words the existence of a domain subject to time but not to space has profound implications for physics and in fact it enables one on a rigorous ontological basis to prove the impossibility of einsteinian physics and it's very easy to see actually because if you have an intermediary domain you evidently have a globally defined concept of simultaneity and as every physicist will understand if in relativity theory you do not have a globally defined concept of simultaneity so very clearly the tripartite cosmos invalidates einstein in physics so i mentioned this as an example that ontology does have something to say even on a scientific basis so these are the ideas i've been developing and they have implications as you might expect not only to physics but to many domains of primary interest so that's a surprise for as an introduction thank you dr smith so jonathan do you would you like to share a screen and show something well i might have a question just about the icon so in the image that was shown the so the center would be the spirit would be the the spiritual the line would be the intermediary and the periphery would be the corporeal is that is that the right understanding exactly jonathan that's exactly right okay and so do you project this this this can you project this icon into three three-dimensional space in the sense of a mountain let's say or a pyramid with the point at the summit representing the a connection of some kind to see it like this if you flipped it have you thought about about it that way in any manner i think it would weaken the iconographic effect all right so okay so do you wanna so i might i might want to bring up one other thing that dr smith didn't mention here if i'm not presuming too much wolfgang in in your book physics and vertical causation you talk about the the straight edge and the compass and how the point is that the the construction enters the picture and bestows a dynamic aspect in addition to its static form the circle of us becomes something more than a closed circular arc it comes to be perceived as a circular art swept out by a compass which as you mentioned later on in the book it it performs the unlikely feat of bringing time into the picture because as the as the compass sweeps out the ark it's actually bringing time into the picture do you would you like to comment on that wolfgang well let me just say that i was thinking especially of the platonist school the platonists seemed to have been very very fascinated with geometry which they regarded as actually a tool in this in the comprehension of metaphysics and they thought of geometry as concerned with geometric construction in other words they were not interested in regarding a geometric figure or diagram simply as as that they regarded it as something to be constructed with the two geomatic instruments the straight edge and the compass and i don't want to say too much about that because it actually leads into very difficult questions it's not an easy subject but i sense that this meditations if you will there's platonous meditations on geometry as they understood it were deeply meaningful in a metaphysical sense and in particular the understanding of time was related to the figure of the compass for example when plato says time is the moving image of eternity i think to to make this somehow graspable ness here is sinking of actually a compass sweeping out the circle so and incidentally in in this regard let me say that the traditional platonist view of time is circular so let this be all for a first introduction to these platonix ideas and they are difficult but in my opinion tremendously meaningful for an understanding of metaphysics and and i might add my experience of this icon right is a before really understanding this icon i was stuck in the outer shell of this reality right and so all my work in academia in science and artificial intelligence and technology etc was an attempt to try to understand the whole of reality by only being able to examine the outer edge of reality right and and actually science isn't even dealing with the outer edge of this icon here it's dealing with kind of the quantitative attributes of the outer edge of this icon and so to have that aha right to learn about wolfgang's work and then realize kind of how we got to this point of only considering the quantitative attributes of this outer edge of this icon as being kind of the parts from which we are to then recreate the whole that was a very big reveal to me right and so then once you kind of acknowledge that if you do agree with that and you say whoa that sounds right you know then you do have to say well what is the real structure of the whole and so this icon comes out of traditional wisdom traditions throughout you know mankind and and speaks of the these three parts right the kind of outer edge the the avaternal or the the spiritus and then kind of this middle world of soul i think and psyche and it's just a wonderful way to begin to you know reapproach our understanding and try to make sense of things jonathan no i i think i i think i i understand the the the icon i think the reason why i was pointing to the the possibility of flipping it is mostly if we want i think that if we want to use your image as a key let's say to sometimes to understanding sacred art there are some moments where we would need to do that can you know you know in the symbolism of the cross he traces this he kind of does that where he he creates the notion that the center of the circle can also be seen as an axis and that the periphery of the circle can be seen as a coil and that would account for the relationship between the different microcosms and microcosms and how they kind of embed each other embed themselves into each other and so if i don't know if maybe this could be an interesting possibility of showing maybe some traditional or some images the from the christian tradition and try to see how they can connect to this image would that make sense well one example actually of of a three-dimensional version of this would be a church itself and so the orthodox church would have a dome with christ at the at the top of the dome and then the circle moving down into a square and so you would have the the dome coming down being held by four pendatives and on those four pendantives would be let's say the corners which would which would be an extreme actually version of that circle or even a more embodied version of that circle down in the let's say the four manifestations of the one and you'll see that represented as the four evangelists or as the four beasts in ezekiel and so if you if you project that image into space there are ways to to account for other traditional forms like architecture like some of the icons that exist in in the in the church and also let's say the iconographic programs that are in the church will have that form so a good example another example would be the dome itself in in traditional byzantine churches the dome represents the ascension itself and so the earliest domes would have christ up at the access point in the middle of the dome and then around the periphery of the dome you would have the mother of god mary which would be directly under him and then you would have the 12 disciples which would be circling the dome and so you have that that relationship between the principle and its manifestation right from from christ as the divine man into the twelve that are has a cosmic aspect but also has a has the notion of the body of the church itself and so you can kind of see that manifested that way so that's one of the reasons why i wanted to to to to see if you had thought about how you can project it that way because i think that i think that the icon or the image of the center and the periphery is obviously the most basic image to understand reality and now you i use it in different guises all the time so so i i don't know much about science and so it's hard for me to to know like let's say why it invalidates einsteinian physics but i definitely see how that structure is you can re you can you can use the center and periphery as it as a structure to explain everything you can basically explain the entire cosmos with that with that basic structure i i guess i've been accustomed to differentiate iconography from sacred art and sacred architecture at large i i i certainly agree completely with what you say about sacred architecture but i always regarded iconography as is as a little part of that i i always regarded icons as two-dimensional am i am i wrong there you know more about this than i do well i think i think so i think it depends on if you understand that icons were are not divorced from the sacred space that is icons were developed as iconographic programs the idea of the panel icon there's nothing wrong with the panel icon but in the byzantine in the midi in the romanesque period or in the byzantine period the icon would have been first and foremost and experience as spatial relationships in the church and so certain images would appear in certain places within the church or the eastern apps would have an image for example in the byzantine tradition for example the eastern apps would have an image of the mother of god with christ pre-incarnate christ in her center and then on the western side of the church you would have for example the falling asleep of the virgin where now christ is holding the soul of the mother of god in her hands now if you if you look at the image of the the death of the mother of god or the the the falling asleep and you see christ holding the soul of the virgin in his hands it's very confusing if you don't understand that it was originally understood in space as a as an answer to the eastern apps and the the mother of god with christ in her center so it's like a reflection of east and west sunrise sunset right this this kind of inversion that happens at the beginning in at the end so i think that in order to really understand icons we have to remember that they were they were mostly spatially experienced inside iconographic programs and this from the time of of constantine right right right at the outset the earliest churches that were created in the constantinian period use this apocalyptic apocalyptic imagery in in the church architecture and then also integrating gospel stories and different images so although yes the image itself if you look at it it is in some ways a vertical right it's a vertical relationship there isn't much going on in that in the in the spatial they are meant to inhabit a a 3d space yeah well jonathan one of the things that i was talking with wolfgang about before you joined us was the difference between traditional art and then art after the renaissance when more and more perspective came in more emphasis on form more emphasis on depth in the image and i was just guessing because i'm no expert on iconography but i was guessing that if we go back to his icon of the the ev eternal being a place with no time in space and then the intermediary being in place with only time it seems to me that that iconography fits into the intermediary in the sense that there is it's mostly two-dimensional so there's not a sense of space within the work itself but there is a sense of time because some of your icons show all the time at one time but in a two-dimensional image and i don't know if if that's at all interesting idea yeah well for sure managers yeah well one of the advantages of icons is is the possibility of showing simultaneity you know and it's the difference between a story and an image a story will will string events in a pattern right in the line whereas in in an icon you can experience it the entire story in a simultaneous image and then the the spatial relationships of the elements will be meaningful rather than how they fit in sequence of time so it's it's it is a play between space and time because obviously an image is this fully spatial image it i mean it's it's a spatial experience because you're you're experiencing it but you're also it's a it's a window into simultaneity because you get the possibility maybe i can show the images i did make a few images last year or maybe some of them two years ago which were trying to encompass i call them you know images of everything or or cosmic images would try to encompass all of this narrative into one single image do you need to give me can i share do you think yes please do okay let's see i haven't carved these yet they're just designs and so these are two efforts that i i made to to create images or cosmic images which would try to encompass let's say entire narratives into single images and so on the left you have this image of the cosmic mountain the mountain of paradise and it's it's also a commentary in some ways on san ephraim's him zone paradise and also saying greg rivenessa's life of moses all of these this these types of structures coming in at the same time so if you look at the image you will see of course this different characters appear several times in this same image you have adam and eve appearing at the tree and then adam and eve covering themselves with the fig leaves and then adam and eve covered with the garments of skin and then you also have an increase of division from the singularity of the cross into a splitting in half until you have adam and eve completely separated and then the thorns which have you know multiplicity let's say multiplicity itself as the as the thorns and then you have of course adam and eve transformed ultimately into the mother of god and saint john up at the tree of life which is shown as the cross and so these these types of image so you also have so sand ephraim talks about how the rivers of these four rivers talked about this idea of the dome and how the dome moves into four into a square how the circle moves into a square and you see that in in the image of paradise itself so if you if you can represent it you get a sense of this this dome which becomes a square with the wall of paradise so it's also a church and you have these four currents which come down and which are mitigated as they get further and further away from the from the source let's say and so these are these are a few you see and so in now the the other one is of course the image of the flood and so you have this let's say microcosm of this so this image here of of paradise is now inserted in the background as the just the tree and the mountain the wall and the four rivers and the flood comes right up to the to the the wall of paradise so basically all of this here in the first image is now what's represented here so it's also a way to kind of show how these microcosm fit into each other and then the arc of course becomes a microcosm as well of the hierarchy which we see in the different images and so you know with the birds the birds above and then the animals below and then death of course at the bottom and residues of civilization residues of religion residues of animality all these residues which are in in the mouth of hades which is this is down here below these are all pulled out of of course traditional images this is it's a condensation of traditional images but all of the elements are taken from different iconographic strains so they say the mouth of hell or the mouth of death is a very ancient image that we find in iconography same with the leviathan this is of course the leviathan but it's also jonah's monster there are different elements to to to look at how i tried to pull it all into one into into what very condensed images so what do you hope people what what impact do you hope this will have on people who well these particular images i think what they do for people is they first of all surprise them because they they at first get a sense that there's a coherence but they they can't access it rationally right away and then slowly if they know their bible this is of course it's mostly useful for people that know their bible if they know their bible then things will start to appear and start to to kind of take form and and make sense and then they'll start to realize that for example you know the crown of thorns which is around the the paradise here is also lifted up by christ as being this ultimate you know apathetic image above and then people start to notice how the image comes together and to realize the the deep coherence of the biblical story the deep coherence of these images and so yes that is what i'm hoping to to accomplish with these images it's just a kind of personal story as i have or experiences i've gone deeper into christianity myself and i look at just the symbolism of the cross right it's amazing how much has opened to me from just contemplating that icon whereas before before i was open to a religious life i guess i had dismissed that icon entirely right even though i had been you know raised nominally christian but you know to me that's what is really kind of the burning question right is if this approach that we have to you know knowledge and understanding today this kind of science physics based in time sequential cause and effect versus really engaging with symbols and and the reality of the symbols themselves right as i go deeper into that it's just opening up a whole new world of new worlds of understanding that we're kind of you know excluded before because these were just regarded as mythological and something from an earlier time and not really of value to the modern man yeah let me let me just here maybe i can show this image and show how it connects to dr smith's circle and the periphery so this is of course this now it's a carving that i've done of christ pulling saint peter from the waters and i think that in this image we see a very a very beautiful version of what wolfgang is talking about in terms of the relationship between center periphery and something we could call memory there are different ways to represent the intermediary world memory is definitely one of them and so we have of course christ who represents in this in this image represents the the center and then peter who is falling into the periphery he's falling into the periphery because he forgets his connection to christ and and he he thinks that it's on his own he thinks that he can do it all by himself that he can walk on the waters without being connected to the incarnation and because of that that's why he falls and in and in calling out to christ right in remembering god remembering christ remembering the heart all these images we find in traditional parlance then he is able to be pulled back out of the chaos and stand firmly on the on the multiplicity that is the world and in this image i wanted to show how christ the way that he engages with multiplicity is he transforms it into glory and so when his foot touches when his foot touches the waters it actually sends golden spirals out from the place where he touches the the the periphery we could say let me just interject jonathan that these carvings are perfectly beautiful they're amazing thank you and i've never seen this style of carving it's is is that unique to to you it's well it's based on i mean it's based on byzantine style but of course it you know we how can i say this we we're not idiosyncratic we're all i mean we're not nostalgic for the past i'm not trying to make pastiche images of ancient art i'm trying to create images that both connect with the past and with the ancient forms but also have enough element of of surprise to make you to not make you ignore it let's say or to not make you walk by and think that it's let me show you here's an image of jonah which is i i chose these images because they're related to the question of the of the icon and so here again we have a similar image as the image of saint peter which is that jonah is being eaten by the monster he's being eaten by this leviathan here that's in the waters by the the sea monster and then he says from the belly of death i cry i cried and you heard my voice and so from the belly of this this chaos and multiplicity he remembers god and therefore is brought out of the waters into the city beautiful so right the you know the the multiplicity with the corporeal world and the christ or god with the avaternal world here for a wolfgang's icon yes well it's to me the way that i see the icon the i see it really as a as a fractal structure and so it it represents itself relatively at different levels and so for example let's say you can let's say if you have a let's say you have a group a team or a nation or something then you can see how that structure will represent itself and there'll be stand-ins let's say a stand-in for the center would be the king of course the king is not spiritual the king is an embodied person but it because it manifests itself fractally then you can understand that there are images which are more appropriate to to see it at it in its highest form and so of course in this image the the you don't see the center it's up here right it's up in what he's looking at it's it's up where he's looking at up here sometimes it's represented as a i don't know if you've ever seen this which is the which is the divine glory it's a divine darkness actually and so usually you'll have a dark a dark semi-circle at the top of many images and that it moves from darkness into light so it really is this kind of apophatic image of the transcendent and so here's a here's a hostile version of the of this question where where now it is in some ways this this connection here between the center and the the periphery which is held by the intermediary being and is of course the source of it is the transcendent the transcendent up here is now more of a hostile image it's more of a pushing down or preventing it from devouring the devouring the world so they're obviously there are different ways to represent the the sometimes it's a beneficial relationship sometimes it can be a hostile relationship depending on the different the things you want to emphasize so jonathan is that st michael yes yeah i'd say michael killing the leviathan yeah you see that in revelation it says saint michael the great the great dragon was was pushed down by saint michael and the the leviathan well i wanted to ask a clarifying question of dr wolfgang smith in order to ask the question i'm going to read a quote of yours from another one of your books dr smith do you want me to stop the share maybe it'll be a good idea no you you can leave it on there it's beautiful to look it's beautiful to look at yeah the ev eternal realm is inherently the cosmos in its integrality before it is fragmented into innumerable bits and pieces through the imposition of temporal and spatial bounds yet despite this partition into spatial temporal fragments every corporeal entity x remains undivided in its very being this gives an identity i guess that's multiplicity but it also made me wonder about the ev eternal realm is there anything above the of eternal realm or is the ebaternal realm the the aboveness oh it's a wonderful question the answer that i would give is this i am presupposing a categorical distinction between god and the creation my ontology is a cosmic ontology in other words i do not engage in any kind of theology i engage in in straight cosmic ontology so the cosmos is one thing and god is infinitely above the cosmos but i don't write about god i i write about the cosmos so your icon is is the cosmos but god is infinitely other god is infinitely other he's not part of the the the icon refers to the cosmos not the gods so jonathan maybe that answers your question about why it's flat rather than a mountain because because god is at the top of the mountain as god is above the top of the mountain let's let's put it that way so yeah now we could stop screen sharing here and and maybe we could go on to talk about this issue of the symbolism of the cross because i found this quote from john barrella quite fascinating jonathan are you familiar with john barella yeah okay so in his book symbolism and reality he's talking about what he learned from renee and and he's and barilla says to the basic cosmological question what is the reality of the physically real materialism is incapable of providing the least response by wanting to reduce the historical physically real to its space-time conditioning and material substantiality far from saving it or issuing its consistency or rooting it in being and guaranteeing its objective existence they positively destroy it since they subject it to fragmentation to the indefinite divisibility of space-time and matter if the cross of christ is only made of two pieces of wood then it vanishes in the scattering and inconstancy of an electron mist so i wondered if the three of you would discuss the symbolism of the cross if it's not just particles if it's not just wood what what are all the aspects of the symbolism of the cross i mean i think what just what i what really stand stood out to me about that borella quote is his in the first sentence right about that the can you read that first sentence over again sure to the basic cosmological question what is the reality of the physically real yes materialism is incapable of providing the least response exactly and therein lies the rub right that's kind of where we're stuck because we're trying to use materialism to interrogate everything when meanwhile it can't even answer the question of its own existence and so we have to look beyond that which is why i think we're all here yeah and i think i think that the cross just in terms of geometry it is the place where the identity of something and its multiple elements meet that's the that's the best way to understand it where the vertical and horizontal meet that is that place of communion that place of love where the multiple can become one without annulling its multiplicity and that's a mystery i think that people are faced with now is that we perceive and we we can identify unity at different levels and different objects but we can a simultaneous in like simultaneously realize that those unities are made up of multiplicities this is true you know it happens at every level all the way down and it seems to go all the way up and and this is of course the problem that a lot of fields are trying to account for or deal with today they come up with terms like emergence which i love how david bentley hart said said emergence just means magic it's like magic happens here and then all of a sudden we have one just because you have a word doesn't mean you understand the process and so this is of course the mystery which i do believe that more traditional visions of of ontological hierarchies answers and the the mystery of the cross in terms of christianity and it's something which i find which is difficult to fully pierce is that it seems what christ is showing to us is that what's at the center is something like sacrifice and it's something like self-sacrifice it that seems to be what happens at the middle so that's what i can propose at the outset i very much like what you just said jonathan about the cross that the most salient point is this point of intersection the idea that the vertical which in a way it represents god and the horizontal which represents the creation that they can intersect and there are many ways i think of interpreting that but beginning with the idea that the incarnation itself represents an intersection of these two dimensions and incidentally let me just remark on this that you mentioned renege and you you said i'm a perennials let me say that this is something that the perennialists don't do do not understand they do not understand this intersection because the perennialists are essentially inspired by the vedic tradition which is the oldest in the world and the very venerable tradition indeed but it is very very different from the christian that the two are not the same and i think it is very very important for the christians to understand the uniqueness of the christian vision of the christian revelation and it lies in this intersection this intersection is nowhere represented in the vedic it is not there this is also why the idea of salvation is nowhere in the vedic tradition the nirvana is blowing out it is a union with god undoubtedly but it is a union in which the human is incinerated and the uniqueness of christianity is something that the vedic people don't understand renege no never understood it sure never understood it and it is true that i was sort of impressed by the perennial school i read a lot of the works and i was inspired by it but eventually i realized that the christian tradition transcends that in a completely fundamental way and that the christian escort on of salvation is incomprehensible in fact in the vedic tradition if you try to explain that to the most educated sadhus in india they will not understand what you're saying i think you're inside i mean i think the insight you've had is the same that i had at some point and also came to love christianity and realize that you know you know a lot of people have said it that you just didn't understand christianity maybe he also didn't have the right sources i don't know or he had bad he had obviously had bad experiences also with the with the catholic church at his at the time of his own in his own experience but i think i think you're right that would we realize in christianity would we have is instead of seeing multiplicity as maya or ultimately as illusion we rather see how its connection to the center and to the divine is what fills it with reality but that that feeling of reality is is real it's not an illusion it's not a it's not something that's evanescent and which will disappear when we go up into heaven but rather it is a kind of solidifying of the of the world in a good way making it glorious and that's what the heavenly jerusalem ultimately represents is the idea that no all these things can participate if they're properly aligned can participate in the glory of god and will be will be full of glory and not not in the way that it will dematerialize them but rather in the manner in which it makes them more real and you see that i think c.s lewis had great insight about about that as well he talks about you know the idea of the the the blades of grass in paradise being too sharp for us something like that like they're actually too real for us and you see in the church fathers they say and yes katan saint paul will be more saint paul and saint peter will be more saint peter as they enter into more and more of their theosis and becoming god more and more they've also become more of themselves very well put and and this is something that is completely uncomprehended in the perennialist world view they they have they have no comprehension with it all and in fact they look upon christianity through vedantic eyes and through vedantic eyes you will never see christianity it's invisible once you put these spectacles on and so this is i think a very important point which needs to be explained to interested people because there's a tremendous confusion about this in the world today most of the so-called intellectuals the world over are in a sense perennials today and this is very unfortunate yeah and i think christianity ultimately is in some ways a better solution to the problem of or the question of non-duality it actually presents a fuller a fuller a fuller solution to that problem right which is that we do not deny the infinite infinite transcendence of god but in that infinite transcendence all of reality can participate i i don't see how you can find a better solution to the problem of of duality rather than wanting to extinguish manifestation and see it as some kind of delusion or illusion or or evanescent some some kind of mist you know that will be this that will be kind of scattered once things return to god it's like well then what are those then what what is their purpose like what is what purpose do they serve we literally could say you know christ saves the world that's right exactly and it's and he says it through elevation itself right and you can see that somebody who's been through the science and the western education right and the materialism which can explain itself and ends up being empty and nothing and then the hindu traditions and kind of all of the eastern traditions that basically pursue that kind of maya extinction path to actual salvation right that christ saves the world literally restores substance meaning to the world and i would add not just through sacrifice but through love yeah right yeah love becomes the bindings and where else do you learn about love in the same way that you do from christianity right and and so to go back to karen's original question about the symbolism of the cross right it is the symbol of love and and that love is what makes things real well yeah some people think that's just a sappy statement but i think it's the deepest metaphysical statement that you can make because love is the coexistence of unity and multiplicity that's what love is because if you love something you don't want it to vanish you don't want it to disappear you want it to exist as different from you and then be bound bound to it at the same time and so it's actually it's one of the most beautiful ways to understand how all the creation can coexist with god and within god so you said love is the unity of you know love is the coexistence okay in unity yes i'd like to jump in here just a minute because before i forget what you said jonathan you said that the connection to the divine is what fills it with reality solidifying the world in a good way and i just love that language because i've been meditating for a long time on that verse faith is the substance of things hoped for because my belief is that the bible is truer than true it's so deeply true that it's not not a scientific book but when you when you read the scripture it's as though deep scientific truths were buried in there for us to find when we when we matured enough to find them and to me faith is the substance of things hoped for is exactly what you said the divine fills fills it with reality so this thing hoped for is the thing that is is posited or is is the the vision that you have for something and then faith fills that with reality it fills it with substance it it fleshes it out so to speak so a while back i i did a video on the quality of the sacrifice thinking about sacrifice not just as how we think of like dying on the cross or giving up your time for others or something well yeah okay but the idea of opportunity cost that every everything that you do means a whole lot of other things that you don't do right so the quality of that sacrifice determines the nature of what comes into being as a result of that sacrifice right that made me ask the question so what exactly is it that we are measuring when we measure because i've been stuck on this measurement problem in physics for a long time and i really think that the measurement problem is deeply tied to sacrifice and i haven't thought my way all all the way through that but i would love to have a physicist point of view on that so wolfgang if you could you don't have to answer right now but if you could just give that some thought because you talk quite a bit in your book about how we are meeting out we are measuring out time we are measuring out all these things in in everything that we do so i think measurement and sacrifice and somehow this idea that jonathan said about our connection to the divine is what fills the world with reality i think it is very necessary very important to represent christianity in this current debate because it seems to me the perennialists and they are represented by a very very brilliant people again on and chew on they have been as it were winning the argument and no one has stood up to represent the christian side and i'm completely convinced that in the the conception of the triune god we have the resolution of this dichotomy of atma maya if you if you read what the perennialists have to say on this subject you find that they cannot get beyond this dichotomy and so for example in practice this means that if you want to actually attain to reality attained to the supreme wisdom you have to of course give up maya and the christian way is much more subtle than that because the christian ontology is based not upon two but upon three and this is where salvation comes into play the christian conception of the triune god somehow saves you from this vedantic dichotomy and this is something that needs to be communicated to the intellectual world today because as i see it they are fascinated by the perennialist message which is a in a sense it's a denial of the christic revelation in favor of the vedic foreign yeah when we if we understand the story of christ we'll see that one of the things that christ is doing pretty much all the time in his story is he's constantly transforming death into glory that's the best way to understand it and so he's filling the the aspects it's it's a narrative the crown of thorns is the best version of that because the crown of thorns is of course the consequence of the falls it is multiplicity itself or it's like hostile multiplicity we could say all these spiky things that that pierce us and then christ is able to transform that into a crown and then you realize that that's what christ is actually doing all the time which is why he goes to the margin all the time why he why he engages with the the the samaritan woman for example here here's a woman who's had several husbands to the extent that now she's living in an illegitimate relationship with a man and so she's a for all intents and purposes and narrative narrative constructs and christ is saying i will marry you right i will be your seventh husband and i will give you water that will flow into eternity and so he takes her low state and brings it up and he does that constantly whether it's the woman with the issue of blood whether it's and whether it's resurrection itself like that's what resurrection is it is a transformation of death into glory so this the whole story of christ the whole you know not just as an abstract image of the incarnation but in the story we see how christ is constantly showing us how the world even death itself can be full and transformed into into light so yeah i love it beautiful so karen i wanted to understand your question just a little better about yeah i'm sorry so flustered looking at all of you because your brain is also much bigger than mine but karen i have an insight in your question if you want if you want to maybe i can see yeah is that it's that without without an identity you can't measure anything you can't you don't measure things without identity identity is pre measurement presupposes identity we presuppose is telos and then presupposes a bound something that binds it and those are the two sacrifices right there the sacrifices of yom kippur there's a sacrifice up towards identity towards that the source of identity and then there's a scapegoat sacrifice of cutting off that which doesn't belong within the identity and so without those two sacrifices without giving up all your best up towards the identity and without cutting off that which doesn't belong you can't measure there's no possibility of measuring and so so measurement is that it has to be bound up in the notion of sacrifice so fascinating because i mean one of the reasons i came to the conclusion i came to is because of my work as an artist and in creativity thinking about the elements and principles of design and how boundary is so important in the way that you establish well first of all boundaries are so important in the way that you establish your work you have to have limitations and constraints before you can even get started because there's just too many choices otherwise so so the boundary sets a place where within which creativity can exist and then one of the things that we always discovered when we're working is that sometimes you're painting and you realize there's this one beautiful little spot over here in this corner and you don't want to lose that spot but you need to you need to repaint so you need to give up that precious thing in order to get to get to the next step to get to the next level and this is like what you're talking about the down cutting off the scapegoat you know getting rid of that scapegoat thing in order to go up towards the identity you have to cut off the other part and i think also that really resonates with me jonathan in the whole area of addiction because i as i've talked about many times on my channel i have a problem with just giving in all the time oh just a little bite of this won't hurt a little bit of that water but it actually does hurt and so because part of what it does is it it it leaves this way out so that you don't have to look up but so i've understood that part but what you're saying here about the down i think that's the part that i haven't gotten a handle on the cutting off so could you could you say that again about the the up is towards the identity and the down is well it's really the yom kippur sacrifice that's really the you could say there are two goats there's one pure goat which is offered up to god and then becomes the meal that we eat so right so we give up and then we get a blessing but we also get cohesion because we eat the meal together so we eat the goat and we become we share the same body because we sacrifice up but then there's also an aspect of the yom kippur sacrifice which is putting your sins on the the goat and chasing it out of the of the city and so that is the cutting off of that which doesn't belong within an identity right so i've said it i joke about it all the time but you can't make an automobile out of gerbils right that is a scapegoat aspect there's some things that you have to eliminate that it almost happens naturally that are eliminated depending on the telos that you're aiming for now of course in the case of christ it's important to understand that christ is both goats christ has both at the same time right that's one of the things that makes it so hard to understand his story christ is both the sacrifice of good odor which goes up and the goat which is sacrificed outside of jerusalem the one that is cast out he does both he he joins those two sacrifices into one and a transcendent sacrifice i'd just like to make a quick connection between one of the things you said jonathan and wolfgang's work which is you can't have measurement without identity right yeah and that is in essence how wolfgang resolves the measurement problem from quantum physics right like measurement by itself as an abstract standalone what entity substance doesn't doesn't exist right and so to just try to answer these questions that can't be answered by measurement with measurement right and then to use the hand waving terms of emergence and consciousness etc to say you know well if you just get enough of them together you know if our computers get fast enough and and our data collection gets vast enough we're gonna see it you know it's gonna pop out but no measurement can't happen without identity i i like to say of wolfgang's work my one sentence summary is the measurer cannot be measured and that is you know really what turned me from finally going okay thank you i no longer have to seek all the answers in this domain which is not capable of giving them to me time to go look somewhere else and it's crazy how people some it's so difficult because you say that but there are thousands and thousands of people which will hear you say that and not know what you're talking about yeah i i keep telling people identities are given identities are a gift from heaven they come down from above obviously i do it on purpose to really push them it's like you cannot get to identities from below it is not possible it is absolutely impossible they they they're a revelation of god there's no other way to encounter them they come down from heaven and bound phenomena together into into unities there's no way around it there was a just a little you know this week there was a big or in the past couple of weeks there was a big story out about self-driving cars right and there's about how here we are 10 years later and they can't make left turns right so because we have this other dimension of our experience wolfgang might call it irreducible wholeness you're calling it identity we're able to do things that this strictly you know in time and space modeling can't do right the simplest things like turn left yeah yeah and then you see this video of elon musk saying literally for the past seven years we're gonna have fully self-driving cars next year by next year you know you guys 90 of your time you're not gonna have your hands on the wheel right and what's interesting about can't happen what's fascinating about the ai this has been really fascinating to me to notice is that what they're doing they're inverting their relationship right and so what they're actually doing inverting the matrix it's an upside down matrix what they're doing is they're farming they're farming for intelligence so the way they train the ai actually is is human selecting yeah so they have all these humans selecting and that is what provides intelligence to the ai and so whatever intelligence the ai has will always come from human selection telling them that's the good one that's the bad one that's the good behavior that's the bad behavior because the machine can never get get there on its own they're modeling intelligence and the intelligence comes from humans and all the algorithms are run by human selection and i don't want to you know get us off track but just i think it's also interesting how that paradigm you know that view of the world allows a very few people to kind of be the authorities that tells everybody else you know how things work and what's going to happen there honey so elon musk and say for seven years now trust me we're gonna have self-driving cars next year right and more money is raised more capitals raised more powers accumulated and and it's just not true it does bring up an interesting point about how in the idea that we can impose identity on something we can choose a new identity or impose identity on something and as jonathan said identity is a gift i mean jonathan you and john pravaky talk a lot about the cup the cup or wolfgang talks about the apple the apple has all this multiplicity i mean if you started taking an apple apart it would be endless number of particles that are involved in an apple and and not just the physical particles but all the things that you could imagine that an apple could do or be or the way that it gets taken up into our bodies it's just completely combinatorial explosive and yet and yet there is an apple and yet it is red and yet it has a taste and a fragrance and and we crave them so it there's also an aspect of identity that i wondered if you guys could talk about a little bit which is coherence over time because one of the theories i've gotten extremely interested in recently not because i think it's true but because i think there are a lot of metaphysical concepts that can be thought about inside this theory and that is stephen wolfram's theory of a new fundamental physics which i don't need to go into here but but in there he does talk about this idea of coherence over time and how identities persist and so i wondered if you guys could talk about that a little bit i mean my arm can move through space and it's the same arm whether it's whether the particles are in this configuration or this configuration or they're over here or it's moving through time or my body is moving through time why is it that that i consist what is the name of the person who whom you're referring to now stephen wolfram if you're interested wolfgang i can send you a lot of material it's a very beautiful theory because that i'll just give you a very simple basic idea that space rather than just being a container space is actually made of particles each particle is a node each node is connected to the other particles through an edge so everything is in relationship and time is the updating of the changing of the the confirmation of these so i'll have to send you some graphics of it but the first icon that he shows for his i'll very quickly draw it out here's the first icon that it shows so this is the beginning there's a rule the rule executes and creates this and then when the rule executes the next time it'll take this edge and reproduce this thing and then it'll take an edge from that new one and reproduce it and when you start reproducing this rule over and over and over again you begin to get structures that looked very much like structures very complex fascinating beautiful structures that look very much like structures in the world now he's thinking computationally but not computationally like the computations of a computer but computationally as in choices over time executing a rule consists of choices over time in the same way that you talked wolfgang earlier about mozart getting a symphony all at once in his head but then it over time he begins to take that apart and lay out the different parts for the various instruments and then get all the music written then the music is basically like a set of symbols that the musicians read and they reconstitute the symphony so their com computationally reconstituting that symphony so when stephen wolfram is talking about a computational universe that's the way i picture it it's more like this rule is executing a symphonic structure and the the thing that i i have been playing around a little bit is what if the one rule is love what if love is the one rule that's that's always recalibrating when when we mess up and screw things up and start going the wrong direction love just institutes and other recalibration and always making a path for us not fixing things but maybe putting obstacles in our path that will allow us to learn what we need to learn in order to move to the next step i got fascinated with jordan peterson's chapter on anomaly in maps of meaning jonathan that's where i started thinking about obstacles and how important they are in terms of growth whether at our level or at the level of a cell or anyplace else obstacles are like obstacles are the gift well for sure in the but in the biblical story you see something like that which is you can see a manner in which let's say love covers all faults something like that it may be the best way to understand it where you you have a sense in which the breaking the breaking is a scandal so you have the fall for example but then what happens is god is constantly covering over and transforming the fall into into more let's say and so let's say a good example that i've used before is that you have the fall you have cain kills his brother because he kills his brother then he found civilization civilization brings war brings chaos brings the end of a world basically but then god uses the very tropes of building and of civilizations to build the ark and so the ark becomes a manner in which all of this breaking down and multiplicity gets re brought brought back together into a microcosm which then you know traverses the chaos and you see then that repeated in the image of the tabernacle and then the temple where the very tools of cain right the very tools of civilizations are kind of recaptured and then brought in in a manner that they manifest now a deeper love and the final image of course is the heavenly jerusalem which saves cain basically right it's like it's it really is this beautiful loop right from the outside of the fall where cain found the first city and then we end with this image of the city which surrounds the garden so you have the garden you have abel and cane you have the garden and the city and this is the totality of what the process led to and so the the multiplicity appears as kind of can appear as scandal but then there's a man in which god is constantly filling that scandal with love and and then and then compensating for it very very interesting let me ask you this jonathan my understanding of uh the art in the to in the orthodox tradition is that iconography to be an iconographer is almost like being a deacon i mean it involves a certain spiritual connection it's not what you do just as an individual by yourself you do it as a member of the church and there's a spiritual side to it and there are also certain rules that you need to obey is it still the way things are today and which should be sadly of course we we do live in the modern world where things are chaotic and people that say do whatever they want but i would say that ideally in my case for example i definitely ask for the blessing of my bishop and he he gave his blessing by giving me my first commission it's actually my bishop who gave me my first commission and so there's a manner in which you know even if it's not done in in official ways like it's not a sacrament right there's no there's no ritual to to decide who an iconographer will be yeah but there is a more organic manner in which iconographers and their work will be accepted into the church by receiving commissions by by being asked to decorate churches for example which is usually the those are the the shining examples of iconography in the church and then the rules there's a language it's the best way to understand it there's a there's an internal language like any poetic language or any musical language there's a there's an internal language and it's flexible so you know you can you can make it consonant if you make it two consonant then it's boring right and if you if you make it too dissonant then people don't recognize it and don't want to integrate it into the community and so you find that balance of play between a kind of consonants with the that which has been given to you but also a breath let's say of of freshness which is related to you being a person in embodied person that's living out your life and so you you'll see iconographers that tend more towards a kind of rigorism and then you'll see iconographers which go wildly into experimentation and you hope that ultimately as the big ship of the church goes down the goes down the river that these things balance themselves out let's say but the most extreme iconographer is usually at some point will will will be ignored by the church or will will just be kind of set aside very interesting i i think this is an area in which the orthodox church has done better than the catholic because in the catholic world as i see it iconography in the strict sense of the term has been lost more or less at the time of the renaissance when it was decided that geniuses like michelangelo should be given free hands to decorate our churches trouble began because i i strongly believe that if you look at michelangelo's paintings yeah the creation it's a horrible image it's a horrible image i mean it is it is more like greek mythology and christianity i mean what you're seeing is not christ you're seeing apollo yeah and i think from who are the naked teenagers next to god in the creation like who are these naked teenagers why why is this happening why do we look at this image so we've kind of connected back and in a sense we have lost sacred art our art is no longer sacred and this is a bad thing because in religion everything should be sacred even the ground you walk upon so this has been a problem and in this regard we have a lot to learn from the orthodox churches which have preserved these traditions which are very important there there are some interesting places tradition cultures that have remained in their folk tradition seem to actually have been better at preserving the more iconographic aspect of christian art and so if you go to a church in mexico for example like a folk church in mexico which you'll find in the church although they have no contact with the medieval tradition or with with orthodox iconography you'll find something which is much closer to the sensibilities and the the theological care that you would find in the in orthodox icons so so it's an interesting it has to do with a very deep deep problem a deep shift in consciousness which i think appeared in the west of course during during that same time well i i think that when they introduced perspective in sacred art they destroyed sacred art because the whole point of sacred art is that it deals with the spiritual world instead of the material world and perspective belongs to the material world it does not belong to this spiritual world where there is no distance at all so it seems to me that this is an important aspect of our decline in in losing sake it up we lost something that is absolutely essential you can't really do without it and we're paying the price and i would tie that back to karen's question about coherence over time right that coherence over time comes from the spiritual world yes to try to find it in the material world yeah and also you can't find it right and that's why wolfgang's a platonist in essence right i hope so well you can see that the worship of the individual genius the worship of innovation all of these things which started to burgeon at the time of the renaissance you know has led to a breakdown of of catholic sacred art you know the the churches it got just worse and worse until vatican ii and and now it's a dismal dismal state although i would say that because of how dismal it became in the 1970s like 60s 70s maybe even before that starting in the 40s it became so dismal that that right now there's in some ways a a reviving of the traditional language because there's nothing left to do all those ugly churches no one everybody hates them no one wants them and and so we can see them as this these faded you know you know very dated innovations that no one cares about anymore and so the only place to go at this point is a rediscovery of the traditional language hopefully not doing it in a way that is too much of a of a pastiche or just a a nostalgia for the past but rather entering into the language like any musical or or our poetic language and learning the rhymes learning the form so that you can now create something which is both new but also in tune with the ancient patterns unfortunately it's much easier to destroy something than to build it up well so wolfgang this is one of the reasons i wanted you to meet jonathan because i know that you've been concerned about the future of the world about the future of of the faith and i wanted you to meet jonathan because he's this entirely new generation and he's bringing along with him a lot of other young men and women who are catching the same vision and so i wanted you to meet somebody who's in this little corner of the internet having an impact with these deep and ancient truths i hope it's encouraging to you it is very encouraging in in fact i couldn't be more encouraged we we need that there has been a disorientation which is very very difficult to repair and i think we have a lot to learn from the orthodox tradition i thank god that it's still functional it's alive and well that is very encouraging it's been wonderful to learn about your work jonathan i too am really encouraged i think it's also just to kind of bring the two together you know i think what wolfgang's work does is kind of from a very credible scientist right shows the reductio out of certain that science has created you know the impasse that we're all at today and then opens people to a reconsideration of okay well if i can't understand the world this way how can i understand the world and then that opens us back up to conversations about the role of religion legitimate role of religion and the differences between different religions and i think our conversation today and getting into some of the nuances about christianity which i really hope people and we as a culture will reconsider and revisit because i think we need it and i think that that wolfgang your work in some ways when you were publishing was so out of tune with academia was so counter-cultural was just like just smashing into into the system in ways that was also difficult for people to ignore because of because of your credentials and your your your credibility in terms of academic capacity and its intellectual capacity and i hope and i and i hope that we see the fruits of all those years of effort now that we can start to notice is that even people who who are coming at it through different means or coming at it through different roads are coming to the conclusions that you came at you know decades ago and that in some ways it's going to it's going to be seen in in retrospect as a as really pioneering for what is coming in the future because there's no other way to go beside the way that you set for us so thank you for all your work well i do believe that we are heading for a to a point where something new will have to come into play and i'm of course hopeful actually what i represent is nothing new i i'm just to play a christian platonist doing his best not to mess up and misconstrue things but to present them as they are and down the road i think our civilization perhaps will be receptive to reconsider these basic problems i do believe that things are breaking down for example physics is in a complete chaos the the non-specialist doesn't know much about it but for example particle physics is almost a joke i mean it's it's it it's a reduction which no sane person can take seriously anymore and so something will have to give sooner or later and i don't think i will live to see it but i don't think it's that far far away from us and i can't tell you jonathan how thrilled i am to hear what you had to say and to see real wisdom and real tradition flowering and expressing itself in a contemporary way that's wonderful okay thank you it's been a delight to spend the morning with you all and next week i'm going to have wolfgang on again with john for baky again if they've talked once and they're going to be talking again so i'm very excited for that thank you all for giving me so much time and maybe we can do this again sometime in the meantime have a have a wonderful day thanks everybody thank you bye-bye
