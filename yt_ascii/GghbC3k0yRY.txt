you did mention that that you thought that an understanding of the way ant colonies are able to perform incredibly organized tasks might well be the key to understanding human cognition so these fundamentally distributed systems so what do you think is the difference between the way don knuth would sort a list and an ant colony would sort a list or performing algorithm sorting a list isn't famous cognition though but but i know what you're getting at is well the advantage of ant colony at least we can see what they're doing we know which ant has talked to which other ant and and and and it's much harder with the with brains to just to know how to what extent of neurons are passing signal so i understand that aunt connie might be a you know if they have the secret of cognition could think of an ant colony as a cognitive single being rather than as a colony of lots of different ants i mean just like the cells of our brain are and and the microbiome and all that is interacting entities but but somehow i consider myself to be one single person well you know aunt connie you can say might be cognitive is somehow and it's yeah i mean you know i okay iii spike i smashed a certain aunt and mmm that's done what was that right you know but if we're going to crack to the secret of cognition it might be that we can do so by but my psyche note how ants do it because we have a better chance to measure and they're communicating by pheromones and by touching each other and site but but not by much more subtle phenomenon like electric currents going through but even a simpler version of that what are your thoughts of maybe conway's game of life okay so conway's game of life is is able to simulate any any computable process and any deterministic process is like how you went there i mean that's not its most powerful thing i would say i mean you can simulate it but the magic is that the individual units are distributed yes and extremely simple yes we can we understand exactly what the primitives are the perimeter is the just like with the answer all in even simple but if we but still it doesn't say that i understand i understand life i mean i understand it it gives me an it gives me a better insight into what does it mean to to have a deterministic universe what does it mean to to have free choice for example do you think god plays dice yes i don't see any reason why god should be forbidden from using the most efficient ways to to to i mean we we know that dice are extremely important and inefficient algorithms there are things like that couldn't be done well without randomness and so i don't see any reason like why god should be prohibited but when the when the algorithm requires it you don't see why the yeah the physics should constrain it you
