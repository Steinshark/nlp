[music] you know them once you know them days you want things to fall in place while keeping up with this place you're trying to keep a smile on that face so you're raving on the weekday off that street and into this raid fam hey what is up guys i'm kphd here and an mkbhd merch store this has never really been a thing in the past we've had a couple things like a single limited edition t-shirt on teespring or some small fun creative projects and those are always really exciting but i've always wanted something a little more permanent a little more developing and a little more interactive so this is gonna be that taking it to the next level this is something we haven't done before so this is something that's been brewing for a while you might have seen some of it teased in the backgrounds of some videos kind of showing up here and there but i figured what better way to launch this whole thing than by reviewing my own merch [music] the logo the classic not everyone will know but you'll know so the shirt itself is actually really soft and this isn't something that i had much control over with previous shirts that i've done but this is really nice material shirt like how can something so crispy be so soft so the material is 50 polyester 25 cotton 25 ryan that's why it's so soft and also i'm 6'3 i'm wearing the large right now you could probably get away with the medium if you're my size also because it's not going to shrink much it's definitely a slim fit it's like a more modern fit design for a t-shirt and there's also different designs or different fits for the men's versus women so that's cool and it's also this is a water-based ink so what that means is instead of like a normal cheap screen print design this isn't going to crack and scrape off over time it's actually going to get softer and still look this good but the color scheme the design the logo obviously i'm a pretty big fan of this one [music] the chevron this is another graphic staple of the channel because obviously it's in the channel banner but i'm no fashion expert but this is also a pretty flattering like a sleek sort of modern image i think it's a couple different shades of red as you can see it's a warm design and i feel like it could also be pretty good for a couple other different color combos also i don't know if you picked up on this but every single one of these shirts at the bottom down here has this hem tag so every single shirt has a hem tag with the logo on the outside and established 2008 on the other side that is definitely a pretty nice touch i'm glad we went with this established 2008 this is another pretty clean design again pretty simple pretty soft again it's got the hem tag again it's i and this is actually i like it more than i thought i would wearing it it looks pretty dope another fun fact is all the shirts on the inside usually you have like a tag like a paper tag sort of cuts you or is scratching you on the back of the neck these shirts don't have an actual physical tag instead this one's got a little printed tag on the inside with the size and the company's logos and a little message for whoever buys it so definitely pretty clean and soft all the way around there have obviously been many milestones in the history of the channel the 100th video i ever made the 100th subscriber video i made update 1.0 about four years ago today was when the channel first passed one million subscribers which is huge but i think the day that this channel was first signed up the day it was created on youtube is the biggest one of them [music] black everything this one this one is legit this is also the only shirt of the collection that is 100 cotton so it may shrink a little bit more but that's so that this is an actually matte black shirt which is dope maybe a little bit tough for pet owners i could see that being a bit of a problem but overall the design clearly thought out well there are only so many truths in life and one of them is that every device should have some sort of a stealthy or space gray or matte black option so that's why we made this and also the hemp tag is probably the most colorful part of this one she's on my brain five shots the hat that's right it's not just t-shirts there's a hat as part of the collection as well this one is it's like a soft fabric on the outside it's a snap back so one size fits most and this actually isn't the only color there's a little green in the brim there but there's also going to be a heather gray version and a navy blue version so if black isn't your style then you can get those colors as well but if you're a hat person there it is i bet you've never seen me with a hat on i've probably not since the golf videos on the beginning of my channel have i had a hat on in a video so that's it that's the core that's what we're starting with right now it is all live at shop.mkbhd.com pretty glad we got that url as well and the goal of this isn't just to open a merch store and then you guys get stuff and it ends there that's the way a lot of things go but this is more kind of like the channel like an exchange so we have this sort of a core collection of the beginning of things but then as you guys come up with ideas for maybe not just new designs but new pieces or things you want to get and you leave them in the comments that's kind of like the way it's contributed to the videos and the way i make videos that'll add to the merch store as well so we'll be adding things over time to what we've established today i also want to give a huge shout out to cotton bureau for making this entire thing possible so this is a cotton bureau site they're the ones that make the beautiful web design possible for that url they're the ones that make the super soft shirts and that top-notch quality possible and they're the ones that make the worldwide shipping of these being available internationally possible so they're taking care of shipping and getting it to you guys as quickly as possible now always shipping is going to be starting off it's going to be going out in waves so if you want to get your order in by the first wave and get your stuff in that first wave you have to order by february 27th by 8 pm eastern that's when the first wave ends and everything goes through to production and gets shipped so the hype is real for that i can't wait to see you guys rocking these but until the next one thank you for watching oh and seems like a good time to introduce the next milestone for the mkbhd channel introducing the mkbhd video team thanks for watching
