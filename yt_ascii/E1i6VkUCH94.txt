six days to change one line of code a true story oh no i can already feel myself going don't do it don't you do it that's called stability philip president now our factory is underutilized by 10 either we start building more of our our backlog or we lay people off i'd rather keep everyone busy build inventory and get ahead of the curve before the busy season how can we do that lee operation manager company policy restricts us from building more than three months of backlog if you just change that to four months we'll have plenty of work philip done now how do we implement that lee i'm not really sure i think we have to change the setting in the legacy software david i t director no problem oh it's probably one line of code in our core routine fill out a ticket submit it to the i.t services judy it admin i'm assigning this request ticket to one two nine two eight one but it still needs the section on business impact completed and director approval david it's for philip it we don't do this right away we'll have to we'll have to we'll have to have a layoff judy okay then i'll fill out that section myself and put it on the fast track two days later what's the status of one two nine two eight one it's the first enhancement in the develop let's see it's in first enhancement oh my goodness hold on it's the first enhancement in the developer queue after 14 bug reports forget the queue market urgent and send it to ed immediately one hour later ed programmer online 1252 of module or five seven what the hell are we looking at i changed the hard-coded variable months of backlog from three to four now unit tested this successfully and ran two batch of tests the operation worked q increased ten percent as expected this is good to go i submitted it to code review and moved it to homer for user testing acceptance or a user acceptance testing wait hold on do you guys work like this real talk is this your life kill me i worked at a company that this was my life that it was just like these large painful changes to get somewhere kinda yes yes kill me oh my goodness all right surely code review it is now against company policy to have any hard-coded variable s you gotta love it you'll have to make this record in the parameter files also there are two old debug commands and unassigned variable warning message and other hard-coded employee id that will have to be fixed before this module can be moved to production ed  that [applause] that may very well be true shirley surely we love you this is fed this is the way to respond to ed but since you are assigned to orb 572 and you are responsible for fixing a pre-existing errors that violate new company policy i cannot promote this as as it is dude this sounds like government law when it comes to property did you know that in the united states if you buy a property and your property let's just say that you never even knew that one of the structures was out of compliance or some weird building thing or non-permit thing happened right you had no idea you bought this property you were just now responsible you own all existing errors that happened this happened to us we had this nice little place we thought it was really nice we really liked it we went we had this like nice little little guest quarters we went to the guest quarters and then it just turns out the that the county was like that's not supposed to be there and we're like i what do you want me to tell you it's not well it's there i don't i don't know what you're trying to tell me like sorry right like that's that's a weird thing all right two hours later okay done i just re-submitted it to code review julie i t testing homer is not available for user acceptance testing because fred is running a controlled test for a month and accounting close use marge instead i don't have access to march then contact joe and i.t security he'll get you permissions two hours later joe in ist security i cannot grant you access to mars without david's signature he's out of town can this wait till monday i don't think so philip or i don't think so philip wants this right away get him to grant access surely your new parameter record months of demand needs a better name oh yes yes the offshore programmers won't understand what this means also it should have an adult trail of changes or an audit trail of changes what policy is that it's not exactly written down anywhere the offshore team is three months late updating the wiki but i assure you all new parameter records must satisfy new naming requirements and keep audit trails one day later ed i renamed the parameters record months of demand to selected months of backlog demand and added module par 634 to maintain the record and its audit trail i have submitted it to code review tony it testing ic129 and 281 on march but i have no test plan ed just run it the old way in the new way and note the increase in the total of work hours reported work order hours reported that's your test plan no dude this sounds like such a qa move oh my goodness i had the right someone was just like you need to try to write a test plan this was once at netflix a while ago okay this has only happened to me once i wrote something down they're like this is your test plan it's childish and incomplete and i'm like yeah yeah you know why i'm a programmer dog this is how i see the world okay childish and incomplete and you will deal with it okay this is why i do this and then something tells me i'm wrong and i change my opinion about how i should do things i don't know what you want from me this affects everything in the factory i have to have user selected test cases expected results documented test runs and user sign off two days later philip david tell tony to move ed's program to production immediately david yes sir total elapsed time six days lines of mission critical code changed one bytes of mission critical code change one excedrin eaton 24. pissed off hours spent on hacker news 14. this person must be ed in the story this is ed i hope you realize that what we just read is ed's life story and that man you need to lay off the excedrin okay you're gonna find yourself having some issues okay you're definitely going to have some issues ed you don't want to do this to your life okay thanks for sharing imagine if this was your life and you wrote it up and your response was thanks for sharing [laughter] [music] [laughter] rob you son of a that is so funny the buck stops there was shirley yeah shirley really laid down the law can we all agree don't call me shirley okay she has her act together i don't okay so don't call me shirley this is ridiculous this oh yeah oh yeah of course it was ed it's at the top of the article foreign oh my goodness oh and we spent weissman thank you very much this is a great great hey go follow ad on twitter okay don't follow ed on twitter okay he hates twitter okay he's probably on threads or on mastodon i don't know maybe he's a mastodon i don't know whatever happened to you ed i appreciate you you don't exist anymore i ain't using mastodon i don't know what to tell you okay i don't know what to tell you the name is the primogen
