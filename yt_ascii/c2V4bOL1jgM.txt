so who of you doesn't speak german or only a little bit of german perfect so because we're in germany i thought you might be wondering or might be wanting to learn a little bit of german and this is the german that we use as software developers this is what we actually use in the office so we start with a simple sentence i bet most of you work with git and the germans already know what's coming most of you work with git and so at some point you might have said something like i have pushed the branch to somewhere if you would translate this like word by word into german it would be something like but this is bad that's not how we speak that's not how we say it we actually say branch [music] pushed notice that we keep the word branch but it's a noun so we capitalize it so that's the german language rules but the important word or the interesting word is the word gushed this is perfect valid german we speak like this so let's take a closer look at this word kushed so the basic form of this word is actually pushing which of course is to push so you might already know that german is a little bit complicated of a language and i could show you a full conjugation table of this word in perfect german but we will be we will be here until tomorrow for this one word so i thought i will show you the two tenses that you might need the most it's the present and the past and also i decided on three pronouns which we might use the most just to make this a little bit faster so if i wanted to say that i have pushed something i would say push is i so is push is i push do pushed is you push s c s pushed he she it pushes or pushes so you there's actually a pattern in there so for the version for the i version for is we add an e at the end of the basic english word for do which is like the informal u that we use in german we add a st and for ascs which is heit we add a t at the end from the basic english word so now we also have the past tense and i use the second past tense this is what we use in speech in germany and that would be pushed do pushed as yes had pushed see this is a little bit easier so it's the same word for all of the versions and it's the same pattern we add g at the beginning and a t at the end so now you know the pattern let's see another word we do code reviews or review each other so i mean how would i say that i review something it would be review two reviewss reviewed see it's the same pattern and also for the past tense toed had ged notice the slight change of intonation for ged so that that's important okay from time to time we deploy software hopefully so again we apply the basic pattern deploy do deploys the ss deployed we we're happy but now for the past tense what do you think will happen so in this case if you would do g deployed this would sound stupid the others don't the others don't you know but this would sound stupid so what we actually do is deployed deployed deployed this is an irregular verb so you know there are exceptions to the rules i could be doing this all day i could be doing this all day but this is is my favorite word actually and yeah it's to cherry pick or cherry picking which is cherry do cherry pi cherry pick notice that when i say cherry pick in english i use the english r but if i say cherry pick in german i say cherry pick super important it's a different r if you want to sound german you you need to practice the german art and now there are two past tense versions for the past tense for this so depending if you view cherry pick as one word or or as a verb or pick as the verb you can get cherryi cherry picked cherry picked or and i use both versions har a cherry pick toer picked aser picked with a proper so now you know how the german language works this is all you need to know if you want to work in a german office let's try out a sentence release line fan so now you have you can claim basic knowledge in german you can put that on your resume and thank you very [music] [applause] much
