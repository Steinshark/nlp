ladies and gentlemen who is the best chess player in the world now it's not magnus carlsen not dingley rand who just recently won the world championship it's not mittens the chess bot it's not frank the best player in the world is the person who is cheating and cheaters ruin the game of chess i mean they tremendously enhance this youtube channel because i'm able to farm them for content for all of you but there's a lot of chess cheaters there's a lot of people playing the game of chess now which means evidently by correlation there will also be more cheaters cheaters come in all shapes and sizes some of them have brand new accounts and they play perfectly every single move some of them like to mix up their moves most of them harvest rating points off of individuals like yourself and myself but in today's video i wanted to deep dive into what happens when a cheater plays a grand master and in many cases not just any grandmaster what happens when a cheater plays some of the best grand masters in the world and that's what we will be looking at today i've got a few examples for you a couple of games of magnus carlson and hikaru nakamura and we will start actually with an appetizer game from none other than daniel nareditsky aka sensei dania now daniel and then we have a couple of games by hikaru and then we will end with magnus all right sit back relax and enjoy your short 20 to 25 minute flight to cheat landia naira ditsky likes to play instructive speedrun games he calls them speedrun games they are nothing of the sort those videos are like 50 minutes long they're slow run games if you will and naroditski was playing with the black pieces against against somebody who at the time he didn't know was cheating now this cheater gave us one type of flavor of cheating which is intermittent cheating like right now i'm intermittent fasting this person was intermittent cheating knight f3 knight f6 and the way that this guy played in the opening was like this so this was a cheater who was rated 2400 and this person beat nara ditsky and then closed their own account that day this person in the beginning of the game as you can see is basically just wasting time so this person is deliberately throwing the advantage in the early stage of the game all right nobody at 2400 not a single person on the planet makes this many night moves in the opening this is not losing but it's clearly worse for white you're not supposed to move the knight like six times right and the knight keeps going right the night just keeps moving nara ditski meanwhile is making improving moves while also creating threats the opponent is still doing this so the opponent has made nine moves and has only developed a queen in a night now at the grand master level you by the way by the way by the way by the way i suppose i should have clarified daniel narodinsky in this game is rated 2077 because he is making instructional speedrun content that wasn't clear probably probably sitting there going isn't he a grandmaster in fact on this account he was not labeled as a grand master but we will give him the grand master title so but israeli he's the lowest rate of grand master of all time there you go 2077. it's an authorized account it's not a smurf chess.com allows it people who lose to him do get their rating points refunded just like when they play cheaters in this case though it's you know we call it legal cheating if you will jokes aside nine moves have been made white has nothing and at the grand master level this is a fatal disadvantage black will simply go here and advance these pawns forward and seize the center right queen a4 bishop d7 dania lines this up and clearly e3 you know rook c8 queen rotates to h4 white was doing his best to basically get as bad of a position as possible before turning on the engine okay and in this game in particular he moved his queen and his knight in the first 15 moves of the game only so what did naroditski do activated his bishop brought forward his knight with two dominant knights strong bishop open file castled king it's now time for white to begin winning this game now here the here white starts cheating a little bit he plays knight b5 top engine move what all right narrow place queen b6 now knight five d4 all right centralizing the knight and now kicking out this night so white is now cheating right now white is playing all top computer moves all right now raditzki also however being a very strong grandmaster is playing top computer moves now white plays h4 looking to try them i don't know create some counter play on that side of the board and a5 by dania trying to go here isn't an accuracy as you can see it's giving some light life to the white position takes takes and now white plays the second move of the engine not the first move cheaters like i said they like to throw advantages early sometimes they like to play the best move and the second best move and the third best move and now white plays knight b5 again which just looks ridiculous because c4 cuts the circulation here now most humans here would simply return home nope not the cheater planning that knight on b5 disallowing the knight any progress and now nara disney plays knight d3 check and in this position he can play the move rook c2 which is the best move rook c2 sacrifices the rook to open up an attack on the queen and trust me if the roles were reversed that is what would have been played but dania being a human plays e5 trying to remove the knight and that is the last opportunity that he gave to his opponent as here his opponent sacrificed the night completely just gave up the night took the pawn removed the opportunity of brusitu and now he squeezes the life out of nariditsky pawn takes d4 best move by white shutting down the center the center is now locked black is only a touch better rook c5 defends the pawn on g5 one of the top engine moves queen e2 rook c8 looking to infiltrate bishop d2 that was the idea of sliding the queen out of the way now black is unable to infiltrate but isn't that a free pawn yes now rook b1 queen slides over king walks out to f2 queen takes another pawn white plays the best move rook c7 is an inaccuracy and now for the first time white has an advantage which he calmly converts by taking the pawn on g5 material is equal but black is worse because black's king is weaker rook b7 now why plays f4 and now white plays f5 and basically from this point forward white cheats every move white simply could not resist rook b2 okay you don't have to be very strong to block this but now in this position it looks like everything is stable it's not best move sacrificing the pawn now best move sacrificing the rook and if takes there's e5 and you just get butchered so dana goes here trying to set up bishop g5 rookie two now best move coming back with the rook hitting the bishop and if rook d2 there is rook g5 check so check king g3 and now in spectacular fashion not just queen h5 but bishop f2 check and the white king doesn't hide here but rather walks forward which is the top move of the engine and the black king is mercilessly hunted and in this position rook b8 check is one of the best moves just giving up the rook but it's still mate you can lose the rook but it's still mate which is so ridiculous and daniel gets mated and his opponent was promptly banned now sometimes the game can be even for a while like in this case the person with white very clearly early on tried to mess it up for themselves in as big of a fashion as they could all right they tried to get a losing position now sometimes when people play like this is a game that hikaru played right hikaru had the black pieces in this game and he was playing a on a on a speed run account an actual speed run account like now it is you know and it's playing like a slow run hikaru was actually trying to play as fast as possible and from an early going hikaru was down a rook all right he was down a rook now for that rook he got monstrous control of the center and he actually won back the bishop all right and as you can see here hikaru also had an advantage all right he had an advantage now pawn to a4 queen b4 c3 and hikaru actually for the majority of this game was doing a really nice job he won back one of his pieces and he was going to win the night in the corner knight takes g6 queen takes g6 and it looked like you know hikaru was simply going to pick this up he's got knight and bishop for a rook and life is good now however cheaters come in all shapes and sizes right and in this particular game white just survived for a very long time he played rook a2 defending against mate or she played rook a2 defending against mate bishop d6 now white plays b5 and trades the bishops and plays knight a3 preventing this the thing is if you start cheating from a dead lost position it's very tough to tell it's very tough to tell like only certain moves become clear all right knight c4 hikaru just planting the rook on c4 if hikaru for the rest of this game wants to do nothing he will not lose because white just has no play white cannot get any of these pawns forward any of these pawns which means he can't get any of his pieces forward right so hikaru plays king d7 and white tries to do this there's absolutely nothing there hikaru now plays h4 going for the win but white still is fighting plays the move c4 i don't know if it does anything because black gets a rock solid position but at least now you know there there are some things to worry about here queen e7 hikaru looking for a queen trade plays c3 now white still playing the best moves trying to stabilize karma plays h3 looking up to open up open up the king now every human being will make it an accuracy at some point alright rookie three h2 check king h1 and wait a minute the way some stuff could happen maybe you're gonna take on c3 so hikaru plays this all of a sudden some of his advantage is gone but okay white gives it back queen before queen e5 check on b1 so the person with white allows the queen to come down to be one king h2 and now rookie king g3 and there is nothing knight h5 the guy walks the second game in a row by the way there's a king on g4 walks the king forward all cheater played a legendary king run oh my goodness and the king for black can hardly claim safety as the game is simply over we need five check the king goes to the corner and rook c8 is just game over so a totally ludicrous game where you know hikaru was obviously playing it seemed like against the legitimate opponent for a majority of the game and if not then you know maybe it was a person who was a really really smart cheater just got this absolutely dominant clamp and the person with white just played every move between two and four seconds like literally every move like look at white's time usage four seconds two seconds one second three seconds two seconds six seconds rook ce2 here is the best move but why why save and if anybody's confused by the way why after queen b1 king h2 hikaru did not do this there's queen e6 and queen here and you kind of get beaten up here however there are also games when cheaters just absolutely stomp grand masters this is an example of a game where a cheater completely obliterated hikaru like it wasn't he just did cheater things and the craziest thing is in the early going it was a deadly some it was complete deadly symmetrical position hikaru played c4 person took place c6 and then played b5 just hanging onto his pawn now there's a lot of ways for white to play here white can play a4 white can play b3 which is what hikaru did in the game white can play knight e5 with ideas to take on c6 hikaru chose to play b3 and the idea is to be down upon but have like long long term pressure on on these pawns in the position bishop f5 and the guy just takes the pawn and plays a5 and basically says all right show me what you got and remember hikaru doesn't know he's playing a cheater he just thinks he's playing some 3000 rated player so in in hikaru's eyes he's like well i'm gonna be down a pawn but i'm gonna do hikaru things he plays knight e5 attacking the pawn on c6 now most people here would want to stop that they would want to block the attack maybe they would play rook a6 like i would play rook a6 i don't see anything wrong with that move and it gets this out of the way no black just castles just gives the pawn up completely so what does hikaru do he takes the pawn right now that's apparently a losing mistake knight c6 bishop c6 and now rook c8 okay again rook pawn most people probably rook ca what's the point well bishop b5 now rook immediately infiltrates the c2 and the only move that white has is queen a3 but what is the point i mean you can't even take this queen takes d4 here is a very human move but it's not the best move the best move here for black is to play bishop h3 which attacks this and now hikaru plays bishop d3 counter-attacking the rook if the rook goes back white just moves the rook and it's probably fine but black in this position disregards the attack on the rook and plays queen d5 threatening mate all right now hikaru plays e4 okay the idea is that queen takes d4 is not a mate so you can take the rook black plays knight takes e4 and then plays knight takes g3 and there is nothing you can do to prevent queen g2 the only way you can prevent queen g2 is to play f3 which leads to bishop takes d4 which is also made for rook f2 queen f3 look at this have we ever seen hikaru and his position reduced to something like this this is crazy right queen h1 queen g2 queen f2 bishop f2 there's 92 how many mates are there in this position everything is made and yeah hikaru i think resigned after this and and and person played like three more games and then was banned yeah this person played a perfect game completely perfect game said you want a stack a pod in the opening against video why not take two back and then bang bang night g3 is just yeah sometimes the cheater leaves the person with no chance now you know what's rare what's really rare in the chess world is to watch magnus carlson play a cheater the reason is magnus carlson is not down here in the dumps with the rest of us all right magnus doesn't just boot up games on his phone against nobodies okay magnus is playing the best players in the world the best players in the world like title players they're not gonna cheat because because you're gonna know it's them right like but sometimes magnus is paid to play you know like little events where he plays against viewers and so on so this was a game that magnus played against the 2100 and this person was cheating and this person was banned but what might surprise you is how this game went magnus started with a ready f5 and he played this gambit e4 this is called a deferred listen you can play e4 like this and then after d3 you have take take right this is a tricky little gambit but magnus does it this way so that he doesn't actually have to move his knight up to g5 and this gambit is quite good bishop d3 black plays d5 magnus now decides i'm gonna capture i'm gonna trade queens and i'm gonna play knight g5 looking to get to f7 and to e4 now is it better to lose a pawn or a rook it's better to lose a pod magnus plays knight c3 and actually refuses to capture the pawn on e4 because it's not going anywhere instead he is focusing on his development and if black plays h6 it's actually a complete waste of time because white was going to go here anyway in the future so you're only helping white so knight c3 black plays bishop f5 magnus develops and castles long and is very happy to see this now couple of things queens already got traded minor piece already got traded so even if black cheats every move it's gonna be very difficult to win the same way that the hikaru law like right it's just going to be more difficult because it's not a sharp position so this person with black just developed his pieces and brought his rook to the center which is the best move and magnus played f3 just a nice little stabilizing move for the center of the board black now played knight d4 with the intention of course to remove his isolated pawn to join that cluster and remove white's knight from the saturn magnus strong end game player brings this other rook and now let the fun begin king f7 best move top computer move by 2100 magnus plays rook d2 now h6 another top computer move disallowing white any access to the g5 square magnus plays knight f2 maybe trying to put this knight here and then play c3 black down plays bishop before completely preventing that now magnus plays the top engine move which is knight d3 and black traits so the computer wanted to trade the light squared bishop for that night now black plays knights the knight is so comfortable on that square of course any human here would like bring the rook or something no because if you brought the rook white would play bishop takes pawn takes rook takes king takes knight b5 hitting a couple of pawns and if c5 you can actually gobble and come back and if you don't play c5 like you play i don't know bishop d6 to counter attack then a g3 bishop e5 and you know white is slightly better according to the computer very slightly yeah so instead of that black completely removes the knight from the center of the board which is the top engine move just trades the rooks and now black trades the bishop for the night what why would you trade the bishop for the night well because you don't want the knight to go to e4 see if you just play king e6 the knight is very strong on e4 it's probably the best piece so the engine says nope we're gonna play a knight versus bishop position now i'm gonna play a5 taking some space now i'm gonna play rook b8 a very ugly move but it does the job now i'm gonna bring my king to the center magnus also brings his king now black plays g5 magnus slides this king over pawn to b6 stabilizing the queen side active king completely unafraid no respect for magnus and pawn to b3 rookie eight and now black is going to try to use his e pawn as a weapon all right he's going to try to either push it forward or play a move like knight d4 check like this so that if bishop d4 ed4 this rook is completely sealed off from the game and have to remove like c5 white is just lost because the rook is trapped which is really funny the rook is just completely trapped you can do this rookie three check king d2 i will just play something like h5 because after cd4 rook b3 so magnus is on the verge of actually losing a game to a 2100 but he doesn't in fact because he's magnus he's able to actually get the knight out of the way with a trick because of h4 and the knight is trapped the knight has actually galloped too far into the white position yeah the cheater does not take a free pawn but confidently backs out of the position magnus plays bishop f2 and then the cheater goes back rook d8 setting up a discovered attack on the king and after the move king e2 black lost on time so black lost on time in a 35 move strategic technical battle against magnus and was promptly banned pretty incredible that [music] magnus managed to hold even for so long but what really helped in this game i think is the fact that there was a stability to the position so it was a position where even if you cheat every move it's not a sharp game and magnus was actually able to stay calm and play a very stable structure and the problem is when you are stockfish like black was stockfish in this game you're basically playing the human equivalent you are playing the human races answer to stockfish which is magnus in a strategic technical game which yeah he managed to play maybe even better than an engine in a positional game now if this was sharp it would have been over but it wasn't so hopefully you enjoyed this video we never get to see a lot of cheaters playing a lot of grand masters again they're usually beating up 1500s or me and then they get banned but they very rarely make it to that level so that's all i have for you today i hope you enjoyed and i'll see you in the next video get out of here
