i i used to want to be a radio dj when i was little but now i'm a podcaster which is great because i don't have the voice to be a dj i and by the way being a dj from what i've heard from people who are djs it sounds like it's a terrible business so i'm very happy being a podcaster because it's more interesting than than than you know being a general purpose radio djs to me it's more interesting it's an easier business to be in there's no requirement that you have a great voice i sure as heck don't and most of the podcasts i listen to don't have people with good voices it doesn't matter and and i get to talk about really geeky things so i enjoy that but i'm already doing that and generally anything that i want to do you because i've had a terrible academic history it usually isn't things that require certifications and degrees and long schooling and everything else it's like well what can i do when i have a computer and i can make podcasts i can make apps i can write so that's stuff i do and i'm really happy doing it is there a job you think you would have been good at i like arguing with people sometimes so you might think lawyer but in reality i'd be a terrible lawyer because i would make a bunch of mistakes and i would i would i would miss a lot of things and so like i i would not be good at that i certainly could not do any kind of medical field thing because i'm not even close to you know meticulous and and a good student enough to to do that so not really no i occasionally think oh you know it'd be fun to like have a coffee shop and sell my coffee but then i don't want to work in a coffee shop so well i shouldn't own one so there's all sorts of things like that like i think i can i can talk myself out of almost any other job pretty easily would you be a good apple employee not even close why not be well first of all whatever you think of apple and their products at heart they are still a big company and i know i would not do well in a big company i just know i don't do well doing things i don't want to do being subservient to other people playing the politics game to try to get ahead i am terrible at all those things and so i know i would i would not get very far i would be miserable and i would probably be fired within a couple of years at most and and it just i would be terrible at that job because no matter again no matter what you think in order to do well at apple you have to do well in a big company because that's what it is because you're quite idealistic right and you know i you always want to change the world for the better you know or the technology world for the better surely the best way to change the technology world for the better would be on the inside you know if i was tim cook maybe i could make the kind of changes i want but if i let's say i went to go head the podcast team at apple what would that really mean i would be running a team that has to interact with the itunes store back end run the whole directory in addition so you have like these different departments you have to work with the server's team and then you have also the podcast app now is integrated into the os you don't you don't download it separately anymore it's right there in the os then you have to work on the release schedule of the os and so there's all these different pressures you'd have to deal with from within the reason why the podcast app is not what i want it to be is not because there's anybody bad managing it it's because the conditions that it has to deal with are not conducive to what i want and that's on a screen called nitpicky details every time i do things like this i think it's a risk and i think maybe it'll turn off some people and every time things work but no one really notices my job i look back on it kind of the way i look back on college it's like it's something it's a
