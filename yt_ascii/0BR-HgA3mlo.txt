i'm about to spend five thousand dollars in the next 300 seconds buying the most satisfying tech on the entire internet and then we're gonna test it so this machine can hold your pen and write for you with perfect accuracy yeah five a paint sprayer but one that apparently gives a perfect coat of paint every single time i'm getting tingles just thinking about using this what are you this is very elaborate the description says it flows upwards against gravity this i have to see i remember fidget spinners were a huge thing a few years ago i wonder what a 2022 fidget spinner looks like wow multi-dimensional let's get one of those we have animated spinners now this one's got so many moving parts i just want it in my hands right now why is this one like 50 okay it's luminous it's got listed here as one of the perks fidgeting can burn more calories throughout the day because you're moving more bit of a stretch if you ask me but my curiosity is peaked someone's made kind of like a fidget spinner within a fidget spinner that is a true 21st century product who made this and why i've had an idea satisfying magnetic gadgets it's always cool to see just how many products are out there a levitating plant okay i mean the levitation is cool it's more the fact that of all things that you could be levitating you picked a plant there's also just a levitating platform that we can put anything on killing me right now this company has built a clock that uses a levitating orb as its hand s 800 for a clock okay screw it let's try some satisfying kitchen gadgets i mean this would be fantastic for my health transformation yes yes that's what i need an apple corer that can get you perfect shaped slices every single time a corn scraper okay we need to get some more of these fruit peely thingies banana slicer my body is ready yeah boy okay this isn't cheap but i'm almost just visualizing this idea of spinning this wheel and getting perfectly cut vegetable slices coming out the other side i think we have to get it all right i think we've got our kitchen gadgets covered let's try god bedroom whoa hmm i did not think that one through so if you ever design a product of your own then this machine the form box it has the capacity to be able to duplicate it i can literally remember featuring this product in a video back when the only thing that existed was just a trailer of it but now it is real and we can buy it and test it automatic zen garden sandbar automatic is just how i like my zen it kind of looks like one of those things you could literally watch for hours waiting for it to finish the pattern it's on that's just giving me an idea i genuinely think the most satisfying thing i've ever experienced in my entire life is the dvd logo hitting the corner of the screen can we buy that dvd logo hits corner shopping you can buy a t-shirt with it on it's quite the same okay i'll figure out how to recreate that satisfaction by the time we get to the unboxing section of this video mark my words there's a 3d printer that can print chocolate in whatever shape you want yeah this has been my whole life on a similar note i've actually been drinking a lot more shakes recently with the whole trying to be healthy thing well instead of needing to shake your drink this thing uses a vortex inside of it to mix it i think it'll be rude not to buy that hand towels that are actually tiny little tablets until they make contact with water yeah i didn't quite know how i got here right i have never been so excited for the products to just be here right now it's been two months and i am ready to be satisfied i think i bought a bit too much tech so let's go from the cheapest satisfying gadgets to the most expensive to find out how much it actually costs to get that thrill starting with our kitchen gadgets so this is our corn thresher apple divider and our banana slicer okay fruit me it's corn beautiful little corn we've got here you know it would be quite funny as well as if you get like a cinematic shot of the corn and i'm like what a beautiful specimen okay let's do it oh it's so perfectly formed that was incredible that's a seven out of ten this might be the corniest video we've ever made let's get this bananas sliced it's about the least satisfying way to open a banana is fruit peeling an asmr category all right oh my god that's what it's gonna do to the banana through the guillotine are you ready here we go oh perfect slices wow easy eight here all right this might be the greatest apple product of all time oh i'd say that was probably more palpitation inducing than satisfying but it did work to be fair that is the quickest i've ever sliced an apple i'll give this one a six so these are a highly cost effective way to get your fix but i've heard that kinetic sand can do us one better so this is kind of like moist feeling sand that never dries out that was a great peel they've really nailed the unboxing experience okay so i've just put together some almost perfect looking shapes made of kinetic sand a sound okay pizza cutter is ah do you see how the sand almost has like a fluffy texture to it okay let's do something very strange here that was not what i expected at all it's like a really nice cake has anyone want a corn cookie a bit of a dilemma for this last pile do we grate it or do we put it through a garlic press all right screw it let's do both oh and it looks like some very gone off mozzarella let's just shove it in the garlic press see what happens this is what my training is leaded to oh god it just looks like droppings we've had our fun now the hand towel tablets i really like this bag kind of looks alarmingly like a bag of mints we've got some nice warm water oh my god it literally looks like a mint this has a high probability of being incredibly underwhelming but let's try it three two one oh wow that was so fast that did not disappoint i enjoyed that the fact that they've managed to get a towel that large into a tablet to that size that's actually a feat of engineering whoops oh that is insane but let's ramp this up with the fidget toys i generally think we spent over a hundred dollars on these spinners let's find out if it was worth it this thing is tiny i'm so excited about this one okay this one is heavy duty very odd i've got no idea how this one works that is a cool design right here's pendulum the way that this thing moves and catches light is actually mesmerizing okay i think i got it okay so it's kind of just like a normal spinner but a little bit more unpredictable six out of ten okay sonic time wait what he's too fast i'm starting to see sonic kind of he's still a blur i kind of thought this was going to be more like a flip book with the effect it creates ah i'll give that a bite okay this one can't be bad look how many mechanisms it's got ah that is amazing the pattern it creates continuously changes as the speed changes look how it catches the light easy eight don't really know what to do with you do you spin it ah oh that is nice it feels like an object you shouldn't be able to hold in your hands and then when you start spinning it it's a mess but it always seems to find some sort of equilibrium unexpectedly fun seven out of whoa okay so this is what we paid i want to say fifty dollars for it is very weighty and balanced i'll give it that something gonna happen when we spin it okay extremely smooth but not fifty dollars come on okay but at the very least apparently if you spin this one the other way around come closer you'll actually hear some music moving on you bought me something oh no oh no i hate it even worse in person i don't want to touch it that's so weird let's take it back okay special pen time very shiny finish and the really interesting thing about this pen is that when we click the button the entire structure of the pen changes i've got no idea how they managed to make it fold up so uniformly but now is stepping up because at forty dollars this is the vortex shaker water and protein powder this really doesn't look like it's going to do much but the company says that apparently the combination of the power of the motor inside of this base with the shape of this blade which actually looks shockingly like a stickman doing a deadlift is enough to create a vortex on the inside let's try it and find out okay wow that i did not expect you can see it's like a whirlpool this is so much more pleasant than using a shaker it's got like a gentle hum to it and nothing spills anywhere it's so clean okay let's try it one thing about that is that is incredibly smooth and that's apparently just the side effect of how this thing goes about mixing your drink man if that's a 40 satisfying gadget what's a 400 one gonna be like well we're gonna find out soon enough because we're already at a hundred dollars with this maglev platform so apparently this uses an electromagnet that's strong enough to not just levitate the platform but also whatever i put on the platform i actually have a very strange idea what if we try and put a spinning fidget spinner on a spinning levitating platform okay so i'm going to spin the platform clockwise and then i'm gonna spin the fidget spinner counterclockwise i think this will work huh oh my gosh that's crazy did you see that the levitating piece of chicken yeah don't eat from there oh and actually on the topic of levitation this machine can this almost feels like science fiction apparently levitate water we all know how magnets work this is probably the gadget i have the least confidence in oh my god he actually looks like he's traveling upwards had me for a second this might not be coming across perfectly on camera but quite an impressive site so obviously water can't actually be flowing upwards against gravity but the way it looks like it works is individual drops of water are falling at a constant rate from here down to here there's a really precise cone at the bottom that's stopping that water splashing and then at the same time there is a strobing light that's basically flashing on and off really really quickly and that makes it kind of like a really sneaky illusion where you're looking at one drop as it's falling but then when the lights go off and then they come back on again you're actually looking at a different drop that's above that drop without realizing it so it looks like the drop has traveled upwards genuinely hypnotic 8.5 out of 10. okay so you remember those fruit cutters from earlier right well this is basically the baller version of them and now that we've put it all together i can kind of see why so the way this works is you lift up the flap at the back and then you pull open the spring-loaded mechanism and that's when you drop the poor vegetable in such that when you let go of this spring-loaded mechanism it will push the vegetable towards the blades at the end this is actually so heartbreaking there's like a little piece of pepper sticking its way through knowing what's about to happen to it i don't want to be the one to do it oh my gosh each slice is so precise and thin i feel like i can see the cell walls in this it's also surprisingly smooth i just realized what we have to try kinetic sand this could be a match made in heaven i mean to listen out for the sound oh my gosh it's cutting off like a single layer of sand at a time you're either gonna love it or you're gonna hate it speaking of sand this might just be the most elaborate sand toy that i ever laid eyes on it's got a slightly cheap 3d printed in someone's garage kind of look to it which for 200 is not the dream anyways sand in turn the machine on and then the only thing left to do is to drop one of these ball bearings in there i'm assuming there's meant to be a magnet on the inside here right my bad there's another switch drop this in see what happens yes look it's like a shark under the sand it's kind of like what i imagine a pet rock would be like okay we'll come back at the end and see what it's done okay we've tested a lot of bleeding edge gadgets over the years we've seen shoes that allow you to physically feel music we've seen infinitely repeating dodecahedrons and working displays the thickness of a piece of paper but this airless paint sprayer right here is up there with one of the most exciting of all for me so let's just say you've moved into a new place you've left your garage door unlocked one night and you have some very friendly neighbors i realize how niche this scenario is oh jesus what am i doing i can basically fill this tank with clean white paint oh even that's so satisfying and then this base compartment can effectively suck out all the air and create a vacuum with that paint which means that when i spray from here it should come out as smooth and as quiet as can be this is a proper like industrial bit of kit pushing me well like it's almost gone back to just how the paper used to be and it's so smooth coming out this hose it's the same about that goggling box though it's such a smooth move even coat of paint 7 out of ten i cannot believe that an item like this actually exists and it actually got delivered to us this robot can write for you and i didn't realize i had to build it myself okay that only took us about five hours but it's fully assembled now so i'm just gonna hand it our weird crushed looking pen and then we pull up something called the inkscape software which lets us design any image we want to and then the robot can turn that image into a path that it needs to follow to make it i know the perfect test for this how perfect a circle can a robot draw go haha that was far better than i thought it was gonna do there's something very surreal about seeing that happen it's the fact that yes you can just print things in perfect circles but i have just seen this use a manual instrument and execute that in person i don't see how we can get more satisfying than that give it a nine just in case right this feels like a challenge i'm gonna pull up the same photo of my cat for both the robot and me to see also you can draw it better man vs machines do this is so intimidating not to worry i did art at school and i didn't fail does not look like a cat although i'm slightly concerned it's one of those drawings that's going to come together at the last minute and look incredible oh i just realized what it's doing the whole drawing is upside down and but that is actually incredible maybe i can beat it on speed the worst part of this is it's not just better than me it's also faster so that's what the axi draw robot did here's my cat i only have one thing left to say here it's a good day for humanity no that's you yeah right there he's more interested in the dvd screensaver 800 800 is the price of this clock it's not made of any spectacularly fancy materials it doesn't tell the time any more accurately than a normal clock but it does have one key differentiator it tells the time with a levitating hand this ball right here so we mount it on the wall i'm really enjoying this led ring around it and we basically set it so that right now it's counting minutes so one whole round is 60 seconds there's an accessory for this so you line that up with that dot and apparently you just slide that in oh my god wait the magnet's moving okay i was too ambitious we need to do it horizontally oh my we got it let me just mount it this is wild i feel like i'm inside of a harry potter movie it's even like rotating on the spot okay so check this out we can set the timer to one minute each second it moves along you can even see the led follow it around and the cool thing about this is that you can set one round of this clock to mean anything you want it to mean so it could count a week it could count a month it could count just towards a specific point in time in the future that you're looking forward to which is a feature i love a hundred dollars though i know time is money but this is something else getting to the very highest end gadgets now this is the miku formulas and it's been talked about on the internet as the pinnacle the literal climax for satisfaction seekers the idea being that let's say you've just designed a product of your own then you can place that product inside of it and use this to create a mold of it to efficiently recreate it as many times as you want i mean the outcome is cool and all but it's more the way that it goes about it that's the fun bit so our mouse right here is effectively sitting on a vacuum that's going to suck out all the air it's actually just a henry the hoover but you may do and then on top of that is a plastic sheet that is now being heated from a filament above and as soon as that gets to the right temperature we're going to bring that plastics down wow oh my god it's created a complete seal around that product that's the day when we get to actually print the mice as well how do we get the mouse out i do actually need my mouse back this is how i'm gonna use it from now on well the good news is that i can still move my mouse the slightly less good news is that i can no longer press buttons or scroll wheels but this is a video that just keeps giving if you asked a random person on the street to design their ideal piece of technology i imagine that a printer that can 3d print chocolate would be pretty high on the list so it comes with these really strange chocolate cigar looking things in the box which you basically shove up the nozzle at the bottom and then we just browse the various different folders of things we could potentially print and you can do chess pieces i love chess let's print a rook so it's moving both the nozzle and the tray underneath it to create the shape look how precise the square is this is my kind of machine and it's almost completely silent and here is our rook wow so it looks like it's had some trouble with the base of it but the rest of it is spot on it's so precisely crafted but this actually goes further because you can also add in your own sd card loaded with any 3d model you can find on the internet and apparently i can print that too so of course we're going to try a pokemon okay see if they can make a bulbasaur oh it's the inside of bulbasaur don't think i'd ever see that and you can tell this time right the machine's even got the base right i cannot wait to see this one eternity later yeah so basically we ran out of chocolate part way through printing that so we have a headless bulbasaur over here oh yeah a very very nice headless bulbasaur but then the cool part of this is that we've managed to print one bulbasaur in many many different sizes it's like a very weird semi-headless family i'll eat the biggest one the texture is so fun you can feel every single layer is built on the inside yeah it's something special there you go bulb is all for you cooking with moments of immense satisfaction i had another one the other day you might know that when i went to go see mr beast earlier this year he got me addicted to anime he showed me a series called death note on netflix which i finished beginning to end in a month and i'm currently looking for the next one to binge open to recommendations by the way also isn't it kind of insane how this is actually automatically spread out all the satin the problem is you can't find half of these shows on the uk version of netflix so imagine the feeling when i realized that i could use the surfshark vpn subscription that i already had and already used to encrypt my internet traffic and monitor my email address in real time for any data leaks to just swap my location to the united states to access the us version of netflix which did have those shows on it but the crazy part of it is that this whole surf shark package together is just 249 a month which split between the seven people i share it with is 36 cents so hit the link in the description and use the code boss and you'll get it not just for that 249 a month price but also three extra months for free on top of that fully refundable
