- yeah. - you just sunk my aircraft carrier. - now bailey only has one boat left. - my only one.
- see what you did to my aircraft carrier? i'm about to do that to you. - alpha, delta, we just gotta hit on b6. go ahead and sink that bad boy. - all right, yeah. thanks
for the air support. it's about time. how did we get that helicopter? that must have been expensive. - it's not ours. - okay, just don't go along with the skit. you too. - one, fire! oh! that's the sound of an aircraft
carrier that gets sunk. - all right, ethan. you just sank a ship. good job, good job.
- yes. - all right, bailey. what's your strategy? - b10. - ah.
- is that a hit? - it's a hit. - no, it's not. - it is a hit. stop cheating! - i'm undefeated, i'm undefeated. - all right, we got a hit on b10. - ethan, i think ethan's
actually getting mad. i'm nervous. i have to be in a room
with him eight hours a day. i'm never gonna live it down. - i'm mad, you're just
gonna destroy me anyways. - oh, he keeps his eyes... your eyes have been closed the whole time. - bailey, you hit my last ship. - this is do or die. - i know.
- 10 grand on the line. - i'm going with the hardy h6. - that's a hit.
- no way! - wait.
- i can still... - this is now a race against time, boys. - yes. - we just can't have misses. - h6, captain. h6. hit now, hurry. - fire! - yes, sir. - the shots are getting faster now. - i think it's coming down to the wire. one wrong move could cost you 10 grand. - ah. - $10,000 move. - all right, c10. - ah, it's a hit. - things are speeding up right now. - my turn, my turn. - go, ethan. this is your big moment. - h5. - that's a hit.
- yes! wow. - i could actually lose. - okay, wait, wait. look at this. - three, two, one, fire! whoo! i like the sound of that. - i literally have to be 100%. - your ship is sinking.
- no. d10. - d10, d10. that is a miss. - that is a miss.
- that is a miss. whoo! - how's it a miss? - it's a miss.
- it's a miss. - it's a miss.
- it is a miss. three, three, three. hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - it's my turn, ladies and gentlemen. i did tell you at the beginning, though, you don't have to tell the truth. - oh no. - h4. - that's a miss. - no! - a10, but that's a sink, but i got... - a10, that's a sink. no. - sink the ship, a10. two lives left, one life left. as you now know, ethan's been lying to you.
- ethan's been lying to me this whole time. - i know, that's why everyone
keeps getting so confused. whose turn is it? - i just blew one up. - all right. - ladies and gentlemen, h7. - that's a hit. - that is a hit. - h7. - it almost looks staged.
- it's so close. - one, fire! - oh, my... - that is the sound of your ships dying. - oh, my gosh, dude. - all right, guys. it comes down to this. what would you say? - bailey, how do you feel? how does this make you feel? - ethan's betrayed me. he's been lying this whole
time about one of his threes. and i don't know which one it is. so we each have one life left. - when it comes to war,
winning at any cost, that's how it is. - bailey, what did you say your odds are of getting it right? - i've got a 33% chance of
guessing. here, come here. it could be that, that or that. and i'm not sure what... - one-in-three chance
of you winning 10 grand. - mm-hmm. - you each have one heart left. it is bailey's turn. if bailey misses, you already
know where his last one is. bailey, one-in-three odds of winning. - i'm gonna go with j2. - j2 is a miss.
- oh! yeah! - ethan, ethan.
- whoo! - what are you shooting? get the camera here. ethan, what are you shooting? - i'm shooting h8. - that's a miss. - no, that is a lie. - h8. and that concludes bailey's... - yes! whoo! let's go. - let's go!
- let's go. - bailey. - all you have to do is cheat to win. - don't make me feel bad for this. - i'm proud of you. - after all we've been through. - hey, so you wanna go get some sushi? - yeah, let's do it.
- no. oh, you weren't even asking... i'll get some sushi too. maybe?
- no, you can't come. you're a loser. - as you guys know, i
