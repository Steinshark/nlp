hi everyone full andheri 40 i worked with a friend to create a splotch to a puzzle game where you draw lines to try bounce the balls into their gates as speedily as possible the original splotch is something i created a few years back for a mini ludum dare we both really liked the core mechanic of the game and wanted to take it further in the cm gem i began by creating the bouncing ball just with the unities built in 2d physics i added a trail renderer to it but was a bit disgusted by the way it looked when it intersected with itself i found a neat solution for this online though which is to take a simple transparent shader such as this one turn on zed writings that the shader writes to the depth buffer and then set a z-test to less these are the settings that are regular opaque shader users to ensure that objects in the foreground get drawn on top of objects in the background applied to the trail shader no more ugly overlapping i then turned to the core gameplay mechanic of drawing lines in the original lines were drawn in a raised freehand which was kind of neat but of course a bit of a nightmare to make minor adjustments to the bounce angle this time we decided to just use straight editable lines which made the game a lot easier to control and must open the possibility for much more intricate and interesting level designs this is what my friend liam was hard at work at as a baseline for the difficulty of the game i began by sketching out the first level which contained a single ball and an execute in designing this level i tried to make it clear that there's an easy but slow wood going over the top and then these more challenging alternate route for the first at times in later levels and one of the quickest route to be less obvious so introduced a pair of portals now the player has to consider which end to enter from as well as which ball to send through since the portals can only be used once when i had some different layouts and paper i began drawing them in photoshop once done and put them into unity as sprites and added a polygon collider sebastian a different element set up as prefabs so for example i could drag two bones to gates and akeem to the scene set up their colors and the level be ready to play after that i did lots of testing and tweaking to try get the difficulty right the aim was to make the game beatable in roughly half an hour but to leave room for optimizing 1/2 roots after the first playthrough while all this was going on i was trying to get the leaderboards up and running for my first entries i've used a free service called dream low but this time i wanted to try set it up myself i began by purchasing a domain from hostgator and creating a database there with columns for name and score while i'd never written any php before this gem with google as my guide it was relatively painless to set up a simple test system where i could submit and download entries from within unity later on i of course looked into protecting against sql injections and also added an id column which i set with a system in photogenic device identifier that way a person's score was tied to their device instead of a user name which of course might be shared by multiple people now there are obviously multiple ways one can go about uploading a fake score and the only way to convincingly protect against all of them would be to record where the player has placed their lines for a given level and then upload that data along with their score i could then have a special instance of the game running physics simulations on everyone's input to verify that their solutions actually work unfortunately since the physics ended up had not been fully deterministic i didn't want to risk rejecting legitimate entries and so had to drop that idea next up i created a simple menu with a level select screen leaderboards some basic options and instructions for the game's aesthetic we'd been toying with inverting the level colors from the original but at the last moment we decided to switch back to the white background and black foreground with this change my trail render was suddenly no longer showing up submission i were rapidly approaching i sort of panicked and threw on a simple under shader which of course got rid of the nice fade out at the end of the trail what i needed to do however was simply change the blend mode on this one line over here oh well you can look for two nice trails in splotch 3 in review i think the game's main shortcoming is the lack of determinism in the physics while testing the physics seems to behave perfectly and yet it will mess up every now and again during the game i haven't yet been able to pinpoint exactly what's going on here but i'll keep looking into it another glaring problem is the lack of an undo command before when you accidentally mess up one of your lines in spite of these problems though i think it's still a pretty fun game and i hope you'll give it a try and let us know what you think until next time cheers
