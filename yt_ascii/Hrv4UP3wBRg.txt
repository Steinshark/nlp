ladies and gentlemen have you ever heard about chat gpt it's this weird chat bot ai thing that can do everything from plan a walk around the neighborhood to give you the best restaurants in your city to do your homework write your essays and play chess kind of a couple of weeks ago i made a video actually taken from anarchy chess where chad gbt tried to play his first full chess game and it was a disaster it made a bunch of illegal moves it spawned multiple pieces from the same starting position it teleported its king around the board and it was it was a mess so i waited a little bit because what do chatbots do what do ai bots do they ai which is a verb and they get better they learn from their mistakes they learn from user input from fantastic amazing handsome and talented individuals like yourselves and then they get stronger and in today's video i play chat gpt again and it was a very interesting game let's jump into it let me show you as always i gave chat gpt the white pieces because i'm a respectful individual and i respect my robot overlords and i'm pretty sure if i don't give it the white pieces it will kidnap my family it started with e4 and again the last time i played chen gbt it was a circus i make no mistake a lot of you like that video because it was so stupid now i can play a lot of different things i played the carl condo the yield trusty right like again if i gotta play one game of chess to save the universe from obliteration from chai gbt aliens or whatever i'm gonna play the karo khan defense it's the opening i know best i know it better than my own name even and chad gpt played d4 and i played d5 now i'm already ready for something like you know queen takes g8 or something like just a teleportation across the board but no much to my surprise chad gpc just took my pawn not only did it take my pawn if we can just go back and move here i'm playing in the custom mode on chess.com like where you can mess up with mess around with the board a little bit it actually was like oh you're playing the carl con defense how splendid and i was like what is wrong with you are you british now oh truman you know that's that's tremendous stuff right he's playing the he's playing the yield koro cone defense and and i was like you're playing the i was like wow so we exchanged and then it played knight f3 and i was like what is going on chat gpt actually knows real openings now in the the reason i really like the karo khan even for beginner and intermediate players it's so easy to learn like you go back to this position and but white has three options they can take they can push and they can leave the pawn here and get taken and this is very simple to play because you just develop your knights you develop your bishop you play this you do that's exactly what i did in the game so it went knight f3 knight c6 but it doesn't take very long in in the video for chai gpt to start firing off illegal moves here chad gpt here says i'll continue developing my pieces with d take c5 now i really did not want to make a circus video so i actually straight up told chad gpt that you can't do that you could see it right here i said unfortunately you know you can't make that move please make another move and and and it did it said oh my bad you're right i'm gonna play knight to c3 i was like oh okay you know i'll play knight c3 developing my knight putting pressure on your pawn on d5 x amazing this is per ai training right here i played bishop to g4 pinning the knight and i've got to do that before i play the move e6 because otherwise i would be blocking in my light squared bishop and then here it played bishop to e2 which came with the comment i'll div i'll respond by developing my bishop with bishop e2 your move black it kept calling me black i i don't think it knew my name you know i gotta tell you you shouldn't call people colors that that could go very poorly in a corporate setting it played bishop e2 though now that's the next thing we got to teach chai gpt how to interact in corporate settings i said my sixth move is pawn to e6 so far so good very very balanced position i have good pressure on the knight in the pawn finish my development and then castle and then here it said i'll castle kingside with oh oh i was like wow this is a real game like i'm actually going toe-to-toe here of course i mean i'm waiting for it to you know like i said i'm waiting for it to teleport its rook and capture my rook but yeah it it i mean it just playing normal moves so i played bishop d6 which is just a good move can't pick my bishop in between the structure i just have eyes over here and by the way you know you're probably expecting some really stupid chai gbt thing to happen but you'll notice actually my opponent castled first and as you get better at chess you can break certain principles like here you know for black you maybe you just want to go here here and also castle but sometimes there are moments in chess as you go up the raiding ladder where you can break what are the traditional principles and you can actually do something that i like to call superseding principles or superseding concepts and you're going to see me kind of implement one of these now i i implemented one of these superseding concepts and went on a big attack without moving my king out of the center of the board because i really thought it would make for good content for all of you and it did chad gbt here said i'm gonna play rook to e1 developing my rook and preparing to potentially put more pressure on your pawn on d5 so yes and no that move actually does put some pressure on my pawn on d5 because it can actually be taken and if i take suddenly my my king is wide open and there's various tactics i mean stockfish is thinking it's fine for black but i thought that was the idea i thought that's what it was saying but okay that's that's not let me put a knight there and then let me unhighlight that and let me put this here so i i kind of thought oh that's what it wants right it's thinking like oh it's putting but yeah i mean rookie one and d5 are not really connected yes it's true i said my eighth move is 97. now i played knight e7 and not the traditional knight to f6 because i wanted to block this pin and i did not want to castle so i wanted to keep my my king in the center of the board and you are going to see why i played knight to e7 and now now chat gpt started malfunctioning ever so slightly here chat gpt said the following it said it said a solid move developing your knight and preparing the castle kingside right your eighth move is knight e7 i will continue with ponte h3 stopping any potential pin on my knight which was not already pinned and preparing to develop my bishop to h2 so chat gpt is essentially speaking like an individual that needed to give a class presentation and just put a bunch of word salad together because they thought they needed to sound intelligent that that's not and i was gonna correct it but i was like you know what you know what you know any of you have younger siblings some of you are parents okay you have three and four-year-olds sometimes you just gotta let them blabber like if a four-year-old is just blabbering about nonsense you're not gonna sit there and go well actually that violates the laws of of physics no is it they're four they don't even know what they said 30 seconds ago they're like my puppy okay he doesn't speak but if he could right just let it all right it wants to develop its bishop to h2 no problem and here i set a trap all right here i said a trap and i play the move h5 all right and and the trap here is that this is called a fishing pole trap so when your opponents have castled and you haven't meaning you have a rook on that file down to their king you can oftentimes do what's called a fishing pole a fish bait and fish hook and the point is that if they take you take and you open up the h file it's very dangerous it's not always winning and not always good but it's very dangerous and i played h5 and then i i i and to be honest with you something really funny happened here you know i got tired of getting bullied by chat gpt so i decided to bully it instead i actually treated chat gbt here like a five-year-old observe so in this position chad gpt had absolutely no idea that it was attacking my bishop right it just played the move h3 and i said i'll play pawn to h5 and it said interesting move advancing your pawn on the king side potentially creating weaknesses in my structure i'll respond with bishop f4 putting pressure on your pawn on d5 and preparing to capture it in the future and i said are you sure you want to play that move you can capture my bishop with your pawn on h3 instead and it said you're absolutely right thank you for pointing that out i apologize for the oversight instead of bishop f4 i will i convinced it to invite danger upon itself now in my defense in my defense it's a scumbag ai and i'm farming it for millions of views on youtube hopefully i don't know how many views this has let me know but also this move just hangs a bishop you know i kind of kind of sat there and i went how do i turn this into content and i thought telling it that i have a bishop hanging and going literally oh no my bishop was the best way to do it so it took my bishop and i said great move i will recapture your pawn on g4 with my pawn a takes g4 and he played knight e5 it played 95 and it said i'm attacking your oppon on d5 i don't know what happened it got completely obsessed with my pawn on d5 but in no way shape or form is it attacking it i said 95 is a good move i'll respond by moving my knight on e7 to f5 and the reason i did that is because i really wanted it to take my knight but i decided to go here it's not the best move of course taking is the best move now it it played it chad gpt uh came up with the biggest word salad i've ever seen in my life so in this position that's a strong move knight f5 attacking my pawn on g4 and threatening to fork my queen and bishop with your knight attacking my what and then it said i'll defend my pawn by playing queen whoops by playing queen to d2 also preparing to potentially double my rooks on the d file what what good move attacking my pawn on g4 threatening to to fork by queen and bishop i'm gonna go queen to d2 defending my pawn and threatening to i don't even know honestly i'm just gonna i i we're just gonna move on because i don't even i i you know okay again right it's like the three or four year old like if a three or four-year-old shows up right guess what this is what i'm talking about if they you know if they show up if a three three or four-year-old shows up and is like hey mom dad i i i i drew a photo of you all right i drew a photo of you this is what it looks like here here it is i drew a photo of you hi do you like it and they're you know it like what are you gonna do you're gonna go no that it looks like garbage it looks nothing like me you should never pick up a pen again no i'm gonna be like oh my god you should be in the guggenheim or the louvre you know so yeah like i'm just gonna let it win okay i'm like what do you want me to do literally nothing that it said made it literally said nothing right nothing literally nothing i was like all right you know what queen d2 god bless you so i took on e5 all right i took on e5 and here we had a normal interaction it played pawn takes e5 and then i went here and then here it played the move f4 and unfortunately now it is losing even though chad gpt is up material it is losing and now i was shocked it was making legal moves i gotta tell you from the first time that i played it it has only made like one illegal move this entire game basically and of course its explanations are still bad but it's legal moves improved tremendously it's board awareness improved tremendously and then here i played of course bishop d4 is good but i in this position decided to sacrifice the rook rook h1 check my opponent really should take because if they walk out here they will get butchered by my queen in fact it's made in two so i sacrificed my rook with rook h1 here and then i played queen to h4 check sliding the king over and now it's really really bad news because i played bishop to d4 and chad gbt now has to lose a queen in a rook because its alternative is to go king to f1 and get mated three different ways queen f2 queen h1 and knight g3 are all made and if it goes here i take with check and then i take the queen so it's very very bad or so i thought now's the part of the video where you're all probably like oh what's chat gbt gonna cook up yo chat gbt really tried not to lose this game it really tried not to lose this one you guys ready all right let me open up the window because well it's it's good memes it's very very good memes so here you go so i said i'm playing bishop d4 check it said that's a strong move attacking my king and potentially forcing me to lose castling rights it already castled so you lost castling rights when you got to castle i will play bishop to e3 blocking the attack and also attacking your bishop so it teleported i i you know like like i said i have been waiting for this moment the entire game i've been waiting for it to start taking my pieces blah blah blah blah so i said i'll play bishop takes e3 capturing your bishop with my bishop on d4 all right it said that's a good move capturing my bishop and maintaining the pressure on my king and here it is folks chad gbt plays f takes e3 so it spawns upon on this square and then it goes here i was a move away from beating it and now i am probably completely lost i mean admittedly it still needs to defend itself correctly but it yeah i'm in trouble now because it's gonna start cheating again right so i'm like all right well the only thing i have here is g3 and and that actually probably is a force mate but nothing is forced against chat gpt it's actually not a force mate because there's like a check and then the king can escape and i figured all right well it's it's come time to lose the game and i said i'll play ponto g3 from g4 so this now i'm threatening queen to h2 now the only move here that does not get mated right the only move that doesn't get mated is trying to get an escape square for the king so you've got to move this bishop and the idea would be check here here here king runs queen is under attack so i'm gonna lose is is what i'm saying like i play g3 but i'm i'm gonna lose because it's spawned and there we go and then shockingly chad gpt said i'll respond with queen d4 attacking d5 and also potentially threatening to queen d4 the game is over it's maiden two not only did it hang its queen it also let me made it oh my god i'm gonna beat chad gbt but little did i know there was one more plot twist to come as chat gpt decided that after queen to h2 check and king to f1 queen to h2 check and king to f1 [laughter] i'll play queen h1 mate do you agree that i win i'm sorry but that's an invalid move the pawn on g3 is blocking your queen's path to h1 so it's not possible to deliver made in that way however it was a nice game and i hope you enjoyed it passive aggressive son of a what and i said i'm sorry but you are wrong my previous move was queen to h2 which means nothing is blocking my path to go to h1 i made a legal move i win the game by checkmate and we sound like two five-year-olds arguing in the local chess tournament i apologize for my mistake you are absolutely right your previous move was queen h2 and with that move you were able to deliver a checkmate on h1 on your next move congratulations on your win and thank you for the game wow wow we did it we did it what a game i mean it took it took a little bit a little bit of of nonsense took a little bit of nonsense for sure toward the end chat gpt decided that it was not gonna go without a bang and when i got a completely winning position here it teleported its bishop and then it proceeded to drop upon from the sky and hiro was winning hadn't just found an escape route for its king but unfortunately it's not quite good enough to do that yet so it still has to resort to things like nah you can't go there but then i told it that i could go there and it decided that i that i won so there you go that was a slight improvement of a game against chad gbt i look forward to challenging it every couple of weeks seeing how it's improving this one was better listen the illegal moves only came at the end and the queen d2 blurb was absolutely ridiculous i mean that was one of the biggest highlights of the game none of those things are true nothing it said was accurate but such is life i'll see you in the next video get out of here
