hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the best engines the show where i say stuff about cool engines now behind me is the 2018 kia stinger gt which won an award in 2018 awards auto 10 best engines award for the 3.3 liter v6 twin turbo underneath the hood now this engine produces 365 horsepower at 6000 rpm and 376 pound-feet of torque from just 1300 rpm all the way to 4500 rpm kia claims the rear wheel drive stinger gt will hit 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds using launch control in my own testing without using launch control i was consistently getting under 5 seconds for 60 miles per hour now at this point i'm just going to put up a bunch of specifications on the screen if you're super interested in them you can pause the video and if you think they're not thrilling at all to look at well thankfully they are almost over having a look underneath the hood you'll notice the engine is tucked fairly far back within the engine bay you'll also notice there isn't a battery to be found up front here that's because the battery is located in the back of the car underneath the spare tire now checking out the engine's airflow we've got these dual air boxes one on each side pulling air from the front of the car it'll pass through that air filter then travel into the turbocharger where it is then collected together in the center here after coming out of each turbocharger joining up together passing up to the front of the car where it then travels through an air-to-air intercooler and then it comes back up travels through this throttle body right here into the intake manifold split between the cylinders then traveling through the exhaust portion of the turbocharger and then through dual exhausts through the back of the vehicle [music] okay so now let's get into some cool features of this engine starting with sodium filled exhaust valves and sodium filled exhaust valves are nothing all that new in fact they've been used in aircraft engines dating as far back as the 1920s but kia says that using sodium within the head of the valve as well as the stem of the valve is a first in a v6 engine in this kia stinger so qualifying statements like in a v6 don't make it sound all that cool of a record so to speak or you know innovation but it is a very cool technology nonetheless so why is this done well when you have an engine here you've got your intake valve and your exhaust valve the air that's coming in tends to cool that intake valve so you don't have to worry so much about the temperatures of the intake valve the exhaust valve of course however has exhaust passing by it all the time so that exhaust is heating up that valve and you have very little to cool it you simply have the valve guide itself where you've got liquid cooling through the cylinder head and so this exhaust valve the head of it starts to get really hot and the hotter that gets the more likely you are to run into pre-ignition or detonation problems where that exhaust valve causes you know a premature ignition of that air fuel mixture in there and so you of course don't want that to happen you want your exhaust valves to be cool that way you can maximize how much spark advance you have and maximize how much power you have and so you want your exhaust valves to be cool and so by putting sodium within it sodium is actually a pretty neat element here in that it has a low melting point but also a high boiling point and has a high thermal conductivity and a relatively high specific heat so what does all this mean well it means that as this engine starts to warm up the solid sodium will then liquefy it turns into a liquid and because it has a high specific heat it's able to pull in a decent amount of heat from that valve head now because it has a high thermal conductivity as this valve is moving up and down very quickly on splashing that sodium around as well as it could perhaps be boiling that sodium if it gets too hot and then the evaporation would come up as that sodium comes up into this hollow stem of the valve it transfers that heat very quickly because of that high thermal conductivity to the valve guide and so the valve guide of course cooled by the liquid cooling within the cylinder head and so overall if you're able to take the heat away from the head of the valve bring it into the stem and then pass it to the coolant that's traveling through the cylinder block then you can cool down this valve and so that's the idea with using sodium within it and according to some numbers that key was saying about this engine if you just have a solid valve you can see temperatures as high as 850 degrees c on the head of that valve if you have a hollow stem with some sodium in it you can get temps down as low as 700 degrees c and then if you do what they're doing where you also have a hollow head as well as a hollow stem where you have some sodium in there you can get temperatures down to as low as 650 degrees c and keep in mind that all of this is done in the exact same dimensions whether it's hollow or whether it is a solid valve okay the next first in a v6 record that kia claims on this engine is the ability to lock the camshafts midway through their cam phasing range and so they've increased the amount of cam phasing that the camshafts have on this engine both intake and exhaust where they have 85 degrees of range that they can phase that camshaft and change the timing of when those intake and exhaust valves open and so this is a neat idea the mid lock is done for startup they say it's a response thing on startup to have good response from these camshafts and then as you start to get into different loadings it will change the phasing of that camshaft depending on what you want so for example if you want power then it will make sure that that intake valve closes when you get to bottom dead center that means you get the maximum amount of air and fuel within that cylinder before you start your compression stroke now if you want efficiency you'll actually push out some of that air as the piston is on its way up and that reduces your compression ratio your effective compression ratio relative to your expansion ratio so it means the distance that the piston travels up to compress that air fuel ratio is less than that distance travels down and so the amount of useful work that you're able to get out of the fuel used is increased so you're going to make less power overall but you're going to get more power out of the amount of fuel that you used so your efficiency is increased your fuel economy is increased so if you're you know in a low load scenario if you're not pressing on the throttle too much it will change the cam phasing so that your intake valve closes a bit later to allow you to get better fuel economy now the last feature we're going to talk about is integrating the exhaust manifold within the cylinder head which is becoming a more popular trend in vehicles for the variety of advantages that this provides first of all it saves weight because you're getting rid of those cast iron exhaust manifolds and second of all it saves a lot of space by incorporating it within the cylinder head so from a packaging standpoint it's advantageous this also helps to heat up the catalytic converter faster and once the engine is up at operating temperature it helps to have cooler temperatures going through the catalytic converter which ultimately gives it longer life and while this does reduce the temperature of the exhaust going to the turbochargers the turbochargers are bolted right up to the cylinder head so there's a very short path for that exhaust to travel helping to spool up those turbos quickly so i hope you've enjoyed this video learning about the 3.3 liter v6 twin turbo in the kia stinger gt if you have any questions or comments please feel free to leave those below thanks for watching
