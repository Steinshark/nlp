[music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [music] [applause] hello friends welcome thank you all for coming for making time today to chat with jonathan pedro who has himself been so gracious as to make time to come to this exclusive interview about his wonderful new project god's dog i'm very excited to talk to you jonathan about this i had the pleasure of reading the entire thing or rather volume one beforehand and i read it in one big gulp so to speak couldn't put it down it was fantastic and this is even though it was on a computer screen which i hate i would much rather have it you know in paper form but still i gulped it up so i'm very happy to talk to you about it and welcome to our little zoom room inside nicholas kotar's patreon community thanks i know i appreciate you reaching out i'm really happy this is the first like discussion i'm gonna have publicly about it so i'm happy that this is perfect i win jonathan if you you don't need to be introduced to these people they are here to see you however i would like you to introduce yourself not as jonathan pajot but as jonathan pedro writer because this is a new manifestation of you as as person so tell us a little bit about jonathan pedro comma writer who is he who is he so it's funny that a long time ago i was more of a writer so when i was a young adult i guess starting around 1718 i was part of a theater group this like big christian theater group you know it was like like 50 people in like massive production and musical and stuff and so they asked me to write a play for them and which brought me to end up actually writing three plays so i wrote three plays for them it was like it was a musical plays with math and i also directed them so i kind of started in this weird slash theater world so that's where i developed let's say my writing but then i kind of gave it up for quite a while well writing i was writing mostly theory stuff and not writing fiction but i always knew that i would come back to it and then this idea came to me i think it it started around the first time i had the idea was probably in 2003 2002 2003 and so i really wanted to write it down but my life was so crazy and messy and so or i kind of asked my brother if you would do it with me and that's what we did we just kind of wrote it slowly in our spare time but for me this is like an opening i want to see how people react to this and how they like the story and if they do then i have a lot more storytelling that i would like to be involved in aha so you're presenting yourself to the masses and if the masses turn up their nose and say jonathan i don't want anymore of this you're going to be like i'm not going to read anymore i don't believe you well it's not that i it's just that i have so many things that i'm doing so at the same time so it's like i always have to decide what is most what is worth my attention you could say so people say jonathan no the your writing is not so good and your black project's not so good i'm like you know what i'm doing this icon carving thing the people seem to come i can just do that and i'll be fine all right fair enough fair enough so let's let's start talking a little bit about about the story so there's a lot going on in this in the story you say you say that you started to have the idea in 2002 2003 but this manifestation of it is clearly influenced by things that have been happening over the last year or two and there's a lot a lot to unpack you think so but no this is really what we wrote and we finished writing 10 years ago because we knew it's also because we knew what was coming in terms of of just world view and everything and so the fact that giants are now back on the menu let's say since this is just complete insane coincidence but we wrote what's there is what we wrote as a screenplay you know 10 years ago yeah wow because it it reads like an episode of of yes yeah it does it's one of the reasons why i was so excited about lord of spirits and so excited about father stephen's work it was because i was this is the stuff that i've been thinking about in terms of story form this is what i wanted to plunge into but i was always nervous to talk about some of the traditions because of how the book of enoch is was kind of suspicious but i just feel like father stephen has solved the book of enoch problem for everybody like now there's nothing weird about talking to talking about it like there's no there's no strangeness about the whole coupling of angels and and man it's just oh no it's just a ritual you know and it's it's like without it no big deal it's the big deal it doesn't it doesn't confound metaphysics like it doesn't create a strange rupture between you know the tradition where we understand the relationship between the invisible and the visible let's say okay so the the central conceit of everything is the garments of skin right so for those who may not have listened as much to your podcast as they should would you would you please expound on the idea what what are the garments of skin where do they come from what's the deal so the the i discovered kind of the idea of the garments of skin was when i read saint gregor of nissa and saint gregory nisa talks about the garments of skin that's something that you need to kind of get rid of you know these garments that are given to adam and eve really being our biological bodies in a way like the body of death you could say and so it includes the idea of the body of death but then it also includes pretty much everything that is added to the body in order to protect you and so this is paneotis nellis in his book deification in christ really goes into this in a really interesting way where he talks about all of civilization basically being versions of these garments of skin and so it's basically just anything added to human nature so it includes all technology all you know all medicine all weapons all of this is included in the concept of the garments of skin but then in the story form what it ends up being is something like the first relic that ever existed that is the first thing that was made so god makes these garments for adam and eve gives them to them and so now this this outer covering becomes the first object of in the history of humanity and so it has a kind of power that is the power of the border you could say the power the power of deciding what's on the inside and what's on the outside and so that's that's the conceit of the story this this garment has a kind of power to define inside and outside and so it gets transmitted from generation to generation so the this may sound this may seem like a like a simple question or maybe not a not a sufficiently well thought out one but i think i'm going to ask it for the people who are going to be embarrassed too are the garments of skin good or bad that's right they're both that's the whole idea of the garments of skin is that they are ambiguous and every time they bring something positive there's something negative in the outset and every time they bring something negative there's a way to turn it into positive and so that's really the the notion of the of technology or any human action really is something that's something like that it's a it's an outer action and so it has a death to it because it's it's kind of crystallized and it's outside you but then so it can become an idol or it can become a tool and and it just depends on how it's used and so that's why the garments in the story will move you move between the sides like go to the bad side go to the good side and people are fighting to keep the garments on their side let's say to be able to have the power to define the limit so then how would you answer somebody who says why are you calling it a relic then if relics are supposed to not simply be bearers of power and this is not an this is not a trivial question because the question of grace versus power is something that's very strong in contemporary storytelling and i'm sure you've noticed this you've talked about this a lot any sort of world that's built in a fantasy setting that involves divine powers most of the time is expressed by writers who are not christian as as a fairly pagan outlook a very pagan world view of humanity trying to either placate angry deities or kill them in in any way shape or form and the the traditional christian worldview then would look at relics and other objects of power so to speak to put it crudely not as manifestations of power for humanity to grab and then use for their benefit but rather artifacts of grace that can help one enter into a deeper reality so how does that work within the world of the story then well it actually tries to encompass both of what you said at the same time and so the idea is that the garments of skin are of grace that is we always we have to remember that god gave the garments of skin to adam as a gift they're not they're not part of the curse they're actually a way to to circumvent the curse yeah but in that but it's also a kind of roundabout right it's like god is giving adam and eve a roundabout to ultimately come back to the same place but that roundabout has certain consequences and those consequences are basically you know the the lineage of cain and the lineage of civilization which god is constantly covering constantly transforming so that's i think that's the way to understand it is really that god whatever action we pose even if it's fallen or if it's evil god can cover it and bring it back into glory so in a way it actually so the garments of skin ends up being both at the same time they end up being something like an evil power that can kind of act on the world and impose itself but then there's a way in which god can cover that and then make it participate in a more a more unif a real unity you could say so because none of that is going to be explored theoretically in this story it's just going to be a story about about the relic will will manifest itself in the narrative form like not in a theoretical form right you're not you're not writing propaganda you're writing a story yeah there are very little few explanations in this story they just it's just the story you just ditch his deal you just deal with it just deal the story so tell me is this a historical story is it a fantastical story what is it and this is also the same problem is that in a way we're trying to bridge we're trying to create something which is going to encompass both at the same time so it is definite so in a way you treat certain let's say biblical aspects or kind of traditional aspects as very take them very seriously and then on the other hand there's a very loose capacity we have to dive into the story and for example like there are certain characters which exist together which obviously are completely anachronistic like you saint george and saint simi in the style light did not exist at the same time we all put them in the story kind of to to create something which in which the same becomes like a type and becomes like a character and hopefully we i know it's tricky and i and i know some people are going to get angry at this like for sure but we hope that ultimately what's going to come out of it is going to be something like a surprise like if i tell you the impetus of what made us want to do made me want to do this you can maybe understand what it is i'm trying to do when when i started thinking about this this was right at the time when there were all these stories and movies coming out which were using christian imagery and christian mythology to destroy it right it was at the time of that movie i remember i don't know yeah stigmata constantine then a little later dan brown and da vinci code it was like we had a slew of these stories and images which were using the christian mythology to to basically destroy there was also there was also neil gaiman's season of miss which was earlier but there was something in that where he was using lucifer as a character and his hierarchy of heaven and earth but ultimately to really destroy the christian the christian worldview and so my conceit at first when i thought of the story i had this idea of like saint jordan saint christopher like a buddy story of two like warrior saints you know fighting monsters and i just saw it like i was like they could do like i thought of a really subversive hollywood type coming up with this idea and i and i thought it would be such a great idea for a subversive hollywood type and then it kept playing on me and i thought what if i did the opposite what if i put up a story that people think looks completely subversive yeah but that ultimately it's actually going to turn back towards a a truly kind of christian world view and so that's why there's going to be some trickiness to some of the elements that as people encounter it but hopefully they can trust enough to know that we're going towards a place well it it requires a kind of a historically accurate engagement with a geography that we've lost right geography is history and it is not history it's both right and they you're not it's not supposed to exist in some in two completely different and completely distinct spheres you're supposed to be comfortable with going in and out of it and even though the medieval mindset certainly would not have accepted a fantasy story they would have considered it to be a falsehood and considered it to be sinful still you have legends that were written during that time that are clearly historical and some of which are not even idiographical but they exist in this uneasy kind of tension with with the existing canon and also with the larger canon of scripture and and the writings of the holy fathers it's it's really it's strange it would be strange to a traditional christian from long ago to think about the gradations of truth that we talk about all the time like scriptures are the most true and then geography is a little less true the writings of the father they're they're most of the time are pretty true and then you have the legends those are like they're not true at all you should just no i mean they would they would never relate to it that way so you're trying to kind of push people back into that kind of way of seeing the world yeah and the story of saint christopher is the perfect place to push back into that because it has so much of that problem inside it like the problem of dog-headed men the problem of legends which appear in the 12th century the problem all these problems but that when you when you were able to kind of pull back a little bit and look at the story the the big story of saint christopher you realize that in a certain manner it's addressing the very question right the the it's addressing this border place like this place in between and so this is this is what our story is about the whole the whole way through even in its form like not just in its content but in the manner in which it's structured and the elements which are put inside of it yeah and so the discomfort that the the extremely right people are going to have is actually something they should probably lean into because it it breaks that comforting sense that we know everything already so we don't need to learn anymore because everything's already clear we've already been told everything that we need to know which is death yeah exactly yeah it's death exactly but but we're hoping that it'll be like my big hope is that if this is mostly get people excited about christian legends and realize how much fodder it is for storytelling and not just for those that want to destroy us like the you know those that want to destroy us have been diving into this all these legends and using them now why can't we and use them in a way that is that is more celebrate celebratory you could say yeah and that of course again and again this we're talking about the the medium of the story as opposed to the medium of straight up telling or or scripture or sermonizing that this this form of transmission of truth is one that for whatever reason we've abandoned by and large as a christian culture or that we've embraced in very limiting fashion so there the discomfort is not it's a historically contingent reality it's not something that christians would have necessarily subscribed to in ages past so let's talk about the giants what is it what is it about the giants that people keep coming back to why why has there been a resurgence in interest i want to present you a new series of graphic novels called god's dog god's dog is a very loose and epic exploration of the legend of the dog-headed warrior saint christopher one of the most surprising and peculiar traditions of the ancient medieval world it was written as a screenplay by myself and my brother metier over 10 years ago and the story was taken up and even recommended by script scouting agency it was requested by several hollywood studios but this story was of course too big too strange too surprising for hollywood and so now with all the control of its potential we bring you this groundbreaking story the full color is a series of graphic novels the story is set in a token style mythical version of the biblical world filled with hidden codes ancient relics angels giants dragons and populated with fictional virgins of mysterious monks warrior saints and more symbolism than you can imagine god's dog contains all the intensity and subtlety of our symbolic thinking the world class layouts and artwork of court nielsen all of this bound in a mysterious and powerful story arc which is available to all from wide-eyed ten-year-olds to the most seasoned of readers the entire story with all its action and complexity is already completely worked out and the first book is near completion now all we need to do is deliver it to you we're crowdfunding this because it is only the first step we've already been contacted by even international publishers for this but we want to knock this out of the park so that our artists can do this full time and deliver the oncoming books at a regular and steady pace under our control i myself will personally not be taking any profit from this first book but rather i want to use this to build what we need to tell this full epic with all its cosmic proportions so along with the graphic novel we are also producing a crowdfunding only add-on the secrets of god's dog source book a beautiful volume in which you will find my original drawings for more than 10 years ago an exploration of the symbolism of saint christopher and an exclusive text by mathieu pedro on the symbolism of the biblical samson this is the first thing that matthew has published since his groundbreaking book the language of creation so jump into the margins with us be part of this shift in storytelling where the end becomes the beginning and where the monster carries the king into a new world what is it about the giants that people keep coming back to why why has there been a resurgence in interest starting by the way with darren aronofsky right i mean that's that's kind of where the things started to show up in yeah yeah when the noah movie they're so so funny because we had this story that we were writing and then all these stories would pop up in a popular culture and we'd think okay we can't tell the story anymore it's being told you know and there are several examples and that was one when there when darynowski put his no movie out i wrote my brother and i said okay our story's finished we can't tell anymore but yeah you realize that's actually not how it works it doesn't work that way it was already completely written by the time the noah movie came out you know i think that there's something about our time that you know we feel like the like the clock is winding down let's say in a cert to a certain respect and there are many elements which are popping up in culture you know the obsession with hybrids the obsession with the obsession with also it's kind of fall into passions and has fallen to degeneracy and you know all these kind of wild desires that are let loose on the world there's that and then there's also this sense of a growing power right of a state power and a corporate power which is becoming so powerful that all of a sudden you you realize that you can't there's nothing to do in the shadow of this power and so that i think is that is let's say what's going on in the world mythologically is bringing back the image of these giants but not just the giants right also the hybrids and the monsters on the edge of the world in general but of course in christian terms in biblical terms those monsters that are on the edge they are the the giants but a lot of the images we see are all about these monsters on the edge of the world like even wonder woman as the you know and and the the amazons like all this imagery of amazonian women is very strong right now and so there's many many images of this of this going on i think that the giants are like the the christian one and it's actually probably gonna start to focus towards giants as this moves forward let's say i think that even in popular culture there will be more about giants so there will be more depictions of 15-foot tall hybridized human animal minotaur kind of things as being the main main thrust of of evil or maybe not of evil like for us we'll on our side yes but maybe not of evil rather maybe other than like other things yeah of enlightenment of of of something which is frightful but it which is inevitable there's going to be that type of of imagery i think so yeah that's real that's a really interesting thought yeah i'll i'll be interested to see how how that comes out and whether or not the sort of rising tide of storytellers amongst the christians will be able to in some way put that in the proper context and avoid it avoid popular culture being able to take those images and use them for their own means which is something that i hope will happen i hope that this that this is the continuation if not a beginning of a kind of movement of more proper storytelling a more old kind of rooted storytelling that didn't necessarily used to be in the modern sense limited to the christian i don't like to say that but that's how the world views it right this used to be just the way people thought right and so i would i would hope that that there's enough of a burgeoning movement that would allow us to start telling stories like this on a larger scale i certainly hope that's what's going to happen with this because this is not necessarily intended only for christian audience is it no not at all like there is there definitely be unapologetically christian elements in it but there won't be much of the type of moralizing or evangelizing or telling the story of of salvation or whatever it is that you usually find in kind of bad christian art there'll be nothing of that it's going to be a straight-up adventure story you know with stakes and arcs and giants you know it's like it all the characters have their arcs and all the you know it's just a story basically and we we submitted it to a script scouting agency at the outset that's how this kind of started we we wrote it we submitted a script scouting agency they gave us a few recommendations we fixed it up and then they ended up recommending it to the studios and the studios were requesting the the screenplay yeah and so it's like if if if hollywood studios are willing to request the screenplay obviously once they read it they're like yeah there's no way like at the end of it it's like a lord of the rings so it's like oh yeah i'm gonna have armies of giants like fighting byzantine soldiers like okay that's not that's not something we're gonna put you know 200 million dollars into so so if for us it was also a proof that that the story stands on its own like it's not just a christian story it can totally exist in a secular world i want to get back to the question of using sort of the traditional storytelling forms using dramatic arcs and things like this a little bit later because there's i think there's an interesting conversation to be had about that but first i wanted to address something when you're talking about the sort of emergence of of the giant the hybrid in in the popular consciousness this is something that struck me a lot lately the the convergence between transhuman transhumanist thought and christian thought in a strange way recently and that is that technology and the world that's that's coming into being right now web 3.0 the sort of internet of things the the extension of the virtual out into the real is something that people like kevin kelly and and you know people at google have been thinking about in the philosophical way for a long time and they see they seem to allow for the possibility some of these some of these people seem to allow for the possibility that there is an emergent consciousness coming into into all this and that technology itself is somehow a burgeoning consciousness that wants to express itself on the other hand so this is something that i find very interesting the emergence of alternate consciousnesses independent of human will on the other side you have a competing school of thought which is popular especially amongst men amongst christianity in that there is a cabal behind closed doors orchestrating this emergence do you which of those two sides do you find to be more compelling i will put my cards on table i think the idea that c.s lewis shows dramatically in that hideous strength which is exactly this the demonic taking advantage of the emergence of technology in ways that the creators did not anticipate i think that's a far more interesting and compelling vision of the world as opposed to the cabal that's hiding behind closed doors and orchestrating everything from above but what about you yeah well i think you could say yeah there's a cabal behind there's a demonic cabal like say it that way but there are demons that are and so the way that these things work is that everybody just works for their own advantages everybody has their own stakes and the stakes those stakes don't necessarily have to do with the with the demonic you know taking a body in the world and manifesting a god in reality yeah but but they they fall in line because all of those stakes are related to their passions related to greed related to power related to you know to having power over others and so it doesn't have to lay itself out as this super structured thing of people sitting in dark rooms like you said you know but nonetheless it it manifests itself through our passions and through everybody's desire to to get what they want and so but it so it is organized but it's not organized in the way that we would think it's organized through everybody's own interests but i think it's definitely something which is it's so it's so it's it's so interesting and disturbing and scary to feel like you know we're sitting in the book of enoch basically and we're kind of watching it happen and we're actually watching the birth of a new god or a new religion and everybody seems to think that that's like so many people seem to think that that's plausible even people that are secular that are yeah so it's a very scary and it's very scary and disturbing that's for sure yeah certainly i mean yeah neither one of those two possibilities is one that's particularly exciting exactly let's talk a little bit about this entertainment for the wider world right entertainment that's inspired by the christian vision that we hope is going to be something that doesn't merely entertain that doesn't merely provide for an escape constellation although those those things are important but also might provide a kind of door or window into individuals being able to experience reality at a deeper level at a more transcendent level recently there have been conversations or rather let's let's step back step back a bit what would be your answer to the ever-present question that i encounter all the time as orthodox people we shouldn't be wasting time writing fiction because fiction is a waste of time it's not it's taking it's taking you away from the things you should be doing which is the ever ever spiraling upward ascent in the spiritual life how can this possibly be something that you need what would be your answer to that well my answer would be that for whoever person said that you could say something like this this is not for you like i think it's wonderful that you that you have like that you spend all your attention praying and reading the lives of the saints like that's awesome it's actually wonderful and i would say like you know thank god that there are still people like that in in the world they're way too nice man that's not what i would say but but i think that you know if you say that just to someone like if i say that to you and then i go home and i stream netflix yeah we have a problem right we have a we have a problem and so i would say that it's it's to really understand it in terms of a ladder and in terms of the lower rungs of the ladder and i think that it's true that in a way fiction does not at all play the same role that liturgy that sacred music that the lives of the saints that icons play not at all they are quite they're much lower on the ladder there's something akin to the type of of fairy tales that people would hear in in their villages you know the type of epic poetry that you know that still existed until not that long ago you know bard would go around and sing these songs you know these have always existed the idea that this is that fictional stories and stories that are a little more that tug a little more at your passions you could say the idea that those didn't exist before and that this is a modern thing is completely false the problem is that is that things are lopsided and that we're obsessed with entertainment and that entertainment has replaced religion has replaced the things that ask most of our attention so i would say we need to if we want to help people come back we need to put things on the lower bars of the ladder so that people can see them and people can start to kind of climb back into a participative world that's my best answer to that that's i mean that's a great answer and i think something implicit in that is the is the acceptance and the humility that many of us don't have to recognize that we can't that we really can't jump over those lower rungs and immediately go up to the higher and to the higher ones to get the full appreciation of what iconography of what of what the depth of the poetic language of the hymnography is trying to tell us until we have a substratum of figurative syntax with which to be able to populate those realities john simmons yes you are mentioning st basil already dealt with this in his in his oration to young men we could talk about that but it's it's it's important it's important for not merely for those outside of the of the church but those within it because primarily because of this very uncomfortable reality that some people don't want to think about and that is that our hearts are very cold and they're not getting much warmer and the and the reality of death as it's come at us in covid has not tended by and large to soften our hearts it's tended to make them harder and it's tended to make the division stronger which suggests to me that we need more not less of the kind of heart softening things that stories give us because without a softened heart you could you could enter into a spiritual experience absolutely and then you will be one with the demons because they will delude you very very quickly because your heart is incapable of accepting the softness of grace and there there is an experience an intense experience of oneness with other that happens when you encounter any story when you're reading when you're when you're watching and that association of self with with other that empathic relationship is something by the way that we really don't have right now because we've been physically separated from other people and zoom doesn't provide it so for a lot of people the only thing they have is story and i'll tell you that you know the thing that i get emailed about the most of all the things that i do isn't my novels it's not my more kind of theologically oriented stuff it's the fairy tales that i tell or for ancient faith those are the things that tend to tend to resonate with people the most the simple eternal fairy tales so so i think yes i think this fits within that within that larger genre in a very in a very interesting way without you know it still pushes some boundaries which is important as well because any kind of creativity can't simply sit in the background and just and just be passive you have to you have to push people on towards something else and like i said from the beginning the the story itself this this story itself is a garment of skin and we are very much aware that that's what it is and it's not like we understand of the meta question of what the story is and so there is that's why it is going to be there is a suspicious aspect to it i don't know how else to say it like not in a bad way in the sense that there's a way in which it had for it to reach out into the world it has to have certain characteristics and if we're aware of them we we we can try to turn them more toward the inside but i was like i was really excited that greg hurwitz who is the he was like that's incredible incredible so he he read it and he was like yeah great and he like he like gave us a blurb and so it's like he's not at all a christian you know he's not in in any way so this is this is to me that gave me hope it's like okay this is what we're trying to do is is happening you know so i just hope people christians will get on board like won't you won't get actually annoyed that that that the other side is also thinking that it's an okay story yeah because sometimes we get very comfortable in in being separate separate from everybody it's much safer to be to be behind the the cloister walls back to this larger question of of the importance of dramatic entertainment i don't know if you saw this but there was a there was a rather involved conversation on facebook a while back or maybe about half a year ago where we're a rather famous orthodox personality i won't say who this person is i don't want to embarrass anybody but many of you may have seen this conversation on facebook so you may know who i'm talking about suggested that this this reinvigoration of the need for re-enchanting the cosmos is something that is overblown and is tends towards the passions rather than towards edification this person especially made the point that what ends up happening with these entertaining stories that are written according to the traditional arcs that tug at the emotional heart strings first and foremost not the spiritual ones tend to produce a an internal void of the kind that needs filling constantly so what ends up happening after you finish an exciting and dramatic story you want the sequel right so this she and so she this person then insisted that it would be better not to write stories of that kind but rather to focus on more human quiet non-fiction stories of encounter between the divine and the human kind of a very different kind of story if this person was sitting here with us right now what what would your addition to this conversation be i mean my my addition to the conversation would be that the stories we have from antiquity the ones that were preserved and the ones that were kept by christians and retold as a way to train the mind as to train people in understanding story arcs and story structures were very much of the kind maybe that she decries including all medieval legends arthurian legend you know the alexander romance there's so many there's so many to name they don't of course have exactly the same structure as ours because there has been changes but in terms of creating these these kind of cosmic stakes and the the these arcs of character they're all there in those ancient myths as well and also the fatal flaws and all of these types of structures are all there so i don't i don't think i agree i don't have a problem with the other the other part i think it's fine to have stories of encounters stories of people having spiritual experiences i think that those are useful as well but what we're trying to do is is a little more than that we're all we're trying also to poke through the poke through the bland materialism that has taken over culture you know since growing since the enlightenment we're trying to help people see the cosmic structure again and so when you when you listen to lord of spirits podcast you get that that's what they're trying to do they're trying to say this is all there in scripture this whole cosmic aspect this hierarchy of angels of of all these these these these demons and these angels fighting and these monsters and the below and the abyss and all of this is this is what this story is about we've just taped over it like we've tried to eliminate it and now because of that people are in love with star wars and in love with harry potter and love with all this other stuff so can't we poke through and help people see once again that this is our story like this is this is the the biblical story the christian story in which we live and it's there's a testimony to that not only in the biblical stories not only in the hagiography but the iconography the you know all these these icons that if you take the time to look at some of these icons you realize that that's the world that they're in you know when you see the eagles above and all of this is something that i we are hoping to kind of reinvigorate so i don't agree i definitely don't agree yeah i mean i'm i'm with you for obvious reasons but it's the the one thing that that that kind of argumentation tends to miss is that there's a garment of skin to be poked through is that most people have such a thick garment of skin so to speak when it comes to realistic stories even if they're non-fiction of human encounters with the divine that there is a huge activation energy that needs to be overcome before they're willing to even accept this as plausible in what in their version of flat reality and ironically by framing it in a more mythological and therefore more real they don't know this but we do in a more mythological fantastic however you want to call it setting you're allowing for the garments of skin to be to be stretched so thin that they're much more it's much more easy to poke through them and allow for the glimmerings of that reality to come to come in and then maybe afterwards they can be inspired by those stories because i mean how many flat flat materialists are are going to sit through a story of a conversion hardly anybody no you're right exactly right and and i think that it's also for me it's also that you know for years now i've been talking about this like i'm trying to explain it explain it explain and explain it but it seems like i also have to and i complain and i also complain about the quality of the story and so i also kind of have to make my own to prove to people that i take this seriously that i am also wanting to kind of be involved and to try to tell a better story so this is this definitely part of it as well like why we're trying to get this done well and and it's it's putting your money where your mouth is right and it's making it's there's a bit of vulnerability that needs to be exposed here because you know all stories are subject to the criticism of the masses that's right as soon as it's out there it's like this and that you know whatever i don't like this i don't like this somebody there'll be a bunch of other you know youtubers are going to be starting to start complaining about your stories now right that's right exactly so then what do you think do you think there's there's a way that we can limit that that knee-jerk reaction fill me with more drama fill me with more drama what is there some way that we can is there something that we can do with our stories that can limit that kind of reaction that we that we wouldn't want to see in our readers well i think at least like in my case what i'm hoping to do with this is to point people back to the traditions surprise people and say you know oh these what are these traditions talking about like what do you know is there really a saint mercurius is there really a saint george and what what's his story and and is it as wild as the one you're telling maybe not the same but it's pretty much as wild as the stories that i'm telling and so trying to get people back into that like one of the things that's going to happen you know as you've seen that the people who were watching this your patrons have seen in the preview that i've said we kind of set up this mythological old testament narrative but that's going to come back so like all through the the story you'll see all the old especially in genesis all the old testament characters kind of reappear as feeding into this mythological story and that's what we wanted too is for people to to get excited about these characters and go back and rediscover them in their original context so what's the what's the plan for the series then this is volume one how many volumes do you anticipate there being well we'll see that so this was a screenplay right so we we actually when we wrote it at first it was about three times the length of a screenplay because we didn't know what we were doing obviously and then when we finally whittled it down to the length of the screenplay there's so much that we had to cut out which is good because it gave us really a very purified way of telling the story and when you read even the first volume you'll feel that it's it's very streamlined and very kind of purified in terms of the the the narrative so that was great but there's all this other stuff and so the the decision the question i'm asking is if this is successful enough like if people really like it people really get involved in it one of the things i'm hoping to do is to reintegrate some of these streams that were clipped so to make it even more epic like a lot of the streams that are clipped were things that would make it even more into like a multi-arc epic story so so it really depends on how people like it and how people are willing to kind of get involved because the idea with this is you know the artist that that is working on the book we've been working on this for like three years wow but it's mostly because he's been doing it very much part-time and he has young kids and he has some health issues in his family so all this has kind of limited him so what what i'm hoping with this book is that we raise enough money so that he can quit his job and just do this full-time if that happens then i'm really hoping we can start putting books out you know like every six months or every eight months or whatever and then if and if that works then we could make this bigger you know and add a little multiverse like a poultry verse version of god's dog hey that's that's in the ether right now everybody's talking about multiverses that's right yeah well multi-cosmoses all right so tell us about the practical things how is this coming out how do you want people to act all right so the the it starts on october 31st we're starting on halloween the crowdfunding and if you've read the if you've read well actually no the people that won't you've read it you'll see you can see why like the first the first scenes of the story happened at during carnival and that's when the monster appears and so it's just a it was just perfect to start it on halloween and so it starts on halloween for two months and people can go to on indiegogo and there'll be different ways to support it obviously buying the book and then i'm also selling prints and signed prints for people who want to kind of be more involved and give more if we reach a certain amount like i think it's 50 000 then we're going to add another another book which is going to be called the secrets of god's dog which will have some articles about saint christopher that i've some that i've written some that i will write and a text by my brother he hasn't published anything since his book so it's great attacks on samson and the relationship between samson and the cherub and the flaming sword which i think people get excited about that cool and then some of my art that i drew at the ten years ago that people haven't seen so like with this extra book and then people can buy pages from the book as well so that's the like original pages so that'd be like the tried to get people who want to kind of support it at higher levels will have things that they can that they can get to and then ultimately we're hoping to put out a pdf of it as we reach also a certain level then people can can they be like ten dollars people can buy the pdf as well so those will be like the major the major ways that people can support it well and the good thing about indiegogo is that whatever you make you make it's not an all or nothing kind of platform so everybody who's listening and who are going to be listening to the recording of this later you needn't worry about this reaching a certain threshold which is the the one problem with kickstarter is that if you don't make it up to a certain level the whole thing kind of collapses so that's that's a good thing whatever you whatever we are managed to to scrounge up for for this project it's gonna be there but what i like about about the whole crowdfunding thing is that it's a it's a way of gathering a tribe together a a community so this is in some ways it's it's a pure form of contributing to the written word than buying stuff at amazon you're immediately it's it's a you know it's an unmediated experience in helping craftsmen and artisans get their work out it's more medieval isn't it yeah definitely yeah that's how it feels we wanted to just we also wanted to do it ourselves to stay in control of everything yeah because obviously once you start getting involved with editors you know they have their own opinions they have the marketing team they have all this and we feel like this story this is the story like this is the story we want to tell we feel like it's been proven in terms of having it read by enough people so we don't want it to be changed so this is the story we're telling that's why that's one of the reasons why we're doing it on our own i already had some editors some publishing companies write me and ask if we'd be interested to submit it or whatever but this is how we're doing it well no it's better the unfortunately the reality is now that if you don't if you don't skew to a certain cultural line you're not ever going to get it published and yeah this is the way to do it and i honestly hope and i think that this will happen and this is going to be the beginning of a bunch of different projects and as soon as this becomes as soon as people see how it can work i think this is going to be an avenue for a lot of creatives to start experimenting because it's a harsh taskmaster if you do a bad product nobody's going to buy it so this is a it's a it can be a humbling thing but it can also be a very exciting thing so i wish you a lot of luck and a lot of providence and i think i think it's going to do great thank you so much i appreciate it and thanks for the support and and all this it's it's great i'm happy to know that i have like i feel like i even have people like i have a team in a way it's not not directly but kind of an indirect team you know there's you in paul king's north and there's all the and and even rodriguez and there's people around that are like yeah jonathan go do it and i'm like so i feel like i'm being i have a i have a good good amount of people around me that so that i'm really grateful for that so thanks yeah absolutely you
