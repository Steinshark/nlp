whoa whoa it's like oh man eat over that touchdown right between the pipes it's time to celebrate with some tunes and some gaming combining two things you love should be a winning strategy and thanks to a recent comment our eyes have been opened to the combination of tech and supporting our favorite sports teams just look at all the branded headphones bluetooth speakers wireless chargers mice and keyboards that you can buy can buy should you buy them the short answer is no the long answer is no and a fascinating rabbit hole of outrageous markups skeezy sales tactics and outright false advertising and the deeper we went the clearer it became that someone needed to blow the whistle just like i'm gonna blow the whistle on our sponsor the ridge get rid of your old bulky wallet the ridge wallet will keep your pockets light and organized click the link below and use code linus to save 10 off your purchase and get free shipping i guess we'll kick things off with the kansas city chiefs logo wireless bluetooth gaming headphones and stand i hadn't actually seen the stand before we started the shoot this is truly unexceptional as for the headphones themselves they're not the worst that i've seen oh they do the same thing as the tommy hilfiger ones where you push on them and you can actually hear the driver's buckle we kick these over to the lab to test though and shockingly the frequency response curve is not that far off our target i gotta hear this it's kind of mind-blowing how good these look on paper yeah they're a little bass heavy but it's down in the sub base where it should add to the rumble of a bass guitar or a kick drum without making the overall sound boomier muddy i wouldn't describe them as having sparkly accurate highs but they're serviceable there's some weird electrical sounds when skipping forward and backward though even the boom mic is good though that's not to say that it's without bugs pc gamers will need to plug in this wimpy five foot extension cable in order to use the boom mic because it doesn't get detected it seems to be a design limitation though rather than a defect since the ps5 picks it up no problem console gamers will probably be pretty happy then because even if you have an xbox or a ps4 they include this separate little mini mic to plug into your controller how about pricing then check out the product page we'll just head over to nflshop.com easy enough to remember given they never shut up about it i wouldn't know anything about that if lgt stored ltt storage ltt storage hey lttstore.com eight bucks for personalization that's pretty reasonable though i don't know if i could say the same about the price in general a hundred dollars is a lot for these everything considered i mean fair enough it does have bold printed graphics so you can listen to the game day broadcast but there's some other pretty questionable stuff here 100 plastic that would be impressive if true and if these are made in the usa i will eat them they're supposed to be a label or a sticker yeah that's america right there that could be a legitimate problem for the nfl if anyone ever catches them and there's some other weird stuff here too some of the product labels make sense officially licensed gear customized items special event item pretty self-explanatory but others are kind of nebulous what's a manufacturer direct item and why doesn't the nfl run its own web store we're gonna get to that one in a bit first we notice that while the kc chiefs logo appears to be simply printed onto blank ear covers just because one team has a certain item available doesn't necessarily mean that your team will too in spite of how easily it apparently could though 50 that's not always a bad thing let's see what's up with these peripherals toronto raptors repping canada the bengals this is an interesting combination sound quality to you vinyl wrap that seems to be over top of what would be a mouse pad with a qi charging spot on it i gotta say with this textured partly glossy partly matte wrap on it though it would be a miracle if even a good mouse tracked on it never mind this one where are my dongles at oh there it is that okay black dongle for the keyboard oh yeah and a white dongle for the mouse that's actually kind of nice the labs test this yes shut up even though it's 2.4 gigahertz given its performance this thing might as well be bluetooth 37 milliseconds of average latency 50 milliseconds max i thought this might just be windows being unresponsive but this feels like a delay even opening the freaking start menu how about the mouse oh the mouse is no better 30 milliseconds average 45 max the mouse apparently has no rated dpi but what we do know is that it's less than 1200 because we would have needed that for mouse tester 1.4 by the way shout out our slash mouse review does the charging at least work oh i guess this is less about performance and more about repping the brand though should we at least look at the print quality seems like it's actually pretty good bold vibrant colors hold on a second hold on a second what do these keys do this is an f5 this is just f5 this just refreshes the web page that button's right here okay what's up and down i can forward in the browser i mean i guess if your crappy mouse doesn't have back and forward buttons on it all right do maternal time this mouse is so squishy that's the best way that i can describe it you know if you want to gain badly enough and you're at your sport fan uncle's house you'd find a way to make this work you'd be compensating for a lot of slop though both the accuracy and precision were again worse than the tommy hill figure set and that's not even when we're pushing it to the limit if you try to do a 360 no scope just whipping this around on the pad it completely loses its ability to track completely i am not even moving it that fast right now oh wow that's bad there's one more thing i'm curious about before it became a bengals mouse pad what was this okay i don't see it felt like it was just a vinyl wrap over and otherwise something product but actually it's just a vinyl wrap over a piece of cardboard there okay now there's a cheat coil and a small circuit board total bomb cost for this i'm guessing about two dollars and fifty cents how much did we pay for it 60 us dollars oh now i feel bad about destroying it anywho so these are garbage and you should only buy them if you want to punish your former bff who had a falling out with for supporting rival sports ball team club but there's a much more interesting takeaway here in spite of the spotty availability of nfl branded merch from team to team we are now running into duplicate items across entirely different sports leagues so who exactly is fanatics the group that evidently is running the nfl shop the site looks basically the same as the nfl one except that you can buy anything here according to this article from boardroom.tv they got into the sports gear game back in 1998 and have grown to the point where they claim to be worth more than all 32 nhl teams combined not only do these guys have deals with the four big sports leagues but they also deal in branded apparel for college sports motorsports golf wrestling the olympics and even esports to top it off pun intended last year they closed the deal to practically take over the sports trading card scene too now that we know where everything's coming from let's check out a couple more products as someone who's seen a lot of cheap knockoff earphones let me tell you if we hadn't bought these from an officially licensed store i would be pretty sure these are them look at the size of this receiver piece micro usb charging what year is it wow everything from the packaging to the looks to the comfort peak wish.com tier i can't believe i bought all this stuff oh that's a cute idea it's a bluetooth speaker in the shape of a puck it has a micro sd slot okay day testing one two three one two three testing testing one two three testing how do i skip the track one two three why would you want to skip that testing one two three one two three one two three well we'll give it a little while it should theoretically survive half an hour with an ip67 rating oh it actually survived half an hour once already impressive it's hard to tell with the song that i'm listening to i'm not super familiar with it but seems to sound kinda all right waterproofness aside then this stuff sucks too so what's the deal here while we don't know much about fnatic's corporate structure or their other dealings there are a lot of red flags here you need to click this tiny link to explicitly opt out of them selling your personal information their customer testimonials are few and read as though their vp of marketing wrote them and they use cringe high pressure sales tactics to drive you to purchase oh no this 65 percent off banner will surely disappear forever in just a few short hours whatsoever shall i do i'd say don't worry about it because a it'll be back and b it doesn't apply to winning teams or athletes player grade jerseys and headwear any brands that you would actually want to buy from or at fnatic zone discretion any other brand or product so basically it's an artificial discount on crappy stuff that they just applied astronomical markups to ahead of time or i guess their own branded products which is not fundamentally a problem as long as the quality is good oh their satisfaction guarantee says all the right reassuring things but nobody picked up when we called during business hours on a friday and the community response to their upcoming nhl uniform partnership deal has been unenthusiastic to say the least so it would appear that our experience wasn't unique but whatever the quality of fanatics products might be the ones we've actually been looking at today seem to come from someone else keyscaper you know how someone actually asked me why we don't do bluetooth headphones on lttstore.com this is why there are enough bluetooth headphones in the world oh my god there's another microsd slot also these are for kids oh no i'm about to find out how much we paid for these eighty dollars it doesn't say these are for kids some jerk wad product manager just didn't care enough to notice that these are way too small i wear a small size motorcycle helmet okay if it's small on me it's flippin tiny what i'm more interested in is this more advanced technology better and stronger materials more reasonable decision design i mean look i mean yeah you you can take whoa oh they cracked i wouldn't recommend that this is the cheapest genericist crap whoa they are light what the left one doesn't even work they even sound cheap when you drop them on the table and i could barely get it open i give up i can't get these paired but the reality of it is i'm not missing out on much and if i was really upset about it i could get the same experience for less keyscaper slash strategic manufacturing is plastered all over the manuals and the web pages for these products but thanks to the power of the internet we were able to find some not all but some of your favorite sports ball tech products for sale on sites like alibaba aliexpress and even amazon at much lower prices the headset that we looked at at the beginning 130 dollars with a sports team logo 1486 without one these earbuds 30 bucks with a logo two dollars without as for our bendy children's headphones 20 on amazon.com if you remember these were 80 from the official store now branding oem products like these is nothing new corsair's first power supply for example was basically a re-badged seasonic unit and believe it or not i do not have a water bottle factory in my basement but it takes a certain level of just plain not giving a crap to put your brand on such garbage i mean if we were talking hotel freebies sure but huge sports teams valued at billions of dollars it feels downright disrespectful to their fans especially given the prices i mean i don't know maybe some of it's okay we got more yeah oh god what year is it there's an aux in on it it's game on [music] it's a lot better than i expected i could get it onto that anyone else would you have a level up so here's the thing it's not my place to tell you what is or isn't okay to spend your money on if you want to rep your favorite teams by all means but at least consider an alternative way of going about it for the same price as this toronto raptor's mouse and keyboard why not a logitech g305 and a keychron mechanical keyboard or as an alternative to the kc chiefs headset how about these arctis nova 3s from steelseries they're better in every possible way and you can even still demonstrate fealty to your favorite billionaire team owner while you game because you'll have plenty of budget left over for enough stickers to deck out your entire setup we're gonna have this stuff and some similar suggestions linked down below but we do have a couple more things to check out apparently oh goodness yep it's the genericist car phone holder ever now with 100 more the logo of that craptastic team that takes up space in our downtown core sorry do i sound like an embittered former fan wasn't my intention to sound like one already become one okay yeah that'll actually hold pretty okay oh sorry charlotte hornets battery bank yep that's a micro usb battery bank seriously shut up they didn't even bother to properly license megsafe oh wow if you want to look like you bought your tampon sized airpods on aliexpress even the pairing message sounds horrible unlistenable how much are these 45 one and a half hours of play time secure comfort fit well well actually they stand okay why does all the stuff say 100 plastic that is not how that works and they all use the exact same copy pasted description so little effort man this whole experience was kind of soul draining i fully understand that companies need to make money you could certainly get a cheaper windbreaker than ours at costco.com the difference is that we go out of our way to make sure that the quality matches the higher sticker price and i just can't say the same about any of my experiences shopping with fanatics and with keyscaper unscrupulous companies like these hurt fans wallets and they hurt the image of the teams in the leagues the nfl makes a really big deal out of protecting the shield and honestly speaking from my point of view this is exactly the kind of manufactured garbage that they should be actively distancing themselves from rather than signing long-term partnerships with but hey maybe i'm misinterpreting maybe it's not about protecting their image or their fans maybe it's about protecting their bottom line speaking of bottom lines this is the bottom line of the script meaning it's time to segue to our sponsor micro center fact microcenter
