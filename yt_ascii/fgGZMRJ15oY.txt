without naming names can you tell the story of your struggle during your time at harvard maybe in a way that tells the bigger story of the struggle of young bright minds that are trying to come up with big bold ideas within the institutions that we're talking about you can start i mean in part it starts with coffee with a couple of croatians in the math department at mit and we used to talk about music and dance and math and physics and love and all this kind of stuff as eastern europeans love to and i ate it up and my friend gordana who was an instructor in the mit math department when i was a graduate student at harvard said to me and i'm probably gonna do a bad version of her accent there we go it will i see you tomorrow at the secret seminar and i said what secret seminar it don't joke i said i'm not used to this style of humor gordon she's getting the secret seminar that your adviser is running i said what are you talking about ha ha ha you know your advisor is running a secret seminar on this aspect i think it was like the chern-simons invariants i'm not sure what the topic was again but she gave me the room number and the time and she was like not cracking a smile i've never known her to make this kind of a joke and i thought this was crazy and i was trying to have an advisor i didn't want an advisor but people said you have to have one so i took one and i went to this room at like 15 minutes early and there was not a soul inside it it was outside of the math department and i was still in the same building the science center at harvard and i sat there and let five minutes go by i'll let seven minutes go by ten minutes go by there's nobody i thought okay so this was all an elaborate joke and then like three minutes to the hour this graduate student walks in and like sees me and does a double take and then i start to see the professors in geometry and topology start to file in and everybody's like very disconcerted that i'm in this room and finally the person who is supposed to be my advisor walks in to the seminar and sees me and goes white as a ghost and i realized that the secret seminar is true that the department is conducting a secret seminar on the exact topic that i'm interested in not telling me about it and that these are the reindeer games that the rudolph's of the department are not invited to and so then i realize okay i did not understand it there's a parallel department and that became the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which i came to understand that the game that i had been sold about publication about blind refereeing about openness and scientific transmission of information was all a lie i came to understand that at the very top there's a second system that's about closed closed meetings and private communications and agreements about citation and publication that the rest of us don't understand and that in large measure that is the thing that i won't submit to and so when you ask me questions like well why wouldn't you feel good about you know talking to your critics or why wouldn't you feel the answer is oh you don't know like if you stay in a nice hotel you don't realize that there is an entire second structure inside of that hotel where like there's usually a workers cafe in a resort complex that isn't available to the people who are staying in the hotel and then there are private hallways inside the same hotel that are parallel structures so that's what i found which was in essence just the way you can stay hotels your whole life and not realize that inside of every hotel is a second structure that you're not supposed to see is the guest there is a second structure inside of academics that behaves totally differently with respect to how people get dinged how people get their grants taken away how this person comes to have that thing named after them and by pretending that we're not running a parallel structure i have no patience for that way anymore so the i got a chance to see how the game how hard ball is really played at harvard and i'm now eager to play hardball back with the same people who played hardball with me let me ask two questions on this so one do you think it's possible so i call those people but that's the technical term do you think it's possible that that's just not the entire system but a part of the system a sort of that there's you can navigate you can swim in the waters and find the groups of people who do aspire to the guy who wrestled my phd was one of the people who filed in to the secret seminar right but are their pinterest training side of this right is he an well yes i was as a bad no but then i'm trying to make this point which is this isn't my failure to correctly map these people it's yours you have a simplification that isn't gonna work i think okay i was the wrong term i would say lacking of character and what would you have had these people do why did they do this why have a secret seminar i don't understand the exact dynamics of a secret samara but i think the right thing to do is to i mean to see individuals like you there might be a reason to have a secret seminar but they should detect that an individual like you a brilliant mind who's thinking about certain ideas could be damaged by this i don't think they see it that way the idea is we're going to sneak food to the children we want to survive yeah so that that's highly problematic and there should be people within that room and i'm trying to say this is the thing the ball can't is thrown back won't be caught the problem is they know that most of their children won't survive and they can't say that i see sorry to interrupt you mean that the the fact that the whole system is underfunded that they naturally have to pick favorites they live in a world which reached steady state at some level let's say you know in the early 70s and in that world before that time you have a professor like norman's steam rod and you'd have 20 children that his graduate students and all of them were going to be professors and all of them would want to have 20 children right so you start like taking higher and higher powers of 20 and you see that the system could not it's not just about money the system couldn't survive so the way it's supposed to work now is that we should shut down the vast majority of phd programs and we should let the small number of truly top places populate mostly teaching and research departments that aren't phd producing we don't want to do that because we use phd students as the labor force so the whole thing has to do with growth resources dishonesty and in that world you see all of these adaptations to a ruthless world where the key question is where we going to bury this huge number of bodies of people who don't work out so my problem was i wasn't interested in dying so you clearly highlight that there is aspects of the system that are broken but as an individual is your role to exit the system or just acknowledge it as a game and win it my role is to survive and thrive in the public eye in other words when you have an escapee of the system like yourself such as and that person says you know i wasn't exactly finished let me show you a bunch of stuff let me show you that the theory of telomeres never got reported properly let me show you that all of marginal economics is supposed to be redone with a different version of the differential calculus let me show you that you didn't understand the self dual yang-mills equations correctly in topology and physics because they're in fact much more broadly found and it's only the mutations that happen in special dimensions there are lots of things to say but this particular group of people like if you just take where are all the gen x and millennial university presidents all right okay they're all they're all in a holding pattern now where why in this story you know is it a of telomeres was it an older professor and a younger graduate student it's this issue of what would be called interference competition so for example orcas try to drown minke whales by covering their blowholes so that they suffocate because the the needed resource is air okay well what are the universities do they try to make sure that you can't be viable that you need them that you need their grants you need to be zinged with overhead charges or fringe rates or all of the games that the locals love to play well my point is ok what's the cost of this how many people died as a result of these interference competition games you know when you take somebody like douglas pressure who did green fluorescent protein and he drives the shuttle bus right because his grant runs out and he has to give away all of his research and all of that research gets a nobel prize and he gets to drive a shuttle bus for $35,000 a year what do you mean by die do you mean their career their dreams their holes they're there as an academic doug pressure was dead for a long period of time okay so as a person who's escaped the system yeah can't you at this because you also have in your mind a powerful theory that may turn out to be useful maybe not let's hope can't you also play the game enough like with the children so like publish and but also if you told me that this would work really what i want to do you see is i would love to revolutionize a field with an h index of zero like we have these proxies that count how many papers you've written how cited of the papers you've written all this is nonsense it's interesting at the aside what do you mean by a field with an h index is your totally new h index is count somehow how many papers have you gotten that gets so many citations yeah let's say h index undefined like for example i don't have an advisor for my phd but i have to have an advisor as far as something called the math genealogy project that tracks who advised who who advised whom right down the line so i am my own advisor which sets up a loop right how many students do i have an infinite number your descendents they don't want to have that story so i have to be i have to have formal advisor rowell bots and my wikipedia entry for example says that i was advised by raoul bot which is not true so you get fit into a system that says what we have to know what your h index is we have to know you know where are you a professor if you want to apply for a grant it makes all of these assumptions what i'm trying to do is to impart to show all of this is nonsense this is proxy bs that came up in the institutional setting and right now it's important for those of us who are still vital like elon it would be great to have ilan as a professor of physics and engineering yeah right it seems ridiculous to say but just as charlotte just as a shot in the arm yeah you know like be great to have you on at cal tech even one day a week yeah one day a month okay well why can't we be in there it's the same reason well why can't you be on the view why can't you be on bill martin we need to know what you're gonna do before we take you on the show on the show well i don't want to tell you what i'm going to do do you think you need to be able to dance the dance a little bit i can dance the dance floor to be on the view oh come on so you can't yeah you do i do that fine here's where it's the place that it goes south is there's like a set of questions that get you into this more adversarial stuff and you've in fact asks some of those more adversarial questions the setting and they're not things that are necessarily aggressive but there are things that are making assumptions right right well so when you make it i have a questions like you know lex are you avoiding your critics you know it's just like okay well why did you frame that that way or the next question would be it's like do you think that you should have a special exemption and that you should have the right to break rules and everyone else should have to follow them like that question i find enervating yeah it doesn't really come out of anything meaningful it's just like we feel we're supposed to ask that of the other person to show that we're not captured by their madness that's not the real question you want to ask me if you want to get really excited about this you want to ask do you think this thing is right yeah weird thing i do do you think that it's going to be immediately seen to be right i don't i think it's gonna it's gonna have an interesting fight and it's gonna have an interesting evolution and well what do you hope to do with it in non-physical terms oh gosh i hope it revolutionizes our relationship of well with people outside of the institutional framework and it reinforces into the institutional framework where we can do the most good to bring the institution's back to health you know it's like these are positive uplifting questions yeah if you had frank we'll check you wouldn't say frank let's be honest you have done very little with your life after the original huge show that you used to break under the physics seem like we weirdly asked people different questions based on how they sit down yeah that's very strange right but you have to understand that so here's the thing i get these days a large number of emails from people with the equivalent of a theory of everything for a gi yeah and i used my own radar bfbs radar to detect on unfairly perhaps whether they're full or not right because i love what you're where you're going with this by the way and mike my concern that i often think about is there's elements of brilliance and what people write to me and i and i'm trying to write now as you made it clear that's the kind of judgments and assumptions we make how am i supposed to deal with you who are not an outsider of the system and think about what you're doing because my radar saying you're not full of you know what i'm also not completely outside of the system that's right you've danced beautifully you've actually get got all the credibility that you're supposed to get all the nice little stamps of approval not all but a large enough amount you use i mean it's hard to put into words exactly why you sound whether your theory turns out to be good or not you sound like a special human being i appreciate that and thank you hey tina good night so but what am i supposed to do with that flood of emails for me aj why do i sound different i don't know and i would like to systemize that i don't know look you know when you're talking to people you very quickly consume eyes like am i claiming to be a physicist no i say it every turn i'm not a physicist right when i say to you when you say something about bundles you say well can you explain it differently i think you know i'm pushing around on this this area that lever over there i'm trying to find something that we can play with and engage and you know another thing is is that i'll say something at scale so if i was saying completely wrong things about bundles on the joe rogan program you don't think that we wouldn't hear a crushing chorus yes and it's actually you know same thing with geometric unity so i put up this this video from this oxford lecture i understand this not a standard lecture but you haven't heard you know the most brilliant people in the field said well this is obviously nonsense they don't know what to make of it yeah i'm gonna hide behind well he hasn't said enough to tale where's the paper and where's the paper i've seen the criticism yeah i've gotten the same kind of critters i've published a few things and like especially stuff related to tesla that we did studies and tesla vehicles and the kind of criticism i've gotten was showed that they're completely oh right like the guy who had elon musk on his program twice is gonna give us an accurate assessment yeah exactly exactly it's just very low-level like without actually ever addressing you know and the content you know like i think that in part you're trying to solve a puzzle that isn't really your puzzle i think you know that i'm sincere you don't know whether the theory is gonna work or not and you know that it's not coming out of somebody who's coming out of left field like the story makes sense there's enough that's new and creative and different in other aspects where you can check me that your real concern is are you really telling me that when you start breaking the rules you see the system for what it is and it's become really vicious and aggressive and the answer is yes and i had to break the rules in part because of learning issues because i came into this field you know with a totally different set of attributes my file just doesn't look like anybody else's remotely but as a result what that did is it showed me what is the system true to its own ideals or does it just follow these weird procedures and then when it when you take it off the rails it behaves terribly and that's really what my story i think does is it just says well he completely takes the system into new territory where it's not expecting to have to deal with somebody with these confusing sets of attributes and i think what he's telling us is he believes it behaves terribly now if you take somebody with perfect standardized tests and you know a winner of math competitions and you put them in a ph.d program they're probably going to be okay i'm not saying that the system you know breaks down for any everybody under all circumstances i'm saying when you present the system with a novel situation at the moment it will almost certainly break down with probability approaching 100% but to me the painful and the tragic thing is it sorry to bring out my motherly instinct but it feels like it's too much it could be too much of a burden to exist outside the system maybe by psychologically first of all i've got a podcast that i that's kind of like i've got amazing friends i have a life which has more interesting people passing through it than i know what to do with and they haven't managed to kill me off yet so so far so good you
