hey what's up guys i'm kim phd here so a pretty general theory i've had going for a while now is every product category that's well established enough has a go-to like an easy to recommend checks all the boxes safe bet straight shot right down the middle like if you want a mouse there's the logitech mx series that's been around if you want a microphone the shure sm7b is like the standard for phones it's like the iphone now this doesn't mean that this is the one for everyone in fact it usually isn't for everyone you use that as a sort of a starting point and then when you find the the values you have and the things you like then you veer off into the alternatives that you might pay more for but there's always that starting go to and so for wireless earbuds that aren't airpods the go-to is the samsung galaxy buds plus for sure 100 and they should be now that doesn't mean they're perfect that doesn't mean they're for everyone but they check all of the fundamental boxes that make them incredibly easy to recommend and enjoy they're pretty great so what's so great about these 150 dollar wireless earbuds well when you look at what you want from these they got to be small check they got to be lightweight check they got to fit in your ears and that's a check for me they do fit well in my ear comfortably thanks to the rubber tips unlike air pods and they actually create a sort of a passive seal now they're not active noise canceling but you know at this price you don't really see that that much but the seal is actually enough that i don't miss it that much and i realize everyone's ears are different so you know different people will have slightly different fits but i was really impressed with the fit of these earbuds and how snug they are in my ear now i'd personally still rather have an active noise cancellation version of these that's for my values and what i like like so if they made that like a pro version i'd be super cool with that but even just putting these in my ear i feel like i'm talking louder because they create that seal and dim down the environment and by the time you start playing music you don't really hear much else so for flying and mass transit and construction and loud stuff maybe this isn't the way to go but generally for everyday use pretty good so they're comfortable then they have a legitimate best in class 11 hour battery life for music listening which is mostly what i do with earbuds and that's great and fast charging but honestly being able to go a full week of casual listening and not having any battery anxiety till like the last day of the week is awesome and then speaking of charging the case these sit in are also pretty textbook you can't forget about the case it's small and slim it's just as pocketable and lightweight as airpods and it has usb type c for charging and it's also capable of wireless charging if you want to put it on the back of your phone or on any wireless charger it'll do that too and it even has a nice hinge weight and magnets for the lid to open and close with a satisfying click it's maybe not quite as satisfying as pixel buds but that's a pretty good click the buds are built well they have this sort of a rubber fin around the outside that helps them seat in your ear instead of like one little piece poking out that can get kind of painful and i found that this was enough to stay in my ears really well not quite as locked in as say the jaybirds with the full-on wingtips on those things but locked in enough that i felt comfortable working out in them it had no problems they stay in my ears and speaking of working out these are ipx2 rated so some sweat is fine now i still i would say they shouldn't be dedicated workout headphones like maybe power beats or anything ipx7 certified but if you wear them every day and you like happen to step out and sweat while wearing them or do a quick workout they are fine and then the touch controls are also really simple both earbuds have that pretty large touchpad surface and that's where you play pause that's where you fast forward accept calls long press first assistant all that stuff i've been using them with my oneplus 8 pro so they call google assistant not bixby but they work fine with any android phone or iphone for that matter but they do work a little bit better with a samsung phone because then you can get the galaxy buds app and that gives you a little more control over customizing media controls and ambient sound pass-through but generally even without that app they've been rock solid no connection issues even walking across the studio leaving my phone over here having them in my backpack no problem and then the sound from these guys was really quite good i was very impressed and happy with the sound from these they have what i would call a very full sound they have a big rich full bass crisp clean mids and highs no background hisss these are tuned by akg and they're proud to put their name on it and i can see why the only complaint i could see coming from a different pair of earbuds or headphones is these may actually feel a bit bass heavy if you're not used to all this but they can turn that down in the eq quite easily but i'll tell you right now i won't be doing that i listen to a lot of music and the way they sound out the box is great it's already great for music i think i'd go so far as to say these are the best sounding non-noise canceling wireless earbuds i've tried this is the truth right now honestly it makes me kind of wish i brought them out on the channel sooner i don't really have anything bad to say about these but i'm gonna nitpick because that's what you do and that's how you get products to be better the next time around i'm sure samsung was working on a next version of these so what i'll say is these don't really look that great to me i feel like they could do with a little bit better of a design i mean i guess almost none really look that great but to me pixel buds do look really good and i love the colors i wish airpods did colors too like this but i don't know for some reason it looks like it feels like cheap plastic to me i think maybe a matte finish that the more premium ones got going on looks better and i think that could have saved these a bit too but look galaxy buds plus it's the go-to just remember the name you know they the battery life i think is their best feature and that's a nice relaxing comfortable feature to have be really good but the sound is really good the fit in my ears is really good the microphones are pretty good and then the case is great just checks all the boxes so it's like now that you know about these you might decide oh okay what i know i like i want to spend more because i want noise cancellation and then you can go get active noise cancellation you spend a bit more and there's plenty of options for those like the sony is an airpods pro or you might go you know what i like these but i also want them to be more workout focused headphones then you go for something with better waterproofing or more of the wingtip fit in the ear stuff like the jay birds or powerbeats so there's other headphones that do plenty of things better than these but if there's anyone out there wondering what's the de facto set of non-air pods wireless earbuds there you go samsung galaxy buds plus now you know so there you have it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
