hello everyone and welcome in this video i'm going to use this five gallon bucket with an american flag on it to make you sad about v8 engines but first let's start off with some good news yamaha with the help of toyota has developed a hydrogen-powered v8 engine look at it look at that ridiculous exhaust it is glorious and it has no carbon emissions a clean v8 engine what is not to love so this engine has been developed using the 5-liter v8 engine from the lexus rcf and then modifying it to run on hydrogen and as you can see looking at the horsepower and torque it's actually very similar in numbers to the lexus rcf so very similar to the gasoline engine except now we're only using hydrogen as our fuel source meaning our emissions are water and we don't have to worry about carbon emissions at all a clean v8 engine so in order to understand and the problem here and get to our five gallon buckets let's first compare the lexus rcf to existing hydrogen-powered vehicles so we're going to use the toyota mirai which uses a fuel cell in order to power itself so the toyota mirai does have significantly less power and less torque that's fine we're not going to worry about that yet our lexus rcf has a fuel tank of 17.4 gallons and it gets a combined rating of 19 miles per gallon giving it a range of about 330 miles and it has a trunk of 10.1 cubic feet we'll get into why that trunk size is important in a moment the toyota mirai has 5.6 kilograms of hydrogen stored on board this is basically how we measure how much hydrogen you store in a vehicle because it's stored as a compressed gas rather than a liquid that you can simply measure in gallons so we have 5.6 kilograms of hydrogen that is within 142.2 liters of hydrogen storage tanks there's actually three tanks in in the toyota meringue andy gets a combined mpge rating of 65. so that gives it a range of about 357 miles and it has a 9.6 cubic foot trunk so as we look at these both of these technologies exist today obviously both of these technologies work all right let's dive straight into the problem so let's assume we're going to create a lexus rcf that instead of running on gasoline it runs on hydrogen so instead of putting gasoline in that 17.4 gallon tank we're going to fill it with hydrogen now the problem here is that hydrogen is at 10 000 psi but let's just assume we can safely use this 17.4 gallon tank and fill it with this hydrogen at 10 000 psi because we have that space available to use so we have that about 17.5 gallons about 66 liters and we want to figure out how much hydrogen can we store within this fuel tank so if we look at our toyota mirai we know that we have 5.6 kilograms of hydrogen within 142.2 liters so if we take that 5.6 divided by 142.2 that tells us how many kilograms of hydrogen we have per liter which is about .04 now if we have 66 liters of available space to store that hydrogen well that tells us we have 2.6 kilograms of hydrogen available to use okay so we know how much hydrogen we have but how far can that take us so an interesting thing about hydrogen is its energy content so one kilogram of hydrogen has about 33.3 kilowatt hours worth of energy in it now one gallon of gasoline has about 33.7 kilowatt hours of energy in it it is a rare example of metric and american units just having this beautiful compatibility here where one gallon of gas is the energy equivalency of about one kilogram of hydrogen okay on top of that hydrogen is also roughly equal in efficiency when used in a combustion engine as gasoline current studies show that it's slightly less efficient but theoretically they have similar potentials as far as efficiency is concerned so knowing that and because we know our lexus rcf gets 19 miles per gallon and a gallon is roughly equivalent to a kilogram and they have similar efficiencies well that means that this lexus rcf powered by hydrogen is going to get 19 miles per kilogram and 19 times 2.6 means our hydrogen lexus rcf has a range of only 50 miles and that is at the epa rating so meaning driving relatively lightly you know if you're going to actually put your foot down and have some fun you could easily cut that in half and only have 25 miles of range so when it comes to range the number everyone loves to talk about is 300 miles we want our cars to be able to travel 300 miles without stopping that's what we're used to with our gasoline cart so electric cars hydrogen cars whatever it is it needs to hit 300 miles so let's look using these buckets as a visual how much space is required in order to store enough hydrogen to have a v8 powered vehicle travel 300 miles so each one of these is five gallons we just calculated that with 17.5 gallons in other words three and a half of these buckets we can travel 50 miles so if we multiply that by six we get 300 miles so three and a half of these buckets times six gives us 21 buckets okay so let's see how much space 21 of these buckets takes up and keep in mind we're putting these inside of a hatchback with the rear seats folded down in other words a vehicle that has a lot of storage space this isn't a sports car with not a lot of space to store fuel or cargo and yes i did verify that these are in fact five gallon buckets they are just slightly larger but it's not enough that it dramatically affects the purpose of this demonstration keep in mind that the actual storage vessels are going to be bulkier than this in order to compensate for the extremely high pressure of the hydrogen inside okay so show me a sports car that you can fit this many five gallon buckets in it doesn't work but you might say jason this is disingenuous right the storage tanks aren't a bunch of individual buckets certainly you put it in a more efficient shape right okay hold that thought beautifully branded okay so show me a sports car that you can fit this inside of and keep in mind this is going to be a 10 000 psi so wherever it's located it needs to be sure that in the event of a car crash it's going to be kept safe oh and this is 95 gallons so we still need two more of these in order to get to 105 in order to have that 300 mile range so if we calculate the volume required in order to store enough hydrogen for this lexus rcf to travel 300 miles it is 14.1 cubic feet which as you can see is larger than the entire trunk of the rcf and that's not even considering that it needs to be a pressure vessel that's holding all this hydrogen there's not even enough space in the trunk to do it and then you don't even have a trunk now to further demonstrate how silly this is let's analyze an electric car and talk about how much volume it needs to travel 300 miles so we can do that by looking at an individual battery module at this point this is dated technology this is from the tesla model s and so we have about 16 liters required for one of these modules which gives you 5.2 kilowatt hours so you can do the math and find out that you need about 300 liters total in order to travel 300 miles significantly less than you would need with hydrogen and we're talking about a vehicle that has a thousand horsepower easily can hit 300 miles and although it is similar in size to a toyota mirai instead of only 10 cubic feet it has 25 cubic feet of storage now yes it's a hatchback so a bit of an advantage there but the point remaining that even a battery does a better job than hydrogen in this case of trying to get something to travel 300 miles and still be sporty okay so we need to be able to store all of this hydro in a smaller space so how about as a liquid well liquid hydrogen can store 75 percent more hydrogen in the same amount of space as gaseous hydrogen held at 10 000 psi so instead of 21 buckets we only need 12 buckets okay so clearly liquid hydrogen improves this quite a bit but it's still a ton of space that we're talking about here and there's an even bigger problem so if you want to store a lot of hydrogen at room temperature which is the temperature we drive around in well then you have to compress it into a really high pressure so you can squeeze a lot of hydrogen into a small space but you could have even more hydrogen if instead of a gas that hydrogen was a liquid which is possible you can have liquid hydrogen at atmospheric pressure if you're able to bring the temperature down low enough to minus 253 degrees celsius just 20 degrees warmer than absolute zero if you can get a liquid that cold if you can get hydrogen that cold it will condense into a liquid and improve its storage capacity by 75 percent you've got .071 kilograms per liter rather than 0.04 kilograms per liter now the challenge here is of course none of our garages are you know minus 253 degrees celsius but this has been done in fact bmw unveiled in 2006 the hydrogen 7 which ran on liquid hydrogen with liquid stored hydrogen so it had this really fancy storage tank which was able you know super well insulated so it could store this liquid hydrogen for a certain amount of time so after about 17 hours enough energy starts to seep into that liquid hydrogen tank that that hydrogen wants to start to boil so the pressure starts to increase right and so as that pressure increases of course you have to release it otherwise you're basically just you know building this bomb within your course you have to release that pressure and so after about 17 hours that's what the bmw hydrogen 7 does if it's just sitting there it starts venting out your fuel to the atmosphere and after about 10 to 12 days according to an article i found on wired on the subject that fuel is gone so all of your fuel if the car is just sitting there just escapes which there's a very interesting quote from bmw's press kit which says parking enclosed in spaces is currently not allowed in other words you cannot park this thing inside of your garage because it's just going to vent all of the fuel inside your garage now you don't actually have to worry too much i don't think about the fuel because they use a catalytic converter so that as that hydrogen is escaping it mixes it with oxygen and so you just have water being vented out but it's still a problem right you're going to fill your garage with the fuel from your tank that you paid for and now it's worthless and it's just all over your garage so they don't let you park it in a closed space and you cannot have a garage at minus 253 degrees celsius at least not yet or it would require a ton of energy in order to keep a garage that cold so your hydrogen doesn't escape so it doesn't really work out a liquid that's the challenge there so you can store hydrogen as a liquid you can store hydrogen as a compressed gas there's a reason why we do it that way today there are other ways of storing hydrogen it can be stored as a solid however i would urge some skepticism when you're reading about this kind of technology and storing hydrogen as a solid attached to other metals because there is an energy required to split hydrogen away from those other elements in order to then use it so when you're considering solid storage of hydrogen you must take into consideration how much energy does it take to break away that hydrogen in order to then use it within the vehicle and is that energy loss worth storing it that way in the first place so use some skepticism when looking at solid storage of hydrogen in okay so here's the sad news for combustion enthusiasts you could try to solve this incredibly difficult if not impossible problem that is hydrogen storage for combustion engines or you could use technology that exists today so here's how many buckets you would need if you were using a fuel cell and you wanted to travel 300 miles just six buckets and again this technology exists today so through the use of five gallon buckets we now understand that fuel cells are the best method for using hydrogen as a fuel source the problem is boring i mean i don't actually think fuel cells are that boring it's kind of exciting technology but they don't make any sound right it's basically just driving an electric car so if you're trying to appease enthusiasts by having this v8 engine running on hydrogen you know the disappointing fact is it has to pretty much be a fuel cell if it's going to have any reasonable range and this is not bringing in many other concerns that are related to hydrogen but i think could be technically solved the fact that hydrogen is about 15 dollars per kilogram today so imagine spending 15 per gallon safely storing it packaging getting it all within the vehicle at crazy high pressures without having any leaks you know that is a challenge so even if you can fit it all in there you also have to make sure that it is safe and these tanks are expensive as well so there are a lot of challenges but the biggest one simply being how much space it takes up if you're going to have an inefficient v8 engine that is powering the vehicle so thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments if feel free to leave them below and i will have some links to some other hydrogen related videos if you're interested in checking those out
