hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by pennzoil we are going to be talking about how to break in a new differential so this is the old original stock differential out of my s2000 and i swapped in a new differential with a different final drive ratio so changing the amount that these gears spin when this spins to a more aggressive ratio so that it could put down a bit more wheel torque in each gear now when you change over to some new components and you've got new components in your differential you want to make sure that those components last and so there are a few things that you want to keep in mind for about the first 500 miles which you're driving so first of all i mean the obvious thing is don't be super aggressive with it so you don't want to do hard launches. you don't want to do power shifts you don't want to do hard down shifts for about those first 500 miles you don't want to get super aggressive with it another thing to keep in mind is you don't want to travel super long distances for those first new miles on that differential so those metal components are trying to mesh together and find that perfect fit and in doing so they'll wear off some of the hot spots but it can create additional heat for those you know first 500 miles or so and so you want to keep your trips relatively shorter you know 15 20 miles or less or so? so that that differential doesn't get too hot so if it is wearing something down you don't just do it all in one run and get it too hot and then cause some permanent damage to the differential instead keep the trips a little bit shorter and that will allow that thing to wear and then if it starts to get hot you're stopped by that time and then you're wearing it down a little bit more as you continue driving later in the week etc whatever that may be the other thing to keep in mind is if it is a truck you may not want to do heavy towing or any towing for that matter for those first 500 miles if you can avoid it that way you're not putting too much heat into the differential not asking too much from it initially allow those components to wear down and find a good mesh and then worry about you know what you're gonna actually be using the vehicle for after those initial 500 miles now after those initial 500 miles you're gonna want to drain and change that oil out and one thing that can be useful is a magnetic drain plug and so this is actually the stock magnetic drain plug out of my s2000 some vehicles will come with it some vehicles may not but it's a good idea to get one of these which you can put on the bottom of the differential and that way any of those you know minor metal shavings that are coming off from that break-in they'll stick to this rather than continue to pass through the differential through the oil that's passing around it and you can see looking on this one you know there is like kind of a fine powder of metal that has kind of been grinded off from that break-in process this does have a little about 500 miles on it this oil so you can you can see you know that that metal has shaved off and you know that there was some wear occurring with that differential and that's normal that's normal to see but you don't want this metal to be passing around the gears you'd rather just trap it and get rid of it so you can use these magnetic drain plugs capture it clean this off and then put it back in and so you're good to go now. i am replacing the diff oil in mine with pennzoil platinum. this is a full synthetic axle oil which is api gl-5 and it has a limited-slip additive, so it can be used with limited slip differentials, and this is 75w-140 oil and the builder actually recommended going up a bit in the viscosity the stock differential calls for a straight 90 grade oil this is a 75w-140 and so why might you want to go up in grade? and if you're just using it as a daily driver, and you're not putting more power through it you've just got a new differential, and that's it you want to go with what's recommended but you know this differential the one put in the car has been built a little for a little bit more power and if you're going to be putting more power through it or for example you're taking it to trackdays, autocross days, things like that a thicker oil can help protect it more now it's going to cause you to get worse fuel economy, and it's not going to be as efficient but assuming you get good flow that thicker oil will allow for more protection and part of the reason behind that the logic of that is let's say you're putting a lot more power through that rear differential well that means you're putting more heat into that differential and so as you put more heat into the differential the oil of course gets hotter now the hotter and oil gets the lower its viscosity becomes so if you start using a thicker oil viscosity grade from the start it can get to higher temperatures and still act like the original oil grain at a lower temperature, and so that's why i'll be putting this in i am planning on putting more power in the car at some point in time and you know having some fun with the car and and when you're putting that additional heat through the differential you want to make sure it's protected so the builder recommends using this 75w-140 where you can get a bit more protection at those higher temperatures, assuming you're actually putting more power through it now again if you're just driving around town and not going long distances things like that not putting a huge demand on that differential the stock recommendation is certainly the way to go but i'm choosing to do this because i will have more power going through it and i do hope to have some fun with it eventually so a huge thank you to pennzoil for sponsoring this video and thank you guys all for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below.
