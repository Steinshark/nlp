- really? - wait, you actually gonna lay down? do it. - i might have to do it. - do it, man. i don't want to, but i might have to. listen-
- dude, the fact that you're having doubts, means you're not gonna get the dub, right? so, just save yourself time. - that's what i'm saying, it's like, think about it this way. there's gonna be people in
here when the sun is coming up. am i gonna be in here
when the sun's coming up? faze up baby? - yeah. - faze up. - i don't think that... - holy , i never felt better. - one more gone. - yep. - one faze member left. - all i'm gonna say, i didn't
expect to last 11 hours. so, i'm proud of myself all right. now, it's time for my prediction. you know what? i'm gonna go with leon. - whoa. he's choosing brute force. - i don't know. - faze rug actually has
a brain in his head. - and then there was eight, boys. how do you think they're
holding up over there? - dude, good.
- good. - they're doing good. they're doing good. surprisingly for 12 hours almost. - all right guys. it's time for your next set of weights. - woo! - let's do it. - bring it on. - here you go. - i'm ready. - but who do you think will win? - i mean, obviously i'm going for nordan. - yeah.
- 100%. - who do you think we'll win? - i think it's a tie
between nordan and jack. okay.
- do you think caspar stands a chance? - yeah. 100%.
- yeah? so, like coming fourth or fifth. nord, you doing good? - taking a nap. - need a hand bro? - isn't he? - do you think danny, surefire is gonna win? - he's not walk away. - yeah. how about you, craig?
- life is good. i'm feeling good boy, i'm feeling good.
- yeah? is joog feeling better? - i can't wait to watch the sun come up. - well, alex is just- - cut to the next one. - dude, alex though, i don't know what he's doin', but... - on the realest level, i don't think anyone was leaving
by morning, until morning. i think everyone's surviving the night. - two o'clock how you feeling, mr. warden? - i'm good. - are you? - yeah, you want a spanking? just kidding, that'd get me kicked out. i can't do that. not until i win. - supposed to be guarding the queen? - then i'll spank ya. - very unprofessional for
me to be guarding the queen, talking like that. - i think we're about to
hit bags, bars or bags. - i said it's not worth it. - all right, rain, rain. it's 2:30, go, go, go. - i'm so tired. - you've been here for so long, bro. - help me please. - no, i cannot. - i lost, i'm out - he stepped. he stepped out. - i stepped.
- go, go to bed. you stepped out. - and then there was... - no more faze. - that's it, faze are out. - so, we started with like
11 and four faze boys. so, now we have like
seven and no faze boys. - oh, dude, that's it bro. what's up with that? - let me see these bad boys. all right guys. so, the person in question
right here is joog. we weren't paying attention,
but we're watching the replay. that's a knee on the ground. all right. now, that actually we
watched some footage. i'll play it for all you boys. - can we see it? - yeah. - duh.
- oh, wow. - yeah. - oh man. - jack, jack. i don't think we there's
any way we can justify that. sorry, but you kinda did and
we kinda have to be fair. - can we let my competitors
vote, maybe, like? - you fought hard, man. it sucks as hell you had . - like that? like that? can i stay and hang out
with you guys anyway? - yeah, yeah. - i'll give you good plugin at least, i know it's not that big. - trying to go as long as i can, i thought that was the point, until you break. - you wanna update? 6:00 am, how you feel? - i feel great. this is crazy. i'm very excited. - how you feeling, mini? - i'm feeling good. i have way too much energy. - i was about say, this is- - it sounds like someone who's very slow. - no, i have way too much energy. it's like, concerning. - how you feeling? - great, how are you? - i'm doing great. - so, great. - how you feeling? - hey. hey guys. how are you? - how you doing man? - can i go again? - just kidding. i'm fine. did i scare you? - no.
- oh. - ask alex, how much it
would cost for him to leave? - alex, how much for you to leave now? - 100,000. - $100,000. - all right, guys. it's the morning. the sun has come up. danny, you have almost
survived a full 24 hours. how you feeling? - phenomenal. - alex, like always, is just staring off in the distance. i don't know what he's looking at. you're doing good? - i'm doing good, yeah.
- yeah? - enjoying it. - how about you, mini? - yo, my brain is numb. i can't feel anything
anymore, i'm chilling. - hey, yo, what's up, beast gang paulers. it's leon lush, future champion
of the circle, right now. we got six left coming up on 24 hours. i'm feeling pretty confident. - are you glad you dropped out? it's the next day. - dude, there's no way way, i'd still be here, dude. there's no way.
- dude, even your brother's not in it anymore. - i'm proud of you all, but it's the fact that
you're wasting your time just really makes me feel bad. so, anytime you guys are
ready, just let me know. cal, i'm- - you lot, keep chatting
the most about me. but i am still here. - well it's daytime again. - look, as i said, yeah, everyone keeps chatting the most. i don't really know what to say. - they don't want me to win. - so, i love you guys. - they don't believe i can win. - love all these guys. - but now that we're uppin'
the weights every hour, better watch out. - this has been the most difficult thing, i've ever done. it's gonna be good. - caspar, to be honest with
you, you've been doing amazing. like, everyone doubted you
from the very, very start. you've been absolutely
killing it honestly. - we all thought you
were a , but you're not. - i'm happy for you, seriously. - time for your next set. [music] wake me up [music] - here you go. danny. [music] wake me up buttercup baby [music] [music] never let me down [music] - you look good, bro, you look good. - i know, i feel good. - i believe you, i believe you. - i just don't want to... - i just can't be out here standing with . - i'm happy if they're happy. i want us all to go home happy, yeah. - all right, jack is coming back. - you guys are still here, all six of you. - morning. - i'm so proud. - did you sleep well? - no. - oh, well. - but i slept a little bit so... - more than they did. - i don't wanna put more on. - here's your weight. here's your more weight. - no, not again. - eat your vegetables. - happens every hour now. - so, just to clarify, they get two pounds every
hour instead of one pound, because things were taking too long. i just heard something,
was danny negotiating? how about you guys all get $1,000 and then danny gets the rest. - ooh. - and, leon gets the shout out. - i gotta think about that, okay. - you know what's gonna be sick though. - what? when i get 100,000, and no one gets . - all right, rice. it's exactly 24 hours in. what do you think? - look, man, i live here. i was just gonna go up here and tan. i still can't use the top of my house. - yeah. - i'm still annoyed by that but, caspar lee is still in there? okay. - i know, right? you think we should have made
this a $20,000 challenge? - yeah, because like, it's $100,000, so people are caring too much. they won't strike deals. they won't do anything. - too much incentive.
- yeah. - too much-
- you're right. - and the shout out.
- honestly you're right, next time i should do $200,000. - we can strike a deal. - all right, sign me up to to that. - okay. so, what do you think of this? - is this real? - yeah. - bro, i swear, it's real. - every hour, now, we're adding two pounds to the weight vest every hour. so, leon you having any regrets? - no, zero. and, i could go seven days and still lose and leave with nothing. i'd still be happy. wouldn't be as happy. - you're so sweet. - but you know, still i get
to be part of something nice. - there you go. guys, human nature says
you're supposed to be like, not doing this anymore. it's over a day. you guys all have weight on you. what are you doing? - $100,000, g. - $100,000? $100,000 does strange things to men. dude, look at mini he's
he's out of it, man. dan? alex, you doing good? - yeah, i'm doing fine. - callux? so, we're running outta weights. these are our last set of weights. after this, they'll all have 36 pounds and we'll have no more weights and yeah, just be first to sit or leave. just go from there. all right guys. all the weight has been distributed. alex? - yeah? - we brought you a present. - 26 1/2 hours just wasn't enough. - oh, can you actually drum or you just- - so drum set, huh? this is allowed? - alex requested it, and
we do what people want. [music] some of those that burn crosses [music] [music] are the same that work forces [music] [music] some of those that burn crosses [music] [music] are the same that work forces [music] [music] some of those that burn crosses [music] - all right, one more time for us. - there it goes. - not the drum set. - just like his brother. runs in my family. i'm gonna be honest. you guys are having a little
too much fun with that. we're gonna have to
restrain your drum access. who wants the first one,
the first four pounder. - thank you, fine sir. - all right guys, you just got four more pounds. we're all outta weight. so, you have exactly 40 pounds, 28-ish hours of no sleep. let's see which one sits down or steps out your fellow competitor,
nordan, came to say hi to you. - what's up homie? - how are you guys doing? - feeling good. - rain, do you miss it? the circle? - yeah. - are you getting dejavu? - you know what you can do with the cash? - does anyone have any cutlery
or do i find it over here? - i coulda got it for you, bro. - i needed a fork. what the . - he's outside the circle and then there was five. - okay, got some motivation for you all. - how do you feel dropping
all those weights? - i feel so good, man. - yeah, okay.
- i could have gone, but it's like, there's
too many people in here with a winning mentality for me. - yeah, that are just nuts. - they're actually psycho. so, i've had a good run. i'm out. - yep, dudes, it was fun. - thanks for inviting me. - thanks for coming man. now, you literally
could all split $20,000, if you wanted to. since callux left, we took all his weights and we're gonna distribute
it between them. - did you hear how i went out? i had to go get a fork. - okay, and that's how you went out. - yeah. - you disappointed him, rice? - well, not really. i didn't think he was gonna win. yo, how long is this video though? because it's been at
least like an hour, right? and, this is a long video. yo listen, man. drop a like, you already know. hurry up, so, i'm trying
to see what happens. - dude i need my house back.
- right? i'm trying to use the pool. - well, we'll return your house, one of these days. we were digging through our luggage and we actually have more weight. so, i guess, 48 pounds is the limit. we found some more weight. no joke, like, we actually have more. we can go back to adding more every hour. here's two more pounds. we're gonna do two
pounds every hour again. we'll do it every half hour. so, 4:30, you guys get another two pounds. so, approximately 30 hours in, cas, how you feeling? how all are you guys feeling, yeah? - yeah, i'm upset with my teammates. - yeah, 'cause they
don't wanna break a deal. - they don't wanna do deal.
- all right, let's go to the source of the problem. why don't you wanna break a deal? - i don't care about the shout out at all. i just wanted to win. - yeah, just for the pride. - i guess, yeah. i didn't wanna be a loser, today. - how does that make you guys feel? - it's understandable. - yeah, you just want the pride? the dub? - yeah, and a little bit of cash. - so, you guys are getting to something. alright. they're willing to give everyone $25,000. you don't want it? you want more? - i wanna play. - yeah, you wanna play?
- yeah. - all right, i knew you were crazy. this is your one chance to convince alex. like, you might be able to get it. so, you're here for $100,000 or nothing? - yeah, i'm here for my movie. - dude. four people are not gonna get anything. like, you could get 25. it's a safe play. - you're gonna make caspar cry. - alex, pick up your phone. it's ringing. - yeah, hello. - alex, this is is the sound of reason. - yeah. - i was wondering if you
were available for a chat. - no. - okay, thanks for talking. - all right guys. it's been another 30 minutes. it's time for more two pounds. you guys are now up to 52 pounds. you guys got a crowd over
here, cheering you on. - isn't it like a zoo? it's literally like a zoo and
you just like, observe them. - alex, alex, alex. - i'm gonna try my best,
i'll be here for a while, if i have to. if i win that $100,000, i'm making one of the
best movies of all time. - all right, guys. it's nighttime now. you gonna survive the night? - yeah, i'll be . yeah i'll be here in the morning. - how about you lee? - it is going to get very messy tonight. - how about you, caspar? are you doing good? - yeah, i'm very surprised,
i'm still here, so... - we all are. last but not least, how you doing al? - great, how you doing? - pretty good, actually. - i could sit here and i could ruin myself
for like, you know, months and months or i could bail out now, like, understand what i'm doing and give it someone who deserves it. so, that's the call. guys, i wish you all the best. i'ma go see a chi tonight and try and figure out
the is wrong with my back. - well, yeah, let's start stripping off this vest. - we got more weights for y'all now, - do you feel much better? now that, that's off? - no. no, i love it. - yeah, just... - appreciate it man.
- good luck, man. - it sucks because i'm like,
i feel fine like, mentally. honestly, i love you guys. this sucks a lot, but... - well, before you go... - what's up? - did you have fun? - i live for this kind of stuff. so, yo, thank you for bringing me on. may the best man win, guys. seriously, i love you all. all right, it's done. - oh, he stepped out. there we go. and now it's down to you four. wait, what do you think guys? - i just wanna win a little
bit of money, that's it. - leon, do you think you deserve the same as danny and alex? - absolutely. - oh, god, okay. 25, 25, danny, 20. what do you guys all think about that? anyone disagree with it? - we waited for 32 hours
because he was stubborn for the last 15 hours. as soon as i leave-
- that's how it goes man. - as soon as mini leaves- - go to the hospital. you guys are like, "yeah, let's all share
the money and get soup." - you guys all share. - we all share it. we all get shouted out. - so, the deal is, you
four each get $25,000 and then five-way shout out. put your hands in and
just make some noise. i don't know. - one, two, three, shake it on three! - there you go. - i wanted to leave. you guys are so sweet. - how do you feel? - i got $25,000-

- all right. - so, you guys must go subscribe, 'cause this is gonna fund his movie. like, go do it right now or
i'm gonna be very disappointed. - out the house now. everyone
out the house, it's over. - this video is one of my
favorite videos to film. you'd think, you know, because
all these guys are youtubers they'd have egos or you know, not get along or whatever, i don't know. i had a lot of fun talking to all of them. they're super chill. and, it was just a lot of fun. i was not expecting that everyone
was just really laid back. no one really had an ego or anything. i hope to do this again in the future. comment down below, if you're a youtuber and you're interested in
doing it in the future. and, i'll see you guys around.
