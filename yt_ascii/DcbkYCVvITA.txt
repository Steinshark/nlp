i've been waiting i've been watching i've been sitting on this evidence looking for you to welcome you to a very spooky month in the 10 million dollar studio we have a lot of spooky surprises for you in store including some of the dumbest investments that will horrify you and what better way to start than looking back at matt damon's immortal words which came out almost exactly a year from today near halloween fortune favors the brave foreign i've been asking myself is true does fortune favor the brave i mean let's be honest he does sound cool while saying it but then again everything sounds cool with cool music behind it it doesn't make it true like take this for example put the music behind it as i say this giant frogs do exist you see what i mean it sounds epic but clearly it's nonsense obviously giant frogs do not oh my gosh they actually exist i can't believe it i mean it's actually real maybe matt damon was right all alone oh it's just a cgi frog i'm sorry i'm sorry guys you guys know i don't respect cgi one bad i mean i feel like if you can't do it for real you might be a fraud and it's making me wonder whether matt damon was really standing in front of mars this whole time or not so the question does still remain is it true that fortune favors the brave well i've run the numbers and matt damon told' million people to get into crypto.com last year on october 28th and if you had jumped into the crypto.com crypto coin you'd be down 50 on that investment right now at the same time if you had chosen to get in the global crypto market at all you'd be down roughly 60 percent over the year even if you had mistaken this crypto ad for a job ad and applied to crypto.com you have still been screwed since a huge chunk of their workforce has now been let go with crypto.com reporting 5 layoffs inside sources then responded to that and said they lied it was much bigger and other reports suggest it was more like 30 to 40 percent of their workforce either way this sucks for anyone who's involved with crypto.com and is a pretty big fall from grace from that heroic swelling music of fortune favors the brave but i don't want to ignore the fact that nearly every market is hurting right now not just crypto with the famously stable s p 500 down 20 so let's not sugarcoat things fortune isn't really favoring anyone right now it's just hurting some people more than others so maybe the quote here is fortune hurts the brave the most in fact what i find so funny about this quote from matt damon isn't just that it's not true now or that it wasn't true when he said it it wasn't true even when it was first recorded remember that matt damon told us the origin of this quote with that epic music behind him the four simple words that have been whispered by the intrepid since the time of the romans well i actually looked up what he's referring to he's not a roman called pliny the younger who was writing about his uncle's adventures to get near a volcano eruption apparently everybody thought it was too dangerous and wanted to go back but his uncle was matt damon's ancestor or something and said fortune favors the brave and everyone thought that that was pretty cool so they sailed closer to the volcano and then the uncle died that's right the ending of the original story is that the uncle was quote overcome by sulfur fumes and died what a perfect encapsulation to this dumpster fire fortune doesn't just favor the brave sometimes fortune affixiates them horribly with sulfur fumes
