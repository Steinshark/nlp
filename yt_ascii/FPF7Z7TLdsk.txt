foreign [music] what on earth were they thinking when they built these cases not only are they hundreds of dollars each but the experience of using them ranges from kind of limited to downright awkward some of them take up a ton of room thanks to their unconventional shape it's free real estate and the dust this one might as well be an open-air test bench with all the gaps in the panels what do they think they're building a tesla we are about to dive deep into the weird side of pc building looking at five of the most ridiculous cases that you can mostly actually buy yes these are real products and this is my first time seeing them live and at the end i'm gonna pick one with your help that i will be live streaming a building which one will it be we've shown off the ship and the aircraft carrier in the past but now we've got the spaceship the tunnel and the tank oh geez what are you trying to do blow up my segway to our sponsor i fix it ifixit is celebrating their 20th anniversary and are giving away a free t-shirt with every purchase of a hundred dollars or more use the code fix it shirt at the checkout to claim yours using the link down below we're gonna start with the tank from lee kwang i don't know if that's how it's pronounced what i know is that it cost us 730 canadian dollars because it's in stock at amazon.ca but not.com sorry americans you'll have to settle for real tanks don't even think about it it's my hard-earned money this whole thing came packaged very nicely actually in a huge box with lots of protective foam to keep all these tempered glass panels safe and it fits most if not all motherboard standards all the way from itx to eatx with acceptable cooling on the front and rear it's surprisingly practical with decent front i o usb 3 a couple usb2s front audio and temperature sensor there's plenty of room for storage down here in the bottom it can accommodate up to four three and a half inch or two and a half inch drives and thanks to the three spots for 360 millimeter radiators we've got ample options for liquid cooling if the 175 millimeter cpu cooler height isn't tall enough for you there's even decent space for cable management underneath although you are probably going to want to order some custom length cables after taking some measurements because the positioning of the power supply relative to everything it needs to plug into is a little bit atypical the only major disappointment that any buyer should be aware of is that at roughly five hundred dollars it still didn't come with any fans whatsoever so you'll have to place two orders one for the tank case and one for only fans have you got it bookmarked yet i bet you do next up well you've seen the tri-stellar prepare yourself for the quad stower infinity this one is about 300 us dollars and is actually available on amazon although the two reviews for it are kind of negative it seems that a super cool feature the ability to control some of the mechanisms through bluetooth has been removed as a trade-off though we are now getting support for most motherboard form factors with this fourth wing as the board now kind of sits off in the like middle here taking up kind of two of the stellers i mean if it's a quad stellar then clearly this is a stellar right because that's the only thing that there are four of this thing is flipping huge and weighs just over 30 pounds with its all steel construction and massive partially tempered glass side panels it supports a max gpu length of 380 millimeters and multiple 360 millimeter rads and also has built-in rgb controlled by a three pin argb header instead of a controller so you can just pop that onto your motherboard easy peasy be warned though with six tempered glass side panels and sizable gaps along all of them this thing is going to be a major pain in the butt to clean like how are you even going to get in there it also doesn't come with any pre-installed fans and the i o is minuscule just a single usb c port and a mic slash headphone jack for headsets i do have to say though i am loving this front power button like this is not powering on the computer this is powering up the computer it's too bad that these are no longer powered though it's all manual now moving on if you ever found yourself wishing there were more cases that looked like stuff this might be the one meet the psychotep edi it is just screaming to be painted and built up with little miniatures and props to make the interior look like an actual cockpit it's going for a relatively speaking reasonable'5 canadian dollars on newegg.ca meaning it's actually within financial reach and unlike the two we just looked at this case comes with fans they're molex powered and certainly nothing special but it's got them this is also our first time being limited to an itx or micro atx motherboard for obvious size reason but it'll still fit a reasonable length gpu with 315 millimeters of clearance and you are not limited to an sfx power supply you can see down here in the bottom it can accommodate a full-sized atx power supply with space in the basement to stuff all your cabling our main gripes with this one are that the top lid here is in my opinion actually too heavily tinted and it doesn't open up on a hinge like an actual cockpit you could probably force it open but there are plastic clips that would probably break from use over time airflow also isn't the best those included fans are just 80 millimeter and there's nowhere else to put any fans even though there's plenty of other meshy openings but hey do you know what you're after it's the look of performance not necessarily actual performance right the vet true k2 or the tube as i like to call it is an itx or matx case with a big 200 millimeter rgb fan at the front it's got some honeycomb punch oats at the back and the bottom for airflow it can fit a three slot 330 millimeter gpu and up to a 155 millimeter tall cpu cooler i mean you can fit so much computer in this bad boy there's room for a 240 millimeter rad in the top where you'll find another mesh strip and you can see everything reasonably clearly through the tinted acrylic side panels our only real complaints about the tube is that the acrylic feels a little cheap and flimsy and one of our thumb screws actually sheared off probably during transit there's decent front i o though for usb and for headphones and you can fit a surprising amount of storage and cables in the box them you're okay k2 what the crap is that how is this so heavy these open-air sort of test bench designs have been pretty popular lately and the motif monument from yule beast designs is one of the cleanest and most sculpture-like options out there but elegance apparently comes with a steep price of 275 us dollars it is meant for an itx form factor motherboard and this is another one where we would strongly recommend buying custom cables for it pushing the price up even higher if you choose to save a few bucks you can hide a reasonable amount of cable mess between these panels here and on the subject of these panels we got the more expensive one that has support for a 240 millimeter radiator but it comes standard with this smaller back plate adding even more cost to a machine like this you're going to want all color coordinated and aesthetically pleasing components like this white power supply from lee and lee and this nice little tiny 2060 gpu but if you're the kind of person who doesn't care about that you can fit longer cards it just won't look nearly as cute you will be limited by the thickness of the card though good luck fitting an air-cooled 4090 on this thing would be like right up against the bottom and as for i o and storage options well there just isn't really any you plug things into the back of your computer and you plug in m.2 drives so i hope you're okay with that i do like the cute little power button but for the price i would have thought they could install it instead of me having to do it we got the white version but it comes in black or gray and you can choose the fastener colors as well and it's this thing there are many versions of this case but this one is ours the k1 pangolin style case from vet true you've probably seen something similar before like the antec torque or the cougar conquer but this one is much more affordable at about 170 us dollars pet owners be warned though this one might as well be an open air test bench because even with fans installed there are a ton of open seams all along the back of the motherboard tray all along the front of the case it's not like there's even any filters on these fans it is going to be a cat and dog hair nightmare aside from that though it's easily the most normal looking case we've seen so far which means that considering the mediocre build quality we had trouble aligning the standoffs for our second pane of tempered glass for example you're still not really getting a great value for your money here then again you're the kind of person who's going to pick out the prettiest components because you've got tempered glass on every side of your pc so what do you care about money or time because you'll spend many many hours cable managing it so good for you oh yeah and yet again it doesn't come with any fans finally we saved the best for last the case no no it's the thermaltake view 37 and we might have bought the very last one of these as they are no longer available we paid just shy of 300 canadian dollars for ours that is a lot of money for a case but when you're already spending hundreds of dollars on fittings and tubing for custom water cooling this case will probably seem worth it for wow factor the side panel unfortunately isn't glass but what it is is curved so that it covers the side and the top of the case so you can get a bird's eye view of whatever you put in there it's big but not unreasonably huge with support for just about any motherboard you'd want as well as three three and a half inch hard drives and fits up to a 420 millimeter rad in either the front or the side three sleds inside not enough for you this beast can hold up to four more three and a half inch drives on the back or eight two and a half inch ssds it also comes with a vertical gpu mount though the riser is not included but if you want a super cool rgb showcase that can support a big custom loop with plenty of storage options hey the view 37 might be for you and the best part look at that damn it i broke a nail man that hurts it comes with fans and look it also comes with this segway to our sponsor look look it's right there i fix it it might have been flawed but with that right to repair bill being passed in
