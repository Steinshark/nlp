welcome to a smartphone that regardless of whether you end up buying one is going to leave an impression on you for a device that starts at four hundred and seventy nine dollars i'm completely flawed but to start with in the box underneath the device itself you've got three compartments with one containing an' watt fast charger and another containing a usb type-c cable weighing in at 215 grams the weight is pretty much the first thing you're going to notice about this handset the device in question is the red magic three and one of the most striking things is this rear design you've got a fully customizable led strip and an angular metal body pretty significant departure from a typical flat glass device but they've done it for a reason it's made of metal to help that heat dissipate and the phone's grooves and its angular shape do help you to grip it if you're going to be gaming for a while in those two senses it's a big win although it now does protrude a lot more in your pocket and it's a criminal table wobbler because of it but okay this is cool the red magic three pairs liquid cooling with a physical fan so you actually have air traveling in through the back here being blown onto the phone by the fan and then leaving through the exhaust on the side according to the company this can keep the phone's cpu 16 degrees cooler that's like the difference between the temperature outside on a sunny day and the temperature of your fridge oh yeah and speaking of that cpu the phone is jacked in terms of specifications it's running these snapdragon 855 a 5000 milliamp hour battery and eight kicks of ram on the base model it's also got a really intriguing camera which i'll come to but what you'll probably notice before any of that is that this is easily the best display the company has ever used remember this phone is 479 dollars it kind of follows in the footsteps of the oneplus 7 pro it's a 90 hertz panel so is one of the only phones in the world that has this ultra smooth ui it's a 1080p hd r amoled display and at 6.65 inches it is massive which makes the phone even more massive because it's paired with some fairly sizable bezels it's worth pointing out though that the bezels are a huge improvement over the last red magic phone and also that a lot of gamers actually seem to like some bezel because it prevents you accident touching your screen the panel itself is good it does crush the blacks a little bit compared to the galaxy s tens there's room for improvement but it's far more competitive than past iterations i was kind of impressed by the software the company haven't really added loads to the stock android 9 it's running on but each feature does feel carefully constructed you've got these air triggers that can be matched to replace almost any on-screen control and they're pretty easy to feel for unsurprisingly responsive for capacitive buttons there's a 4d shock feature which makes the phone automatically vibrate every time you get attacked in games although this does only work in a few and to be honest the haptic engine in this phone isn't great you'll primarily notice this when you're typing i still don't really like these stock icons and the stock wallpapers that come with the phone but changing all that is a five-minute job and more importantly at its core this is a blower free android experience the other thing though which i really do like is the gaming space you actually get a physical toggle that takes you there and it's a space where you can just focus on your games you have fine control over the fan speed which is still a massive novelty to me you can control whether or not you want notifications to reach you what you're playing and you can screen record the games to share later oh yeah and audio is covered too as well as the software which can give you virtual 7.1 surround sound the hardware itself is really good you've got a proper dual front firing speakers system which is kind of a rarity with all these bezel as smartphones and a headphone jack let's talk about the camera for a second for a firm that already does so much at such a good price you kind of come in expecting nothing and yeah it's a single camera so you miss out on ultra wide and optical zoom shots but the core camera experience is really rather good you've got a 48 megapixel camera powered by the same imx 586 as the wampus 7 pro and this phone can record 8k video as well as slow-motion at just under 2,000 frames per second twice as slow as the market-leading 960 now there are a few caveats to this as well as both features being in beta at the 8k video is only at 15 frames per second whereas i'd say the lower limit to what counts as usable is about 24 the said if you lean the phone against an object and slightly speed up the footage it's pretty usable and of course mega sharp although a phone sensor is not really big enough right now to take proper high quality 8k video this still gives you a lot of room to crop into the photo quality is pretty decent too it handles dynamic range and even low-light reasonably well and whilst the camera ui isn't as polished as with some of its competitors i was almost always happy with the end result oh yeah and worth mentioning is that there's a gaming port presumably for third-party accessories and a fingerprint scanner on the back here really easy to feel for but it just doesn't quite feel like the right shape for a finger it is fast though the magic 3 has no ip rating or support for wireless charging but those two seem like pretty fair emissions considering what you do get here i gotta say this myth here at smartphone market is really heating up and i couldn't be more excited about it if you enjoyed this video a sub would be massively appreciated my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss i don't catch you in the next one [music] you
