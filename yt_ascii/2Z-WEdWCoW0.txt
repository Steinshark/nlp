we all thought the galaxy s10 camera was pretty great but today i'm taking it up to a whole other level this is going to be smartphone videography like you might have never seen before so this package is saying here is from a company called beast creek i reached out to them about a couple of months ago saying that i wanted to build the most powerful smartphone camera ever this is what they sent over you've got the beast cage which is this giant metal enclosure that allows you to mount lenses directly onto your smartphone and then a whole bunch of smaller smartphone lenses which surprised me in terms of build quality but that's not the main event here there are piles of really high quality camera gear here but the most exciting and the most central part to this is the dof adaptor which allows you to mount full-frame camera lenses onto your phone all right so using all of this stuff where are you gonna build two separate camera rigs the first is based off the iphone tenace max which is one of the best phones in terms of capturing hdr in video and for this we're just going to mount it inside the beast cage that is built before this phone which lets you mount the dof adapter and whichever full-frame camera lens you want to use but also stuff like the action handle which lets you get a better grip of the whole thing because as you can imagine it's a little bit front heavy secondly the s10 plus rig and because there isn't a beast cage built for this phone we're using something they called a beast grip pro kind of like a universal equivalent for all smartphones and even though i was told all of this has been prioritized to work with iphone better than it does for android the results that i got from this smartphone blew me away but let's start with the iphone rig first so i took both rigs to central london to try and capture the hustle and bustle the people the cars the traffic and i think the results we got will probably impress you the first thing you're probably noticed from the iphone footage is depth of field the ability to focus on a closer object and to have that beautiful soft background blur with everything else if you pay attention to the soft glow of lights in the background it's well beyond what the smartphone itself could achieve and in some cases i was getting this footage confused with footage for my $2,000 dslr one of the other advantages of using a lens like this is that you've got my need to control over the focus so you can have these really dramatic shots where you're pulling focus as the shop proceeds so you can slowly draw attention from one part of the image to another it also works pretty well in low-light there is noise but it's not as bad as i thought it would be the tennis max actually keeps up pretty well with this full-frame camera gear now beast grip has their own application which is what i used for this and it's basically full manual control of your phone you've got all the standard stuff control over exposure and iso but something that i find particularly useful is focus assist which highlights in green whatever is in focus this isn't a perfect setup there are a couple of issues i noticed the phone seems to have lost a bit of sharpness compared to without a lens and specific to the iphone it's heavy color processing can result in some weird-looking background blur alright let's move on to the s10 plus rig and to be honest the minute i saw this footage coming out of the camera i was instantly excited to share it with you as before the depth of field is fantastic you've got really nice background blur but what was super impressive is that even though we were now in low-light this phone handles that depth of field whilst keeping the subject pin sharp i was shocked with how all this footage came out and it goes some way to showing that the s10 hardware is really quite capable because of the way the lens fits over the phone you do have to crop a little bit into the image otherwise you get these weird black bars on the side but nonetheless because it's shooting at high 4k resolution the resulting image is still very sharp and that brings us to one of the main advantages of shooting with a smart phone color processing this is shot with the filmic pro app and straight out of the app this is the footage i haven't even touched it the color grading here is cinema quality now this s10 rig was also the perfect opportunity to test out the anamorphic lens and for those of you don't know an animal fit lens allows you to capture a lot more horizontal information you get this super wide shot and the way the lens is built brings a subtle visual flair to the end product again straight unedited footage from the filmic pro app so i've been considering turning this into a new series on the channel on a new smartphone releases we could completely deck it out rig it up and see what at its maximum potential it is capable of let me know if that's something you'd want to see because i'm still debating the idea as always if you enjoyed the video if you could smash the subscribe button i would really appreciate it my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music] you
