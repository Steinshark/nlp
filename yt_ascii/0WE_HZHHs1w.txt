this youtuber has already raised a hundred thousand dollars from his fans by selling his youtube channel and it's turning out to be a huge scam and i'm here to tell you why let me start by saying i'm a fan of this youtube channel which kind of makes this a bit of a weird story because i've reached out to them in the past and said how much i like their work it's a channel called disrupt who you may have come across they have 1.4 million subscribers and their creator jack produces many documentaries about everything from computer viruses to hackers and if you're a nerd it's pretty great stuff but today jack posted something different from his normal videos he's selling his channel i am selling this channel well a portion of it because a change is coming path a and path b path a i believe is the best option this is the equity crowdfunding path this means that right now at this present moment you can own a portion of disrupt for a minimum of 100 you will receive 23 shares of the disrupt corporation in return you'll get a percentage of the net profit that this channel makes every single year so right from the start this all sounds pretty interesting right you invest a hundred dollars you get a portion of a youtube channel it's sort of like buying a business and it's sort of like supporting a creator that you like you might be tempted to think it's the best of both worlds i mean just listen to all the cool stuff he plans to use the money for and in return my team and i will use that capital to expand the disrupt operation and bring you feature like films shows and virtual reality content it's a compelling pitch you're making money and he's gonna spend your investment on better videos it's a win-win right now jack does mention a second path if he doesn't raise the full amount but he pretty quickly labels that a bad idea path b is the path that will have to go down if we do not reach our funding goal by the deadline this would mean a complete restructuring of the internal operations here at disrupt this path is not ideal so if you want to secure the future of the disrupt down path a please consider investing now this is where the first cracks in his story start to show he never tells us what path b is or why he'd have to take it in fact he kind of does this weird appeal of both hey on the one hand this is a really serious investment and on the other hand if you don't invest as a fan your favorite channel could die which is really weird but you might not notice it watching the rest of the video you might get swept away by all the beautiful graphics which sort of serve as an advertisement for what you're gonna get if you help invest in the channel but things really go sour when we actually go to invest and we go to the website where we invest at because that's where we learn things aren't as advertised let's start with the amount he's raising five hundred thousand dollars for ten percent of his channel the website claims that disrupt is valuing themselves at 10.7 million dollars that's what they're claiming percent of their company is worth now this is absolutely insane i own a channel of a similar size and there's no way right you could argue my channel is worth 10 million 10 million 10 million dollars okay well technically if you ignore the 10 million studio there's no way that my youtube channel by itself is worth 10 million okay i guess that's what i'm trying to say and that's how i know that his isn't either and when you check his financials this actually becomes even more clear because you might have been wondering this whole time why is he raising 500 000 specifically at such an insane valuation well it has something to do with the fact i think that he's 500 000 in debt call it a crazy hunch but i found this fact out at the bottom of his financial document all the way down all 14 pages down the very last line you will see this disrupt owes 466 thousand dollars and they also owe attorney fees so basically they owe 500 000 that's what they say aka all of it to pay off the debts so for those of you who have been paying attention forget about films forget about the metaverse forget about virtual reality your money is going off to pay jack's dad and he's trying to sell all of this to you as if it's some shiny turd straight from mark zuckerberg's metaverse and it's worth five hundred thousand dollars but it isn't and here's the thing it gets even worse because wait till you hear how he got in debt in the first place because it turns out that jack had a co-founder this whole time of disrupt who owned 50 of the company and one day jack decides he's gonna buy him out of his 50 for wait for it 500 000 so yes you're hearing this right he bought out fifty percent of disrupt for five hundred thousand dollars and then is selling his fans ten percent of the company for the same five hundred thousand dollars because he can't afford the quarterly payments obviously because he overpaid for it which is very ironic and in all this he tries to pretend it's about the metaverse and hides the actual financial truth at the bottom of his disclosure and by the way that disclosure that i'm telling you guys about the really important one it's not in his video and it's actually at the very bottom of his crowdfunding website so all you have to do to learn about the super important fact is go into the link scroll to the very bottom get that document go to the very bottom of that document and finally you could learn the truth guys are you not seeing how big of a scam this is i mean to be clear i have no problem if people want a crowdfund for really anything as long as they're honest if he told people hey i'm in debt and i'm trying to raise money for it i ain't got no problem with that but he doesn't tell you that because of obviously you're not gonna spend money on his bad financial decisions you're gonna spend money if you think you're building the future and you think you're getting rich which i guess you are building the future but it's just it's just jack's future which you know is different i did reach out to disrupt to ask if there's some context that i'm missing here and so far i've gotten no response but on discord he has been answering some questions so i want to go over that apparently the full story is that jack says that his co-owner originally bought disrupt 50 of it anyways for 10 000 a while ago and jack seems to have done most of the work in the interim this co-founder then turned into some super garyvee villain and wanted to turn everything into nfts and sell crypto coins and jack was against it because he didn't want you investing in bad financial decisions and so he wanted a buyout and he got about for 500 000 but it's here where things start to get complicated because when jack started throwing his partner under the bus as some nft super villain his partner decided to climb from underneath it and clear his name he jumped in the discord and started disproving the claims one by one starting with crypto he says hi there i am the partner with significant creative differences spoiler there was mention of a disrupt crypto coin or slinging nfts i think that's a misguided interpretation of my vision and that's not the only thing that might be untrue remember jack said that his partner only invested 10k but it turns out it was a lot more than that quote i invested a lot more than 10k into disrupt that is another point that requires clarification 10k was initial bankroll but the major investment came from three years of salaries being paid overhead rent for office space studio equipment etc we later learned that he probably invested around two hundred thousand dollars because he says the 500k buyout was a little over a 2x on his investment which he rightfully points out is a terrible return on a youtube channel investment where mostly your dollars would go to zero so it turns out jack's co-founder isn't some predatory lending supervillain nor was it true when jack said that his co-founder even asked for the buyout or set the conditions quote just as another note i never wanted to sell my stake in the company jack offered the valuation i did not set it there that was his offer that i accepted in an effort to resolve amicably now this all contradicts what jack has said directly in a follow-up video that he did after i reached out to him he said his co-founder is the one who set the price this is where the 466 thousand dollars of debt can be seen on our financials this is what the prior member has set their price at in order to depart from disrupt so who's telling the truth here well it looks like it's not jack because recently he's deleted his comment saying his co-founder only put in 10k and that his co-founder set the price instead he changed it to this quote i have updated the previously typed message in 2017 a co-founder and i started disrupt as an llc in 2021 we settled on a buyout agreement now what i find crazy about this is that while changing his story jack doesn't acknowledge what he's changing here because remember we've gone from the co-founder is a villainous nft huckster who bought his company for ten thousand dollars and demanded a buyout for 500k now it's looking like his co-founder invested two hundred thousand dollars didn't push nfts and didn't even want to be bought out and look i'm not here to settle who's right in their business disagreements i just don't even care i'm just here to point out that jack is disguising his business problems as financial opportunities which they're not and when he gets caught he continues to lie and throws his co-founder under the bus when it just seems like they basically have creative differences i don't know it just seems like jack is acting like one of these delusional people who go on shark tank with five dollars in sales and are seeking a million dollars for one percent of their company except for the fact instead of pitching to mark cuban he's pitching to his fans who might not know why it's a bad investment because he's deliberately hid it from them but luckily people are finally figuring out what he did and he's rightfully getting ripped apart by his audience for it and that's kind of the good news that he's unlikely to reach his goal and the other good news is that plan b isn't that big of a deal the co-founder would get 51 of the company and it seems like he doesn't want to do that much different jack would continue producing content fans don't lose money and things just return back to the status quo honestly this is just such a stupid drama for no reason jack decided to swindle his fans out of 500k because he didn't like his co-founder by selling them a company at an even worse price than he bought it for and by the way remember he can't pay the debt because obviously it was a terrible decision and when he gets got trying to sell this bad debt he doubles down and tries to tell everyone that he's saving the company from his co-founder who by all accounts seems like a pretty nice guy and yet has there ever been an apology no and for all these reasons the crazy valuation the bad debt the lies i'm out
