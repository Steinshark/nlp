and goods can see you oh it's great to see you i'm i'm nervous and anticipating disappointment that we won't get to meet in thunder bay in september no word yet but no i don't i i also don't think that it's going to be because the problem with thunder bay too is that it's far away from everybody and so it means that in order for them to even make it happen they probably will need people to to travel and so i don't yeah i don't see it i don't see it's it's frustrating but yeah yeah and what a year you've had i'd saw your comments of you know easter twenty twenty nineteen flood 2020 pandemic yes local not in global flood [laughter] and and i just watched this morning i just watched your donkey kong video and i thought it was it was tremendous it was tremendous jonathan i don't i when i think when people first told me about you and i watched some of your first videos i'm like what is this guy talking about but you've you've seriously colonized parts of me that i can't talk to people and some of your some of your ideas just haven't gotten so deep in my head that so i owe you a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything that i've that i've that i've learned from you and so i i just want to say that well thank you that that really the donkey kong thing it was really just because things have gotten so grim you know in the past few months and and understandably so but i just felt like i just needed to do something that was extremely light and extremely that was showing the pattern but it was didn't have that many ramifications and so people have been asking me to make a video game video game symbolism for years and i've always refused because there is something about video games that i our video game culture which i i'm not super productive but i don't have anything against video games like i played video games once in a while too but anyway so i finally gave in and i'm like okay i'm gonna make something just fun and light and you know anyways well i i thought i i really enjoyed it cuz i'm old enough to remember you know when you had to go to an arcade or with the quarters yeah yeah yeah i pumped a lot of quarters and machines at certain times in my life what what does what is your life looking like now for you i know you spending a lot of time working on your stuff making videos i mean cuz your life i mean what do i wanted to talk to you today is kind of a you know go back over the last few years i mean your life got turned upside down definitely no definitely and you know last year was probably one of the most intense years i guess in my life you know i've had pretty intense year that last year was really intense also because i had all planned to do a lot of traveling and i did but i was also dealing with the flood and all of this and actually right now i feel like the lack of traveling is actually feels kind of nice i'm realizing that it's it actually feels kind of nice to you know just like everybody there's something about this pandemic which there are a lot of negative aspects to it for sure but there's a positive aspect in the sense that it's forcing everybody to stop and i think that it's acting almost like a little sabbath or like a little jubilee and so it's forcing people to stop and so it can it can be positive because you have to kind of take some distance and see what's going on you also end up spending you know where i spend way more time with my kids when we're talking to my family and i'm loving that the heart of it i just love it so i hope we can take some of that into into the net like if when it starts so when it starts again i hope we can take some of that into the next iteration of our society you know they shut down the stores here on sundays all the story so all the all the grocery stores are all all the grocery stores are closed on sundays yeah and it's like and and they did it for purely secular reasons yeah yeah but i've talked to a few people just regular people that aren't even necessarily christians they said oh we love that it's cool that the stores are closed on sundays because we don't have the self-discipline yeah not to go to the store on sundays but if it's closed then you don't go and then you end up spending more time with your family and he just happens and so i was like interesting well i so i grew up in paterson new jersey and these jersey blue laws as they were called you know they lasted into the 60s and 70s when shopping malls were closed on sundays and this is the new york metropolitan area where you know one of the more secular places in the country these laws endured on the east coast and that of course i grew up in the christian reformed church which was very sabbatarian so even if things were open you didn't go because that was your community didn't do these things on sunday hmm and and unfortunately you know in the 70s and 80s the christian reformed church sort of began to dismiss these things and the theological justification for that was these are these are this is liberalism or this is you know this is this is legalism that we're not swimming on sunday or playing ball on sunday or you know in our in our house we couldn't turn the tv on until after the second service on sunday that was kind of the break but i wonder if this was some latent thing from my jewish ancestors on my father's side it was sundown on sunday after that you could it's kind of a weird mix but i you know i think so i've been so my wife is a schoolteacher and before she was a public schoolteacher we were home schoolers and so she kind of got cast into creating what essentially is homeschool material for her public school students because she had all this homeschool experience and wanted very mod very much wanted her students in her classroom to be able and the families to do some of that most of whom don't really necessarily have a lot of interest in that because it's very demanding of the parents but you know watching the disruption happen in people's lives people are i think we've had enough months of this lockdown where people and the emerging is going to be slow where people are going to have learned something and at least aspirationally are going to say i want to take some of these new learnings and blessings into my future but we'll see how long that lasts we'll see how long that lasts but how about you how i mean what's life like for a pastor in the world where there's no church i guess like where there's no a physical meeting how's it been it's it's you know it is important that this thing happened during lent and i emotionally just hit me a lot harder than i thought it would just losing the rhythm of being with the people hmm and so then you know i do these little videos now for church for the members the three members of my church that can actually figure out how to get on youtube and i had to i you know i got a one of my elder said you know you gonna have to you're gonna have to cheer things up a little bit i'm sorry little depressed myself but especially when we then turned the page into easter and the easter and because easter is of course a season it's not just a day i did the day yeah until then and and so then i sort of had to lean into even though we couldn't meet and jubilee is what i think about all the time because i walk here to church and i do this stuff in the building the empty building where we have not had services since mid-march and i think the it's a little non protestant of me but you know the sanctuary is getting a sabbath rest and it's getting a jubilee in a where it'll be put to work again soon but it's fallow right now and there's that's not altogether a bad thing damn and you can see what like you can see kind of what the purpose of these little deaths are because you realize it well we actually have to restart because things have broken down now we have to restart and so for people who are keen it's actually an opportunity to fix a bunch of stuff yeah right it's an opportunity to start on the right foot as we say to start on the in on the right path but you can't it's hard to do that unless there's a breakdown you know when things are when the gears are turning and the wheel the machine is running it's really difficult to change things because there's almost a logic there's a pattern that's running its course and you know it's very difficult to stop it but when these kind of things happen then you know if you're attentive it's an opportunity to make some changes you know and jonathan one of the things that i think i have to again continue to credit you with is it was probably a gap in my protestantism and i think you know charles taylor brings this out in in his work a secular age protestantism tends definitely towards the instrumental towards the adea gentek towards the driving you know part of part of what happens in going from let's say two-speed where you had the the holy persons and then the laity to the one speed when john calvin wants to make all of geneva in a sense the the city of god what are one of the things that you i think have really helped me with is showing again you have the center and you have the periphery and in in god's creation they both have their place and and i was watched also this morning i watched you know the little clip that your people i think it's it's absolutely perfect that it's your people who are selecting the clips because people sometimes hope all your videos are so terribly long why don't you just do clips i don't know what clips are actually the good ones yeah exactly i i do feel very fortunate because i can see what people pick out of the queue neighs and what people pick out of the videos that they find interesting and so i'm like okay yeah interesting interesting well and i saw your little two little clip on lilith and i just i'm a protestant you know we don't read those so let's talk about that lilith yeah and but but you've i think shown very well kind of the place in the created order for these different elements that sort of get pushed out of the way in the agenting protestant mind and and you know you've really helped me with that well thanks i appreciate it and how have you been you've been still doing a videos every day is that because i see once in a while but i are you still still have the same rhythm i do video six days a week i'm the seventh you have to go to the church channel for the video it's you know it's become part of my rhythm and i you know i often feel i often feel like a bad youtuber cuz when i watch your videos i think boy jonathan knows what he's doing and jonathan's doing it the right way and i and i but i just kind of use it for what i use it for which is i've found that it's a good way to engage in conversations and to try out ideas with a really far broader audience than little livingstone's most of whom i'll say things and they look at me like what are you talking about but i think you're doing i think it's just too styled i think you doing more like a joe rogan type discussion you know this constant discussion and it has a great advantage like i sometimes now i i feel like i'm kind of out of the discussion like i'm kind of i've kind of moved out of the discussion just because i've been busy i've been doing all these different things and so i'm not following the flow whereas you're right in there and seeing you're still you're doing videos about you know about the portal and like john for vicki and all the stuff that's going on and it's actually been seeing that you're doing videos that you're doing videos about that kind of stuff now i'm like i've contacted a few people like i'm gonna do i want to do a discussion go on that you know that group the stoah that yeah do and peter's yeah so i'm gonna try to participate in that site like you know i need to get back into a conversation i can't just be the guy talking or else i'm going to start talking in circles so i really appreciate this ongoing conversation i need to actually need to be more part of it but i have kind of pulled away a little bit especially from the whole dark web like intellectual dark web thing i never completely identified with that name from the beginning and and so i've also since jordan has kind of moved out of it i've also moved i think i feel like i pulled out more just because the things they're talking about i don't i don't think they i don't think a lot of the people like the one signs i don't think they really understand the stakes of what interests me and so because of that i just it's a feel like there's no conversation to be had with john though john birt vicki i think he totally gets it i think like i wish that i wish john could talk to someone like the wine science because i think that that he could have a really good discussion with them but for me i just feel like the stakes i just don't they i'm not communicating the stakes of what i've been talking about in a way that for a certain type of atheist is not it's not clicking like they don't know what i'm talking about like for was that like rationality rule you kind of engage him i'm like i'm not engaging that that person i mean i don't i don't think i don't think he even knows what i'm talking about like i think that you would listen to my videos and think it's just gibberish non-stop gibberish that's probably true but i i i'll tell you i mean we're all sort of and i see this as just part of the economy of the kingdom of god that here in his body has many members and the hey in the ear and the eye and the nose are not all the same and they and in fact it's it's god's good god's good purpose that they're not but i see i see the tremendous impact of your work on on people that i'm talking to and and what you have done is i think in a deep way really and i think this you know this is i think this is part of your mission and the mission that you've intentionally embraced to you you have really helped to rewire people to see and understand and engage at levels that very little in modernity would afford them to both and i appreciate you that that's i think that's vitally important especially as we are in a period where i mean these things take a long time to work through chronologically in history but we are the intensification of the breaking down of modernity this is i mean it's it's happening quicker than we think and something like a pandemic well it kind of works on both ends of it but it speeds up the process oh for sure and it's it's opening up spaces that we thought were impossible you know i was talking to a friend of mine today it was not at all the christian come this regular liberal you know north american and he he sees and he's not he's not even like conservative like he he's a left-leaning but he says i never thought that i would see the government reached so much in my life he said i didn't think it was possible i didn't think it was possible for the for the government to reach so deep in our private lives and you said all of a sudden within a few weeks you know it's it's we have people denouncing their neighbors calling the police and you thought wow this is crazy how it can things change so fast yes break it it's accelerating and this 2020 election for you guys is going to be another major marker it's it's not gonna get any easier but look at look at the pause that again the the pandemic has given us trump can't go out and you know fill a fill a stadium with cheering fans biden can't go out and press the flesh in a sense we have two people that are probably gonna be running anyway you know so i frankly look at i i look at what a feeding frenzy 2016 was and i just i mean 2020 would have been another layer up but this pandemic is in that aspect perhaps part of the grace of god to say we're gonna put a blanket on this sucker because you know the world doesn't need the world doesn't need and canada doesn't need the united states flying apart anytime soon yeah well we'll see because it's not it's gonna it's gonna ramp up near the election cuz we're gonna get cuz the they're gonna get desperate the candidates are gonna get desperate to try to get the attend because now that like you said the attention is not on the election at all but it's kind of they're seething in the background and it's motivating actually a lot of moves in terms of media the way the media is framing things is frank it's a lot of it is based on the upcoming election but it's it's gonna ramp up we'll see i hope it doesn't like i hear there's no discussion like here it's all justin trudeau globalism it's it's wild like how much everybody just agrees with what's going on here in quebec i think it's gonna be in quebec i think french canadians have a weird they're kind of sheet we're kind of like sheep you kind of follow it all kind of all just follow in one direction but there's also there's also like a low-level resistance and and i think i'm starting to see it right now you know like everybody's like yeah yeah shut down shut down but then everybody's outside and you know and now i even this weekend i saw a few restaurants that were kind of we had that the door open and they had dad tables outside and i was like okay let's everybody's kind of pushing everybody's pushing and i think it's people are just gonna start just doing their own thing at some point it's gonna happen that's mostly it's probably gonna happen more like that than coming from a top-down decree people are gonna say okay you know what this is not it's we're just tired and we're just gonna we just need to see people yeah and that's what's happening in california right now the governor the governor had laid down well these are the things and then some of the counties sort of you know broke and then the governor very quickly realized he didn't really have the power and didn't want to so he kind of readjusted the criteria some more counties could be in and it's it's you know they the the there's a spanish saying la carga say hey glen el camino which is that the the load adjusts itself on the road and that's exactly what's that's exactly what's happening right now but you know i really wanted to talk to you because i i wanted to talk to you about what you and i have been doing over the last two and a half years and because you your channel started a little ahead of mine and i think it fits into i mean it's interesting now that we have this pandemic that that's happening now but before i you know i got my undergrad degree in history and so i've always sort of got a historical mindset to me and so before too much history goes by i at least wanted to do some talking and documenting about you know what i've what i call the jordan at least wave one of you know jordans wave in terms of you know in canada it was c16 in the united states it was the trump election you know c16 was sort of october 2016 of course donald trump was elected in november 2016 and then of course jordan jordan you know there's no way to separate it from jordan and now you're a personal friend of his so i you know you have to be more careful than i do but you know what happened jordan had been talking about this stuff for a very long time and that evidence is out on youtube and of course you you caught wind of him early before he took his status rocket ride and you know you could just send him an email and he could respond to you and oh well here's this artist who's doing stuff and you develop a relationship with him but that moment that just like you said things what caught my attention in this was that jordan in the jordan peterson wave things happened i didn't anticipate seeing yeah a conversations could be had that i couldn't have before yep and i you know i was i was fortunate enough that the protestant if a cat if calvinists can use that word to have sort of been at the right time and gathered around me additional conversation partners and for me that's been the real takeaway from this thing but i wanted to talk to you about this before this history gets too old behind us and and start with some of because of course you had already started building a relationship with jordan and then whoosh and then of course you start a youtube channel and well you're an artist and you you know we've talked about your life before this now suddenly you're an artist who also makes videos and of course just been a flood and a pandemic and all of that so so what now thinking back to three four years on this what what comes to the of your mental salience hierarchy i think that one of the things where we're seeing is as we watch kind of the breakdown of the of the west let's say could say it that way the breakdown of what has held the west together and we see the breakdown of christianity the surprising thing about a breakdown is that it also affords opportunities and i think that that's something that the people who had wanted let's say religion to go away didn't realize you know as narratives break down there's also a spaces that open and those open spaces are the reason why all of a sudden conversations that we didn't think we're possible are happening you know because there's more connect there's more connectivity there's more like lateral connectivity you could say it that way and i think that so i think that that it's it's actually a very exciting time because there's a possibility for there's really a possibility for a flip and i think that that's really what jordan did is is he flipped the discourse he turned it and what he did i mean it was already kind of preparing there were people who were kind of talking about it and it's not like he came out completely out of the blue with his idea but there's something about him about his personality about the way that he was also kind of like a father figure oh there's all these things that kind of came together and the fact also that he resisted he talks about jordan talked about this quite a few times where he said he took it out of the abstract and and and chose a place right said this this thing here is where i'm not going to move and that's what the bill the c16 thing was and he's often said that it was it was near arbitrary in the sense that there other things happened before that that we're in the same vein and other things have happened since but it's like he said this one is the one i guess i'm gonna stay no and like i'm stopping here and so there's something about there's something about that where he he kind of flipped the discourse into in terms of religion let's say cuz he did it in a lot of things but in terms of religion he he brought the he brings the end of the the evolutionary thinking to its inevitable conclusion and the inevitable conclusion is you know that that this is you know that thing that you marginalized all this time this religion thing you marginalized it well if you if you're in the if you're in the evolution mindset it has to participate in the pattern and this is the same thing with consciousness it's the whole problem of consciousness - it's like people just stood in consciousness and were describing the world and then you come to the end where it's like the last thing to to analyze is the thing you've been not talking about and then when it turns back on itself then it creates this weird flip and that's what i think jordan did a lot of the things that i think were the most powerful things that he talked about were the the things that lead into the notion of of of attention and relevance the relevance realization that that now john has been kind of taking up i think that that's the most powerful thing that jordan brought to the to the floor in terms of in terms of shattering the categories that people have been using and forcing this the scientific mind to think to see differently and i think no one has gotten over that yet like people are still processing that and it's but in a way it's the moment he's gone in a way because now at least for now because jordan is has kind of he's vanished and and the effect of jordan vanishing has been huge it's been huge in the sense that like he i know that it's part of why my views have gone down i know that it's part of why the discussions have slowed down why there's less of this interconnect connectivity you know it's as if without him there is no intellectual dark web really yeah yeah right there's just been shapiro and the weinstein weinstein's and and they can kind of talk to each other but they they don't there isn't this this problem that's there this kind of weird thing that we have to solve that jordan was kind of bringing to the table somehow well i very like hello he put it because he sort of brought they connected via him and without him right there the weinstein sort of go back to the things they talked about and ben shapiro does his stuff on politics and yep you know and and of course why would ben shapiro and and the wine stein's over why would these two talk hmm if jordan doesn't sort of connect them why did very little few reasons yeah why did you start doing youtubes i started because of jordan i mean i i we did that video we did a video we did the two videos one was called tradition and things that don't fit and then the metaphysics of peppe and then what happened is i got invited to do an event with him in toronto and so i i did that event and he put that up and you put up those other videos and so it was like i had a few i appeared on his channel a few times and people started writing me and i started getting flooded with emails of people saying can you interpret this like this this symbolism of this and symbolism that and i realized okay well i can't i'm not gonna answer all these emails so i have to i kind of have to i guess i have to do something and since it was it was a happening on youtube i figured then i'll make youtube videos because really as silly as that it's it's interesting to me how you and your brother you know cuz your brother's your you know with his book i mean he's very much a part of this story even though he's not on your channel and and i also you know when earlier we talked about the fact that you've sort of taken a step back because you know i wrestled with this as a pastor you know yeah i put out a lot of videos and i do a lot of conversation but in some ways i think this is true of john verve a key to in some ways sort of the space that a pastor holds is different from the space that an icon carver holds yeah because an icon carver in a sense in a sense i would imagine and please correct me if i'm wrong in a sense i would imagine you're sort of an artistic monk i guess sort of your vocation yeah and and a youtube you know a youtube celebrity i remember you talking about your kid describing you my father makes youtube video you tuber my dad's a youtuber that's been reduced to that nice joke in my in my family yeah and and again i think here too in this way jordans absence sort of means the circuit isn't running like it was it's not it's not necessarily bad there's some positive aspects to that you know there it's like different waves and so right now what i've been doing i would say in the past since i guess it's it actually is since jordan kind of vanished i've been consolidating the things that have better that i've been given to me you could say it that way and so i've been focusing a lot more on getting the conversation to to run within the people that have been following my videos and now we just started a blog where people that are that have been watching my videos for a few years that are on this facebook group that discusses the symbolism and have read in my brother's book now i've kind of jp you met jp masu so he's editing the blog and people can submit articles that are doing symbolic interpretation or they talk about symbolism for the blog and so that has been i put a lot of emphasis on that in the past few months kind of getting that started i don't think there's going to be a massive public for it but i think that it's going to be a good training ground for a lot of people and it'll be a resource for those who want to go further into to symbolism and so that's kind of been my that's been my focus in the past few months has been to try to to seek to make this into a team effort so that it's not just me talking about symbolism but that there's there's you know a few dozen people that really understand what i'm talking about and can understand some facets of it that i don't and can use the the lens of symbolism to look at things that i don't have the energy or the interest to look at and so and so that's it's been that's been exciting to put together and i'm looking forward to - already the articles that have been going up we've been live for about two weeks or three weeks maybe and the articles that have been going up have been great just wonderful really really good stuff so you know it's i this this last weekend i used you probably know the youtube channel like stories of old yeah it's it's a movie interpretation channel a dutchman another dutchman and you know when i was working on when i was working on he'd done a couple of videos is gonna do a third one in this series about story vs. reality and of course that immediately caught my attention and you know they did a video on story vs. reality it's got a series he's got two out and a third one is coming very very interesting that as a preacher i just kind of jumped on it right away and because it sort of fit in i was i've been working through first peter in during the easter season and what was what what you know one of the things that and i think about this a lot actually with your work where there's a there's a there's an interesting tension involved in both being the artist and the explainer yeah because in a sense your videos are about bringing up to consciousness that which is already forming and shaping and molding beneath now there's a prophetic mode in that of you know oh my people you are absorbing you are absorbing the worship of bail and you don't even know it and so allow me to bring up to your conscious you know that the part of you that is kind just the formation that is happening beneath the surface and of course for all of us we have a certain we have the pleasure of insight this the emotional psychological pleasure of insight in that process which i think is part of the joy i have in watching you take an arcade game and once you say it it's oh gosh this is the most this is the most obvious thing in the world i never you know i never recognized how this ties into the rest of creation but just in the first few minutes it's like you know what why was i too dumb to see but then there's this other moment of realizing that oh my i have been deeply formed and the little conscious self of the me that managing manages these things is in very many ways weak helpless has been subject to programming far beyond and now jonathan pojo comes up and makes me think differently about masculine and feminine right hand left hand center and periphery but yet as an artist in a sense you're both the the former as the artist in some ways you're like the magician who goes on youtube and shows the how the tricks work exactly it's the only reason why you have to do that is because there's there's been a lot of really evil magicians in the past to generate few generations you had a few really bad wizards that have been distorting reality and and using one of the problems that we've had in the past few centuries is that a lot of christians took the science pill like they just took it completely and they went down the critical historical scientific path and those that took up the storytelling mode and who intuitively understood the patterns were those that really you just wanted to destroy christianity and so you have and so all the people who are really good at storytelling where though that we're using these symbolic patterns to undermine the christian narrative and christians were too busy answering with this or that like statue that are bold that they found in the sand and in palestine you know and they they lost the story and and you can see because who are the christians right now like it's all it's all its es lewis' and toki right it's like that's our only that it like that's our only two storytellers it's it's those two in the whole 20th century we've got those two whereas the you know people those that want to have been wanting to undermine have every other story and so maybe not every other story but a huge amount of this storytelling and so it feels like one of the things that i want to do is i want to give back the power of storytelling to the people who could do it because the thing is that the the token story is the is more powerful it's one of the most powerful stories that were has been told in the 20th century barnone like nope not even the christian or not it's it's one of the most influential stories that has surfaced in the past few hundred years and it's it it's because it has totally infiltrated culture in a way that people don't even realize it all your video games have token behind them all years a lot so much of your science fiction all the world-building that you see in science fiction that you see in in in fantasy stories it's all toki he's the one who who gave you that and so that's how powerful if you tell the right story that's how powerful it is right the right story taking a story let's say like a disney story that somewhat twisted like a moana or whatever there's enough of it to for it to be true but there's enough of it for it to be twisted but if you were able to to to take it and just give it back in its pristine form then it's gonna win because it's truer and that's what i thought i would say like one of my main goals has been to give to give back to to christians or to people who don't want to undermine everything to give them back the pattern so that they can use them because it's not enough to interpret these movies this is i mean this is really hopefully it's just groundwork for people then to be able to to tell better stories you know it strikes me again as i was watching like stories of old as i was watching him basically deconstruct as i was watching him deconstruct i just had the sense that that that effort will always fail and so that something was doing he was saying reality is what like meaningless and random well he's saying well here so-so story well well he was in a sense saying well here's the trick of story you know the end and therefore you selectively construct the bits and that's how psychologically you create story that's unlike reality of course i okay tell me what reality is well he doesn't say it out loud but the assumption is what reality is just one random chaotic purposeless event after another that's what reality is and so now we have these stories and so i'm waiting on his third episode where i suspect he will make the move that the freedom from religion people make every time they put up a bull board in sacramento which is say i can bring the meaning myself and i think yeah yeah i definitely have to watch the video because that's that's hilarious it's so funny because let's think of a very short story in terms of human in terms of human interaction all your actions are based on an end there's no action that you make any every action in the world is based on an end now whether or not the end resolves itself one way or the other that's a different story because there are stories that don't end well even in a even in a movie but the the purpose is there so we always act for ends there's there's no action without an end so i it's just funny to think it's like you know the end well when i'm pouring a glass of juice from the fridge i so no the end like i that's why i'm doing it or else i wouldn't do it if i didn't know at the end was oh well and i think i just i just finished a very interesting conversation with brett shackled brett is the author he's a roman catholic from regina saskatchewan who's the the the theologian for the diocese and regina and he wrote this what to me was a tremendous book on transubstantiation and where basically i think in many ways he began helping protestants lutheran's calvinists and catholics understand each other by showing some of the ways that luther and calvin were trying to recapture aquinas and didn't understand what they were doing it's a fascinating book and how did i get at him well i ends these ends because we're talking about conspiracy theories yeah okay and again i think some of your work on this has been really tremendous and and has deeply influenced me and you know mary coe cohan has been really helpful for me - she's roman catholic she listens to all of us and she does her own little commentaries but you know how you lay these things out and and so here like stories of old i think is basically going to say he's going to make the move well this is such telling language we don't really have purpose because this is of course what sam harris says about again when you're pouring the glass of orange juice there's no such thing as purpose it only looks like purpose you know and you experiences that as purpose so what the freedom from religion foundation says is that while we can enjoy the experience of purpose and we can we can live as if there's purpose but there really isn't any and it's like oh you're talking about why are you working so hard on this yeah what why and and and in fact because you can't you can't tell the story that there is no purpose unless you use all of the tools of purpose to tell the story and in that sense the tools themselves betray the purpose for which they were given and no matter you know no matter how much you use that hammer to deconstruct the hammer is more real than the pile of rubble you leave on the floor that's right yeah that every every move you use to tell me that there's no purpose is based on is you're using all your purpose-driven mechanisms to tell me that there's no purpose like what exactly is your purpose and telling me there's no purpose if you've got to have one you definitely have one it's a very dark cynical purpose that you've got and trying to do that and so you know when i was you know so i first started you know i made just be a pastor looks at jordan peterson and then of course people started coming to me which was an unusual experience for me in in ministry because they usually have people avoiding me and so people start coming to me and they start telling me and of course we never we saw them quite know what's really going on we just experience things and make up reasons that sort of seemed to fit maybe are 20% right and and then i'm talking to all of these people and realizing a good percentage of the people i'm talking to were depressed and then they tell me i watched hours of jordans video and i'm not depressed anymore and what's more i kind of think i want to go to church yeah i don't know why and and then the crazy thing especially as a protestant not necessarily making protestants very terribly happy i'll talk to you because you're easier to find and talk to than jordan but what i really want to do is be orthodox edit and as a protestant i sit here and i think you'd better you better count the cost of this endeavor my friend because the orthodox don't just let anybody saunter in on one sunday and say i believe walk down get baptized and now you're right yeah yeah it usually takes a year before they baptize you that's for sure so so again i mean my my entire video project at least the part that that connects with jordan has been to try to figure out what he's doing and and you know i'm not always so sure but none of us always none of us ever know all that we're doing but but sometimes i watch jordan and i think i wonder if he knows all the levels he's working on because we can see them by the effects yeah and that's exactly why i don't want to do little clips of me because we who are even doing the work only know the effects by watching what comes back to us hmm yeah i mean i i agree i think i think he's probably he might be more aware than what you think though he's actually i think he's quite aware he's also aware he's even aware at the level in which he speaks because i even one time i had a conversation with them and i won't say who i was criticizing but i was i was kind of commenting on someone a youtube someone on youtube and i said you know i don't think he's very that he's that smart that person and and jordan said yeah but he's a stand-in for like the common person and he was like i want that's where that's who i want to talk to like i don't want to talk to because a lot of people have criticized jordan because he his stuff isn't formulated in in complicated technical words and all of this and it it sounds very everyday and it's because that's what he wanted to do he really did want to connect to connect right to the people and talk be able to speak at different levels but if he's talking to ian mcgill chris he's able to read go up and talk about about that stuff too but he doesn't feel he doesn't feel like it has to prove to people that he's smart you know and used complicated words all the time to kind of to kind of show people that he's smart and so i think that he he i think he's more aware than we think sometimes of of what he's trying to accomplish and like trying to gather the levels together to have this like weird effect he probably also knows that that that he was playing a kind of father a dad figure as well like he's i'm sure he he understood that but it's hard because we again he doesn't it's hard to have access to him and now you know be people who you should be left alone that's right you know when i it was so funny because i you know i saw he was coming through california and i okay you're you're you're in oregon and then you're gonna be in sacramento then you're gonna be in the bay area then you give me in southern california son rogan when he's doing that i'm just kind of looking between the lines and i'm thinking yo dude a schedule like this as a pastor if you were in my church i wouldn't recommend it yeah i'd say that that's that's there's a there's a lot that goes into that in terms of the churn and the people and and all of that you know and and as you know i i shouldn't say i didn't ask for it but i guess when i made a video i asked for it so part of what so so part of what i've done and people sometimes ask me what i do and i say well i'm a pastor i'm just sort of pastoring in a different way right now and so i you know with the discord server and with the conversations a lot of it is and that the meetups which we can't do right now you know a lot of it is you know to me to me the focus is on the community that i leave behind me and and the power of that community and obviously i just i just passed her a tiny little segment of this community i think that's great iii think in a way with the kind of these discord discussions and everyone and everything i think that's probably the best thing to do right now like i talked about the idea of consolidating what's happened in a way and trying to to now gather up you know the the pieces of things that have been transformed and tried to make them more more solid more just more coherent so i think that it's great like that if you've got this discord discussion and you've got people talking to each other and everything kind of an extension of the meetups because it's hard can't do meet up with everybody but to have a discord discord discussion is connect create something of that you know okay i know a discussion well and and to me the you know i look for people's motivation not just to so let's say have a little conversation whether it's by text or voice chat or even zoom but their desire to to begin to build something and so it was members of my local meetup who built the bridges of meaning discord server and and they've kind of they kind of coalesced around a bunch of people that i had zoom conversations with and posted on the channel and it's it's sort of built since there and and sort of that sort of becomes an estuary for me if people want to talk to me well even i you need it's even hard for to get a rando slot right now because i only have certain number each week and but i want to keep them open because then you know this is some of what you've taught me to and and jordan there's there's a real value in and leaving a space for that which i won't filter mmm-hmm into my life and it can't be everything but you can't have none hmm there needs to be a space because then through that space comes you know yeah surprise comes all kinds of things that you hadn't thought about things you hadn't considered for sure yeah so so well i guess two thoughts come to my number one you know is there will gosh is there gonna be a second wave and if so what let me jordan scott we said you know you had a couple tweets yesterday and i thought yeah he's he's you know this is this some of this pattern is jordan and you kind of see what's publicity and what you know they're just putting out to keep the social media machine playing and then what comes out now there there's some jordan behind yes and so it's possible he's working mostly working on his book well exactly and and so it's it's going to be very interesting to me because he okay so we had c 16 we had the election of trumps at trump and we had you know everything that we've had in clown world we've had joker now we had a pandemic now we're having a pandemic and so you know a big part of that wave jordans wave was also i mean the man and the moment found each other and and then i you know you're right he mean he c 16 the more i think about it was in so many ways exactly the right inflection point to hit something if you're gonna create a wave mm-hmm but the world that the sequel and it'll be interesting to see to what degree it is a sequel the world that the sequel comes into is a different oh yeah it's a different world for me you know as a pastor you know people come to me and okay so you listen to jordan and you got red pill door bread pilled or any other pill you want to conceive it as and you want to remake your life and you want to do things differently and you're gonna listen to jonathan pozzo you're going to need to there's going to need to be patterns habits disciplines institutions community if that shining moment of revelation that you experienced is going to bear any fruit at all it's going to have to and i really do i put that comment on twitter but your video of the seeds i thought if if i had to show people one someone who at least knew something one video to say what jonathan pojo what i think his message is boy that video was i thought well there's the seed of the jaw of the jonathan pojo plant well i don't even know what video is this the soils the parable of the soils oh the soil yeah the parable of the of the of christ as the sower yeah yeah that's right that's right yeah oh yeah i i think so i think you're right that that also because it has the meta pattern inside of it it has like it has a pattern as the meta pattern and it's christian yeah yeah i i i don't i'm curious to see like how i feel like this maybe i'm wrong but i feel like there isn't gonna be like a second wave i think there's gonna be something else i mean i think jordan will have his place in discourse oh you'll have his place in in the world but i don't see his second book having as big an effect and i don't see unless there's another controversy unless there's some controversy i don't i don't see i don't see i see i think i'll say something in that book you know at all yeah he'll touch people maybe but i it seems like there might be something else like there might be another i don't know what it's gonna be because you never know what it is until it happens yeah i think we just have to be ready to take advantage of whatever flashpoint is there which can create another level where can bring people to the next level or to create insight the right type of insight that needs to to happen and that's why i talked about consolidating because if you consolidate the people that you've been talking to then you know it for example like let's say you and myself the reason why it's parked us let's say is because we the soil was already prepared it was stuff that we were already thinking about or that that we already had our something in our life is prepared to kind of to take that and to move on to move with it you know and so i think that maybe that's how i see it now i think now is the time to plow the soil or to - to get people ready people who have already were already in the discussion already thinking you were already you know who have had some insights - for the next for the next moment where it's gonna jump again but i don't know what that's gonna be i have no idea yeah yeah i mean it could be because anything can happen right now it i mean people don't and when things start to accelerate in these weird chaotic moments it's there is no telling what's gonna what's gonna happen because if we if you had known if you could have known that let's say i don't know when maybe what's six years ago i would have told you trump drags it pandemic and the jordan peterson and you know people who were hardcore atheists all of a sudden have stopped being so aggressive when they they still hate religion but they feel like they can be as aggressive as they were you know even people like sam harris isn't as cocky as he was anymore yeah and i don't think maybe he wouldn't even acknowledge it but it's that's what it seems like yeah you know this this so i've been reading robert putnam wrote bowling alone and so eric had ross no he had a jd vance on his podcast and jd vance have you read hillbilly elegy okay you know who jd man says okay and and jd vance mentioned i mean it was it was just something very interesting to me so jd vance writes about his grandmother he grew up out in appalachia and his grandmother was you know she believed in god didn't go to church because the pastors were all you know hucksters and grifters but she you know she believed in god and she trusted that god would make things right and so on and so forth and and so of course for vance that caught his interest now he eventually know if he's i think he's in a roman catholic church now i'm not sure i mean every you know in terms of the big line and and i think you get this writer than most you know we're we're back to sacraments mm-hmm and we're back to icons and we're back to the imagination that imagination that's in a trust what i say that word we're we're back we're you know i saw this i saw this coming with protestants that seeker movement was sort of you know back to stripped out churches whose smoke machines using using proverbs to gain wisdom to get a little bit of credibility to sneak in the four spiritual laws and the sinner's prayer and then i watched in the response to that everybody suddenly wanting well i want one of these old church buildings with with architectural features and i want chanting and i we're gonna get a cantor and these are these are dutch reformed churches doing this and i'm watching this thinking what's what's going on there and so you're getting again and you talked about this before i saw anybody else talking about it kind of this this inversion this return and you know then i dreamed up chesterton's the last chapter before the conclusion of the everlasting man he talks about you know the seven deaths of christianity and and you talk about you know basically chesterton says christianity as many times died and then it keeps coming around again and i've heard you talk about this a number of times which is it's a process it's it's the duck we i could kind of color the double inversions it's the so a good a good example is that example that you said where the church decides that in order to reach out to the world it has to be more like the world right it has to be more like the people you're reaching towards and so it keeps so it but in order to do that it has to dilute itself it has to dilute itself in order to reach out you know and it's a form of of kenosis you could see it that way if you want to it's like an ending of yourself to move out but at some point there's a point where you reach a limit where it's like if i go one step further mm-hmm i'm not myself like i'm it's over like there's nothing and so the church the evangelical church is like oh we could use advertising techniques we could use you can use moviemaking techniques we could have dance we can have this got smoke machines we can have rock bands and then you get to the end where it's like okay you're still not as good as a rock band you're still not as good as a dance troupe you're still not as good as an advertising firm but you've come all this way and so now you're at the edge and the only place to go is now it's like well i actually forget where i've forgotten where i've come from and so there the move to remember is a normal move it's like it just kind of happens on its own i have to now remember what where i came from it's almost it's even there's even something in that in the idea of transgression itself where you can only be a rebel if there is authority and so rebellion ultimately ends up reinstating authority necessarily because the rebellion makes no sense if authority breaks down right and that's the whole idea of the clown to where at the end it's like the clown flips it back because it's it's like when you've made fun of everything and the whole world is a joke then the only thing left to make fun of is the joke itself you make fun of the joke and then it turns back and you come back to the king you know and people play that out in their lives i've often noted that in conservative christian reformed when conservative christian reform 'ti still existed and still those in some rural places it was the rebellious youth who became the authoritarians when they were they're older yeah and they were older yeah and and you just watch i seen that too i've seen that happen to teenagers who were so rebellious and then they become pastors and they're like that's how they are like they're hardcore and that even you see that people who convert to islam - you see that - a lot of people convert to islam are people who are like completely out there and then no and then i need something solid like i want something solid now yeah yeah and they become hardcore because yeah is lomb gives them those those bright lines and the traditions and it and it's all there well i i i've peppered you enough jonathan and you've been you've been gracious any anything you wanted to bring into this conversation we're like where'd you feel your ad in terms because i've now because you used to comment mostly what jordan was doing yeah and so he's been gone for like you know four six eight months even more and so what has been your driving force like what has been what has been the thing that keeps you discussing right now well i've been had jordan sort of well when he when he went on his book tour so i've been i read ross douthat book on decadence and i found that i found that really helpful to try and get a sense of what's really happened in the culture since the 70s you know i watched the joker moveme movie and i felt like i was watching my growing up and then i realized yeah he filmed that in newark new jersey i was watching my growing up years and and so trying to get a ross douthat peter thiel has had some interesting ideas about lack of progress mm-hm and and so i've been trying to get a handle on and again increasingly lately everything i think i'm looking for i start finding in chesterton and as a protestant who who is very dismissive of calvinists that can be unnerving in some places because chesterton made that point in i think it was the second chapter in his book entitled heretics that this world can't find the good can only sort of find the good in terms of opposite of the negative mmm-hmm because they can only see the negative and they can't see the thing that the negative is moving against it's their only think seeing things in its shadow and and so i've been doing a lot of thinking about the last the last 60 years of history the 60s to the 70s to the 80s to the 90s and and then now and how okay everybody everybody wants to be progressive what what exactly are you progressing towards oh yeah my goodness because then i you know i i'll here i'll watch the and i think the the pandemic has taken some of the wind out of the progressive this sales right now yeah hard to know where that will actually go but okay so what exactly is your tell us what exactly what beyond the code the the the heat death of the universe do you actually want yeah and so that's and so i've been you know i've been thinking a lot about that and on one and also continuing on my my god number one and god number two because thinking and this is where you know i wind up with a bunch of roman catholics which again what do i do with that with my dutch calvinism no i'm not converting all you people that have been cheering for that in the comment section but what do we mean when we use this word god and again your work has been tremendously helpful for me to and to understand that that in some weird way god is everywhere and nowhere and the whole earth is full of his glory but the you know all of creation does not exhaust him by any means and noting in you know i've been it's been very interesting watching television shows like the good place and upload watching humanity's crisis of confidence that even if we had everything our way we are finally a shallow cup that is too shallow to actually contain the desires that the universe that we desire and that sort of backs me into cs lewis's argument for just from desire that deep in our hearts we know we were made for more then even what our imaginations now cast on screens with with zeros and ones that we think we can make anything in the in the virtual space and then we discover no we we are we're bumping into our own limitations again and so that to me then leads back to the the nihilistic despair of humanity that if if we are finally the own there's no finally and there's finally no agent above us or beyond us then we are then we are locked in a prison of our own despair mm-hmm and and this to me just opens up you know christianity and what the whole story is about yeah yeah that makes sense that makes a lot of sense and so are you seeing in the discussion that's remaining let's say glimmers of that because i saw you were kind of you were kind of listening to the portal and you were you know breaking down some of the things they're talking about trying to find some some moments that express more let's say a desire for more like you said do you see cuz it i'm curious like what is this the solution like what is the solution that is for example like the the on the on the portal like what is the i was listening to one of the videos we did where he was taught i don't forget we was talking to and he was talking about telling people that he should have kids or something like if you have kids then that will give you meaning and everything and and i kept there was something so fragmentary about that type of thing where it's like it's like yeah okay but you know i don't think that that's enough i mean i don't think that people will feel like that that that's enough and also why like is it just to follow some biological drive to to to to reproduce and if so then what what's all this other stuff like what's this all this whole other thing that's going on this whole civilization thing this whole art thing this whole what is that like what is going on you know if we find meaning in the being in you know reproducing the species because we're programmed to do that i don't i don't there's more don't you worry obviously agree with me but yeah look that's so he was talking to ryan holiday who ryan holiday is doing youtube videos on stoicism and again if when i was in when i was first learning what who stoics were if you had told me that in 2020 there would be a stoicism movement on youtube yeah and you're gonna talk to the stowe i mean so you're gonna talk to say anything to them yeah and and the funny thing about stoicism is they have so here's all this wisdom about and and i listen to their wisdom and i think yeah that's wisdom this is this is stuff that you can hear jordan peterson tell you that you can get from marcus aurelius they can get from all of these people but but where stoicism finally sort of bottoms out is that yeah if you have a kid and if you love that kid don't forget that proviso because i get i think part of the part of the v hangover and post christendom is that christianity shamed us into a certain level of love that society continues to maintain that yet to abandon your kids you're still a schmuck and we all know that so so suddenly the having of that child and parenting of that child begins to have a sacramental effect because and and one of the first people i talked to after i made my first video was someone who lives near er and i had lunch with him and he said you know this was a guy who was studying for the ministry and then he got to a point in reading all of the protestant theology and he said i don't believe any of it and then he listened to sam harris and he went through the whole thing with okay and then he met a woman had a kid and began to realize in himself i'm and i've talked to a lot of people like this what if something happens to my kid i love my kid that kid isn't just a bunch of atoms and and and something in the real a ship with my child suggests that it's not merely a psychological trick or an evolutionary product that i am bounded to this child but there's something in this moment that connects heaven and earth and i am deeply disturbed by that realization and it's not going to leave me alone until i get an answer that is satisfying and so here's so i listen to eric talked to ryan holiday about what these people need to do is have kids and i think yeah i've got five of them they're that they're you know it's sort of like the like stories of old you keep using those tools yeah it's some going you know the tool that at some point the stones start talking to you yeah oh yeah that's it that's a great that's a great way to put it and there's a reason why stoicism failed like it failed in the sense that it failed to make civilization it it's a it's like it has use used to it but stoicism only really succeeded when it was bound within christianity because a lot of people will tell you that christianity is a is actually a large largely of akin to stoicism that's the better right a kid there yeah there it's a kid too stoicism there are aspects of so sysm within christianity but stoicism doesn't offer you doesn't offer you a tour ii to live in it doesn't offer you a story to exist in and the same thing within your plate inist like the neoplatonist just couldn't they just couldn't break through because because it was a theory and it was a bunch of you know this it was a theory about the about reality but it wasn't an enacted story wasn't an enacted something that you entered into and it didn't create the type of communion that would bind people together and so you have marcus aurelius being a stoic you know on his own and whining that everybody is you know and and and and complaining that everybody's is a degenerate but like we wouldn't say it that way but you know like just being this like you know taking the world on his shoulders and doing his thing you know taking it all on himself but it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't come together which which is exactly i've watched enough christians deconstruct which is what i find exactly what happens to people who deconstruct from christianity so they sort of become stoics and they they take the world on their shoulders and they're really frustrated with everyone who's who's not pulling their share and not doing you know not not carrying the load with them and it's like and and so then i get to agustin and so yeah manichaean ism and when you people always use manichaean as a as kind of an exact kind of an illustration of dualism go would look what the mannequins believe it's wild stuff and and then and then of course neoplatonism but i think you said it's work so wow here's this incredibly brilliant fought through neoplatonist image of the world but if you read confessions talk about a book dripping with pathos right and relation and you know so so john john very key and i just had just at a conversation last week and i think the conversation went very well and so we're where john and i sort of you know come up against each other is exactly this this question of personhood and in your conversation with john which which was was quite esoteric but i thought i really enjoyed it and and i thought you nailed it right on the head when you said you know it's person person person you get past a certain point it's gonna be person up and person down you know if you want to say it's it's impersonal beyond this point well you can say that but you can't know it anyway because you're just a human being and you know in you know in my conversation i just finished with with brett shackled i'm gonna post yours tomorrow or brett's tomorrow but you know we i think i think the thing that we finally come down to it we never see really get past genesis 3 that in a sense the genesis 3 story is about a conspiracy theory in all that the snake does is say you know just makes a few suggestions and frame it in a certain way and can we finally trust our maker can we finally trust it can we as tiny little scared creatures finally surrender our hearts and say this is what i am this is and and and and i no matter how much money and power and technology and all the stuff that this world has to offer for jesus and all this debt this is this is what i am and what my heart desires is to is to love and be loved and you know neoplatonism agustin didn't end there for a reason and i so i watched the stoics and i think i'd rather have my neighbor be a stoic than a hedonist yeah i'd still rather they be a good christian who gives lay down lays down their life for their neighbor all the way up to and including their enemy yeah no i i agree and i think that like i think that it just that's one of the reasons why it happened the way did that one of the reasons why neoplatonism and crit and stoicism were taken into christianity because it offered that it offered the story it offered the the pathos and it offered the personalism like if you want to say it that way it offered the fact that the world actually manifests itself through personal categories you could say it that way which is that and and and it really is the idea you could say of intelligences you know that's how we talk about so we talked about principalities and angels that the world actually manifests itself through intelligences it's not concepts like the way that that the kind of let's say the kind of basic platonic way of understanding it that there are these like form that are something like concepts that are kind of like these but no they're intelligences they're the world manifests itself by through intelligences and once you kind of get that then all of a sudden you realize well there's a reason why because the stoic a stoic doesn't have to worship and they don't worship but it also means if you don't celebrate then you don't come together it's just not it's just very simple the world is a celebration is the beginning of reality it's the way that reality it's the it's the relevance realization worship is relevance realization oh that's what worship is it is it is it is celebrating the disclosure of of of the source of how things come together and are one and exists in love like you could say it that way and so i think that that's why that's why worship even that and that's one of the things in my conversation with john that i was trying to kind of pull out of him which you know maybe is a bit is a bit is a bit tricky on my part but i was trying to pull out of him that even even non theistic religions like certain strands of buddhism or taoism that if they posit the highest in terms of non-being it still manifest itself as beings all the way down and so it's like okay so you say that ultimate reality in in terms of buddhism is a form of annihilation okay but then there are all these bodhisattva's like that start right at the door of annihilation all the way down to hell you have this like araki of beings that come down and it's the same in taoism and it's the same in hinduism and it's the same in every religion understands the world as a hierarchy of beings and the hierarchy of intelligences and not and and that means that it has to do with celebration and love and devotion also it's not just that it's not only that but it's also part of it right it's not just story but you can't get rid of story it's not just devotion but you can't get rid of devotion and i think you know i think folk religion you know one of the things that always interested me about when i first started watching friends and neighbors you know start getting all excited about american style buddhism was i thought no wait a minute you know you go you go you go over there and you take a look at those buddhists and i remember when there was a jetliner that was broken down on a runway and the buddhist monks came out and sacrificed a goat to get that you know sucker moving again and i thought oh wait a minute wait a minute oh my oh my western secular friends are going to these places and meditating and do all that because this religiosity that's you know that's all the problematic stuff but those are buddhists sacrificing and go on an airstrip yes why is that happening well i always say that my catholic grandmother was more buddhas than all these california judas for sure well and that gets into the idea folk religion where we're you know so so jd vance's meemaw was you know a protestant folk religionist in many ways but but there's a there's a you know even though she didn't go to church there was there was at least still a haunting of an inclination of what you just described that she was that she was not going to in some ways the entire artifice of what we've seen as new atheism is so fragile because it can it can sort of only be maintained as a grudge i'm serious about that no you're right you're totally right it can only be maintained as i'm i'm not going to worship yeah and all your videos are debunking yeah yeah okay let's see it's kind of like dealing with a two-year-old it says you know i'm not gonna eat anymore all right hey go for it i'll talk to you tomorrow i'll take your dinner away yeah yo p baby but do you see that yeah you see that in the end you end up having the atheist today they have to end up saying things like was a the dawkins who said i'm a culturally christian atheist and then jejak who says he's a christian atheist and you're gonna end up having that error or who's the other guy the the crowds guy i'm horrible with names the the problem with the one who wrote the strange death of europe what's his name oh douglas yeah so douglas murray he's the same as he is like i'm a christian atheist you're gonna get you're gonna get a lot more of that but then it also but then it and it hopefully it plays itself out right because there's at some point when you say at some point when you say it's like there's this real reality okay great mean that has appeared online i think it was like mike serna [ __ ] you posted it that i saw at least and it was you know that exploding mind meme where it's it's like the mind keeps getting bigger and more bright and then it's like you keep getting more and more intelligent or whatever and it and it was it was basically about god and it the first one was i believe in god it's like a little brain and then it says i don't believe in god and like a bigger brain then he says i believe that god is a useful construct you know for keeping societies together and is a bigger brain and then the other one is that without god society breaks down and everything like falls to hell and then the last ones like well i believe in god because like what what do you mean it's up so that's not real like that's not real that if you don't have god or you don't have some religion then everything falls apart that's not a real thing that's a real thing that's a real thing in the world and it actually happens just like symbolism now so that's what i've been i just i just keep i just keep i just keep it at some yeah yeah yeah cuz i can't get enough of it and and people like you and and others indulge my indulge my itch by making me no longer be able to watch donkey kong with any kind of the innocence i had before yeah well i have a people i have a lot like just today i was talking with some people that my kind of top patrons and and one of the guys kyle i think he was on your your your channel and so he i think he watches you and he was he was talking about and he was actually giving me a frame that i might want to bring up with you right now because he was because one of the problems that i've been trying to understand in terms of symbolism it's just hard because we're in it right now is to understand the flip that happened during the pandemic cuz it's a it's very odd right it's very odd you had you had a moment in march mmm where all the left-leaning all the liberal types we're saying it's evil to shut the border it's racist xenophobic it's all this bla bla bla bla bla and the people who were conservatives were saying no this is a serious pandemic we got to shut it down and then it flipped completely upside down like the whole thing the whole discourse complete changed and then all of a sudden it was the people who were were on the left were saying we need to shut down forever two years like it's gonna this is never gonna come back it's never gonna change and then the others are saying you free i need to be free like like you can't shut us down this is government tyranny valo and i thought wow it's in it's crazy how how it totally flipped and then he said that you were talking about the strength and compassion right yeah so the republicans the republicans you know exactly what's gonna happen watch the 2016 republican candidates debate each other about who should be at the head of the party and then look at the twenty twenty democrats that big field debate each other the the republicans the republicans always sort of manifest strength hmm we are about strength and so donald trump you know wants to manifest strength and the democrats kindness compassion and so you know republicans we're going to fund you we can't put enough money towards national security we can't we can't spend enough money on keeping ourselves safe even though the united states spends more than the next six countries combined the democrats we can't spend enough money throwing it at suffering people because if they're suffering you know we're sure that that some amount of money will fix it mm-hm and i think part of what happens in a pandemic is that both get exposed hmm and and so you know the shutdown well you know for a while i mean when trump was running for office you know one of the things he was gonna end is the national deficit because there's gonna be so much money coming in and yeah yeah yeah and and so now of course then the dems are all worried about the deficit and now you know well we just you know four trillion dollars in one fell swoop and now the dems are back and wanting to do another three trillion and and so everything's all inverted you're exactly right because well well what what are you afraid of and you know in in a sense at least the the republicans are afraid of their loss of liberty and the dems are afraid of losing their life because you know it's it's been very interesting again this gets it this gets into so in in 1960 john fitzgerald kennedy the democratic senate senator from massachusetts ran for president of the united states and the dominant concern was can we elect a roman catholic right in 2004 another jfk john kerry the democratic senator from massachusetts who was also a celebrated war veteran ran for president on the democratic ticket and most catholics didn't vote for him in 2020 we're going to have a friesian so that's my mother side friesians they're germans and dutch we're going to have a frisian who his most abiding church connection was the reformed church in america so donald trump religiously is my cousin okay yeah region yeah oh gosh reformed the enormous vincent peale prosperity gospel hmm running against joe biden who of course is a roman catholic and joe biden goes to church more than donald trump okay now all of these church labels what on earth do they mean i mean anything anymore yeah and well here's the question and so then tom hollands work comes through his book dominion which is a very interesting book he basically comes through and says which really annoys the secularists you know how deeply christian our entire society is you know we can't christianity runs through everything that we're doing all of our fights are in a sense within christianity oh yeah that's an equal opportunity because the secularists you know say no it's the enlightenment in' and somehow our culture is a clean room artifact of the greeks and tom holland says hey i've spent my life writing stuff about the greeks we're nothing like the greeks oh yeah my goodness no and and on the other side the christians are saying no we've you know christian people are this is how you define christian people by their religiosity and it's like well you know there's there's a lot of stuff about religiosity that it isn't merely religiosity either and so we have inversions all over the place right now no you're right and and it's but but i thought the topsy-turvy like that i guess that's the the problem of the topsy-turvy world is things just keep flipping and you don't know and it's like juggling it's you know you don't know what's going on i think some things are out things are down and so it's it'll be interesting to see how it's going to to play out but there was still like it was interesting the way that he had framed it based on your categories i thought it was a good idea he said when at the beginning that the republicans were acting out of strength by saying we're gonna shut our borders right right and the democrats were acting out of compassion by saying no no we need to let people in yeah and then when it flipped their ciliate we're using the same the same the same reason like so that the person the republican is saying you know oh no i'm gonna be strength i can't let someone control me i need to go outside and not wear a mask and do that and the other is saying no you need to protect others and save lives and isolate yourself to save lives and so it ends up being the same motivation which is creating the opposite the opposite reaction yep and so it's fascinating to watch it it's really fascinating to watch it and it'll you know it's crazy when we said it'll have like you know what what do you think you know and i think in some ways you know because i think i think a fair amount about i mean the the the rising of the or knocks church with envy within the church landscape in america is fascinating to me and you know especially in the light of this because i think about rod dreher how you know rod drear goes to his priest and says you know we want to we want to practice you know roman catholic family planning and his priest rolls his eyes and says oh you're one of those and you know within not too long roger ear will be orthodox so you know so in a sense what we've seen is that we used to have these labels like roman catholic john kennedy is roman catholic and that label stood for something there was a witness there that by the time of john kerry the witness is completely do you know diluted yeah and now the awards were i think rod rares analysis of this situation is the best i think that i mean his vision is that to a certain extent they're right now what's really happening is that there are christians who take it seriously and they're christians who don't who base their motivation on their faith and there are christians who base their motivation on other factors that they base it on other factors and those christians that base their motivation on their faith they end up seeing each other across denominations and so it's like i feel more akin and a lot of worth attacks might be annoyed that i'll say that but i feel way more akin even with evangelical who who wants to get rid of the sins in his life and wants to be faithful to his wife and wants to to worship god the way he thinks it's he's capable of doing who wants his culture to be coherent i feel more akin to that person and i do too some greek orthodox nominal orthodox who goes to church three times a year and you know it's like guy i yeah so i can see you across the the across the lane and i'm like why you know it we disagree on things but i i can see you and the other person is just like me but we're getting so now work and relevance realization because we're trying to figure out what it is what's the pattern like what what is the thing that's making this this is disappear as a pattern right because we're the first things people who are these who are these yeah who are these american conservative rod dreher tides like we're how is it that they're in the weird communion but they don't go to church together they wouldn't take the chalice together there but they still feel a sense of weird and a lot of a lot of these types of people are nanak you mental is actually like we we don't believe in a humanism but we actually see each other across the lines and say one of the reasons why i feel like into you is because you take your difference with me seriously right and you're willing to we'd actually have to like talk it out and take it seriously instead of saying it doesn't matter it's all good like whatever let's all have a big a big party and just forget about our differences as if that does anything and i think some of that so chuck you know who chuck colson is he was one of richard nixon's hatchet men he wrote this book born-again yeah i've heard of that book yeah so so when born again you know chuck colson comes to his wife and says i'm a christian and his wife looks at him is like you're episcopalian you know no no now really so and and i think in a lot of ways what we've been working on for the last 60 years now in an ecumenical frame is what is what is it what is what is what is that thing what is that thing that that binds an eastern orthodox icon carver with a dutch reformed from an iconoclastic background because of course they smashed half the monasteries and defect you know laughing and and i and my like denomination is you know conservative enough that there are some quarters where van der clay is talking to an icon carver doesn't doesn't jonathan pojo make idols and oh conversation so but that's part of exactly what we're in right now and it's manifest in the strange the strange ecumenism that is happening at this level because a lot of what's been passed off as ecumenical conversations we look at and say i'm not really interested in that because it's it's just it's like a weird fluffy pretend it's like you're pretending yeah yeah i think there's an honesty about maybe at this level that we're trying to identify there's an honesty right there's an honesty about actual differences in actual resemblances instead of just trying to to to cast it all aside i remember having a discussion when i was here it was really i was young i was in orthodox like i was evangelical and i remember meeting a catholic guy and he was like oh christians we just all need to come together we just all need to be together and together and and i was like well i said i know some christians who think that when you pray to mary you're praying did the devil and so what do you do with that and you said oh well they just have to put that aside well i'm like well i don't know what to tell you because that doesn't work that way like you you can't just throw everything out that's debts deal with it let's talk about it we might disagree but if you just say let's pretend like it's not there you know it's like pat it ends up you know it'll look really nice for a little while and then it'll be all passive-aggressive from then on well and to me this gets back to one of the earlier things that i saw in jordan where he says you know first you act it out and i think that gets into worship what we talked about and sacramentality because okay let's all be together so so let's go let's go worship at your house today and you come in and oh there's the statue and jesus is up on the cross and all you know start to get a little bit of nervous and you know people are dipping in the holy water and and at what point will something inside of me say okay there's the line i can't cross that line yet exactly and and but but at least there is a line yes yeah because in a sense what we what we sort of what began wandering into you know because this inversion seems very much to have something kicked off in the 60s that got us going in here there so so where exactly is the line and what is the line and what is that what is that line really connected to and harfa how far up and down does that line there we go and will you actually live by that line hmm not at all so arbitrary it has to do it i think a lot of it has to do with honesty i think that i think a lot of it had to do with honesty and that's what makes like i said just that's what makes us able to see each other across the line is that you're not pretending you know that this is like you for example like if i brought you to an orthodox church you wouldn't pretend that it's all fine you'd be like okay that's this is my line and so we can actually talk about it you know like i went to i went to this year i went to like a christmas service one of the christmas services in a major kind of pentecostal type evangelical church and it was and it was more like a big play but he was still in the church and and and it was like the whole time was like i'm gonna you know and then it was like it's it's kept happening and then when the acrobats came out i was like that's it this is my line like this is the line where i'm like nope nope when i've got the girls like dropping from like the cloth ins in leotards in the church i'm like that's it like i just that i just can't i just can't i'm not here anymore i'm just not here anymore so i could imagine like you said but then if i if i saw the pastor of that church was a very who someone has extreme integrity and is extremely impressive in terms of his life and terms of his devotion you know i can still see him across the line but i'm not gonna pretend like it's fine that that i think it's fine he has acrobats in his church i'm not [laughter] well and and to me as you know so so when i listen to people talk about me and other things they'll say well he's this he's this pastor who's high in openness and it's like i'm not sure that's always a good thing but i've always i've always as a protestant wondered so why is it okay to bring the donkey into the building and have the christmas pageant but it's idolatry to have a picture of a donkey in stained glass you know and and so oh you're so right you're so right but i i really like i yeah i i really do think that one of the reasons if you are honest about what you believe and you're honest about what your limits are and you don't pretend and you know what it is then i think that that permits a lot of openness and he permits it from its indefinite openness because you're open to a certain level you know like i couldn't have a discussion i think like i could have a discussion with anybody yeah but i doesn't mean that i have to concede the things that are important to me just because i'm having the discussion you know and so so i think that that's it like if you're honest and and you know what you believe and you know what you are then you actually have a lot of room to talk to other people yeah yeah no i and again people sometimes ask me because they're surprised that i'm a pastor and i'm like this and i think that's surprising but you know i learned so much of this from my father because i learned from him exactly what you just said if you know who you are and you know what you believe then the other person's whatever it is they are and are saying and doing it doesn't really threaten you hmm because that's them and you're you and you actually know the difference between them and you a lot of people don't what did you know and but it ends up manifesting itself in all kinds of ways where for example you know let's say people who just to accept tradition from other cultures it's like you're deluding yourself you it'd be way better for you to say well you know what like that like the sacrificing of the goats no i don't want that like i don't i don't want that i don't think that's okay i want a mechanic not i'm not a goat sacrifice that until once you at least say no that i think is then you can have an actual discussion but if you pretend like it's all okay like you have no idea how weird other people's other people's way of doing things is right you have no idea like there are cultures where people still beat their wives and so you would have to at some point saying well they don't know that no i don't that's that's not acceptable right and so it's better to just know and then then but then i could talk to a guy who beats his wife like i could have a discussion with him you know and i but i wouldn't agree with his behavior but i can talk with the murderer i could talk with the with that with with with people who live in a way that i disagree with you know i don't feel like i need to to pure it to keep myself pure from anything that's not like me yeah yeah well yeah yeah no i agree i agree well we've done that we've done almost two hours two hours you you really pull me like two because i usually i never have like to our conversation so he's like after an hour i start being like okay you know we've gone through everything but would you got me going for two hours it's awesome and laughing the whole time joe joe rogan watch yourself baby well jonathan so we should give you it not that not that my you can of course post this on your blog to us and on your channel to us send you the file but you know you've got your blog going and it's that is that on your regular domain you can get there from your regular say the symbolic on the now it's gonna be my things are gonna start to focus on my website so this symbolic worldcom i'm gonna start to have more things there you know articles and also if i appear on other channels and so i'm gonna start to consolidate that in that and on that website so it's gonna become the place you still think they're gonna they're gonna clamp down and take youtube away from us i think they're good i think they're going to do it very slowly and i think it's already happened i think it's already happening i've seen it happen i saw i did you know it's like obviously they can probably their algorithm could probably identity identifying with join peterson they identify me with more conservatives and i saw like i did a video i it was called is christianity a cuckold religion right and the video was really trying to explain a pattern but i think the fact that i used that word and i'm already kind of associated probably with more right-leaning stuff and everything i saw it happened in real time the video took off in like i had like 20,000 views in one day and then it stopped and they just went flat and i thought oh okay what's going on and then from then on i've seen my views like kind of hold at a certain amount of views and i part of it is the fact that during peterson's gone that's for sure but part of it is also i think you know i don't think it's a human decision i think it's just their algorithm just starts just marginalizes people who who are not in line with what they want so i think it's already happening and it's better for them if i was if their strategic it's better for them to keep you on their platform but make you as marginal as possible because that way you're not putting the effort into finding other platforms you know yeah yeah that's what i think is going on there there really isn't a because there really isn't a platform competitor nope like youtube there really isn't like i upload all my stuff on [ __ ] you but [ __ ] you [ __ ] shoot is crap it's a just not well done it's not well programmed the search is not good you know there's no recommendation the way that youtube recommends video so it's hard to get more reach outside of your reach and so you there is no competitor so i don't know i don't really know yeah and think spot is just not it's just not panning out it's just say you know i respect what they're doing and i and i respect the fact that they're putting in all this effort but if you go on there yeah you know even the most famous person has very few reactions yeah oh well well we'll just got along well yeah grace of god that's right it's that's that's being a christian helps me not worry too much about these things cuz there you go as here we are in right now but thank you jonathan thank you for your time and and most of all again thank you for the work that you do because i i think it's really important and i think it's excellent work and you really do help me see the world in a different way you inform my bible reading you inform my culture watching and you've just opened up whole new vistas for me that apart from you i don't know that i'd see so thank you well thanks and thanks for all the insane work you put into these discussions and i hope that we will meet in person we were supposed to and now it might not happen but i let's hope that we get to meet lord willing one way or another i believe it will happen and i look forward to that day all right all right bye paul thank you jonathan bye-bye
