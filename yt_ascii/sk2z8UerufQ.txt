okay hold on can we do one more video can we just do one more short video it's very very good can i show you my favorite my favorite internet tech video of all time dude where's randy where the hell is randy randy web def it is like literally the best it is the best video of all time did wendy get rid of it randy oh you're right all right let's catch you up to speed oh sent to the bold quest to learn how to create a website in exchange for some time okay hold on if you've never seen randy all right let's catch you up to speed oh sent to the bold quest to learn how to create a website in exchange for some kind of book or something i don't know this little [ __ ] gave me 14 days to do it and in the first seven i managed to script together a proof of concept with the help of it's not cultural appropriation is it they have a very basic understanding of web development a bit only functioning website and seven more days to deliver a final product if i don't deliver on time well it's time but have no fear we've got a whole seven days to kill five days to kill by the end of the timeline here's what a one finish extremely clean funny clue from hitting the landing page the final thank you message very clear vision for what this website is about and what my goals are beyond my being dedicated dude this this is literally me every single time i think i have a project it's like awesome music is playing things are fantastic it never ends that way things yes as well as do a bunch of sign optimizations to make everything load quicker and all around just be nicer to use so let's go first off funny floyd believe it or not the site actually works at the moment but the live version of the website isn't using the live key for strike so i can't actually collect payments it's all just test data at the moment but to change that all i've got to do is go into the live keys like those bad boys in and oh what are we going to use to test now so to the rescue you can literally pop open a new branch use that as a preview site with the test keys in the preview the live in the production and we're ready to rumble ladies and gents nice to make sure the flow for that was working i put my own car details to the live site and just like that i sacrificed one dollar from my own card i mean it's just gonna come back to me anyway boy now i've just noticed a little buggy oh [ __ ] disgusting bugs one dollar even though it's a recurring subscription doesn't qualify for the membership page for a membership it's 5 aud in above right but then why am i still getting the membership fish let's look into it and also since there's other currencies how do i go about setting limits in the other currencies as well it seems like a little bit of a rabbit hole that i'm gonna go down i began by literally just hard coding the five aussie lower equivalent in all the currencies that i support on the page at the moment that way it's actually a consistent amount you're not doing anyway conversions every single recurring thing so it's not going to be inconsistent like that next up was deciding a minimum transaction again they would have just took the 106. currencies and now currency dependent just like that see how wasn't so hard was it but while doing that i also noticed that there's no way of putting in decimals at the moment obviously that's a bit of a known though decimals are cool why in the can i not get this text input auto sales correct let's put that on hold for the time being shelly there are bigger fishies to fry like member benefits unbenefit remember is if you get this discord roll which gives you access to the sub cake mud i have absolutely zero clue on how to hook that up get up to three hours of reading the discord api docs and looking around on some code i've come to the conclusion that this is indeed a problem for future randall the man the myth the well-slept legend wow looks like he knows what he's doing maybe he'll have better luck making some progress i bet he's had a good night future randy no not at all discord can suff my pee pee but i tell you what let's continue on with that funding slowly for starters i really like to get the total amount displaying on the landing page so i went ahead and did that yeah or style it properly later but for now it's allowed to look like now i just remembered yesterday i was working on that whole sense business so after polishing up some code i got that bad boy working now you can plop that center mount in and there we have it a recurring mount of 7.24 cents it turns out strobe sets up a recurring payment by these things called products the way we actually alter the amount of the subscription in the end is just by having a base one dollar amount and changing that quantity so the recurring payments can only be multipliers of that dollar amount in other words since a goddamn useless oh well i never really like sense anyway we can still use them for the one-time donors but for the recurring amount that's another day down the drain and i still haven't tackled this funding flow yet i swear to god i'm gonna finish this by the end of the day if it's if it's the death of me i styled up the fun preview on the landing page and added this little call to action here so that way when people first come to the site they can be like oh what's this then clickity clackity they call me mr market man whether nothing actually happens is a completely different story or what a man can really do is speculate after that was done i got sick and tired of looking at this really disgusting article so i decided to give it a revamp and this this literally took me five goddamn hours there were just so many little issues like getting this preview text to start in the right place and the articles weren't updating properly then to top it all off trying to get this [ __ ] into css was just a goddamn nightmare because well between you and me i have no idea what the [ __ ] i'm doing but i'm glad i did it because i went a lot of new things and i reckon i'll finally be able to tackle that disco integration i was talking about earlier tomorrow i'm going to bed good night i feel refreshed three days thank you he's in a row to that i say the only reason i'm actually wearing pants to begin with is because i'm recording a video by the holy moly guacamole do i finally understand this now now i've gone and set up a discord mod wish that i can use the library discord.js to make it go beep boop and give a roll to a user automatically what riddled me this how in the freaking heck and flip am i supposed to get a user's id now i could just get them to copy and paste it over by going into settings turning on developer mode clicking on that person copy paste but you know that's not exactly the most straightforward thing for little timmy over here foreign too baby do i actually know how to use a wolf too no randy what's a wolf too you ask the question we're just going to use the library so we don't actually have to worry about it introducing next author js a library for lazy people who don't know how to implement authentication properly like me except it's not unsuitable maybe it is simple maybe i'm just maybe i'm the simple one so after spending an entire day trying to mess around with that scaring the docks for any semblance of what i'm after and finally there it is there it is boys that right there discord id baby that's an excellent accomplishment pat on the backs all round but i've still got to get the gitlab id somehow and this library is a bit icky wacky when it comes to authenticating multiple accounts so eventually after sleeping on it i managed to figure out a really scuffed way of determining whether it's discord or gitlab with their sign in now you've been warned okay this implementation is not for the faint of heart if it starts with the discord.com then it's discord else if oh this is genius why didn't i think of this before i was blinded by my ego next up what is going to be the best way of i mean i know a way i'm gonna do index of we can literally do that dot index of i don't know how [ __ ] javascript works discord get lab so scarf but it works surely surely this works we're compiling we've compiled everyone prepare uranus discord login thank you get lab login yes yes we've done it holy [ __ ] it works yes i'm a genius does this not feel like every one of your projects you have ever done in your entire lifetime like this man is the greatest youtube video smith of all time this is how i feel every time i do it it's like ah discord's not going to be that hard two days later you're like i don't even get it why am i still wearing the same pants for three days straight now we just literally told the discord but to his son deep randy.gg roll to the user id tell gitlab to add this [ __ ] to each repository and bada bing bada boom completely automated perks baby you have no idea how proud i am of myself for actually figuring that out on my own but that's been plaguing me for this entire week another funny quotes well you've went to this time to make things look pretty made the membership sexy as hell and optimize it for mobile flexboxes are so goddamn useful holy [ __ ] taki mushrooms with that i've officially evolved into a css mega chat if only my high school i.t teacher big jen would see me now and then did the same thing for the landing page except i'm really just gonna need to do something about this background it doesn't work in this aspect ratio and of course the fun page got the same treatment and then i went about ah well that's why i don't set deadlines well future randy will take care of that one website you've created here i tell you what you get a gold sticker and have a look at what came in the map i mean have here you go you've entered readings for [ __ ] nerds [music] [laughter] ah what's wrong with me okay that was really that was it's just it's just so funny oh that was just so funny if you don't know randy you gotta go subscribe i don't i i didn't even have anything to say other than this just felt this just feels this feels like every project ever created of all time all right let's get back let's actually do a little bit of project ourselves we've spent entirely too much time let's do rust serverless you know we're gonna do an mpa okay multi-page application purely server side rendered no client-side let's go okay why is he inactive he's actually just starting to get active again i've reached out to old randall i've this is my site account okay this is my sat account i'm subscribed to him i swear i'm subscribed to him okay this is not what this looks like okay this is not what this looks like this is not i'm just saying this is totally like watch this when i switch accounts you're gonna immediately see that i am indeed subscribed okay subscribed yeah see even like the video all right that's enough of this hey this has been a randall's good stuff
