hello everyone and welcome we are sitting inside of the 2023 nissan z now you'll notice there's not a number preceding that z unlike the previous 370z or 350z 300 cx 240z so each of those numbers used to represent the engine size in liters so the 370z had a 3.7 liter engine well we can't do that anymore because this has a 3 liter v6 and that would make it a 300 z and we've already had a 300 cx so we are at the nissan z so let's start there let's start with the engine and work our way through this new machine so this has a three liter twin turbo v6 revving to 6800 rpm unlike the previous 3.7 liter which revved up to 7 500 rpm and was naturally aspirated so the strategy now is two small very high revving turbos they rev over 200 000 rpm these turbos so small but high revving that gives you response versus you know if you want a large turbo you get big power but then your downside is you have lots of turbo lag so small turbos used here in order to minimize lag and we are now at 400 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque so about a 20 increase in horsepower and a 30 increase in torque from the previous generation and more importantly if you look at the torque curves this engine is hitting peak torque at just 600 rpm all the way to 5200 rpm and at 5200 rpm is where the previous generation actually hits peak torque so we're at peak torque long long before the previous generation thanks to these small turbos that rev up very quickly and give you plenty of boost and so we have more power now this engine is not new it is the same engine used in the infiniti q50 so you can think of this in some ways as a 370z that's had an engine swap and it now has this twin turbo 3 liter engine with that engine the only mechanical difference aside from a different ecu and you know tuning unique to this vehicle the mechanical difference is that it has a recirculating valve for the intake so when you're on the throttle and then you let off you're not dumping that wasted boost and just throwing it out into the atmosphere you send it back into the intake and then recirculate it and so that gives you a little bit more preparation so say you're going through a gear shift you can hold on to some of that pressure and not have as much lag between shifts getting back to full boost so the one mechanical difference versus q50 is that they've added that recirculating air intake valve so that you can have better boost as you go through these shifts or as you let off throttle and then get back onto throttle as far as the engine it's actually better than i thought it was going to be i'm not a huge fan of turbocharged engines overall i love naturally aspirated engines and if you have to have more power i like supercharged engines just because of how controlled they are as far as response the the right pedal does exactly what you want it to and you get it very quickly it's not bad in here but you definitely obviously have turbo leg right you put your foot down and there's kind of like two stages i mean this is a decent size engine three liters so you get some immediate torque and then you wait a little bit and then you get that turbo boost and it's kind of this like two-step process where it goes one here we are at naturally aspirated power and then boop both those turbos spool up very quickly and then you get to your next power level so it is noticeable on track driving i didn't really have a problem with throttle modulation in the manual transmission car but it was a bit challenging for me honestly in the automatic transmission car so i felt like when i was in the automatic i had it where i couldn't quite figure out exactly how much throttle to give it and reason being is i would overshoot my target so i think okay i'm gonna give it this much throttle and i'd end up stepping out the rear end now part of that could be when i was in the automatic you have your normal and sport mode i had it in sport mode and they may just tune the throttle there a bit too aggressively where it's more of an on off switch rather than like a linear progression of power as you get your foot on again turbos make that harder to do and then automatics make that harder to do it's searching for the right gear at these times so there's a variety of reasons why you could have that happening but personally i found easier to control throttle in the manual especially on track and not get the rear end kicked out as much so let's get into the transmission options we are riding in the manual so this is the six-speed manual it's basically carry over from the previous 370z there's a couple small changes so they have updated the synchronizers for gears one and two and they've tried to make shifting a bit more response a bit more crisp they've added a few elements in order to change the shifting feel and make shifting through one and two also feel improved with those updated synchros now the automatic is completely new to the z so it is now the nine speed automatic transmission a similar transmission that they are using in the new frontier going into z so nine speed now means you have a wide spread of gear ratios you can make that thing a bit more efficient and also get really good launches out of it now there are two significant trim differences and then we're in the proto so that's really a third but you have the sport or the performance and with the sport you're not getting launch control but with the performance whether you have the automatic or the manual you will have an assistance for launch control so with the manual it'll hold the revs at a certain rpm and then for the automatic it will you know you hold the brake you hold the throttle and then you just let go of the brake and it gets everything right and you launch down the line so we got to try out all of them the automatic is quicker but not bad acceleration in the manual honestly and they say it is a 15 improvement in 0-60 versus the 370z moving back from the transmission we have a carbon composite drive shaft reducing that rotational mass coming from the driveline then we head back to a new rear differential so we have slightly taller gearing we have an engine that doesn't rev quite as high so the taller gearing is going to give us a little bit higher speeds in each gear and then also we have a new differential back there so instead of a viscous style limited slip diff which again is performance only now we have a mechanical clutch plate style mechanical limited slip differential i said mechanical twice there just to make sure you knew it was mechanical now for the sport the entry level trim you just get the open differential and so really you have a big price gap between sport and performance it's ten thousand dollar difference 40k for sport 50k for the performance but there are some major differences of why you might want to spend that extra 10k and i wish some of these were optional you didn't have to go all the way to performance to get it but key ones from a performance standpoint the limited slip differential you get better wheels and tires and you get rev matching with the performance so you don't get rap matching with the manual and the sport and you may not want that so that's fine i think it's great to have it as an option you can turn it on or off in here and so you know if you want to go on the track and not think about heel toe you don't have to if you want to cruise around in city traffic now think about you know heel toe great you don't have to if you do want to do it you can turn it up so i like having the option and really those three things i think are kind of critical in going up to the performance you also get a better interior so you get better screen you get better sound system you get better seats you get heated seats so there are a lot of good reasons to go for that performance upgrade though again it does come at a significant price jump ten thousand dollars to go for the performance so moving from that differential out to the rear wheels we now have larger wheels and tires especially with the performance variant and with the performance variant you're also going to get larger brakes nissan says overall grip thanks to improvements in structural rigidity torsional stiffness up about 10 percent and bigger tires better tires because of all these changes to the suspension the tires and the body they are getting an improvement of 13 in lateral grip so significantly more grip for cornering and that is all with a heavier vehicle so spec to spec if you look at previous gen versus current gen and you compare similar trims this vehicle weighs about 150 pounds more so we're looking at about 3 500 to 3 600 pounds in the new z depending on which variant you get manual versus automatic sport versus performance so it is a bit heavier but that makes sense i mean they have larger cooling requirements now right this thing has significantly more power you've got those twin turbos you have an intercooler which you have to have cooling for you have engine oil cooler which you have cooling for and so the cooling requirements are greater for this vehicle hence that large gaping hole in the front the straight rectangle that allows for all of that air to come through and help keep things cool personally i think it would have maybe looked a little bit better if it wasn't just a straight rectangle i think it seems like a very simple shape and it kind of feels a little off with the overall design but overall looking at the car especially in person i actually do really like the way it looks and it is a significant improvement when you see it side by side with the 370z the 370z really starts to look dated and this really has a modern look to it so i like the way this looks to me personally the one take back as far as you know subjectively how does this thing look i wish they had just done something slightly different styling with the front grille now it is you know a bit of an homage to the previous generation z's and so they're keeping with that heritage in the design i just feel like it doesn't quite work super smoothly now aside from the exterior the interior is also a huge improvement so this is actually a pretty nice place to be i like the improvements they've made you've got a digital display up front you've got a nice large screen right here to your right you know you can hook up apple carplay all that stuff and you still have your three gauge pods so we have turbo boost we have turbo speed which again this thing goes over 200 000 rpm that turbo speed and then we have battery voltage because you know you always got to want to be keeping an eye on your battery voltage i'm not sold on the battery voltage i think maybe like oil temperature oil pressure something like that could be kind of useful to have up there but you can go through these gauges here and get more information through the front display as well so this is an interesting car right because it's all new like it's a whole new model this is the z this is not the 370z but there is a significant amount of carryover i mean this thing is based on the same platform it has the same wheelbase your suspension mounting points are pretty much the same you have double wishbone up front multi-link in the rear just like previously so it's been significantly updated they do say that it is 80 by parts different part number different than the previous gen but to me it's like well the engine is a ton of parts right and the engine's from you know an infiniti q50 and so pulling that out that's probably a large percentage of part number right there so it is to me in many ways and it behaves kind of like a nissan z 370z but it has a different engine it now has electronic steering rather than mechanical steering and you have a different style differential in the back now a clutch based rather than viscous based so let's dive a little deeper into what this thing is like to drive and so i spent some time on the track and one of the things that was surprising to me to learn after driving on the track and i kind of spoke with everyone that had also driven alongside me and we all thought hey it feels softer the car feels softer so it has a good comfortable ride to it and what i was surprised to learn is that spring rates have gone up damping rates have gone up and roll bar rates have gone up so everything has gotten stiffer but the car overall to me feels softer than the 370z and i did get to drive them back to back very briefly i don't know if from a weight standpoint if everything is relatively stiffer so that could play a part of it but they have made improvements to you know the suspension overall and so i find the ride very comfortable i do find that there seems to be you know a good bit of dive and it leans back it really does lean back and you do have some roll out there on the track so the body is kind of moving around out there on the track but it felt controlled aside from for me again going to throttle control and the automatic i felt like it was a little punchy and it was kind of easy to get the rear end out but aside from that decently well controlled out on the track and as far as the steering what's interesting i actually like the steering and here's the thing i assume a lot of people are going to say oh i can't believe they've gone to electronic steering i drove this 370z in this back-to-back and steering didn't cross my mind and just going back to back i didn't really think anything of it and i wasn't actively thinking okay focus on the steering but i think that tells you enough when you just drive them back to back and you don't really notice that big of a difference so to me the steering actually still feels good i am totally fine with it as far as the shifting there's definitely a healthy weight to the shift knob and the clutch as well it's got a good satisfying feeling going through the gears here and i do like having the rev matching the shifting you know it feels a little kind of older and clunky style but i mean that's what it's coming from right this is the 370z transmission so it kind of has that raw manual feel and i don't think there's anything wrong with that i mean that's kind of what people are going for when they're buying these style transmissions now i will say with this new engine you can definitely out shift as far as releasing the clutch too soon how quickly those revs drop so it's not that it has really bad rev hang but you definitely can out shift it if you shift really quickly you're going to be pulling those revs down with the clutch rather than them just dropping naturally from the engine overall i also just think i like this turbo engine more than i thought i would i really like naturally aspirated engines so i was kind of disappointed even though it is getting a healthy bump in power and i'm honestly not that disappointed with how the engine behaves yes you have turbo lag you don't get perfect response but it's a good engine and it feels fitting for the car so overall i came into this thinking that this was a 370z with an engine swap and i thought that's exactly what it would feel like and actually it feels better than that so i'm i'm pleasantly surprised after driving this thing you know the new exterior the new interior the new engine it all works pretty well together and so overall i think it's a pretty solid package especially when you start looking at the entry level for the sport price versus something like the supra you're getting a lot more for your dollar with this at the 40k version versus the supra where you're down to you know the 2-liter turbocharged engine so getting this 3-liter twin-turbo engine at that entry level price that's awesome overall i have enjoyed driving this thing i like the turbo engine more than i thought it would it's definitely quick what a beautiful place to be driving this thing thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below
