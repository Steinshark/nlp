tu yensang founder of the 276th year ming dynasty is the second of the only two chinese emperors who were born ordinary peasants he's to say the least an interesting guy born into abject poverty he experienced the very worst that 14th century china inflicted on people without a childhood education he became a self-taught scholar and climbed to power by attracting the most competent officials upon entering power he sought to bring peace and prosperity to the kingdom by imposing strict all-encompassing rules on the people in this way he's considered one of the great total autocrats for a long time i've been fascinated by his unique against odd story in a previous video i talked about the fall of the ming dynasty here i want to wind back the clock and explore china's last peasant emperor and one of its greatest historical figures at the start of the ming dynasty jew's journey begins in the 14th century with the iran dynasty this chinese imperial dynasty descends from the greater mongol empire which itself started with the famous genghis khan the mongol empire once governed vast territories stretching from europe to china but unrest between the great khan's successors led to its split and the declaration of the ryan dynasty the rian dynasty would conquer the remaining parts of the song dynasty in unify han china but after the death of its founder kublai khan the emperors of the yen dynasty struggled to make good for its people the high majority resented rule by the foreigners and its governance quickly fell into corruption the ordinary chinese began to rise up in protest against mongol rule the yuan dynasty seemed unable to stop them with their emperors uninterested in ruling and the elite mired in conflict the only question seemed to be determining who would next take the reins julian zhang was born september' 1328 to an ordinary farmer in what is now anhui province he grew up poor and illiterate in a country that did not offer much prospects for its poorest people when he was 17 a famine struck his farm and his entire immediate family saved one brother died drew and his last remaining elder brother had to wrap their father's dead body in a map of reeds bound in rope for burial but soon after that his last brother died too and drew was alone drew went to the nearby huangji temple and became a monk there that temple though quickly ran out of money and its monks had to go beg in order to earn their keep do for the next few years begged his way to what is now the city of hafee illiterate and poor eight years later at the age of 24 do went to the city of haudeau now known as fangyang county in anhui to see local rebel leader guojishing he gained the rebel leader's trust due to his intelligence and diligence and was appointed the bodyguard head do and go soon became very close and guo would take the young man into battle with him trusting him with hairy and critical problems drew would marry his daughter joining the family and he learned a lot under his mentor the art of running a successful rebellion even then he had great ambitions for himself and his legacy on march 10 1356 at the age of 32 drew sought to make good on those dreams he led an army of thirty six thousand soldiers to what is now the city of nanjing and defeated adrian regiment upon its fall he declared to the yen officials governing the city the cruel rule and misgovernment of the yen dynasty has led to the chaotic situation all over the realm the people have been plunged into misery and suffering if any virtuous man wants to follow me so that is to make great contributions to this process i will assign him to a suitable position with due respect i will do away with all the improper laws and policies of the uyan dynasty the liberation of nanjing would start off to his goal of evicting the mongols from china nanjing would serve as his base of operations from nanjing zhu progressively conquered the southern jiangsu province the cities of zijang province and then anhui the iran government was divided and its armies were frequently defeated due's rebellion spread quickly across the lands but it was not the only one occurring at the time in fact at this time jui's ming faction was not particularly well regarded in the southeast jiangxiang ruled fertile farmlands that brought his armies great wealth in the central province of what is now jiangxi chan yolyang commanded a small empire purported to be the resurrection of the han dynasty zhang owned vast riches chun commanded a fierce disciplined army dew was just an illiterate wandering beggar but perhaps because of that he grew to be intellectually voracious he educated himself thoroughly in the confucian classics and sought learned people to work with him the turning point occurred at the battle of lake polyang in august 1363 when chun's navy was narrowly defeated by two smaller fleet his usage of burning incendiary ships helped turn the tide and then came the pure luck of chun's death by an errant arrow his fall would leave his kingdom in a disarray and the ming would shortly thereafter absorb it a few years later dew invaded zhang xichang's southern heartlands and laid siege to the capital city of his kingdom in suto zhang was captured and hung himself leaving drew has the leading challenger to the iran soon thereafter he ejected the mongols back to the steppe and took power as the founder of china's next dynasty at the age of 40 in 1368 he would extend to the emperor's throne as the hongwoo emperor as the founder of a dynasty julie knew he had special legitimacy to rule and make real changes to china's government and as one who actually suffered the ills and desperation of poverty during his rise to power he seemed to have generally wanted to help them to do so drew felt that he needed immense power and he quickly seized it for himself sweeping away the checks and balances from the previous dynasty in this way he had a strong authoritarian bent he sought unlimited power with no checks or balances and he got it the ming dynasty would see the re-establishment of confucianism as the governing philosophy of the nation drew himself seemed to have worshipped confucius sacrificing several animals and diligently following the rights as it reopened schools across the country do made sure that students studied the confucius classics the ruling ideology of confucianism suited his ideas of a highly feudalistic autocratic government confucianism would help cement the social contract between the ming people and the government in his vision of the ming dynasty someone will always have their place and always know who their superiors and inferiors are to help create this world do personally wrote a vast four-part legal document for his subjects it is called the dachau literally the great warnings he demanded that everyone in its kingdom follow its laws in it you can find quote contemporary examples end quote of good and bad behavior his codes touch on almost everything including things like clothing jewelry and even household utensils the dachau is written in an earthly readable chinese that differs from the inscrutable scholarly language of the day this is because drew wanted people to actually read it this document is not official talk it was not scholarly writing afraid that people would not understand it i spoke this directly so that both high and low could understand the thing zoo struggled the most with was secession having ascended to the throne as a relatively old man at the age of 40 the state immediately put pressure on him to find a successor he sired plenty of children jewel would sire 26 sons and 16 daughters with his empress and many concubines 24 sons and 14 daughters made it to adulthood which is a pretty good hit rate for 14th century china each of the sons received the best confucian education studying the classics and morals the sort of stuff that their father never got in his youth drew even ordered them to do manual labor from time to time so to better understand the plight of the people he told his children's teachers you gentlemen should complement the curriculum with practical subjects do not just emulate the literary men by making your pupils memorize passages of literature he diligently married his sons off to the families of prominent military generals drew's intention in doing so was to kickstart a class of hereditary nobles with military roots this way the military would never rebel against the ruling power of his family having so many sons has been the downfall of many dynasties due ironically knew this upon taking the throne he tried to implement a structure to prevent conflict between those sons upon his ascension in 1368 he split the kingdom into thiefs then as each son grew into age he made them lord of a thief the eldest job yao would stay at the side as the crown prince dubial grew up well a gentle soul who seemed to fit the model of a confucian scholar ruler his father began to involve him in the various matters of the empire but as the yiddish proverb goes man plans god laughs whilst on a trip to survey two cities for a future ming capital he fell ill and died at the age of 36 or 37 on may 17 1392. the 64 year old julian dong was inconsolable and the imperial court ground into paralysis as he grieved eventually the court brought him out of his sadness and he designated dupiau's eldest surviving son the meek sixteen-year-old jujun wren as the next emperor drew died at the age of 69 in june 1398. he was a doting caring father who tried to do right for his progeny but the death of the crown prince would set off a secession crisis nevertheless and his schemes to bring his sons in line would fail but that is a story for another time the iran dynasty had reached its end point and the country had fallen into chaos julian zhang went from the very bottom of that country to the very top he unified the people drove out the foreigners and brought it out of chaos he sought to pacify the nation and it seems like he put actual deep thought in the reasoning behind his actions kind of the way he thought of it was that if everyone knew what exactly their life would be like what exactly their role was then they would never be dissatisfied and they would never be able to cause disharmony his approach restricted the free movement of the peoples assigned them permanent predefined roles and locked them in it forever and got a bunch of people killed on false pretenses during his paranoid purges and then he stayed in office for way too long the first years of the ming dynasty saw boom has recovered from the devastation of the iran conquest there were 1.7 million recorded households then 10 years later that number grew to 10.6 million which is a good thing but another 14 years pass and the number was still stuck at 10.6 million china saw no growth or progression in those years agricultural productivity slowed families went broke under onerous taxes and had to flee many people fell ill and died over 200 peasant uprisings broke out after the tenth year of hongwoo the emperor's frequent waves of paranoid purges would kill tens of thousands at a time the people were ready for his passing though his son and successor wasn't that much better julian zang was a brilliant thoughtful charismatic man with immense force of will like with another ruler of china many centuries later perhaps he died too late alright everyone take care of yourselves see you later
