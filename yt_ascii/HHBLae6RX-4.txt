oppo have just announced a couple of really impressive features which combined with what they're already capable of make they're coming with flagship phones including the find x2 a pretty incredible prospect this is why first up a flexible camera oppo has confirmed that they've been working on a smartphone camera system capable of zooming in 10 times without noticeable loss to image quality and people have said that this is impossible because to create optical zoom you need physical distance between the lens in your camera but offers solution might catch you off guard instead of making a camera module with a massive outward protrusion they've gone inwards they've laid the camera lenses horizontally across the width of the phone using a prism to bend the light sideways so this gives them the distance that they need to create the zoom while still making something that can fit in your pocket it'll start with an ultra wide perspective moving all the way into a deep zoom and the system already has optical image stabilization built-in but to be fair with this kind of magnification you kind of need that now generally speaking when you use a zoom lens it can result in a little bit of distortion as well as a less-than-ideal aperture so we will have to wait and see but the exciting thing is that unlike a lot of experiments that come out of the doors of upper we have confirmed that this is shipping soon also oppo recently came out with their own version of samsung's and variable aperture the ability to open up the aperture at night to let more light in and still capture good shots combine that with their new ish ultra night mode with ten times magnification and you can have a lot of tools to play around with and then on top of that you've got the fact that the find x2 should be coming with a time-of-flight 3d camera and i've actually had a pretty good chance to play around with one of them there's actually one built into the honor of view 20 and its implications are curious to say the least in real time it can differentiate you from your background and apply effect to you in isolation it could make you look taller slimmer or even change your outfit alright but aside from camera we've got the fact that oppo is now working on maybe the best fingerprint scanner ever made you might remember that aside from quirky software the gillies heel of the oppo find x was the fact that it had no fingerprint scanner on it at all but the company has made strides in this department they recently showed off an in display scanner on there are 17 phone and have just now like a few days ago showed off a technology that takes the same technology but expands it to an area 15 times the size this remove the current 3 to 5 centimeter squared to potentially 50 centimeter squared or essentially pretty much all of your phone also it can scan two fingers at the same time super fast charging when the find x launched in june 2018 the company announced that it would be coming with vuca charging which you know that's great is still one of the fastest charging standards out there but at the same time they showed off the lamborghini edition find outs and with it announced super vooc charging which splits the battery into two separate cells to increase the bandwidth and is even today world's fastest solution fast-forward six months and it's pretty clear opera moving forward with this we've seen it on the are 17 pro so i've got no doubt that it would be on the next fine device you might also not even need a slider this time in a way the slider on the oppo find x was one of its well factors it was one of the things that people would look at and be like okay that's cool but at the same time when you're using the phone it ends up being an inconvenience more than a benefit it's one extra step that needs to occur before you can take a photo it's most likely the reason the company struggled to fit an in display fingerprint scanner and it makes the firm thicker so it's possible that the 2019 version could forego the slider entirely in place of a punch hall camera but i'd be curious to know your opinion as to whether that would make the phone better or not if it did mean a more competitive price and a camera that was ready to go at any time the design could be taken a step further in my opinion the find x is still the best-looking phone from every angle and so i think the next evolution of this design might well extend that lead op over started experimenting with bold gradient finishes and personally i'd quite like to see them introduce subtle elements of that into the sleeker find x2 okay so the question then becomes would improvements of this caliber be enough to shift to an oppo device because let's face it the software experience really isn't for everyone let me know in the comments down below my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
