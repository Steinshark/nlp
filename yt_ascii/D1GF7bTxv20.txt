there's a lot of misinformation about what always actually up to right now they're making android phones but with no google services they have their own app store but some things are missing from it huawei has their own operating system they've developed from scratch called harmony os this is huge news but no one seems to really have any answers about what's happening with it so i spend the last month working with them just trying to really understand what the master plan is so in case you didn't know in may of last year the u.s. put huawei on something called the entity list their list of bodies that us companies like google aren't allowed to work with but wait a second if you're a maker of android smartphones and google can't do business with you how does a even work well in a normal situation google certifies android devices and in doing so they give them access to something called gms google mobile services that means access to google's core apps things like gmail google maps google calendar etc but it also means that third-party developers can build their own apps to take advantage of google services so for example when you open up ober you see a map but uber didn't build their own map system from scratch that's a massive undertaking it's actually just data pulled from google maps using google services but you're probably seeing where this is going because google can't work with huawei right now you don't get this gms on a huawei phone but instead something called hms while we mobile services and for the last year the thing people are focusing on i'd say understandably is what's missing what you don't get versus google mobile services but today i just want to zoom out and show you what was actually trying to do with all of this the bigger picture which starts with hms android and ends with harmony os which i think is fascinating so right now when you pick a smart phone you've probably used to picking between two ecosystems apple ios and gms android but while he's really trying to make here is a third player in that field hms android and i mean that extra competition is good news for everybody not just people who by huawei phones but to understand what it actually means for hallway take a look at apple apple make smart phones that if you look at their hardware like the amount of ram they have or the size of their batteries or the specs of their camera systems on paper they are crushed versus top-end android phones but because apple builds the chips inside their phones the hardware and every aspect of the software that runs on top of it they can design every line of code in that software to take advantage every last bit of power in that hardware apple phones are hyper efficient most android phones don't have this efficiency the companies who make android phones they buy chipsets from an external company and then on top of that they're relying on a software core built by google which is another external company so you can probably see where i'm going with this the proposition that we're always making is quite similar to apple's they already build their own chipsets for their phones but what's happening now is that because of this u.s. ban they're relying on their own software chord - this has its downsides but the upside is that because of this top-down control they've got there's the potential for that same sort of synergy there's an example well according to holly at least hms android has 62 percent lower latency than gms android so faster communication between the different layers of the operating system and the cherry on top is that if while we can pull this off on mass then when apps do come to huawei phones they'll be more power efficient because they'll be based on a core which huawei has designed for huawei phones and the apps might also just be better you might have noticed something if you're an android user your phone takes amazing photos when you use the normal camera app but kind of terrible photos when you take them through a third-party app like if i went on to the instagram camera right now the photo i'd be able to take would be nothing close to what my camera is actually capable of you might have noticed that while your phone comes with an ultra wide camera or incredible zoom capabilities try accessing these features while taking a snapchat story and you can't the problem that normal android faces is fragmentation let's say instagram was to take a random small phone let's just call it phone x and then start tweaking their app to take advantage of let's say it's two times zoom camera and it's 120-degree ultra wide camera that's technically possible but then they'd have tens of thousands of other phones to then start accounting for each with their own varying software skins the android ecosystem is almost too vast and if there isn't a system in place to be able to just kind of code for these features once and then apply them to all phones but always hms has this system so what we always trying to do right now is to basically hand developers the tools to take advantage of huawei specific features so if you take instagram as an example what always hoping for is that you'll be able to use the main camera yes you can do that on every phone but also the ultra wide the qua weighs night mode software to take photos in the dark or even the 3d depth sensor on the front of some phones to better track those ar face filters just do it more accurately it's yet to be seen if developers do implement these features but the point is with hms they can as an example have got an app here called you cam it's a third-party app built by someone outside of huawei but then if i go into low-light for example and then take a photo through it it'll still use the ai chip inside the phone to brighten the photos this doesn't happen on normal android phones even if they had dedicated ai chips but okay none of this matters if you don't have apps and you probably know why phones have no access to google play store but what you get instead is something called huawei app gallery i've been told a load of impressive figures that there's over 1.4 million developers registered right now and something like 55,000 apps that have those hms core features built in but like always fully aware that if you go onto the app gallery right now there are some apps that you might have been able to find on google's play store that you won't find here but from the conversations i've had with huawei it's pretty clear that they know they know that people want this stuff they're trying as hard as they can to get it but it takes time because there's no precedent for a situation like this but they're also pretty aware that the solution to that is to create an environment where developers can't say no so imagine an independent developer is approached by quawi who says that all you need to do is to put your app on our app store and that's it you'll reach millions more users will help you do it and you'll get better exposure on our store because you've got less competition you can see why that's enticing for developers and while we as consumers wait for that process to happen there are some mechanisms in place to make it easier there's phone clone which transfers apps from your old phone but there's something i think is quite important that i haven't seen a single person talk about it's called more apps this is basically the first thing i would tell anyone who's going to buy a hallway phone to download because you probably noticed the first thing you see is every app you've had questions about and for each one it will give you either a direct download link or link straight to the web version of that app and everything you find through here we'll work on huawei phones what i thought was more interesting was the wish list when you're in the app gallery you'll see this little option to request a nap and the whole purpose of this is to tell huawei what apps are the highest priority to send huawei the signal to then chase those developers and when there's apps eventually become available you can make it auto install on your phone if it was me doing this i'd probably also start building like exclusive applications for the app gallery i think always already started doing this in china but anyways that's why is core system but what sits on top of it is anyway i'll talk about this properly in a different video but the important takeaway is that the latest mui ten has an almost hidden newfound emphasis on inter device connectivity they're really trying to mesh together the smartphone and the laptop experience as an example but when you try to do this with operating system is vastly different as android on windows you've run into some limitations but that's where harmony os comes in so in case you didn't know harmony os is always own complete operating system they've built it from scratch and it works on small phones so when the u.s. band first came out this kind of led a lot of us to believe that the kali was gonna start releasing phones powered by harmony os but i can tell you now this actually isn't the plan for harmony at least for the foreseeable future all we wants to stick with android for its phones for a few reasons first of all that always still wants to work with google and google wants to work with four-way it's just that the current situation doesn't allow them to do that if however huawei jumped ship to a completely new operating system they kind of be shutting that door behind them and secondly if i didn't make this clear always pumping a lot of resources into getting developers to port their apps over from the google play store and right now that's a pretty easy ask but trying to get developers to redevelop their apps for a new operating system that's a different ballgame that said well how many os isn't quite what people thought it was it's a fascinating part of always master plan the way it was described to me is as a distributed operating system harmony is based on something called a microkernel which basically means the code is not specific to one type of device so yes it can run on phones but it can also run on anything from earphones to fridges to cars but why well imagine all the electronic devices you have right now maybe you've got a laptop the smartphone the tv maybe a speaker system each of these devices they've got certain inputs and certain outputs like your laptop is a keyboard that's an input your tv has a screen that's an output so you've got all these devices with their separate inputs and outputs but the idea here is that if they're all powered by the same harmony operating system then those inputs and outputs can be pooled in so for example i could press a button on my laptop to start playing music and input and that can immediately create an output on different device let's say start playing that music on my wireless speaker and then showing me lyrics on my tv screen it would behave as if all your devices were one connected device or in a more real-world example let's say someone was video calling me on my phone i could use the phone's front camera as the input so that the other person can see my face but then the ecosystem might decide that actually the tv is the best output for me to see the other person so it can display them on there and this is a real thing harmonie os isn't just some sort of theoretical pipe dream they've already launched a tv that runs it so that's the long-term goal this kind of evolving ecosystem of connected devices i'm hoping i've kind of and cleared up some of the misinformation i think some of the stuff i'm talking about here is the first time this has been talked about so let me know if it was useful and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
