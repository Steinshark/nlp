the name is the primagen but this name doesn't make any sense to me at all okay i'm i'm genuinely confused at what the heck i'm even looking at so let's do this okay great care when you're buying an app to make sure it's good and it's not going to ruin your machine and does exactly what you want html is the ultimate example of what you troubles you get into if you are promiscuous right and you are promiscuous why because part of what html does is you have to visit other people's websites and you have to execute not your code that you wrote other people's code what the hell are we watching kind of makes sense i'm not gonna lie to you i'm a little excited about this okay i'm a little excited about this okay i'm ready to get promiscuous boys that's a weird phrase to say okay html it's an interpreted system the customers want instant gratification and you've got to get cracking speed is of the essence i think the nub of what we're trying to get at is this html seems to be able to tolerate your mistakes but for those of you who know a programming until you accidentally forget a closing tag and then it just  it all up the whole nine yards okay okay you know this whole tolerant business you know once you start intermixing html with css and inline styles then it gets even worse then the whole universe is the worst the amount of hours i have spent trying to make something happen has clear fix clearfix is the the devil okay if you don't know if you don't know who clearfix is okay are you even a senior engineer probably not you don't even know what clearfix is so guess what man with your basic c or whatever you know they will not tolerate your mistakes they won't interpret it for you they won't compile the program for you unless it's correct so how does this difference come about if html is a language it's getting executed what is it about it that makes it easy to be tolerant and on the face of it yes it's wonderful it seems to put my errors right perhaps we could start off with our good old friend the paragraph p and i'm going to just put a piece of text in here which says hello sean even though i absolutely don't have to do it nevertheless i want to do it i'm going to close off the paragraph and then i'm you know i don't know who decided that sean should be spelled s-e-a-n but i do feel that's truly when the english language went to hell okay that's truly where it all went downhill okay is at that point if we could just trace it back that that's how you spell sean whoever is responsible of that just needs a slap okay it's it's not true and second off i would just like to let you know that computer file has some big p energy p tag energy right there okay very impressed right now that's a pretty big p tag i want to open up another one straight away afterwards goodbye dave once again we close off by the way is this college or something why are we writing code on paper okay this is what i'm getting i'm getting college vibes all of a sudden i'm back in school just about to take a test okay i don't like this you'll all understand that this is a classic use of paragraphs you put them in sequence you have first paragraph second paragraph third paragraph all that kind of thing does it mean anything and does it look any different and does it do any different if i start messing about and saying i'm not going to sequence them i'm going to fit the second paragraph inside the thirst by the way you're welcome on the screen tearing okay i still haven't switched to sway so you can sway your mouth towards these nuts okay so it's nested as we say it forms a hierarchy it's a para within a para you can see the difference i've opened up a paragraph i've said hello sean i've then opened up another paragraph and i've said this is a nurse just a hammeric home that the inner one really is fitting inside the outer one and then i'd beautifully close them both off you might think oh i know what it'll do i might get hello sean and then the phrase this is a nest will be tabbed in and indented maybe that's what it does so i think it actually puts a space right paragraph like an unaltered p tag has a margin is that what it is i get that correct i think that's right i think an unaltered p tag has a bit of a vertical spacing associated with it it's a block element yeah margin plus display block yep that's right boom got it first try yeah yeah i'm an html programmer okay i have 20 years html programming experience what do you have you got nothing okay you have nothing okay you could barely distinguish a p tag because it's so amazing compared to like your standard div you don't even know i've tried this out in my own firefox browser and believe me it doesn't crash it it just treats it exactly as if it was sequential paragraphs there's no sign of the nesting or anything so if we develop these a little bit is that true i thought there was vertical three things okay do the p hello sean always do the p do another p goodbye dave so you're emitting the closing bit is that right i'm hitting the closing of the paragraphs yes you can do that you can do that yeah html yes it is nothing was going to fault you for missing out end of p and that if you type that in will look the same as that but technically it looks the same until beyond that right once you stop messing with the p then everything gets all screwed up right then beyond that that's where everything gets all crazy and so it is fair though it is pretty impressive that you can just send this down as a document and it renders no different than you know the other ones right that is really impressive that you can do that that you can you can let these streams cross and they're both the same it's just that any content beyond that it gets all garbly but it is most important it's really impressive that that actually does end correctly it does but what's its rule and here we go probably won't do what you want to do it does what it finds convenient and what it finds convenient is the following rule it says i am going to assume if you give me a second p and i'm already inside the first one i'll just close the first one off how would the browser cope if i sometimes put my no way it doesn't do that does it there's no way i believe that i don't think it closes it off right i'm quite pop i bet you i mean we could technically figure it out we could figure that out yes it does no no no no way dang it i'm gonna add a little extra margin here margin 10 pixel right and background color i think will go there we go we'll do that and go over to the f and go zero zero rf rf there we go let's just try that boom that's it that's all we're doing file called home i mean if you close one p just one p really i've been a few close two p's you can't you can't nest peas oh you can't nest peas oh yeah yeah padding you're you're right i mean i could do i could technically do padding now because this is definitely that that's nested you can't nest the peas this whole time i thought you could you can ask you could touch you can't nest peas i guess you need 21 years of experience doing html and pay zaynum sometimes didn't and the answer is it will always as far as i know assume that you want a sequence and that is what it will impose on you what it comes down to is a sort of informal i hate the web sometimes oh theorem something like the following if you're trying to be very clever and mend somebody's incorrect program then the problem is that if you have a structure that can be a sequence of or it can be a nest of or it can be any combination you could have a sequence of nests or a nest of sequences but if you one start saying they can both coexist nesting sequencing then you must put your end tags in if you want to be unambiguous otherwise how can it be repaired so in other words if they if both possibilities are possible then you can't have smart behavior because it cannot know how to repair it correctly and what html is doing is it's not solving the insoluble it's saying i have one view of the world and i'm going to impose it on you and i am not going to try and be clever i am flabbergasted right now now that of course is a luxury that html has it basically says i keep things simple i like things to be more or less sequential with the minimum of this embedding you know and all that and that's why i can get away with murder now for those of you who've ever written a program and no i didn't know that about the piece you interpret it oh boy it's not going to try amend your banner program for you i didn't know where are you well where where did i put this thing in where did i do this in right okay that does it that still doesn't you can't miss the nasties okay i didn't know that okay i didn't know that okay i did i didn't know that i didn't know about that the little p the p nesting thing okay things are so much more complicated well the answer is you can do it let me just invent a little piece of pseudo code and i'll let you fill this in in either basic or c or java or whatever terms you want printf i love that you brits and your javers okay who puts it r on the end of that who does that who just throws an r in willy-nilly okay you always tell you're always highbrowing us about how you speak the little the queen's english and then you just throw an r in there come on hello you're like come on let's see programmers will know that if you want a new line at the end of that which you do you better put it backslash n at the end yeah we're going around the stuff inside this block which is a very simple block it's just got a single print statement in it so what we'll get is hello john hello john hello john hello john 10 times then i do another loop that goes around 10. well that screen tearing is looking so good right now hi dave new line close quotes semicolon let's hope this really would compile you can all see what's going to happen when you execute this i'm going to get how much goodbye 10 times so that is what happens when you have a sequence of blocks yeah but by comparison with paragraph in html can you in programming languages have nested blocks you bet you can bet your sweet ass loop around 10 times on the following printf hello sure yeah yeah now look at what i'm going to do and now i'm ready not going to close off that book i'm going to nest another loop block inside it goodbye dave now let's make sure our brackets match i'll open it one i've opened up two i've closed this one i must close that one that's a squared algorithm right here i understand what i'm trying to do here i'm trying to do a loop within a loop they're nested like and square dolls one inside the other but the effect of this is completely different to the one i did previously here what's going to happen is the outermost one goes around 10 times and every time it goes around it there's a hello sean but every time he does a hello sean it then goes into a nested inner loop that does 10 goodbye dave's so for every one i love theater file by the way fantastic beautiful love all of this it's actually it's actually o of one because if you really think about it's actually it it there's no based on input so there actually is no scaling factor to it so it's actually a constant 100 which we all know constants get reduced down to one you actually drop constants and when there's nothing left you just put one in there come on shut up hello sean i print out i'm magazine 10 goodbye dave's net result i will end up with a hundred goodbye dave's interleave between ten hello whereas in the earlier case i had 20 printouts i had 10 hello shorts followed by 10 goodbye days that's one why can't it put my programs right for me and the answer is if you omit your end tags how can it know whether you want this one or this one they're both equally valid this thing they both equally ignore the fact that white space makes programs more legible too where's your indenting sir and is the absolute fundamental conundrum ambiguously put back the closed curly braces if users omit them no you can't because you've got to work out do they want to hurt sequence a nest the nest of sequences there's all sorts of places to put back the brackets and they have all sorts of different effects i would say that the only sane answer is the one that that the web didn't do i think that the only sane answers that you have to nest it this idea that you don't nest it makes no sense right the fact that you run it serially makes no sense that's like that that's a that's a completely unintelligible approach to this problem i totally get that if you don't put a closing thing then everything else just goes right inside your pp but instead the pp is serial it doesn't make any sense why why why why would you do that with just p but not the d okay the day doesn't do it the day wants it nested why choose two different resolution steps i hate this i hate my life i hate this i hate my i hate it okay i hate it you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna press subscribe on my alternate account i'm gonna get the video a like and that's that okay i can't even emotionally handle this any longer and i'm also two minutes late to my meeting okay so i gotta go okay you know what the name is the later gen okay i gotta go
