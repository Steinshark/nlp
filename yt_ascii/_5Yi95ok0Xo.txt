so hello everybody we are back with richard roland i know everybody is excited to see what is it that we're going to talk about today and so after our trek through ethiopia we are now moving back to western europe what we're going to do is we're going to we've been talking a lot about sacred history and about how these religious patterns kind of manifested themselves in the way that people understood themselves and their identities and but now we're going to look a little more at this secular world and we're going to look at a tradition called the nine worthies where even in secular spaces or in kind of more common spaces there was this desire to connect their own society through memory through celebration with different characters in the past both from the pagan world and the christian religious world you know trying to kind of continue on this vision of universal history that we've been proposing since the beginning this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] and so richard i know there were a few things you wanted to say before we start there are a few things you wanted to kind of come back on first of all congratulations on the the conference on the token conference that you went to i hear some people we're inviting symbolic world people were there yeah we had a great turnout of symbolic worlders so shout out to all of you guys just a bunch of really delightful people we had a bunch of people for whom this was their first time ever stepping into an orthodox church which was really awesome and i think was made a really big impression on people we had a cool time the talks which i think will be very resonant for your audience will be up on the amitool podcast whenever they get uploaded by audio producer the we did some other really cool stuff we got to read the dream of the rude which is an anglo-saxon devotional poem to the lord's cross actually in front of a of a relic of the lord's cross and and and venerate that relic which was basically i mean it was just sort of like peak my life like like it was just sort of like one of the best parts ever happened yeah well everything coming together token it was it was poetry and yeah yeah it was it was very much and it was nice because we sort of like went from talking about the stuff to to being able to participate it in it in in a way yeah and it was it was really cool so anyway it was a great time a huge thanks to father andrew the community there with st paul's and the same basil society for hosting me feeding me putting me up and just treating me so well and it was a great time that's great that's great and so as you saw i also discussed with deacon enoch you know an ethiopian deacon who's also american who kind of expounded a little more of ethiopian tradition from the inside and since our whole kind of exploration of of ethiopian orthodox you've had some amazing reactions from ethiopian christians people from all over and you know people helping us understand more giving us some few precisions that richard wants to we is going to look over some few precisions we need to to make maybe yeah so this came from tadios so tadios thanks for thanks for reaching out and i have to say one of my favorite things in life is actually being graciously corrected i say graciously okay but but i really do uh try to keep a sort of beginner's mind about these things and there's definitely stuff that i was picking up by you know from reading different books and different academic papers and things like that but i don't have that same insider perspective and so tadios reached out to correct a few things that we said that i said in our last ethiopia video about ethiopian saints and hagiography and i just wanted to go over them real quick because they're actually super cool and they actually make the overall point that we were trying to make better than the things that we said so his first thing that he wanted to mention was the i said something about one of one of the saints who whose leg sort of fell off and my impression and this was based on an academic paper that i'd read on on the subject my impression was that the leg was not actually a big deal and it wasn't really venerated and i mentioned this mostly because it seemed weird and very like a not what christians do but also be like very kind of non-ethiopian right ethiopia is all about like taking the the remnant of the thing and like preserving it right and so it turns out this was just a totally mistaken thing uh about which you know my source was completely wrong and so what he's what he says is he talks about saint techlee heimannot i think uh he's known to have prayed for 22 years while standing still so very much his legs would be important actually yes yeah so his legs would kind of come up and seven years he prayed only standing on seven of those years he prayed only standing on one foot and so what he had done of course we have like stylized in people like this so to stop him from seeding or leaning to the side it says that he put six like arrows or spears on either side of him so that if he got tired and leaned to one side he'd be pierced by them and tradition describes that whenever his body got weaker and he leaned to the side the arrows would pierce him and keep him straining standing straight for years praying in in this cave and so this led to one of his legs below the knee getting broken off from his body like you'd imagine might happen and he said apparently that particular bone not only was it kept but it actually has its own feast day on the ethiopian calendar just for that leg which is pretty awesome i love stuff like this like we have we have like the like two different feasts around the head of yeah and things like the chains of saint peter and and what not but this is really this is really fun yeah but they'll do us with the head of st john the baptist too i saw some icons in ethiopia of the head of saint john the baptist like with wings like flying around to haunt the people that decapitated him that is my gosh that's so great and actually one of the cool things he he did include a picture of an icon of this particular saint and of course the thing the first thing that i noticed in the icon was just the fact that the saint has six wings you know he's a seraphim yeah and so something about like his burning intensity and his love for god so anyway that was really cool there was [music] there were some other corrections in here i mean some of these stories were are just like crazy i'll i'll read what he says about this he said there are sub-traditions within the tradition of you know the veneration of a saints relic so for instance there's a famous monastery called saint melchizedek who is a saint named after the old testament priest god gave him this covenant which makes everyone who is buried near the monastery not just the saints makes their relics be preserved as incorrupt so that they don't decay and he says and i'm just going to go off of what he says here i haven't looked this up at all it says last i've heard some university professors tried to test the hypothesis on the hagiography and bury someone half like their body like half in half outside the borders of the monastery and the portion of the body that was inside the monastery premise didn't decay and the other portion did like every other burial and he doesn't actually include some pictures here and there's some other really crazy stuff of like ossuaries where like the bones of saints just sort of like show up and people like yeah we don't actually know who these guys are or or how they got here yeah they're saying they got to be saints so yeah and he corrected us in a few things like because we said some some of the people we mentioned were part of the the original yeah yeah i think specifically the same with the wings that you've mentioned yeah that he wasn't he was an ethiopian saint yeah so a few things like that so thanks everybody for correcting us when we get our details wrong and so so these nine saints will lead us in a way in a very strange surprising way into the nine worthies today so richard take it yes it could take it so that's that was a nice transition so actually you could probably just do an entire video and i know there's a whole section in i think matthew's book about the symbolism of the number nine which is very important in the ancient world in the middle ages it's very important in dante like dante's whole metrical scheme is around the symbolism of the number nine i mean it's not hard to understand it's a triad of triads right and so it's a sort of a a heavenly fullness right and so there are of course very famously there are nine ranks of angels mentioned in the scriptures described by saint dionysius the areopagite and then also in the orthodox church there are nine ranks of saints and so i don't know how many people know this but if there's there's actually like if you think liturgy is long the priest actually has his own liturgy that he has to do to prepare for everyone's liturgy right so it's sometimes called like the liturgy of preparation and essentially what the priest does is he ends up you know this is when he prepares the bread and the wine for the liturgy and on the discos or the the patents the little metal plate on which the bread is placed there's the lamb which is the peace for christ but then there are also smaller pieces and i know that i know that this gets really specific and yes you know who you are i know that some people are gonna message me and say well actually it's a it's a slightly different commemoration in the byzantine tradition versus the slavic tradition i know that but just for simplicity's sake there's a particle for the mother of god and then there are these nine smaller particles for essentially nine ranks of saints and so and and and most of the saints in the orthodox church fall into like one of those categories and that yeah that there's a little bit of fluidity about like which which rank is exactly what between various traditions but there there just seems to be the idea that if you're gonna have a group of holy people like this there needs to be nine of them so what i thought we would do is is take take the our universal history series in a direction which nobody has asked for right everybody's like what are you gonna do ireland what are you guys doing america what are you gonna do etc and i thought we would just do something that nobody has asked for at all which is to talk about the nine worthies and the reason that i wanted to do this is because one of the questions or another way to put this would be like one of the realizations that i've had while doing this series with you and also discussing it with other people is is just the way that these patterns manifest themselves even outside of the the the spaces that we have kind of delineated as sacred and we didn't start specifically in sacred places like we started with just like sort of like secular medieval history when we started the series but it very quickly moved into talking especially when we get into ethiopia and you have to really talk about all this stuff so in our in our previous episode an idea that i think really resonated with a lot of people is we talked about this idea that the saints uphold the world and that this is both something that we believe to be sort of literally true but also that it it's a pattern which manifests itself in the lower regions of the mountain right that that even the even the the p the people that you venerate maybe not necessarily as as holy but definitely a sacred in some way like a set apart in some way or you say iconic of a people group or of a city those people that you you set aside for veneration in some way do really become the connective tissue you could say like love or veneration is the connective tissue by which things cohere yeah you could just use the word commemorate is yes yeah you can commemorate as good or weirded out by the idea that the people that you remember through through statute through naming things you know obviously there's a hierarchy of that but those are the people these kind of they're an analogous to the idea of the same to the just that uphold the fabric of society through memory through common connection through common identification yeah in in his book the ethics of beauty dr petitsa says talking about the the sort of american love for veneration of the american soldier which is something you can actually do without necessarily approving of you know the various wars the soldiers fought in right but that that if you go to like arlington national seminar cemetery for instance i almost hit arlington national seminary if you go to arlington national cemetery or there's also a national cemetery here for veterans in in the place where i live not a single one of those soldiers was killed for their country they all gave their life for their country right and so this is a kind of it's a different distinction it's it's so so that that's a good example of commemoration right in in the united states i don't know if you guys have something like this up in canadia land i mean but but like you have something like it but nothing like it at the same time yeah we're not as as nationalistic here yeah yeah in the united states when a soul when a veteran dies even if you know they just you know were in the army when they were young and then they they got out of the army they had a normal life and they died in old age there at the burial there will be like members of the military will show up and there will be like a flag folding ceremony and everything for that person these are all like kind of like lower levels of commemoration so when we talk about the nine worthies the nine worthies are this group of men and later on because in the middle ages they're always like seeking symmetry in things later on there becomes also a group of nine worthy women to kind of parallel the nine worthy men but this is this is a list of people and their their historical scriptural legendary men not necessarily saints although you know some of them like joshua in the bible is obviously you know a saint in basically everybody's church but but they but they were selected for this list because they were seen to personify the ideals of chivalry which which people really wanted to inculcate and this starts in maybe you could say the the 12th and 1300s which is when sh which is when the idea of chivalry is really starting to come into its own we often think of a chivalry and the chivalric romance as being like a medieval thing but it's actually it's actually kind of a renaissance thing that was projected back into the middle ages and it's not to say there were not chivalrous people in the middle ages but it's but it's this is gonna sound funny to some people but like go look it up that the renaissance was a much more violent period than the middle ages was and and and so there was this need to sort of figure out what to do with that the problem of you know in in some in some sense like societal problem number one you're always trying to solve is what i do with all my violent young men right and that's that's like that's really the main problem that most societies are trying to deal with in some way or other and and so what and so this is where the this is where the ideal of chivalry so i think the first the first list was compiled in like 1312. so this is really where the idea of chivalry starts to to be brought forward based on older literature of course things like the song of roland and sir gowan and the green knight and all the stuff which were much older than yeah and just the arthur the arthurian cycle the different arthurian cycles the french cycles were already there and so there were different different cycles of and just aquitaine in that whole kind of that whole world of yeah yeah yeah well and the the great thing about like aquitaine is that you have you have basically these these troubadour kings who are like both wandering minstrels but also you know knights but also kings and then you've got like eleanor whose father was one of these troubador kings and eleanor of aquitaine is you know richard the lionheart's father and also but also her mother rather but also the mother of literally every other king in europe at that at that time and and she was really into this stuff and so it's like it's her daughters that become the patrons for like christian detroit and and all these other like the big arthurian writers and so you it's it was a very colorful time and a very colorful kind of court there in aquitaine so the nine worthies are three pagans so these are hector of troy alexander the great and julius caesar three hebrews so joshua the son of nun or jesus in the greek david the king and then judah maccabee and then three christians and the three christian kings are king arthur charlemagne and godfrey abbouyon am i saying am i saying that right yeah you're saying it pretty good hey i'm pretty i'm i'm really pleased because i'm so bad at french yeah so godfrey of bouyon who most people maybe have not heard of i think i think that's the surprise on the list people are like well i've heard of those other guys but like who's does god forget so the reason that we're talking about this in in universal history is to kind of type two things together which is one how does the how do these patterns manifest themselves in what we would now call secular spaces though perhaps they would not have recognized our that use of the word secular in the 1300s but like how did these things manifest in secular spaces because we have these kinds of manifestations and we have these kinds of of heroes even now we've talked a lot about lincoln and you know things like this but also that that i mean i know that you're you're sometimes a little down on superheroes jonathan i don't know if you mean to come across that way or not but but obviously obviously the whole world of like superhero storytelling is a super mixed bag yeah it's a super mixed bag but also i think there is and i think we're gonna have an essay about this in in finding the golden key there is definitely a let's say a longing for this kind of commemoration which is which is definitely manifesting itself in that space right now and so when we find images of the nine worthies there's a very early 13th century carving which i think is the earliest visual representation of them all together and it's in cologne and germany but it's not they're it's not in a church or in a sacred place it's in a city hall and so the idea is that you could say that these nine men together represent the ideal of chivalry of kingship of lordship but also they show the way in which a secular order and and in the third in the 14th century that that that really did mean like the civil powers aside outside of like the church powers right the way that a secular order could also participate in kind of this master narrative this story of western civilization that everybody was very consciously trying to write themselves into yeah so there there are also statues there's a there's a fountain in nuremberg germany called the beautiful fountain and you can go out and look at some pictures of these things online and i'm sure we'll have them in the video for which also shows the nine where these and but but it's at that same fountain there are like these different groups of people right and some of the groups are like apostles saints martyrs etc and then over here in this group you have the nine worthies yeah and so it it it's a general commemoration of yeah of different aspects of reality let's say and the political or the kind of civil sphere is part yes yes and so basically what this lets them do is they they're able to bring in all of the the three strains which basically constitute western civilization which are paganism and specifically greco-roman paganism the our jewish inheritance that we have as as christians and then and then the the the great the great sort of icons of christian of the christian ruler which for this particular list are king arthur charlemagne and godfrey bouyon which for reasons we'll talk about in a second you know it's funny that there's no constantine yeah there's some constantine there's no justinian it's like it's definitely western europe like yes it's definitely definitely western europe yeah so for those of you who are who have been hankering for like some more western europe stuff this is this is your day so i thought what we could do is is very quickly talk about each one of the worthies yeah and why they're included and i think there's a lot there are a lot of people out there who will be interested in going out and reading more of these people there's definitely a something that i've heard over and over again recently has been like it's really a cry or a hunger especially from like a lot of young men who are into the symbolic world and other things like that for you know trying to trying to like navigate like what does it look like to be a man what's it look like to be masculine that's a really difficult thing to do right now it seems like we're we're constantly like falling into one error or or the other yeah but this is a question that they're really concerned with in the middle ages too it was like one of the dominant questions of let's say medieval legends and fiction yeah and i'm curious about some of the choices myself rather than others and so are there sources that kind of explain why or there are okay yeah so i'm gonna be reading from just a text it doesn't have a helpful name in english it's the history of the nine worthies of the world three whereof were gentiles and then it lists all the gentiles three jews three christians being an account of their glorious lives worthy actions renowned victories and deaths okay so that's actually a super helpful name it's just very long i put that on a book jacket yeah yeah yeah yeah put that i mean people did back then and this particular book was made as an it's an it's an older book but it was made as kind of like an english translation in like the 1600s like the 1630s so that's that's actually i mean it kind of shows how long and how late even into the modern period this idea of the nine worthies were and i would just say do you do you guys have a phrase dressed to the nines yeah i never understood that yeah so that's a reference to that's a reference to to this comes from a shakespeare play but it's a it's a reference to it's a reference to the nine worthies in other words and there was actually a king of france francis the first of france who would dress up like one of the nine wordies and so he was literally like on different occasions yeah yeah yeah and like like in the in the and this is during the renaissance he would dress in what was called the antique mode in other words like like like with the roman toga and everything yeah or or like or like you know an armor yeah in armor and things like this and he would like walk around like this to like kind of consciously associate himself with the nine worthies actually most of our most of our illustrations of the nine worthies come from a kind of book called an armorial which is a book of heraldry and it's a it's a book intended to like teach you heraldry and like keep track of of who in the kingdom has these different signs so if you see this heraldic device you'll be able to recognize that this is an important part of your education as a as a nobleman and but the first several pages usually the first ten pages of a of an armorial these are custom-made books for very wealthy people so the first ten pages of an armorial would be the nine worthies and then the tenth page would be whoever commissioned the book okay you know and and and and dressed up also like the nine worthies and so so the i yeah so the idea connecting it all together yeah you're you're and it became this very personal way for people obviously people of a certain social status but it became a very personal way for people to connect themselves into the larger story you could say a western chivalry of of let's say the proper use of secular power yeah yeah so it's interesting but it's important also to mention it's something that i keep repeating probably at every podcast which is that even though the tradition kind of appears later than the middle ages in order for people to have recognized these these people as the nine worthies it means that this was something which was already kind of let's say bubbling up in culture there was something that people when they saw it they said yes of course these are the nine worthies if it hadn't been if it hadn't been something that people could recognize you know then it wouldn't have lasted and it wouldn't have been perpetuated right well and so so to that i want to say two things one is it's one of the most irritating things in the world to me when somebody says something like oh well the title theotokos was not approved until the council of ephesus and therefore the veneration of the mother of god began like on that date like that's not how things work that does not know anything that's not how anything works like so just as a good rule of thumb if you come across something and it says like the first mention in a text that we have of this particular thing is this date what you need to do is back up one to 200 years at a minimum yeah before that date and set like and just like assume this has been in the error long enough for somebody to write this down so like the the the most the most recent so if this list was first coined in the early 1300s the most recent person on the list is godfrey bouyon who died in 1100 so he's not quite a contemporary but but he's really close so obviously there couldn't have been a list like this before he died but this concept let's we could just say like this is the ultimate like the the crystallization of this concept which had been part of a part of western europe for a long long time so you can you know that for example charlemagne consciously modeled himself after joshua and king david right so you can understand how and constantine right so so you can understand how this is something like you like we said that's already in the culture and now is is bubbling up and manifesting itself concretely right so let's go let's let's start let's go because i have some questions myself about some of these were these okay so first guy on the list hector of troy which i think most people who are listening this podcast will be familiar with the iliad and the story of hector which means that everything you think you know about hector is pro is sort of wrong in the in the west until a very late date they did not have access to the homeric poems in their originals and so what they had to go off of was mostly things like virgil and other authors who were basically retelling the story in latin or in some other western language and telling it especially from the trojan perspective which is important to understand the romans saw themselves as trojans and so their vision of the trojans were they were the noble ones right more noble let's say than the greeks and the trojans yeah so this is a really this is a really big point and and this goes all the way back to video number one that we did in the series right is that the romans saw themselves as trojans right and and therefore the the portrayal that we get of the trojans in the aeneid is extremely more like light so that the thing about the iliad is that it's actually so balanced there are no there's no good guys or bad guys in the iliad i mean into their individual people but the two sides they're not you know it's it's it is a truly great work of art in that it is written with just deep sympathy for the human beings on both sides of this conference is very complex work the hector even in the iliad hector is shown he's the best yeah he's the best dude in in the iliad as well so in in the in the legend that they had received and that gets told retold in the stories of the nine worthies and all the way up to the time of shakespeare okay when shakespeare writes about the his poem his his play about the the fall of troy and troilus and christina [music] hector is he he's so great achilles can't kill him in a fair fight and so there are different variations of this but for instance in this this particular work on the nine worthies of course they're all they're all knights so they're all jousting right so like take that image that you have of like you know hoplites and armor or like brad pitt or whatever and put that out of your head and imagine just like full-on heraldic devices guys on horses jousting in front of the gates of troy that's how that's how they they portrayed it you know and and so so there are several times during the conflict that hector unseats achilles but is not willing to kill him because it's not fair he's not gonna he's not gonna kill a downed opponent and so then finally in this particular telling when when achilles finally decides like that the greek leaders tell achilles okay you have to kill hector you have to go out and kill him achilles comes out and and at a at a particular time we're told that hector is actually bearing up the body of one of the greek princes who had died to bury him in honor so hector is just like here's a worthy opponent i'm going to carry his body and have it buried in state and at that point achilles runs up and kills him when his back is turned so it's it's a really despicable kind of treasonous way and actually a lot of the all three of the pagan worthies in in this in this telling die due to treason right julie caesar's dad alexander is poisoned by his generals and so so hector the thing that makes hector a worthy is is his great valor in combat which is this is gonna some people are gonna be like yeah great valor in combat and some other people listening this are gonna be like oh i don't know about you know and you know and there is definitely one could say a strong pacifist inclination within traditional christianity things that christ says the example that we have of many saints there is also however a a strong say vindication of like the proper uses of violence within the tradition yeah chivalry ends up being something like a coded version of right you know the honorable way to fight if you have to and the honorable way to kind of deal with aggression if you need to right yeah and so that's yeah and and it basically becomes a it basically becomes what the peace of god in the middle ages was on a national level chivalry becomes on a personal level so the idea of the peace of god is that there would be rules governing warfare you could only do things in certain ways you could only fight on certain days you know certain holy days and things like that were not days that was appropriate to campaign on and and for the most part during the middle ages people kept to this yeah and this is in western europe and for the most part people people really stuck to this and so you you have a lot of wars in the middle ages but the wars by modern standards would just be like very small border skirmishes you know it's not until until the rise of secularism that we're able to just really kill each other in efficient ways and just like in mass but so so there's there's definitely a there's definitely a uh let's say on a personal level chivalry is is you know a certain thing so part of the code of chivalry this comes up in christian's uh percival part of the code of chivalry is there are certain days on which one does not bear arms for instance on holy friday is a day it just would not be appropriate to wear armor to carry a sword etc and things like this so so there's so yeah it's so the things that make hector one of the worthies and really the first worthy because everything kind of begins at troy that's where that's definitely the trojan war the trojan war is definitely where the west was born yeah and and hector is sort of the great hero of that war from a medieval perspective and hector and so hector is is he's really good at fighting but he also shows mercy and love towards his his opponents and he's not willing to kind of take advantage of somebody in an unfair way yeah and you can see that in the story in the original story the idea of achilles you know misusing the body of hector after he died is kind of a counter example to the way in which the medievals would perceive the knightly way of fighting and of treating your enemy right right and so i think i think that actually that there's like an exact twist there right from the way that hector dies in the story which is he dies because he's honoring the body of his foe yeah exactly versus the way that achilles treats his body in the iliad so that's kind of nice so yeah so hector is great and by the way hector is i mean like i'm i'm just a massive hector fanboy like i should just like put that out now he's one of my favorite i don't know what you could say legendary figures historical figures whatever people go back and forth on whether the trojan war was actually historical and i think actually the current thing is that actually it is historical but people have been going back and forth on whether it was historical since like the time of few cities yeah but what everybody has agreed on is that whether or not it was like a historical thing it was it's super important and it's it's kind of it's kind of the first the first story in the west yeah so the second worthy which will be no surprise to you is alexander the great of course alexander the great is i think nowadays he would definitely be hashtag canceled he's he's got a lot of shall we say problematic things about his life the way that he we're told [music] i mean there's there's a ton of wild stuff in this particular retelling of alexander and definitely his his sexual mores are are not christian not even the way like hectors were like hector hector despite not being a christian is you know faithful to his to his wife femme man characters children there's and there's definitely a very long tradition that that at some point helen kind of like threw herself at hector and he was like no thanks yeah i don't i don't need this crazy in my life you know but he's also the only person in troy in the in the iliad he's basically the only person in troy who actually treats her decently yeah and so she weeps for him at his death anyway i just really love hector a lot if that's not right so alexander but this is the retelling in the nine worthies yeah yeah yeah this is the retelling and so this is the thing like when there are faults in these guys lives they don't shy away from from telling those things right and this is i mean this is a thing like we're so and we're just such babies now jonathan like we're i mean we really are though like we're just giant babies like if there is if there's a person whose life is worthy and and worthy of emulation in a lot of different ways but then they have like one thing wrong with them yeah we're like well sorry that person's problematic and and like i don't care if it's the right or the left like yeah this is this is just in the air right now we're just we're so fragile yeah and and so they're setting up alexander as kind of the the in the medieval perspective you could say he he's the you know if hector is the first knight alexander is the first emperor right and and of course everyone agrees that you should have an emperor and everyone agrees that whoever the emperor is should be kind of the best and most worthy person and so even though even though alexander has a lot of he has a lot of faults he's portrayed in the in this retelling as being you know he loses his temper and and kills somebody who's really close to him but then after that he he shows so much remorse that he like starves himself and they eventually have to like force him to start eating again so it's kind of like it's not saying it's okay that he did that thing but also like he did demonstrate repentance a lot but after afterwards and though the way that it's sort of portrayed is that is that alexander is this i mean he's like this really dynamic young genius which he was and that but that he had he had sort of the wrong people around him yeah which is not saying it like wasn't his fault but we're told you know he's he has you know he had this influence from this particular greek philosopher not aristotle in this case but one of the people who is one of aristotle's students who who basically told him well you should be you know look at all your achievements you should be worshipped as a god right alexander being very young you know having this mentor tell him you should be worshipped as a god said oh i get i guess i should be worshipped as god but then we're told but the macedonian soldiers would have none of it and just continue to salute him as their general and he was also fine with that yeah and so there's some fun stuff in here one thing that's in here is when he conquers india he's seduced by the indian queen whose name was cleophys not cleopatra cleophas and but but she does a very cleopatra thing which is she she basically buys her kingdom back with you know by seducing alexander and then has a son from him whom she names alexander and of course eventually you know cleopatra seduces julius caesar and then they have a son that they name julius caesar yeah and but the the i mean this is a real symbolism happens moment because cleophys is a i mean she's a real historical figure like there's no ambiguity about about it the ambiguity would be around like who her son who her son's father actually was yeah and and the way that like the greco-roman chroniclers would write about it is they would say they would say that oh she had a son named alexander whoever her father whoever his family might have been might have been yeah wink wink but of course you know it's it's significant she's the she's the queen of india in this particular telling which is we've talked about the overlap between india and ethiopia and you know and as the steeler of the heart and all that so you have all those things going on in the story what makes alexander great lots and lots of things i mean he he defeats his enemies but he's really fair to everyone he conquers that that comes out over and over again and he so he has he has a bunch of faults but also he's at the end of the day like he's he's great because of because of his accomplishments and because because of his the the let's say the just way that he treated the people that whom he defeated right so that in so you have this idea that you should be in victory you should be you should be moderate and subdued in the way that you again unlike us like we're such like we're like just little toddlers even like on the internet as soon as somebody scores a point against somebody else you know they just like they're ready to dance on the grave you know and and and the the medieval idea of chivalry is that is that you really you should you should be able to win your fights but also when you win you've got to be gracious and i will just say one last thing which is they were not inattentive to the fact that alexander died at the age of 33 which is a which is of course also the age that christ died at and they a lot of people seem to have noticed this and commented on it in various ways there there's a lot of stuff in this particular retelling that is missing there's no gates of alexander there's no griffin chariot anything's like and and for the most part all of these tellings are very grounded you could say there is not a whole lot of what we consider to be like mythical yeah material that's actually in them they're they're they're pretty grounded all right so third guy on the list is of course julius caesar i don't think i need to introduce caesar to anyone and basically everything you know or heard about caesar is isn't is in this retelling why is caesar included he's included because he's he becomes this sort of this model of of kingship and nowadays like we're use we're we're conditioned to think of caesar as kind of a bad guy yeah i was going to say like yeah caesar not augustine yeah yeah so so we're we're conditioned to kind of see caesar as as kind of a bad guy because of his because because like he he sort of like brought about the end of the republic right yeah and also because he he was such a ruthless conqueror like yes you know this idea that he killed a million yeah but the answer the answer is is dante sees and dante's not the reason but dante just like as part of his whole world they saw julius caesar as being the as being sort of the the the first manifestation you could say of the ideal roman man or or the ideal roman emperor yeah right and so well like scipio africanus is the first ideal roman man but then caesar's the first ideal roman emperor and and so the idea was that that caesar was setting up a he was setting up like a perfect reign and and basically he had subdued the world he was going to bring peace to the world and again caesar shows great clemency to his enemies who aren't gauls and and i'm from france i am allowed to lie i know i know i know i know no but but like when he defeats like pompey's army and people like this like he's he shows he shows great clemency to them but also but also like he doesn't put up with traitors he doesn't put up with you know people trying to go behind him things like this ironically i guess because that's how he dies yeah but but in the in the end in the end so in in the lowest region of hell in the inferno right one of the three people who's in prison there you know you have three famous traitors and one of them is brutus right you know and so and so for dante the worst possible sin that you could commit would be not just treachery but treachery against your lord yeah and so in the structure of hell you have like hell is all these sort of nested descending circles but then the final the final tier in hell of circles is a city right and so the point is that these are the crimes that cause like these other things are like animal passions but these are the crimes that cause human civilization to cease to cohere as dante saw happening in florence and he saw happening in italy around him at that particular time and so what's the thing at the end of the day that most does that will it's assassinating your what they would have considered to be like your lawful ruler right that that's the thing that's going to cause society to cease to cohere yeah yeah so so julius caesar is is on here and i'll just say each one of these begins with like a little poem and so we're told great julius caesar next attained the name of the third worthy whose immortal fame remains still fresh in records of time he to the empire of the world did climb and what he conquered by his sword and fight he with his pen did elegantly right this is not great poetry but at length through many wounds his soul hence fled and he who never before was conquered in war he who was slaughtered strewed so many lands with his own blood and brood the seat of wronged justice and fell down a sacrifice to appease the incensed gown so there's this there's definitely this idea of of caesar being a let's say a precursor of christ and that he was a sacrifice that was necessary for the public peace right and so then like the gospel of saint john it says you know they say it is necessary that one man should die for his nation right and that's that's how they sort of saw what happened to caesar as it's sort of like it's regrettable that caesar had to be killed it's regardable that he regrettable that he kind of grasped for power too quickly but at the end of the day he becomes sort of a martyr to the peace of the roman empire and it's because of that i mean it makes a note in here to say not a single one of the people who assassinated caesar lived outlived him by more than two years yeah you know like all of those people and it's really the death of caesar at least in this in this particular telling it's the death of caesar that galvanizes the roman people and makes the rise of augustus a thing that's actually possible yeah basically from that point forward the the people at large can't conceive of of of going back to the older way of doing things okay so that's caesar move on to joshua everything in the in the story about joshua is just exactly what's in the bible so i'm gonna assume people either have a familiarity with that if they don't there are lots of bibles out there so go buy one just go i don't know what to say like the book of joshua is super super awesome but i will say this this is how his story begins it says who can see the sun and not remember joshua and the great commerce that this valorous captain had with the king of stars which is just i mean that's a the king of stars is god in this case right you know making the sun stand still yeah yeah yeah and the the host you know the starry host the host of heavens kind of like fighting on the side of joshua yeah all the world lift their eyes up to it that is the sun but none hath but none he hath lifted up his voice so far as it to make himself be heard and obeyed the stars knew joshua or jesus because he bore the name of him that formed them it is he that gave us the foretaste of the name jesus at which the heaven the earth and hell to bend the knee so and i and it goes on to talk there's a really lengthy and actually quite beautiful digression at the beginning of this talking about so i think sometimes like especially if you came from like an evangelical background we read joshua as sort of like the the kind of lesser sequel to moses like moses is really great and then josh was kind of and then after joshua dies everything just goes to hell yeah right but literally but joshua was not seen that way in the early christian communities and even even now in the orthodox church or in in these medieval stories so you have this you have this uh this sort of play on words in the gospel according to saint john in chapter one it says the law came by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ right so and of course so so it that's a play in words because of course jesus in greek is is joshua right that's the name of moses successor right and so and so so joshua was the one who's actually able to enter the promised land he's the one that's able to perform everything that god said and before him yeah and and conquer the enemies of god et cetera right and so and so he fulfills the promise right it's not moses who fulfills the promise right exactly yeah and so john chapter one is like riffing on that a little bit and sort of saying you know jesus right he's the fulfillment of of the promise so you've got joshua who is he was great we're told because he's so much worthier than the three before him because they worship false gods but he worshipped the true god by whose power he caused the sun and moon to stand still so yeah pretty cool stuff number five on the list and the exact middle point in the list is david and again there's nothing surprising in in the david thing like it's just all the stuff that's in the bible peop people should read the life of david like a lot i think because because be frightened if they do it but it's got everything it's just got everything in it though yeah i know but it's it's hard to see for a lot of people like how how much of these these these approximations of jesus story are in the story of david because they often they often are twisted like they don't look exactly the same or they kind of failed you could say almost like right kind of failed versions of jesus almost right right so you've got david number and then the third hebrew in the list is judas maccabeeus now people are probably a little less familiar with him than they are with joshua and david but he's the he's the sort of the bic the big leader of the maccabean revolt this is actually also in the bible if you have the director's cut version of the bible yeah i'm not gonna go too much into the the whole story of judah maccabees just for the sake of time but it's good you could say that he's the last glorious moment of of kind of jewish kingship before and also but also like the the the accidental opening of the door to rome right the maccabees make this alliance with rome and so later when pompey the great shows up with an army at jerusalem he's like well we have a legal document you guys said we could do this kind of a thing and that's that's i mean that's that's a historical fact but it's also in it's also in this legend okay again again the christians who put this list together still had maccabees in their bible of course so everything that's in the legend like again there's nothing surprising if you read first and second maccabees you already know all this all this stuff why is he in the list okay joshua that's easy david super easy to figure out why david is in the list david is also the great example of somebody who would be just totally hashtag canceled you know like he's he's just i mean david is just like he's he's he's literally all over the place yeah he's just he's so crazy but and there's like very frank discussion in in his legend here about you know the whole bathsheba thing yeah and what goes on there and the way that the way that all of the bad stuff that eventually happens to david family david's family kind of goes back to that and in spite of all of that okay i will say one thing so this is cool do you know i'm sure you remember when david gets the idea that he he wants to build the temple and he says it's it's it's shameful that the ark of god should dwell in tents i live in a palace right so something that his legend kind of points out which i never noticed before but it's totally just in the bible okay is that that is an exact almost word for word parallel to what uriah says when david tells him to come home when david orders him home to like cover up the fact that bathsheba is pregnant yeah uriah says it would be shameful for me to dwell in a house while joab and the ark of god are dwelling in tents really it's the same thing huh like and i don't know what to do with that it's like an opposite it's like it's like yeah it's reversed yeah yeah like i didn't even like i just discovered that like literally this week i was today years old when when i read that and i was like so yeah yeah i mean we have to think about it before yeah what it can mean but for sure it's it's clearly a reference they're referencing each other yeah and and i mean again like that's that's just in the bible but the the guy that was putting these legends together notice kind of knows the parallels there so that's okay that's cool so judah maccabees why is he included he's included mainly because he was a very successful military commander he was never his big thing the big thing that the maccabees are kind of known for is that they were they were willing to die for to defend god's truth and and the law of the law of god yeah and of course and the the the whole story of the maccabees is very important to us it's an early exemplar of the idea of the veneration of the saints in second temple judaism and all this different stuff and so judah and of course judah dies the way that a knight should die which is in battle right so he goes he kind of goes out fighting and we're told what are the things that make him great he the people wept and made a great limitation for the death of of a commander so valiant for whatsoever virtue hath of great whatsoever valor hath of generous met in the person of judah maccabeeus to make a marvel of his life and give a mortal memory to his name in the space of six years he sustained the great and prodigious forces of three kings of asia as you have heard opposing himself with a little flying camp in other words like a little guerrilla force yeah against armies of 40 60 and 100 000 men which he put into disorder and confusion he defeated nine generals of the infidels in ranged battles and combats killing some with his own hands carrying away their spoils so that all of his great qualities valor always held the upper rank and worthily entitled him to the name of worthy so in the list he's actually the one who's most known for valor all right so he's the third jew in the list and then we get to the three christians the first one is arthur everyone has heard of king arthur i think i'm interested to say why they think arthur because there's something about arthur there's an ambiguity about arthur right right so in this particular retelling a lot of the later stuff like you know having an incestuous son with his sister and things like this is it's not there we'll say like it exists in certain like tellings but there but but they hadn't come to dominate at this particular point in history it's not really in the english language it's really when when mallory does his retelling based on the french book yeah that that we sort of like accept all of these pieces as sort of like being set in stone one could say i did a little arthurian pun there like set in stone anyway and so in this legend it's mostly about him yeah and it's written and it's it's uniting bitten britain fighting off the pagan saxons and then also bullying the the roman legates who came to collect tribute from him so i'll i'll just say this at the beginning because this is like this is just like you know when when people listen to or when people listen to these series and they they ask questions like well did x really happen or whatever he's introduced with saying the british writers have related such strange and miraculous actions and adventures of this worthy prince that many intelligent men have been apt to think that all which have been written of his heroic deeds is mere fiction and invention yey some are of the opinion that there never was any such person but though historians disagree about times and places some writing carelessly and others superstitiously all those superstitious historians out there yet they all agree upon the predecessors and successors of this noble king but as it is mostly but as it is most awful infidelity to doubt that there was a joshua it is a wicked atheism to question if there were a david and totally unreasonable to deny the being of judah maccabees it may be judged folly to affirm that there was never any alexander jewish seizure seizure caesar godfrey the julius caesar that's a that's a bad julius caesar yeah or charlemagne so we may be thought guilty of incredulity and ingratitude to deny or doubt the honorable acts of our victorious arthur and this is the premise this is premise and vindication of our hero and his immortal name and fame whereby he justly gained the title of the seventh worthy of the world and now on to his history so it gets into his history but there is like a little kind of an argument at the beginning for like whether he exists or not yeah yeah his inclusion on the list because he is this he is this like you could say like a lodestone that attracts all these different legends and things like this and actually most of the arthurian legends aren't about arthur they're about the people in his court and it actually talks about that it says there are 12 you know like like he has he has as nice at the round table and if arthur wasn't so great then surely one of those guys would be in this list but arthur eclipses all of them for his acts of chivalry which is actually also i mean that's that's in the other like the more popular arthurian material as well the thing that makes arthur great i think is is the fact that a he is he's just like the perfect embodiment of all the chivalric legends right and all of the other knights had these different fatal flaws in to some degree or other but it's not until much later that arthur is also given one of those yeah and basically once once arthur isn't the perfect knight anymore that's when they have to bring on along like galahad so we have arthur then we have charlemagne yeah so we have arthur then we have charlemagne charlemagne is the great christian king right he's he's in this list mainly because he defeated saracen armies and forced lots and lots of people to convert to christianity and of course maybe the circus did they say that in the the thing that he couldn't that he forced well what it says what it says is that he overcame all of his enemies he was crowned emperor of rome and the christian faith he always defended against saracens he contended against the huns and the pagans he he too conquered and yet all of his fury he laid by if they would idols leave and the true god obey oh okay yeah yeah so yeah and of course enforce somebody it's like it's like if you convert then my sword will fall lightly yeah right exactly yeah freaky drinky huh charlemagne is is the the the guy in here that in in once is like makes the most sense to me like he's he's but he's the origin of western europe right the understanding of western europe the way we understand it is right found in the story of charlemagne and the frankish the frankish king yes but also like there are a lot of you know from an orthodox perspective like we're a little yeah little frosty on charlemagne yeah because he's also he's also the beginning of the schism even though it's way before the schism well there's also like a hint at what's coming in his court and his theologians and the way he sees himself as emperor you know in in competition with the with the byzantines when charlemagne was coronated he actually set off to constantinople to have a sakos asakos made like the like the tunic the thing our bishops were now he sent off to have one of those made for him to wear at his coronation and it was a very deliberate attempt to identify himself as sort of like the the legitimate yeah this is something people need to understand from charlemagne we'll get it when we talk about it more but he didn't see himself as emperor of the west the way a lot of people tried to portray it he saw himself as the roman emperor as the emperor as the one that succeeded irene's husband it's like irene is crazy and now we need a new emperor so he's the emperor so he he saw themselves as just the emperor stop just stop there like there you didn't right right yeah yes so yeah but there's there's a i mean there there is a whole thing i'll just read this bit the false synod of the greeks untruly called the seventh this is talking about the seventh ecumenical council whoa was condemned and rejected by all of the bishops who who subscribed to the condemnation and this is but this is like this is a historical fact this is right court theologians rejected the seventh ecumenical council and then later the pope had to basically tell him to back down steamroll through and try to get it accepted but they mentioned this in the story yeah this is in the story so the seventh ecumenical council is the false synod false synod of the greeks right yes yeah yeah so i mean this is why pope benedict says that the west never fully accepted the seventh medical council because it's just you see it much later you know you see it in these texts where it comes up again that it's like this council we don't like it even right and there's there's you know especially talking now and you know everybody's you know much friendlier and chummy these days which i guess is good it's nice that nobody's trying to burn me at a stake but but also like you know people will say well you know the roman roman catholic theology around the icon and the orthodox the the exact same thing historically that has not been true it might be might be true now sure you know i'm but but historically that that's not been the case even in the west even as they had they they obviously did have images but they would have looked at the the ways that we use the we use icons liturgically yeah because because we don't just like hang up some nice pictures or what you know but there's there are particular times the liturgy the priest kisses this icon the priest kisses you know this other icon and things like this and they they did look at those things especially at the time of charlemagne they didn't look at those things as as idolatrous that's problematic yeah and they and the west never took up the incarnational argument for icons and like the final proof of that is that when calvin criticizes images he doesn't even use he doesn't even address that argument right he doesn't even he doesn't even address the main argument of the seventh ecumenical concept because he doesn't know it doesn't know is yeah doesn't know it yeah so why is he in this list you know from the west from a western christian perspective it's pretty obvious why is the list i will say he he was seen he was seen as like this defender of the faith both against the false synod of the greeks as well as against the saracens or you know the muslim armies invading europe and but also for the west he was seen as a restorer of knowledge or restore of education you know bringing the monks in transcriptions there was a sense in which he was like an enlightener of western europe so all that stuff is in here we're told that at the when he was 68 years old that he spent three years you know the last few years of his life cloistered away reading the bible and the books of saint augustine it says whom he admired above all the doctors of the church so ortho bros just go wild with that and and he resided at paris had frequent conference with the learned and he there he erected a famous university of course paris is where the university is kind of like you know at least one particular university model is kind of birthed yeah right and so this legend consciously tries to connect charlemagne back to that and yeah and getting into a western scholarship is right basically in charlemagne yeah right yeah so and then the final person on this list who people probably most mysterious familiar with is godfreya bouyon who who were said who were told was called the king of jerusalem now we don't say he is the king of jerusalem we say he was called the king of jerusalem interesting so godfrey beyond just like the high level version of the story is that he was one of the leaders of the first crusade which was kind of the most successful of the crusades he he retook jerusalem and then died a year or two after retaking jerusalem and he he was he was the ruler of jerusalem after it was retaken but he refused the title of the king of jerusalem and i think this is this is he's on this list for a few reasons one is like within 10 or 20 years of his death there are already legends about him you know like fighting bears and decapitating camels with a single stroke of his sword and actually a bunch of the same kind of legends that get attributed to richard the lionheart who's another famous creator obviously i was a big rejected lionheart fan as a kid for you know obvious reasons yeah you know but uh there almost immediately after his death like he became you could say that he became people considered him to be the apex of the christian knight like like all of these things had been setting up to that and then he was like the perfect example of what it looked like in practice right so he was somebody with that was within like kind of living memory when these lists started to be putting being put together and somebody that you could look at like and very consciously say he's he's one of the like he was the greatest night of his day when he was when he conquered jerusalem and he was set up to rule it he was presented with a crown that's like really richly adorned with pearls and all these different things and he refused it and he said why would i bear the name of a king in a place where my savior was crowned with reproaches why would i take a scepter in my hand where he took a cross upon his shoulders why would i suffer a crown of gold upon my head where he received a crown of thorns so he refused the title of king and i think this is a thing at the end of the day that makes him worthy of inclusion on this list was not just his valor in battle but but at the end of the day his his his unwillingness to seize power yeah there's an interesting parallel also even in this image of the last roman emperor i mean actually there's no relationship well yes no you think there is well i don't know that there's a relation but but it's but it's the same pattern yeah the idea of like the last emperor or the the ultimate emperor basically giving his crown up to christ in jerusalem yeah in jerusalem in jerusalem yeah where else would this happen so he he he only rules jerusalem for a couple of years and he dies in the year 1100 and a couple of years later and then his brother baldwin takes but baldwin takes the title king of jerusalem like he he he accepts the crown but but godfrey didn't and godfrey's on this list and baldwin isn't so here you go so there you go yeah but it's interesting to see like you said that the last worthy has this this kind of rendering up of of civil power up to a higher state or up to god you know so it's like we celebrate all this civil power but we end with something which recognizes that it it's obviously in a certain manner there's a vanity to it and the one we we recognize the most is the one that kind of gave it up to god and so i think i think yeah he's sort of the plenitude of the whole list right at the at the end of the at the end of the day this list is not to say you know hey you secular rule ruler you should be charlemagne you know you should be like charlemagne in certain respects you should defend the church and you should descend the other thing it's not saying you should be you know judah maccabees though you should be like in certain respects but the very last person in the list is godfrey and godfrey does all of these things but then he refuses the crown he says christ is the only real king of jerusalem and and the where these are i mean they're all over monuments civic buildings fountains things like that in these public secular spaces they're also a major genre of let's say of drama in the middle ages and even into the renaissance like this is there there are you know plays within plays in shakespeare's plays that are masks you know m-a-s-q-e q-u-e there are masks or plays about the lives of the various nine-worthy's so these guys were in in some sense like sort of superheroes yeah right that they were like historical kind of a little contemporary you know hector's on a night on a horse with a with a lance you know yeah so they're historical they're kind of contemporary but they're also a little bit legendary and but but they sort of they sort of like caught up the whole ideal of into themselves of what did it look like in western europe to be to be a noble to be to be chivalrous to be to be worthy in other words still like have to have what does it look like when the virtues manifest themselves in a person who is maybe not exactly a saint but he is but is still like worthy it's worthy and it's interesting because in different from hagiography where in hagiography there would just be this kind of celebration of the saint almost without reserve right in these texts and in these celebrations you find the reserve as part of the way that they're remembered that exactly here they are remembered for these virtues but we also acknowledge these these problems that they had and these faults so so it's a it's a balanced tradition so and of course by by having these three triads like going back to the beginning of the video it had to be nine why did it have to be nine because you need like for this this this picture of chivalry to be something that can that that really has legs and is really part of this coherent picture in this vision of the world that they possess in the middle ages you had to you you've got to you've got to have all three pieces you've got to have your greeks in romans you've got to have your the you know the jewish inheritance and you've got to have the christians culminating in this example of this of this christian who actually kind of goes all the way back to the start right he goes east actually it mentions that and i don't know if this is something that happened historically or not but it mentions that he was like at one point on his way to constantinople so like so he goes east he goes and he goes back to jerusalem and he kind of like you know the the the circle sort of it brings it kind of brings it together yeah it brings it together so so it's a cool way to see how something like something like popular literature drama veneration all these things in the middle ages were able to tie into and down to just like ornamentation on architecture we're able to tie into the universal history in this way yeah all right so this is this has just been great just one more example and a very a very kind of thoughtful example of universal history and also an understanding of how we have this we have a sad virgin of the middle ages or that period of time where with all propaganda it was all just you know that there wasn't the subtlety of understanding that we moderns have but in this tradition we do actually find a kind of powerful subtlety in recognizing the strength and the weaknesses of our ancestors and celebrating them nonetheless and not wanting to cancel and destroy their memory because they're not perfect and they're not christ incarnate you know all of them right yeah it these takes are wonderfully complex in in lots of ways and and yeah there's definitely a you could you can think about the situation that somebody might find that found themselves in in the 1300s looking at this list and being like oh yeah these are great this is you know and this i mean this is popular literature right this is this is like common people were really into these stories and really into these figures and for that person to find themselves under the rule of a local lord or a king who was maybe not like perfect in every respect but then also you know but also you know a night a night is still a night like you know i once read this medieval account i can't remember where it is now about this man who walked like a hundred miles in a week to go because because he heard that a certain princess was going to be passing through the city and he just wanted to have the experience of seeing a princess and it was just like a common man and and this is the this is a sort of we can't we can't conceive now of something like that i mean i guess people will go to see celebrities things like that but we also we also sort of like they would have thought of like a princess as being like in some ways like like like ontologically different like seeing a princess is really different from seeing a woman right there they're not totally the same thing and so so if you're if you find yourself like under one of these these guys who's not not the best but then you can still see that he participates in these certain aspects of the chivalrous king the chivalrous man the perfect knight and and participates in them and just to some greater or lesser degree you can kind of celebrate and give your attention to those parts of his life yeah not these other parts i'll i'll just close with this talking about godfrey it says and this is the end of the book it says he was a prince in whom all virtues christian civil and military so those are the three kinds of virtues that each of these guys represent to some degree christian virtues civil virtues military virtues met in the highest point of humane perfection without mixture of any default so that it will remain difficult to find another
