in 1948 it was estimated that five percent of japanese males between the ages of 16 and 25 were addicted to methamphetamine another survey found that 30 of people aged 20 to 22 had either tried or were now taking stimulants like amphetamines and meth in the first few years after world war ii japan experienced a significant panic over methamphetamine headlines screamed every other day of attacks by delusional meth addicts stimulant abuse caught people by surprise and it considerably changed the country's attitudes towards such drugs in this video we're going to talk about japan's post-war heropan panic a japanese scientist discovered methamphetamine dr nagayoshi nagai was one of the first japanese scientists to train abroad in'71 he traveled to berlin and worked there for 12 years under the famous chemist august wilhelm von hoffman there he conducted experiments on vanilla and cinnamon extracts his discoveries in synthetic vanilla were notable and the government asked him to return to japan and help found a pharmaceutical industry dr nagai did so though he later briefly returned to marry a german woman in japan he began researching an herb called chinese ephedra or ma hwang there's a shrub that grows in the coastal and sub-alpine areas of mongolia and northeastern china the chinese had known about mahwang for at least 5 000 years traditional chinese medicine doctors used it to treat coughs and fevers and to induce sweating in'85 he isolated one the four forms of ephedrine from the plant and then in'93 he also managed to synthesize methamphetamine its original name was m33n as it was nagai's 33rd extract from the plant few people cared at the time a few decades later in 1919 akira ogata one of his students at the university of tokyo synthesized a much more potent variant called crystal meth again not many people cared at the time crystal meth easily crosses into the blood-brain barrier into the brain there it triggers an avalanche of neurotransmitters including dopamine which roughly speaking makes you feel good nora ephedrine which primes your brain for fight or flight responses and to a smaller extent serotonin all this means is that taking crystal meth leaves you with a rush of energy and a feeling of euphoria this rush happens quickly and lasts quite long about 8 to 12 hours but if the user uses the drug too much however it can leave them with hallucinations delusions sleeplessness and other bad things trying to kick the habit often causes withdrawal symptoms like decreased energy anxiety irritability and disrupted sleep patterns people often inject methamphetamine in order to get a faster high addicts often share needles amongst each other resulting in higher rates of hiv and hepatitis c meth was first used in japan as a cough suppressant or bronchodilator relaxing the muscle bands of asthmatics sometimes it was administered to those suffering depression and having lethargic symptoms but again it was not popular then in 1938 during world war ii the german army adopted it under the brand name pervitin for its stimulant effects the japanese heard about this same as the united states and the united kingdom did and several researchers like kenosuke miora encouraged the government to do the same miara's pharmaceutical company died nippon pharmaceutical company produced the most popular meth brand drug philippon or hedopon introduced in 1941 the name literally means loving labor and it became synonymous with all stimulants for decades so in 1941 the government approved the commercial sale of both amphetamine and methamphetamine without limitation the latter becoming more addictive became more popular the drugs were marketed as awakening drugs or wakeamines one package had on it the following advert for night work and other times demanding mental alertness for over exertion the most powerful new amphetamine on the market as world war ii progressed the japanese military adopted methamphetamine for the war effort sentries working on nighttime duty received a special meth tablet called the cat eye tablet workers and munitions factories received tablets of their own so that they can work through the night kamikaze and other special forces took a special meth tablet mixed with green tea powder and stamped with the emperor's crest it was called the storming tablet so math was widely used throughout the entire military complex but almost always in the form of tablets it is said that air pilots got meth injections they recall being told that they were receiving nighttime vision hormones imported from germany the post-war records indicate that these probably were milanotropins extracted from cows and pigs the military stockpiled huge amounts of these meth drugs calling it a mainland decisive battle weapon they lost anyway so i reckon meth doesn't help win wars japan's situation after the war's end was ruinous the whole country was in chaos there were no jobs food shortages were rampant and made worse by millions of japanese soldiers returning to the home islands many japanese resorted to alcohol and drugs to cope with this horrible situation there were signs of a meth crisis as early as september 1946 when tokyo's first meth addict was admitted to hospital the drugs fueling this crisis came from three sources first the pharmaceutical drug makers started dumping their huge post-war supplies into the civilian market these companies believed that they were helping the japanese people overcome their tiredness while working to rebuild the country they were also trying to make money there were 20 such companies and they advertised heavily to survive in a terrible economy meth was often cheaper than even alcohol second the military's drug stockpiles leaked out the american post-occupation forces tried to seize them for eventual destruction sending 200 american-born japanese nisei to help track it down side note the story of these japanese americans siding against the country of their own heritage is fascinating i hope to do a video about it someday despite these efforts many caches scattered across various islands and hospitals supply depots and even caves slipped through their grasp and third the informal markets and the crime gangs various drugs were quote-unquote diverted through the efforts of corrupt servicemen and the crime gangs on the streets methamphetamine was referred to as shabu meaning speed the drug was easily manufactured in small mom-and-pop labs with ingredients brought over from hong kong pharmacies so what happened is that many japanese soldiers simply took their pills home they like many others were ignorant of the drugs hazardous side effects they thought it harmless and when they ran out of their initial stash they went out and bought more like as i mentioned japanese were unfamiliar with the horrible downsides of meth and other stimulants like it and the contemporary documents reflect this attitude many noted the seeming positive upsides of these drugs on working attitudes and stamina but two deaths publicly attributed to drug abuse helped turn public attitudes against these stimulates drugs were widely abused in the japanese entertainment industry in october 1946 the comedian miss wakana died of a heart attack then in january 1947 the famous novelist sakonosuke oda died of a hemorrhage their deaths were probably not directly due to meth overdose wakana had been clean for two years and oda most likely died from tuberculosis but the newspaper seized on their well-known drug habits and attributed to that in 1949 the japanese government mulled over controls on the distribution of philippon the debate in the national diet started on the predicament of street orphans who lost their parents to meth addiction and were committing crimes to fund their own habits diet members visited the ministry of health and welfare over time they and the ministry staff concluded that the root cause were not with the children themselves but rather the adult dealers and smugglers getting them hooked on meth many ordinary japanese still believed that meth had a positive place in society particularly in its role as a work productivity booster one editorial in the journal of the japan medical association says when i met many journalists in a meeting and asked them about its use i was very surprised to find that almost all of them had been using it regularly of course they suggested that its use is not due to addiction but to the need to make work productivity rise they excused it as follows if the companies pay well we do not need to work until late at night and to use such stuff note how blame fell on certain groups of immoral people abusing the drug rather than the drug itself to them the drug was being abused by immoral people like entertainers and novelists moral people like office workers on the other hand were more than capable of using the drug healthily without negative issues in october 1950 about 100 young people in a village near urawa city in saitama were arrested in connection to what was called a mass sexual assault incident many of the perpetrators suffered from hallucinations and delusions connected to a meth drug called neo-agotine by toyama chemical it was found that toyama had produced over 10 million vials of the drug each month when their production quota was 51 000. unfortunately since the quota was only a bureaucratic guideline rather than a real law toyamas fined only 14 dollars for their contribution to the incident the people realize that better controls were necessary to keep young people from using these drugs thus in june 1951 japan passed a stimulant control act of 1951. it criminalized the import manufacture trafficking receipt and possession of these drugs particularly when done in concert of other crimes the police rapidly put the law to action in 1951 seventeen thousand five hundred and twenty eight people were arrested for stimulant related offenses but the law at the time lacked teeth the maximum offense was a three-year prison sentence and the crackdown shifted meth production from informal labs to organize crime like the yakuza by 1954 the epidemic was worse than ever an anonymous census of 127 142 people found 7.5 percent of respondents aged 15 to 30 used methamphetamine 75 percent of those people injected themselves with over five vials a day based on this data the ministry doing the survey estimated that there were over half a million abusers in the country meth-linked crimes were rampant but it was an april 1954 violation and murder of a young primary school girl named kyoko hasada in a school bathroom that really caught the nation's attention the murder was committed by a 20 year old meth addict named shikichi sakamaki who was captured with 500 vials of meth and two needles on him he reportedly said even i myself cannot understand why i committed such a crime maybe it was hitopon that led me to do it this led to an avalanche of meth related headlines the next few weeks a young female office worker walking home in tokyo stabbed by a meth addict she had never met before a 21 year old male addict in osaka randomly pushing three children into the water where they drowned in may 1954 half of the 60 murders reported were linked to meth the media and commentators whipped up the panic the three biggest newspapers ran drug related headlines 43 times between july and december 1954. they said it was a time of moral decay or moral insanity in japan that june japan amended its stimulant control act to crack down harder on the drug trade and arrests skyrocketed four months after the amendment the police had arrested 6 000 people in relation to methamphetamine 46 percent of which were for possession and the rest for usage or buying the police was reorganized focusing on both demand and supply one all-night raid in osaka in july 1954 had 2 000 officers searching 800 buildings indictments surged from 43 in 1953 to 63 percent and if you were convicted then you went to jail over 9 000 violators went to jail for stimulate related offenses between 1951 and 1956. the police spent heavily to get the word out on methamphetamine abuse case study interviews of afflicted meth addicts found similar stories the person first starts using methamphetamine unaware of its potentially dangerous effects perhaps for studying or productivity and the like but unexpectedly the victim finds him or herself addicted unable to stop taking the drug and with extensive drug use comes to hallucinations and violence so the japanese police believe then that they needed to get the word out on the potential dangers of taking these stimulants especially the young people as 50 percent of addicts take their first dose between the ages of 15 to 24. over 24 million yen was spent putting up posters telling people to avoid stimulant drugs at all costs the police eventually put up 225 000 pamphlets 470 000 leaflets and 385 000 posters throughout the country sometimes the posters were encouraging and optimistic a man in a suit pointing at an addict with the words let's wipe out the evil of stimulant drugs others were gruesome and shocking with images of syringes plunged into a teenage boy there was special focus on addressing young students studying and preparing for their year-end examinations a period of exceptional stress lectures roundtable discussions and presentations were all held at schools factories workplaces and even nightclubs combined with the ongoing media blitz the word got out a 1955 survey found that just three percent of the youths never heard of hiropod people through considerable blame at the foreign korean and taiwanese populations euphemistically referred to as third country residents a nationalist narrative quickly emerged that this epidemic came from bad forces abroad in this narrative the drugs were smuggled into the country perhaps by communists it helped shift public attitudes against methamphetamine use by essentially painting it as a threat to japan's future in 1954 the tokyo police claimed that 70 percent of the illegal meth labs were run by koreans they failed to note that the japanese police specifically targeted the korean villages east of tokyo for drug raids this dubious data point caused problems for the beleaguer ethnic minorities who have long suffered from discrimination and even violence this sustained police activity succeeded in bringing down the level of drug crime by 1957 census cards had shown a decline in methamphetamine use amongst the japanese population offenses and arrests started to decline year after year by 1962 the so-called heropon panic had largely ended arrests relating to meth declined to about 300 to 800 a year but this did not mean that addicts stop taking drugs many young people switched over to sniffing solvents and crimes of those skyrocketed to 20 000 in 1968 and 50 000 in 1971. statistics on the true size and extent of the post-war epidemic are hard to come by arrests and surveys can only go so far but the causes for japan's post-war meth crisis could be pinpointed to abundant legal and illegal supply a lack of awareness about the drugs addictiveness and terrible economic conditions changing the first two elements and an alleviation of the third help reverse this situation and helped end the herupon panic alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up
