ladies and gentlemen we have received a present from the chess gods here to start 2024 it's currently january 2nd hopefully none of you have failed your new year's resolutions already my new year's resolution was to continue to make interesting chess content and the chess gods presented me with a golden opportunity when chess.com announced that this was magnus month and we get magnus carlson bots you have chance now to play against sleeping magnus skiing magnus soccer magnus really should be football magnus chef magnus i don't know why he's chef magnus magnus himself and then if that wasn't good enough you get three magnus carlson in one and that bot is called the magnite well in today's video i'm not going to play the magna because the magna are too good but i will try to challenge the magna later this month again what i'm going to do in today's video is i'm going to play the magnus carlson bot until i win or until i lose my mind and if i can beat the magnus carlson bot which is probably rated 2882 i don't think they messed around then tomorrow i'm goingon to or sometime this week i'm going to take a crack at the magnus mot with stockfish actually you voted for this because i was going to pay sleeping magnus versus martin who we all know this goof but let's play magnus i'm going to give magnus the black pieces i'm going to give magnus the white pieces to start rather he could start with white he's going to say hello i'm magnus carlson there we go hi i'm magnus carlson i'm the 16th undisputed world chess champion that's what his tinder profile says as well i guess i will play a i will play d4 knight f6 and we're going to go from there that's what we're going to do and i've been the number one player in the world since 2011 very good very good the magnus carlson bot likes to tell you how good he is i'm sure he's exactly that same way in person knight c3 is inviting a nso windy and i will try to give instructional commentary as well well let's see how long you last good luck thank you magnus all right bishop to b4 playing a nso indian controlling this move e4 i don't really make small talk when i play can't control with the bot version okay nobody asked going to castle and now a very big decision like this okay so he plays knight e2 his idea is to play a3 and then and then go like this there's a lot of different lines here for black i'm going to play rook e8 and against a3 i'm going to play bishop back to f8 so i'm actually going to get my bishop out of the way and sort of make fun of this position okay he's trying to take some center space makes a lot of sense i think i can play c5 here i can probably also play just the very calm d6 maybe d5 is also a moved d5 e5 and then something like knight d7 although i am unfamiliar with the theory so let's just be solid he said good move that that must mean it was a good move the tension is building no it's not absolutely no it's not now i don't know c5 or e5 both look good i can also just slowly play and wait a little bit maybe i'll play e5 i think he's going to keep the tension he actually will keep the tension okay he plays d5 your piece must be in good shape with all the moving it's doing okay all right i hope my bot doesn't say something every time i make the best move yes it is annoying magnus thank you thank you for that observation i'm going to play a5 to stop the queens side expansion and maybe b6 and now maybe also g6 to control the movement there if h4 i will play h5 okay maybe i will just play h5 anyway and then h4 is he going to castle and then oh wow so he's going to he's going to wrap he's going to put the knight back on h1 amazing now the thing about bots on chess.com is that you know they they're they're very good but i definitely feel like they're they're beatable i have like no evidence to back this up what's whatever but i don't think they're completely invincible i don't think they're completely invincible let's go queen d7 to put the knight here okay we're both we're both rerouting i'll take a couple of draws you know if i can draw against magnus i think i'll be happy get the knight over there he says i see the real me would play a better move but the bot version will settle for that no problem i i don't really want to go b6 you know i don't really want to play this move because i think he's going to play b4 i think the bot is going to play b4 yeah and and now i kind of don't like i don't want to take cu i don't want to trade and allow him into my position he's magnus carlson after all sort of kind of not exactly but you know knight a6 now if he goes b5 i'm chilling he goes b5 i i am i am very much relaxed because then i can just lock the position i'm we have a very very tense game here i'm considering f5 and then maybe f4 as well maybe take take okay he does open the position but i but i i don't mind this i don't think i don't think i'm concerned let's put my king on h8 so we can maybe use the g file yeah he's trying to get my weakness is that a is that a major weakness or is that nothing to be worried about it's a big question rook g8 i mean i'm queen c2 queen b1 don't scare me yeah does c5 scare me does anything scare me i i have to remember it is a bot so like it it will play the best move a lot but not always okay queen f6 maybe take take the queen is going to come in knight h1 back okay that that looks like an admission that i'm doing something right e4 queen d4 looks like it wins material i don't i don't think it does bishop h6 looks good knight g5 also doesn't look half bad maybe maybe i do need to play h4 maybe i do need to control the knight i think he's going to go back h3 wow it really feels like i'm making progress here i mean it would be great if i would just beat the magnus bot in one video somehow i don't think that's going to happen i mean in one game not in one video cuz the point is to beat it in one video i do have to be a little bit like i don't want to take cuz i you know but but at some point this will be come the best move i just don't know if we've arrived there yet all right let's play knight knight g5 maybe f4 is strong and i need to i need to be careful bishop h6 is a major question am i ready for that position to open he can still play f4 very very very stressful if i move my rook he has the discovered attack on my knight which i really don't like queen g6 queen not queen g5 but just in general getting my queen there f4 is very bad because it gives up the light squares not sure what to do maybe i can continue maneuvering like put my knight there and there that could be an option i can play knight g5 inducing f4 and then move my my knight back but it why why would i do that take take he could also play let's play knight f8 i'm not making a committal decision yet i also don't feel like the magnus bot is making a comm a committal decision i really don't like how the computer is actually playing this and i mean it is a computer but i somehow don't am not convinced by is it time to close the queen side is it time to close the queen side okay he's trying to put the bishop there i don't know what i'm trying to do is is a more important question that's the real issue let's close the queen side i've locked the queen side the magnus bot says we all make blunders sometimes i just make less of them than you do way less of them i don't want to punish you for that move but i have to do i even know if this is a bad move he's trying to go to g5 do i continue to maneuver do i do i slide my queen back is that is that normal i really don't think i have that bad of a position oh i can't go bishop f6 can't go there because he mates me that i mean yeah that is generally a pretty bad thing i still can't play rook e8 because he has this stupid move c5 maybe king h7 he he can't take my pawn okay i don't but i i don't know where he's going that's the thing i i i don't know where that move is actually going to go so maybe now i play bishop f6 let's pre moove whoa knight g4 uhoh uhoh that could be really uhoh uhoh he said a capa blanca esque move if i do say so myself oh that's really dangerous oh no oh and i i can't take anything cuz he's just getting he's getting the pieces in can i take wait take take take is bad but what if i play take take and then i take i mean i must be losing right take take take fg queen e7 yeah i i i have to be losing oh my goodness queen e8 oh it's so bad oh do i have to just go back to g7 does he have this does he have this oh he just play king h1 oh that means that as long as i don't take this i'm not going to lose i think okay well that suddenly is a big boost of confidence what if i play rook a7 rook a8 is he going to repeat with me if i play rook a7 rook a8 i don't think he's going to repeat moves i think he's going to continue to improve his position oh okay i welcome that i think maybe not ah i had an okay position i had an okay position but then i didn't knight e7 queen f6 knight h8 i really hate where my king is positioned in line here but i i'm not i'm not as scared as i should be probably i don't think the best move is obvious here says magnus queen g7 wait is he going to sacrifice is he going to is he going to [laughter] sacrifice ah no oh oh oh and he's going to go rookie s i'm going to lose my queen no it was not that bad for a while i don't think it was that bad oh it's bad oh it's real bad i can't even go here no that was a slip oh god oh god all right bad to worse bad to worse okay but i but i do want to analyze that game because i don't think it was that stupid i i think i was actually kind of all right hold on a minute now hold on a minute knight h1 was crazy this was a crazy move we were maneuvering i was definitely worse but then but then the bot yeah this wasn't good this wasn't good i was right this was this was correct according to the computer now here i should have i should have been a bit more aggressive but i was i was really worried and then i think here yeah here it started doing stupid stuff and wow e4 what e4 take bishop d4 well trade this and then go what just go two pawns down just go two pawns down two pawns down and i have a better position huh queen f6 was bad i i i got into too much of a maneuvering game here i had a feeling i had an advantage here but yeah then i got really spooked when when it played knight g4 once magnus played this i was like uhoh yeah king h1 was crazy but and then knight h6 and i don't think he gave me a chance after that wow but i was actually i i was better i mean like i right here king h2 and you know if i if i had just instead of knight f8 if i had just played queen h6 queen g6 i had my biggest advantage of the game right here minus one damn all right we're going to keep trying cuz i think i think it's possible i'll take the black pieces i i gave you the black pieces but thank you magnus d4 all right wait no problem that you know that was close that was close i'm g to chowski or a london let's play a london let's be let's be smart and solid solid and smart h that's that is not even what even is that wow that's not normal you're not supposed to play like that this move is excellent bro the bot just played a knight c6 london ridiculous i guess it's just going to play like bishop here and and and pretend like everything is normal okay c4 going to try to play principal chess this is like one of the worst possible versions of the london that the computer can play said most people take my trades interesting choice what does that even mean most people take my trades okay i am slightly better i have a slightly better position against magnus carlson that is not something we can say every day yes of course the bot is going to play very like like that and i'm better because the knight is misplaced i'm actually actually quite a bit better i think let's play bishop d3 and then yeah it's going to play like this and it's going to try to get my bishop which is annoying maybe i should have went to e2 b1 or e2 where are we where are we thinking i kind of like b1 seems like if i play aggressively it might make a mistake but that might be a really stupid way of thinking as well e4 take take how do we feel about e4 take oh my god i can't draw moves queen d3 as well is kind of a interesting looking move e4 looks oh my god e4 looks i i i can't draw arrows oh my god oh my god that is so infuriating i'm trying to draw an arrow to show the audience that i'm thinking of playing this move cuz i'm defended and maybe got e5 ideas i can't draw it cuz i'm an old man i'm an old man i i can't i can't play normal mouse moves cuz i'm an old man okay i like queen d3 and i like e4 taking is okay but i think i think probably the computer's going to get a knight to the e4 square let's play e4 and trade okay is it going to take bishop to a what that looks stupid the idea is bishop to b2 and what if i just play queen b3 then what is the idea queen e7 then i have like this what the what is this move okay okay tweet at me if you beat my bot so i can ignore it that is true that is he does ignore tweets that's actually one of the more accurate things that they've said e5 knight d d5 i have queen c2 he's going to go g6 do i have an attack there can i play queen d2 and try to get my queen over there i i'm a little bit concerned that if i just start to attack the bot it's going to defend perfectly and i'm never actually going to win on the other hand this might be the only moment i have so i don't i don't know what to do i'm very conflicted what if i play queen c2 setting up the winning move e5 okay wow he is completely unconcerned about my plan he's just going to go g6 that's just what he wants and then what about queen d2 is that is that worth anything then he's going to play bishop c6 somehow i'm not that convinced my attack is all that good i might need a better plan like trying to play positionally cuz e5 g6 just doesn't look that dangerous for black and by the time i create attack he's going to actually he's going to get some good good piece activity so maybe maybe c4 maybe a4 put my knight on e5 the these pieces are a bit stuck which i'm not a huge fan of chess is hard why does anybody play this game let's go knight e5 bishop e8 i mean it looks like i'm doing something smart you are stronger than i thought is that true i don't know i was programmed to say shut up magnus stop getting my hopes up that you're complimenting me okay queen e2 i mean i'm assuming the knight is going to take the bishop now do i want to take with the f pawn or the h you're normally supposed to take like this i generally would agree with that but at the moment i kind of think this might be better uhoh uhoh he keeps saying i don't think the best move is obvious here and and i'm not going to lie i i am beginning to think that he's right i'm beginning to think that he's right because if i take i lose literally everything oh you know i got to tell you it is really unnerving playing an entity that you know you are probably going to lose against knight f3 maybe i'm taking too long maybe i'm getting in my own head maybe that's what it is maybe the truth is if i played faster i would win how's that for a theory like what if i just played really quickly played confidently wasn't afraid like these pawns are awful what but he can't take he can't take because i have a discover check okay is he giving me a pawn what's happening here take take take and then i can come back for i guess the idea is to play bishop f6 right that's the idea i mean it looks like it works so i think i have to grab a pawn while i can he has a very powerful c pawn but i feel like i can keep it under lock and key a little bit no i can't because he's probably going to go here so now or c2 so now the question is what about rook c1 or rook b1 let's play rook c1 and let's try to push our own pawn okay does he just double up and destroy me is that is that the big idea how about rook e1 hitting the rook oh i like that that's that looks very passive and very bad now i can take this pawn and positions still might be in the it's not in the balance that is a problem that move is definitely an issue and now i'm just upon pawn down with the damage structure and magnus just has a pawn oh my goodness this guy is so annoying let's get rid of the bishop let's get rid of the bishop please don't go g6 just anything but g6 oh thank you wait no that was still wrong cuz he just yeah i'm just two pawns down and i i am not saving this one we've made it to the end game bravo self-confidence is very important all right i'm down two pawns in an end game was i ever better did i ever have anything in this position anything like i'm i'm getting to positions that are kind of okay bishop b1 knight d5 okay i shouldn't have played e4 just shouldn't have played this move lesson learned don't ever push your pawns against magnus carlson queen c2 he was already better and then he was just winning just winning i mean and and what what does the game review say what does the game review say yesterday i managed to make a draw in the meantime maybe i should just start another game that's what i should do while we wait for this game review it's a one minute game review all right now you know what why why hold up why why am i no no i want white why am i trying to be nice to a bot he's a bot he has no control i control everything what was magnus's accuracy that game 94 it was 94% he made four inaccuracies one of them was in the opening and then one of them was was when rookie eight okay it's ridiculous it's so stupid yes yes yes i know you're the undisputed world champion magnus yes thank you all right let's play my openings let's play knight c3 bishop b5 okay this will give me a nice position this is where the real fun begins where where i traded a bishop for a knight you psycho okay i like this structure smart move said magnus thank you bud that's appreciated now i don't mind a capture because the doubled pawns look really nice for me i'm going to play king h1 to get my king off the the line there and now queen e1 and then i'm going to put all my pawns on light squares i guess the bot is going to try to play c4 i'm assuming that's the bot's idea to do this bishop a6 yeah it's trying to go here that's generally what what people try to do in this position i can play knight e5 or i can play just e5 i can just close the position let me close the position and maybe play knight out that way or maybe queen g3 or maybe bishop d2 i am not sure sure let's be let's be patient bishop d2 it's he's also being patient knight out to a4 i'd love to play c4 i'd love to play c4 wait a minute wait a minute i'm i'm really liking this oh this is they're giving me hope i don't want to trade the knight but i got my pawn to c4 which is really important because now i killed black's mobility wait a minute this might be it this damn well might be it i do do i have an attack what i learned from the last few games is there is a critical moment he might make a mistake is that moment now is that moment upon us or should i continue to prepare with moves like queen g3 let's play queen g3 i love this position i totally in control here the bot is malfunctioning it doesn't even know what it's doing oh my goodness we just need what does he even play what what he can't even do anything knight h h4 and then f5 maybe knight h4 and then f5 maybe knight g5 and f5 knight h4 f5 knight h4 the knight will go back to g6 oh this is crazy queen g4 knight i just got to just got to play it slow oh do do i play it fast or play it slow rookie one everything looks good every move in the position looks good i'm going to go here because i think i'm preparing this i expected that f5 takes here takes i need backup i need backup i can't just rush in so i need to bring my second rook now i have the boys all right now i've got the boys now maybe instead of taking the knight i bring the knight back and i play h4 h5 maybe that's the idea cuz i think taking gives way too much solidity so i'm going to go back i don't think the bot can fight back yeah i don't know what it it can't do anything to me maybe queen g4 and then h4 h5 maybe that's the plan queen g4 h4 and i get the pawn to h5 taking squares away he's not letting me do it and he's also looking to open here i can't take my i can't i can't fall asleep at the wheel can't fall asleep at the wheel maybe go back to a4 the knight over there is doing a nice job just keeping his position occupied okay very nice now maybe i can reposition i play bishop e3 to force this move maybe maybe that's the key idea bishop e3 get him to lock the center oh yes oh yes we might now be in business as long as i don't allow counterplay somehow as long as i don't allow maybe i maybe i go around that way oh this is massive magnus is playing my game now the bishop is on a3 the pawn is going to fall okay that's fine i got him distracted trying to defend himself over there i don't think there's anything now i'm going for it now i'm going to attack him because i got his queen to go offside excellent now i shove his knight backwards all beautiful stuff he's got no moves this is my moment this is my moment i just need to do it the right way rookie two slow play defend everything life is good oh the knight is going over there maybe f5 maybe f5 take take maybe the bishop goes to c1 as he he's arriving right here but maybe then kn have bishop d2 queen a6 or maybe now i just go knight g5 i just go all in or maybe knight h4 okay this is a big moment in my life everything i have ever worked for has led to right here right now f5 take queen takes knight f6 maybe i can play pawn takes no i don't want to lose i i i don't want to lose i'm not going to lose how do i deal with knight to b6 take this might be the only way cuz this is happening and i've got to deal with it yep i've got to deal with it and now how am i breaking in i don't want to go back i also don't want to play bishop d2 because then the queen has permanent eyes on that pawn is there any sacrifice is there anything that might okay i'm going to take now i think he's going to start bringing his pawns yep i've already allowed way more than i would have liked queen g3 or f5 take here i don't think knight h4 f5 he can take and then i'm not getting through i think i got to back up so i can enable this move but is he arriving no he's not arriving night it's so close and yet it is so far do i reposition then i would lose my queenside pawns this is crazy how is there not a knockout punch is it because this is a stupid bot how about f5 now i just got to go for it i gotta go for it e6 oh then he takes with the bishop oh he takes with the bishop and then i can't get the rook oh my god maybe now knight h4 just go for it just just get rid of the defenders all right get rid of the defenders just do my best bishop h6 takes queen f6 king h7 oh it's just too slow it's like a move too slow it's all a move too slow it's unbelievable maybe g4 rook f6 g4 might be wishful thinking but i'm going for it i'm going for it rook f6 i got to i just got to go for it this is insane queen c3 i can take i can play bishop takes as well i'm going for it i don't know maybe i might win i might lose no idea take here queen g5 he's going to get away queen g5 he takes rook h6 queen g5 is he going to play queen h7 is he going to play queen h7 or is there something else queen g5 is he going to go here oh brutal oh i missed that oh i missed that move oh i missed that move that's it that's the game right there i thought he was going to take my rook but he checks me into a check oh that's brutal and he can force a queen trade now that's tough i have to just bounce back and forth and i think he can check me and go defend himself or you just do that oh that's tough that's tough now he said you made it to the oh i was so close oh i was so close i have a feeling i was i had to have been winning i had to have been winning there what did i miss oh i had such a good position maybe just h4 h5 yeah before i wasted so much time i thought inducing d4 was correct queen h5 knight queen knight knight g5 queen h5 was was was correct i had i was plus one and a half i guess this was the wrong plan and then oh yeah the knight got there and then i went for it and i should have still what e6 what about takes oh my god what oh my god knight e5 how is this what is the i guess i i guess it's a draw oh i wasted a little bit too much time yeah this was really instructive closing the position the the side that wants to attack the other really prefers a locked center and then here i should have just been faster i should have played knight g5 because of h6 what i guess i can reposition knight g5 would have been a critical idea i mean there's still a lot of work to be done but h one more game one last game one last game i don't think i'm going to win with white i mean i don't think i'm going to win with black so one last game maybe he doesn't know some gambits let's see how's this gambit knowledge i hope he plays d4 he did not he he he did not play d4 okay well i'll still go here i'll still play a gambit it is a fun way of developing thank you magnus c4 is critical oh he's playing he's playing a very boring way white can like start pushing yo he played c4 there it is he said even i need to defend sometimes yep whoa that a move can't i take sorry am i stupid i mean probably but why can't i play this move what if i take the knight he can take my bishop and the queen x-ray defends the bishop right now he can't take my bishop because of my queen but if i take he can go here and now the queen oh that's that's like a poisoned horse and if i don't take right now his next move is kn here that's nah man that's crazy what a that's insane and what if i go here to try to wait what wait am i a genius wait i just take right i just take whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa that just took a turn wait a minute i got out of that whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa i mean i'm probably worse but i castled i mean i have a rook for a for two knights it's it's bad but it could have been a lot worse i feel like e6 i'm just going to try to trade the pawns in the center now hold up i'm kind of rejuvenated here i'm feeling pretty good about myself i'm going to try to trade off yeah and then what if i go like here i mean i probably should stop getting into tactical battles versus a robot but like what if i trade the queens he's going to zuk me no he didn't interesting okay is he gonna go knight g5 uh-huh uh-huh rook d6 i mean i'm going to lose a pawn and then it's going to be knight and two two knights versus two brooks uh-oh okay i'll back up yes sir oh crap oh crap i hate this i hate this i hate this i hate this i hate this i hate this oh my god i hate this that was unbelievable that it caught me with that queen f3 rook h5 is just so brutal i mean i played the best way apparently i played g6 and i was not i should have castled this way i guess but that was hilarious and then yeah i mean i'm just worse all right tomorrow i'm going to bring stockfish this week i'm going to bring stockfish and i'm gonna i'm going to talk to stockfish not the whole time not the whole time but i'm going to talk to stockfish a few times in the game and i'm going to beat this bot i'm going to beat this bot that's what i'm going to do we're going to see how many times i can i need to talk to stockfish during a game to beat the bot that's what i'm going to do okay that's what we're going to do get out of here
