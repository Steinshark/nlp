hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about tesla 0 to 60 time of 2.28 seconds as measured by motor trend now shortly after publishing that video jason cammisa and frank markus and motor trend reached out to me and they said hey the reason why your theoretical limit of 0 to 60 in 2.32 seconds is actually slower than are measured time of 2.28 seconds is because you are not including the amount of time it takes for one foot of rollout and so they actually write all this in an article i should have fully read it before you know publishing a video on it but regardless it's something i want to talk about here and talk about how rollout works why the industry uses it and how impressive this p100d actually is regardless of which which number were looking at 2.53 vs 2.58 (2.28) so what is rollout well if you take your car to a dragstrip you may have already known what this is so basically what happens is there's going to be two light beams going across that track you're going to have at the pre-staged beam and then you're going to have the stage being so as your engine up to that start line of that dragstrip you're going to hit the pre-staged beam and that's going to let you know that you're 7 inches away from the stage beam so slow down and check very carefully until you hit that stage beam then you're going to continue to roll your car up until you hit that stage mean they'll be a light that lets you know hey you're staged you're in the right spot don't move and wait for the christmas tree to go down so you know when to start your race so where this one foot number came from once the lights tell you to go what's going to happen is you're going to start moving and the clock does not start until this stage beam is no longer pointing on your tire so once there's a clear path through this stage beam that's when it starts the clock your tires going to start to roll you're going to continue to move and so you're already moving and this stage beam is still pointing on your tire until you leave it completely once you get to this position here and that's when the clock starts and so this distance right here is that rollout that's basically free time because the stage beam hasn't started the clock yet and yet you're moving and so typically this ends up being about one foot you get up to about three miles per hour and it gives you about 2.3 second advantage in your zero to sixty time now as you can imagine the rollout of a vehicle can vary and so there's two major factors that can change this the first being the diameter of the tire so if you have a smaller tire it would roll off of this stage beam sooner than the overall distance that traveled would be shorter and smaller tire will give you less of a rollout advantage a larger tire will give you more of a rollout advantage also the initial position matters so if you roll up to the drag strip and you come just right when you get onto that stage beam you stop then you're going to have more of an advantage than if you were to roll a little bit further and have left distance to travel before that clock starts so what the industry decided to do to normalize all this it's just decided that every vehicle will get the first foot free you don't measure that first foot of travel distance and so that keeps it consistent among everyone so the reason why all of the major auto journalists are going to use this whether it's motortrend road & track caranddriver whoever they're all going to be using this one foot of rollout and excluding that from their 0 to 60 time partly to you know remain consistent with the nhra which you know is basically the top tier of drag racing out there partly because if you take your car to a dragstrip that's the number that you're going to be able to get so you can measure directly with the car magazine and then also it's done to remain consistent with historical data so nowadays we can do all of this with gps and you can get the truth 0 to 60 time very easily and so many of the magazines will include you know both numbers for you look at just you know but they're going to give you that subtraction of 1 foot of rollout simply to remain consistent with all of history so if you go back and look at something in the 1960s and compared with something from today you can compare you know oranges to oranges or apples to apples i don't think many people say oranges to oranges but the point is you can compare those directly and that will give you you know something meaningful rather than if we switched everything today and then you went back and looked it wouldn't be a direct comparison so it's kind of silly to include it nowadays but thankfully a lot of the magazines will give you both numbers as motortrend did in their article on this so the important things that you can look at either or but when i was calculating my theoretical limit which was 2.32 seconds that was assuming the full duration from a stop to 60 miles per hour so what does the p100 actually do in this well they were actually able to cross that one foot and just 0.26 seconds a little bit quicker than 0.3 which is kind of an average of the cars out there they were able to accelerate all the way up to 5.9 miles per hour in that first foot and they were able to achieve if you include that rollout, a 0-60 of 2.53 seconds now this number is still actually really cool and here's why their stopping distance for this exact same car from 60 to 0 was 2.48 seconds so if you look at that versus the 0 to 60 it's a difference of one twentieth of a second between accelerating and decelerating so basically the car can stop just as fast or i should say the car can accelerate just as fast as the car can stop which basically does not happen i mean there aren't other cars out there that can do this so it's a very unique thing about this tesla p100d will probably get more of these vehicles in the future part of its the fact that it's electric there's no gearshift you get instant torque honestly this thing's not going to be using all of its torque until it gets to maybe 30 40 miles per hour because otherwise you're just going to sit there spinning the tires so it's got plenty of torque no gearshifts kind of gives you the perfect scenario of you know accelerating from 0 to 60 just in that last bit you know for maybe 50 to 60 miles per hour doesn't quite have the power to fully put down all of the grip that it has and so it has a slightly better braking time then it's accelerating time but for all intensive purposes i mean they are basically the same so very cool it's able to accelerate an average of 1.0g across the 0-60 range and it's able to decelerate an average of 1.1gs super cool now my other video i compared it to the p85 not the p85d just a regular p85 which was able to stop in just 102 feet and there are some certain reasons for that but basically that gives it a deceleration of 1.18g and that's where i came up with my theoretical 0 to 60 limit for the tesla based on the grip of this p85 at 2.32 seconds that it would be able to accelerate in so if you look at this vehicle here compared to the p100d though there are some major differences 4633 pounds versus 4891 pounds so about a 250 pound difference between the p85 versus the p100d it doesn't have that all-wheel-drive system so it doesn't have the two motors upfront and also has a better weight distribution for breaking for 47/53 vs 51/49 so it's going to have a more even load under braking and be able to decelerate quicker than the p100d so a theoretical 0-60  you know what's the fastest time we'll ever see a tesla p100d accelerate based on today's current street tire technology we're not talking about race car tires a lot of people like to jump in the comments and you know talk about you know top fuel at point eight seconds 0 to 60 things like that that's on a completely different tire we're talking street-legal tires here based on the grip that it has in deceleration you could expect to see a 0-60 of 2.3 seconds including that one foot of rollout time or if you're excluding that one for the rollout time as low as 2.1 seconds assuming a perfect world now this is kind of strange to say because this doesn't have motors up front so it's going to have more weight and going to have a different weight distribution so just based on its grip on the grip of those tires and assuming that you can have that grip for acceleration you could potentially see a 2.1 0-60 time versus the 2.28 which we saw in the p100d so very cool we're basically just coming down to the limit of grip now which is cool that you know technology has gotten there it's really everything is dependent on tires these days you know if there are tires there are street legal and come out that have more grip than our current tire technology then we will see these 0 to 60 times improve if they don't then they're kinda gonna you know taper off here at this limit so thank you guys for watching certainly recommend checking out the other video that i posted on this if you have not yet it goes way into the detail it goes into way more detail on all the math behind all of this so we're checking out thank you guys for watching any questions or comments leave them below
