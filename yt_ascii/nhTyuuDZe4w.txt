first off we have a guest on right here so for me to be able to try this v0 out we thought we'd get a little bit of a guest on now are you the creator of v0 there's a team there's a team was the person that prototyped it nice nice okay so you kind of came up with this idea behind it and then people ran with it yeah so so yeah so it uh so guillermo roush or ceo and i were joking kind of one day at the office about mid-journey and how jpegs or so i don't know our web 1.0 you know we really yeah what would be really nice if we had like scgs and then we're like well the usbg you can do html if you guys chanel could you do jsx i think did you react and that got us sort of thinking and that's what kicked off the project and then so some prototypes later yeah started on what was initially internally codenamed web journey and that took a a bunch of research and and prototypes later and then showed proof concept and then it kind of got green lit team formed around the ai team already is already at purcell like we already work on the isdk and a bunch of other ai related features of the platform just to make sure that ai is awesome on brazil and then this sort of product got green lit and we sort of shifted years into product mode nice is there going to be a v1 if v0 is great will there be a v1 maybe no i i don't know i think b0 is a good name so we agonized over it over days okay okay there were some terrible alternatives give me one terrible alternative alternatives big brush so bad there was a joke that like kept going through the entire naming i don't know saga that we should just call it we should call it life like something outrageous life like versel life something crazy screenplay and other horrend that was like a 24-hour moment so real talk i actually screenplay so bad we actually it's okay well first off i don't think screenplays that bad tz you may know tj t teach tv and i have a little internal little tool that we've been building to do you know youtube videos to have stuff being written and maybe we called screenplay you know for for code and youtube videos okay tough guy all right so i actually have v zeros here should i i should probably run without dark mode on right give it the full proper experience here well kind of you know whenever you do dark mode it kind of changes what's actually being generated and so maybe it would look a little bit funny i don't want to rob it of its of its potential here okay so i'm gonna i actually do have to ask one very important question before i click this button and prompt anything when is htmx support go you could probably do it i don't know i don't know where we get that much data it's pretty new right when was htmx created i think the very first version of intercooler was like 2010 or something like that oh so there's nothing that out there yeah it could be done it could be done might be great it's really just go templates you just actually just generate go templates or you just generate the basic yeah hdmi stuff just the html and then let the person templatize it themselves it'd be fun it's fun all right all right all right all right so what what do i what the the basic idea here is that i need to create something i just give it a prompt and it's gonna create me something right yeah that's the that's the gist the idea is effectively make a journey for user interfaces and the idea is that unlike mid journey though where you sort of have to prompt everything in one shot this will presumably allow you to iterate and we can do iteration after this but you can just keep prompting the same interface over and over again and so it's a little bit more figma in that sense it sort of diverges from the mid-journey zero shot okay speed efficiency entertainment well look at this thing go it's actually like filling this thing out that's pretty cool yeah that's a placeholder image it seems and click around to the alternatives you can see the other ones so if you click on a b or c you'll see differences there oh my god we're home we got negative two minutes ago i searched for this in the future is this was this skynet yeah there you go oh look you know i know it's like it's not i shouldn't be impressed by word calculator but i still get just so dag impressed by word calculator it's such a good it's so good it just it just feels that exciting it does yeah so i think your zoom the reason why it looks super zoomed in is that i think you're because you're zoomed in it's gonna do mobile but if you zoomed out oh nice nice okay and this is a placeholder so that means am i able to take this placeholder and try to put something and ask it to put something into it not not yet although that's something that we might do we also just might be like upload a bunch of images to like your account and swap them in and stuff i was thinking about that the other day but what i found was if you we had on slash initially but it really did tracks from the design like it's very very disruptive and makes you kind of judge the design based off the images because they're just overwhelm your senses of like layout and stuff so yeah the idea was just use something sort of basic and gray to really get you moving forward so i do like that actually now you basically can go to the code so you click yeah so now that the punchline is like it's generated real react code and it generated like that's compatible with chad cnui you can or html you can either like run the command if you had a npx v0 ad the id or just like copy and paste this into your next js app or whatever your oh i guess htmx supports html so your htmx app right so yeah this is just htmx and is this tailwind am i looking at some tailwind going on here yeah you're looking at talent yep all right hey that's actually pretty badass i like that i i am not upset about this at all saves you a bit of time now you can also like refine you can you can also nice so you can also if you go back to the canvas view at the top right all right canvas view nice oh okay oh i see that yeah lead rob says we need htmx tab so the top right if you click canvas click that again and now if you so you can edit just like this will if you type more into this prompt it'll basically like repaint the whole the whole the whole code snippet however if you go to the right of the input you click that little like what looks like a cursor this guy a little spinning on all the way at the bottom of the screen oh yeah yeah at the bottom oh and you can just select out what you want so now basically you can yeah you can swap stuff basically you can click and if you click you can reprompt that area okay can i can i do could i make it let's see make it twitch purple with white text can i do that yeah just because you give me the kind of the gray canvas and so it's like can you oh yes it actually does do that that is twitch purple i mean that says twitch purpley as purpley gets oh cool because then you know then i can keep on going here and throw in replace twitch with the svg twitch icon and put it before the name oh that is it's gonna be interesting one that's i mean i know why it's interesting after the fact [music] that was the greatest callback i did not see it coming back there two for two that's wow that was pretty cool what a moment what about we just shared a moment right there let's go let's go i genuinely thought it i completely just screwed up the whole thing and and it really did it it came fully back that we're so back on that one yeah it even gave me a little bit right here we're so back yeah wow that was okay i'm genuinely impressed by that i'm i'm actually pretty impressed by this hold on can i do one more yeah instead of like let's see let's see row based before or how let's see how do i say this in a way to make it let me let me hold on let me do it don't you give me any hints here could we have the svg and the prime gin on the same line instead of stacked i guess that's probably how a normie would say it okay okay the little flex row there we did a little flex row right yeah well i think the width maybe with auto thing yeah the whole so lay back up for the point of this and this is the point is to get you to the place where you just copy this into your app it's not to necessarily be a perfect design tool okay although it seems that everybody wants it to be a perfect design tool but the real goal and the name itself as well is that it's v0 right and you could just copy this and edit the tailwind and you know keep going with your life but this gets you from zero to one very very quickly okay can i throw something out can i throw one thing out yeah i honestly think you should drop react and just throw html or have that as an option because like i would totally like when i'm when i'm building dumb things at work and i have to do something really quickly i like sometimes i just need the make this thing right here right and i'm just like hey make the thing do that copy give me the html so i can just put it into whatever you know whatever set of crap that i need you didn't get the extent off of this if you go to the code tab there's another tab next to reactor oh boom okay perfect yeah yeah awesome yeah it's not as styled and beautiful yet but there you go that's fine with me i don't we don't need styling beautiful we got prettier anyway yeah we got prettier it will do all of it for us dude that's fantastic yeah yeah okay actually i i am genuinely you know i still so basically we do support htmx right you already do yeah you accidentally just supported htmx nice job you just did it you supported hyper media as as the application engine of state i think i said that right yeah hadios all right all right okay so this is super cool i really appreciate it look at that mobile view look at that mobile view go look at that mobile view go speed efficiency entertainment engine of the application say there you go i got it wrong yeah hyperme yeah yeah yeah yeah i got that incorrect okay let's see what let's see what was special about this oh yeah okay so let's get some questions here what was special about the svg generation because i said that whole like hey swap out twitch and make it into an svg and put it before my name and you said ooh what was the oofing yeah sdgs are hard well just because think about the way that like a language model works with svgs like it's very hallucination prone but we have a very special system that's for svgs so oh and it's because yeah because you know looking at this yeah this isn't the twitch icon it looks just like the twitch icon right it just created it yeah because there's some extra thicknesses in certain locations versus other locations so it actually just created effectively the twitch icon yes so it gets fancy there are a bunch of tricks it does also if it thinks it's close to a similar icon it didn't it didn't create the switch icon it looked up what the it found at the twitch icon in its database and decided that was the closest one to twitch and it used that okay okay so it's not generating like it's not actually like generating every token of an svg we found that to be like really difficult only some of the models were good enough at it so there's a hybrid approach where sometimes it does try to generate the actual svg on the fly and sometimes it just finds one that's very specific and like uses it in its databases okay we know twitch use twitch okay since you know twitch already you already pre have that kind of set it's missing the thickness right it's not thick on the bottom that's kind of you know i just noticed yeah i don't think all right so this is actually really cool so can you can you give me something that was very interesting about creating all this or something that surprised you because it sounds like you guys do a lot more ai than just i mean i guess what i understand and so you say you have a whole ai team and all that and so what are some things that surprised you about this how much speed matters the faster models change your relationship with the tool so we've played with the model speed quite a bit we've tried super low latency models that are not as good for lack of a better term but are faster and slower models that are more that yield better output but are slower and i think we're going to end up with two modes to be honest i think we're gonna have a fast mode and a or like a low definition but fast and a high definition but slow and the reason is sometimes just like when you're designing something you sometimes you want somebody really are like intricate and perfect and you don't care how long it takes you just want to be great and sometimes you just need to you know whip something up really quickly and yeah it's a different experience of the tool obviously we want everything to be fast in a perfect world of course right but yeah of their trade-offs and so that was one of the things that we learned along the way and was surprising all right you you can just say no to this question and don't feel bad i get it numbers are always tricky what it will you be let's see what's the pricing model gonna look like for this so yeah i can talk about it basically high level there will be pricing you'll pay per like you'll basically buy credits okay to use it'll be a credit based model very similar in essence to like the way that mid mid journey is base effectively priced if that makes sense yeah a mid-journer you pay for like gpu hours like fast hours and stuff like that and we'll do something similar we'll probably just keep it simple and call it like tokens or credits or whatever okay yeah dolly does something like that you get credits you just generate an image with a credit and i think that's what they use i can't remember but yeah i i get that will you would you consider a per install fee with npx installation right there i've heard they've they've really enjoyed their success with the recent changes so it seems like if you just hit him with that npx installed yeah i heard that one's awesome it's working out great oh yeah yeah that's where i mean that's personally where i'd go with the focusing model maybe 20 cents nice yeah or just views views just yeah if every time you view the html it's 10 cents but if you view the react it's 20 cents you know the premium output i like that yeah you could have prettier as an option you know just throwing that as well you can have unpridified code oh just charge people for prettier laughs premium features anyways this is awesome this is fantastic thanks for coming on and sharing this with me i'm glad that i gotta just check this out i genuinely i'm gonna try to take some time and use it in the next couple weeks building a lot of little htmx stuff i think it's just i genuinely think it's a really cool tool to just get yourself off the ground because you know every single time i build a little front end thing especially even with tailwind there's like the first hour of just like getting things into a place you know that's like the first step of every size like i i get a bunch of stuff into places that's the idea it just takes an annoyingly a long amount of time this all this is is just like the shortcut this is just the code snippet auto generation of place zero so the name's fantastic by the way ooh what about react native would you consider react native as well i was talking about this as a team i don't see why we can't try it i think so yeah all right jared jared palmer if you want to check him out on twitch i believe twitch has been your twitch has been popped up a few times and here i'll include it in the video go give them a follow good stuff going on up this is victor if that's not it that's a different person don't look at that one anyways anyways well thank you for joining me yeah man anytime all right take care happy prompting hey thank you hey yeah my i shall prompt from here on out and life will be good to me this is like this is what makes this is what makes sense right whatever i see these people try to make you know you you see it every now and then where people are trying to make the ai do like really big things why is the delay so great i don't know what's going on with the delay there was definitely a big delay in there just just ignore that we'll we'll take the delay out in post-production but i noticed that people are always worried about the ai stealing your jobs and all that but honestly i don't think that's something you gotta you gotta worry about right like to me this is really where ai shines is like just build a quick template that's all we want is a quick template and that is it and i think anything beyond that it's going to be too difficult or too unreasonable really to do to do anything they're not stealing front-end jobs if anything all it does is it just means that you can do more and google just said last night google so google tends to be pretty good at kind of guesstimating where engineers are except when they completely got it wrong and then fired a bunch of people including someone that's been there for like 20 years by locking him out of his email account besides for google totally fumbling the bag they fumbled the bag harder than netflix did with the witcher but besides for that they said that even with ai and how fast they're gonna make certain tasks they still think globally there's going to be a shortage of of developers for the foreseeable future so hopefully that makes you feel better i it makes me feel better so there's that the name is i think i mean i think ai is kind of cool right like i'm not i'm not an ai maximalist and i'm not an ai it's not going to do anything i just think it's gonna make your job less boring you get more time to do the cool stuff less time to do the boring stuff i never want to build another splash page another tweet another anything like this another one of these i just want to build for me i never want to think about that crap ever again again
