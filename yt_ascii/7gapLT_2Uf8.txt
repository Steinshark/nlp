we love eyes from across the room and i feel like i'm about to explode and i clench my hands tight so i want to lead you too soon give to me good morning friends we are going to be continuing on building this react app that i built started building a few videos ago and i'm going to build something really cool into it which is integrating an api that essentially tells me what to do but before we do any coding you know what comes first which is coffee let's go get coffee got the coffee check which is spelled everywhere of course and i also got a smoothie because can't live off of coffee despite what many of us programmers believe this is what you deserve okay so as i mentioned i'm sitting down today and going to be building onto the existing react app i'll link the github down below but before we get into it i want to talk to you about appsumo i have been using appsumo for quite a while now for both personal and business related projects appsumo is the leading digital marketplace for entrepreneurs they have tools that can really help automate all your busy work so you can focus on the important things from different business tools to web development tools they have everything i love finding deals on tools to help me be more productive and also help with my coding process the most recent one i actually got was called rocket scrap which is really interesting it's an api that scrapes html and json from any page in a single api request which is as i'm sure you can imagine very useful they handle many proxies browsers and geo locations so you can just focus on the data collection tools on appsumo are game changers for businesses i've saved time and money thanks to appsumo so i was really excited to share it with you definitely go check them out i've linked them down in the bio this is my go-to marketplace for anything when it comes to both personal projects business projects and if anyone asks me what tools to use when they are building a web development project i always suggest to go check out appsumo i'm a huge believer of quality over quantity and i think that should be taken into consideration for your work and your projects too and what i mean by that is using tools that will help take care of the mundane tasks or things that you don't really have any interest in so you can put your focus and your productivity to things you actually care about go check them out link is in the description okay i feel like the best thing to do is just jump into code so let's get coding okay so the first thing i want to do is just show you where we're currently at with our project so let's just start it up here npm start and as you can see it's just a static to-do list at the moment so a header and then some different kind of to-do's but i feel like the problem is i wanted something that's more exciting i thought why not get the to-do list to tell me what to do so if we go back to vs code here we need to find an api to tell us what to do and for this all i did was i searched up what was it ford api essentially what this board api does is all you have to do is give it a call here and it will tell you what activity to do okay so now i'm back in the project and i'm literally just going to make or this api call write an app.js i might move it later but right now i'm just feeling kind of lazy and to do that i'm just going to make a fun function to fetch the data so prompts to fetch data and we are going to return and the api which go back to the api [music] and just get it here then we are going to do response and get the json and let's console log out the data to ensure we're getting the right data okay and now we need to actually call this fetch data function here i'm going to use in the built-in use effect method which i already imported and just put it underneath here so use effect and this will essentially just call the function we just made [music] [music] okay i think we're good to go let's see what's going on [music] this is not what i wanted what's going on here let's see [music] tiffany okay let's try this again we can do this and then also too i was just reading that it takes a second argument so right now i'm passing an empty array and then let's call the data okay let's give this a try and see if this works now no this is not what i want let's see there we go forward api this isn't what i want oh because you know why i need to put slash activity at the end of it right now it's just a slash api see this should bring up activities there we go so right now the first activity is write a list of things you are grateful for and then it will change every time on refresh memorize the 50 states in our capitals create a meal plan for the coming week start a collection make a simple musical instrument so you can see it's pretty fun here you're just finding different activities to do and while some of them might not be the most realistic ones they're really fun to kind of let an api take over and control your life for a day so let's start implementing this further okay but i thought i'd make this a little bit more exciting and whatever the api tells me to do i'm gonna actually do it october doesn't say to go to mars or go to a concert or anything that's completely impossible for me but i will find a way to do it okay so i actually built onto a little bit and i didn't record my stream but i'm to take you through what exactly i did so as you can see here i made a data api and a set data method which i am using in my fetch data function here so data api i put in an array it doesn't really need to be in one i'm being really lazy today so if anyone has time and wants to like improve my code please do so by clicking on the github below and then doing a pr request and i'll check that later so anyway so i did that then i put a heading here this api is controlling my life and essentially i'm just mapping over the data api or the data from the api and returning the activity so let's go to here and as you can see this is gorgeous oh just to-do-list needs a lot of work still but anyways if i refresh every time i refresh it'll be something different so let's let it control my life what should i do i'm really nervous [music] well you don't have cats that's issue number one but i can do it for my dogs i'll take my dogs when i get home maybe that's what we could do let's do one more and see learn how to make an alexa skittle that's kind of cool [music] okay okay i like this one i feel like i should do this one totally easy today i don't want to do one okay i'm going to do it because i promised you i would actually no i'm not let's do one more let's see what else we've got winter favorite camp watch a movie you'd never usually watch okay this is what i'm going to do comment down below movies that i should watch by the way but i'm gonna think of one i'm gonna call paul actually after this and see what movie he thinks that i would never usually watch that i should watch it just cannot be a horror movie those like keep me up at night okay the other thing i want to do is i got a notification that someone actually did a pr request and contributed to this to-do app which makes me so excited so please go and check it out and do the same as you can see on my screen here they did some refactoring custom hook for data management and basic theming so i'm going to check out the code here i'm really new to this whole open source contributing and working together so please be patient with me and we will learn together i it's bad to say but i haven't been a huge contributor to open source pretty much at all so i think this is a really great way for me to have a better understanding of the flow of it and then also to if anyone else feels that way to contribute to open source by doing this project together let's go files changed and you can see what they changed here thank you for deleting all those extra ones [music] [music] oh wow oh my gosh i'm so excited this is amazing okay [music] now if i want to approve it merge pull request confirm merge this is really exciting [music] now into master so if we go to here [music] [music] oh because i didn't push my changes first okay so let's do okay so i absolutely love the changes that this individual made so thank you so much if you're watching this i hope you add more and contribute more to it so now i stashed my changes so i could see these changes now so i'm going to not stash unstash my changes and then push this up to github and yeah i linked it down below so make sure to go check it out and i guess i need to next on my list is go find a movie to watch that i wouldn't really watch typically when no one else can see
