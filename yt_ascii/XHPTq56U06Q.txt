hey guys and welcome back so in this video i'm gonna be talking about why it may not be the best idea to be using an ide that being said ids are a great tool but if you're a beginner and especially a student and you're using an ide you may be hindering your programming ability and maybe even your ability to get a job so make sure you listen to why you might not want to be using it so if you guys are interested in possibly winning one bitcoin by creating your own game written in python pi game or some other language i encourage you check out the link in the description and have a look at this website that's running a contest called game chan game jam so this contest runs until april'th so you've got about a month left to enter and the best game is gonna win one bitcoin all the details about the game how you enter how your judge are on the website but i figured i shout out to you guys because i know a lot of you're interested in python and pi game and this could look great on a resume to say you've entered in a contest like this and you submitted a game ok so before i get too far into this content let me just quickly say that i have nothing against ide s i love ide s and personally i use one almost every day now the reason that i'm recommending recommending you don't use one is if you're not an experienced programmer or you're just learning a language these are the reasons this is one you wouldn't want to be using an ide if you're experienced your developer you've been programming for many years ids are amazing and you're probably like why in the world wouldn't i use one and you're absolutely correct but if you're a beginner using an ide can really affect you and really hurt you and that's what i'm gonna be really mentioning in this video now the first reason i would say not to use an ide is if you're an absolute beginner and you're trying to learn programming using an ide is going to affect you in two ways first of all it's gonna be difficult to use ids are typically not easy and you have to actually learn them so learning not only how to program but now how to use your ide are just two things you don't need on your plate at the same time the second reason and i would say this is a lot more powerful than having to learn the ide is the fact that it's gonna help you in so many different ways that's not good for you for example if you run into some errors rather than testing your programming seeing the crash output it's gonna tell you exactly what the error is it's say this won't work and it's also gonna autocorrect lines so what that means is you're not really gonna be learning exactly what you're doing wrong and i had this issue when i started programming a job i started using eclipse and i would never have failed outputs when i ran them because it would constantly be telling me no you can't run this you have to fix this and it would autocorrect my lines so i realized i was forgetting a lot of syntax and if i had to use if i didn't have that ide available and i had to write and like notepad plus plus or even by hand i couldn't remember a lot of the reasons why things were crash or just the syntax in general and that's one of the reasons you might not want to use one because if you're just learning it's gonna help you almost too much you want to run into those mistakes and you want to learn the syntax by yourself you don't want to constantly have that aid of the ide helping you through the way and this is what a lot of professors and teachers says well using ids as a beginner is just not the best way to learn once you get more advanced that's fine but if you're just trying to learn the language an ide is really gonna do more harm than is good now the second reason i would say not to use an ide is similar to this and it's if you're a student now you're gonna be like well it can help my efficiency i like ide s i can code faster with them that's fine that's a valid reason to use one but if you're gonna have to be writing code by hand you better make sure that you know the language you're writing it and this is an issue that i see a lot of my classmates having they code with ids because it's way easier but then when they get to a handwritten test and yes we have to hand write code in university i know it's not 1990 they have a lot of issues and that's because they can't remember the exact syntax or their ide would automatically finish a line or it would add a semicolon or it would fix the brackets for them but they don't have that luxury when they're writing by hand right so that's one of the reasons you may not want to use one as well is if you're a student and you really need to know that language down because you can't look it up on a test and you're gonna have to handwrite i'd recommend at least before the test you're either practicing by hand or you're just using a simple text editor third reason you might not want to use an ide your computer simply can't handle it now i know most ids and computers and today is age run fine and aren't going to be laggy but if you're using a very mad very heavy and system heavy ide you might not have the luxury of being able to use that on every machine and going from using an ide to not using an ide on a different machine can be a lot more difficult than it looks this is personally why whenever i write java code i write it in sublime text i don't use an ide because i never know when i'm gonna want to write java code or if i'm gonna have to do it if i want to load up for example on my laptop eclipse and all this stuff i'd rather just quickly write it in a text editor and that's just personally my opinion a reason for why you may not want to use an ide now i kind of mentioned this at the beginning of video and i said it might affect you getting a job now this kind of wraps up all of the three reasons before in a job interview typically for coding they're very tough and they actually ask you to write code or to explain code in the interview now if you need to write code in the interview typically they're lenient on syntax but you don't want to be in the position where you can't remember certain syntax or certain errors are automatically fixed for you because you've been using an ide and you don't remember them in the interview now i know this is kind of a weird thing and a lot of people are probably gonna say oh no like i'd be fine but actually try writing your code in a text editor like sublime text or notepad plus plus or even just notepad and tab yourself and see how well you do see if you can remember all the lines see if you know all the syntax because that's something important and once you get that down it's fine to use an ide because you already know the stuff it's just aiding you with it but if you don't know it and you're using the ide then you're kind of just hindering yourself so make sure that you guys know the language and you know what you're doing before you possibly go to a job interview or go write a test and all you've been using is an ide so i'm gonna wrap it with the video now i know a lot of you probably have mixed opinions on this and that you'd rather use an ide and that's what you've been using but seriously please consider actually writing your code in a text editor and then using an ide if you guys are advanced ignore everything i've said but if you're a beginner and you're just learning or maybe even an intermediate consider writing your code in just a standard text editor see how you do with that and if you're fine then you can move up to an ide that's been it for today guys if you enjoyed the video please make sure you leave a like and subscribe and i will see you again in another video [music]
