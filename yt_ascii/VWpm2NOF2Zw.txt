we wouldn't be arguing about whether there were women and men if things didn't need to be retooled from the very bottom that's my sense of the situation now that is a critical conversation whether the god-shaped hole gets filled by god exactly is something maybe for us to discuss on the shows you're going to be joining me for the next nine evenings on my we who wrestle with god tour and i would like you to come armed with your sharpest sword and hold nothing back you've asked me to do something generally speaking i'm pretty good at which is to be disagreeable and tried to find holes and things i'm going to be coming at it from a kind of first principles uneducated but i hope sufficiently intelligent perspective and i think you could offer to the audience a really critical response that's thoughtful so that i can see if there's still holes in what i've laid out because i can't find any that's what we're going to explore i can't wait the history of the evolution of ethics in the last 10,000 years has been a history of the secularization of ethics and it's still evolving and we have issues today we have issues about vegetarianism we've given up cannibalism and slavery but we but we we there's still no agreements on a lot of fundamental issues and ethics but those agreements have nothing to do with [music] religion hello everybody i had the opportunity today to talk to the philosopher daniel dennet who along with sam harris and christopher hitchens and richard dawkins is probably perhaps best known to the world as one of the four horsemen of the an atheist movement that was been so influential over the last 20 years and as many of you know i've had many discussions with sam harris and a couple of discussions with richard dawkins another one hypothetically forthcoming and it occurred to me a couple of weeks ago that i had spoken with dr daniel dennet and i felt that that would be enlightening and necessary and so today we talked about his understanding of the relationship between science and moral mor it the relationship between morality and the secular and the relationship between morality sec the secular and the religious and we exchanged our views about how those different systems of apprehension and conception might be interrelated and talked about the difficulties in both discussing and reconciling the scientific and religious views dr dennett's viewpoint is that the religious viewpoint has been superseded fundamentally that it might have been a necessary precondition for civilized development but that it's been superseded and we got a long ways in that discussion not to the end and for obvious reasons but welcome to the exchange so dr danet and and i will call you dan i'm very interested in talking to you about your ideas about religious belief and practice and you may know that i've talked to some of the people who you've been intellectually associated with i've had two discussions with richard dawkins and i think we're planning a third if if the information i'm getting is correct and i've spoken with sam harris a number of times and i think good we we share a lot of interests you and i and one of them is a very deep interest i would say and i was reviewing your book today breaking the spell and that's really the domain that i wanted to discuss although i'm perfectly happy to branch out from that in anywhere that our conversation takes us and i want to try out some ideas on you and i want to see what what you have to say about them i'm going to start with a definition if you don't mind about from from your book so that we have some sense that we're talking about the same thing i think i'll try two definitions because there's two domains i think that we could dig into that would be very useful so like you i'm interested in what i believe i'm interested in the the scientific analysis of religious belief i don't think that we yes yes yes yeah and so so that's where i'd like to that's what i'd like to investigate so i'm going to start out with a couple of definitions from your from your books and then we can dig into that so the the first one is that you described religious the religious domain as a vowed belief in a supernatural agent or agents whose approval is to be sought and you that was a definition that i took from from breaking the spell i'm wondering if and then i'm going to add something to that and then i'll get you to comment about whether you think those definitions still suffice or maybe how they've changed in your thinking or anything you'd like add to them so the the other thing that i'm curious about here is you talked about aboutness and you said the aboutness of a pencil of the pencil marks the aboutness of the pencil marks composing a shopping list is derived from the intentions of the person whose list it is and i'm interested in that the relationship between intentionality and the reason i want to bring that into the discussion of religion is because i think there's a link between the idea that i've been developing and the ideas of intentionality that that at least in part typify your thought and i don't see the relationship precisely between those ideas of intentionality and this definition of rel of the religious enterprise that you described and so that's the first thing i'd like to get clarified so so my understanding of perception is that aim defines perception and that seems to to be akin to your to it's akin in some ways to your conception of intentionality and aboutness doeses that seem at least vaguely plausible yes more or less when i speak about intentionality i mean it in the philosophers sense derived from rano it's the about aboutness is a good synonym for intentionality and it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with one's intention if if i'm startled by a loud noise my startle is about that loud noise but there's no intention involved in the sense of what do you intend sir i may have some intentions immediately like i am going to run or i'm going to duck but intention in the in the like the legal sense of did you do that on purpose is is a distinct notion okay so can maybe you can clarify what it means that means in relationship to aboutness then are those that's obviously i'm not familiar with the distinction that you're drawing or sufficiently familiar what's the relationship between the concepts of intention and aboutness well the latin intender arum in is to point an arrow at and bren tano and others said this is the key to thought it's it's directed at something it has an intentional object the intentional object is whatever the thought is about and the curious thing about thoughts is that they can be about santa claus or the easter bunny and in that case they're about something that doesn't exist but that creates logical problems but we can set those logical problems aside and just deal with the fact that we have to explain how information that's in our brains can be about things in the world and also about things that don't even exist okay so that okay okay so that that that helps and and the the latin that you referred to is also very helpful so i'm going to throw something in from left field let's say so the word sin the word sin there's there's a a three language there's three language point of derivation for the word sin they're all from archery to sin means to miss the target so greek greek is hamartia i don't remember what the hebrew is chet i think but i can't remember it doesn't matter it means to miss the target and it is an archery term and so it's you could you could think of you could think of sin in that regard as malintention or mis intention or merely failure to miss the target and so so there's a there's a and and then you talked about intentionality with regard to thought being directed at something and so the the way i've been conceptualizing the religion enterprise isn't so much in relationship to the definition that you offered with regard to a vowed belief in a supernatural agent or agents whose approval is to be sought although i'd like to get into that because it's dead relevant let me run something by you so when we aim our attention at something we're aiming our attention within a hierarchy of aim and the religious enterprise looks to me to be the enterprise that specifies the highest aim or the most foundational of aims and i think that our our instinct that there's such a thing as depth say depth in literary analysis for example or depth of significance in relationship to concepts is a function of the fact that there's a hierarchy of of intention and i think that as you move toward the foundation or up to the apex depending on which metaphoric frame you use you start to enter into the realm of what's deep and that the realm of what's deep is what signifies the religious i mean this is like a technical definition and so imagine that your intentions any given intention depends on another intention and that depends on another intention but as you stack the intentions up and analyze them you go down into the depths to see what the foundational intentions are the the religious is the realm of the foundations of intention there is a good way of thinking about it so that's a different definition obviously than the supernatural agent definition and so i'm wondering well first of all if that explanation makes any sense to you because it's pretty brief and also what your reactions to that are well my reaction to it is that the term that i would use for what you're talking about is the summum bonum the highest good and that is not necessarily a religious idea i have my sense of what's the most important thing what are the most important things and i'm not religious but i'm i'd like to say deep i i share the hierarchy of ends that you describe i don't think of my endorsement and allegiance to that ethic as a religious ethic but there it is and i am happy to say there are some things that are more important than others okay okay well well that that's why i wanted that's actually why i wanted to start with definition right because there's no sense having a discussion about what something means unless we can agree what territory we're wandering over okay so now we seem to have established okay so we seem to have established some agreement that there's a hierarchy of conceptualization or you said even more specifically a hierarchy of good and you referred to the sunum bonum and and you said you have a hierarchy of good and you believe that there's something hypothetically something at the apex or at the foundation so okay so okay so let's see let's it's it's definitely the case that there are medieval conceptions of the judeo christian god as the sumon borum and there are insistences in the biblical corpus that in the final analysis god is ineffable even though he's conceptualized in those stories as a spirit with it with whom communication is possible but his fundamental nature disappears into the ineffable that's what that what the theologians claim when they're pushed and so okay so let's see if we can figure that out so i don't think that the conception of god as the sum of all that's good is an accurate conceptualization it seems to me it's more like whatever god is conceptualized to be is the is that which all good things share in common right i know that that's that makes that makes the concept of god something like the central element in a web of ideas that surround the concept of the good as such right right it's not exactly a sum and it's important to be precise when discussing things like this now you said you have a a conception of the highest good and so can i ask you what that is well it's not readily definable but there's there's i think that human beings are the measure of what's good and over the eons we have gradually discovered and invented and contrived standards of what we think good is and that's as much for you know a good wheel or a good axe or a good airplane or a good person and these all sorts of different you know there's even i suppose good machine guns good at being a machine gun but the moral good is a particular human realm i think animals don't really have morality they have something that makes morality possible but they don't have morality but we human beings have evolved systems of morality and they implicitly fix they don't define in the geom metrical sense what the highest good is but they they outline it they they point to it and and it's a moving target what we what we think of as good today is quite different from what was thought good back in old testament days nobody today would want to live with old testament morality uh we've we've come a long way from that thank goodness thank goodness goodness has evolved the cost of living has already increased 177% this year and continues to rise despite interest rate controls as our national debt

that's jordan to 98 9898 today okay okay so it was interesting you know when when you listed out things that could be good the the things that came to mind first for you were were were some of them were tool like a good wheel a good axe even a good machine gun and i like that i like that and i think we have some com ality of conception there too because there's a there's a pragmatic definition of good it's something like something that's good fits its purpose and well that would be in a hierarchy as well so that purpose would have to be good as well right there's there's a functional element to that and so okay and so the the way that i've been conceptualizing perception and i think this is a neurophysiologically informed conceptualization is that once we establish our aim the world array itself around us into something like pathways and tools and obstacles that's associated that concept i derived in part from jj gibson's conceptualization of perception exactly affordances right exactly okay so and and so what do you think of gibson's ideas i think most of them are are excellent i've been writing about affordances for some time and what i think gibson was weak on is he didn't talk about how affordances are actually tracked in the brain he he he was he sort of throw up his threw up his hands about that and and said the information is in the light well yeah but how does the information in the light get into our heads and do what it does that's the part that he was weak on but we're making great progress on that today in the neurosciences yeah okay okay so so let me elaborate a little bit on the gibsonian model and i've been thinking about it for a long time and i' i've specifically thought about some elaborations on it recently he talked a lot about affordances essentially tools and obstacles okay so i'm going to lay out a schema and you tell me what you think about this and i'm i'm hoping that it matches the underlying neurophysiology i believe i believe that it does so imagine that we establish an aim this would be with every active perception we establish an aim and then what we see in the world our our our perceptual systems are navigation tools and once we establish name or a destination we see a pathway to the destination we see tools that could that we could use to afford us movement towards the destination we see obstacles that could get in way so far that's pretty gibsonian we see markers of progress we see markers of failure we see allies and foes that would be more on the human scale and we see agents of transformation and the agents of transformation would shift our aims right because you as you said you know what what's good changes to some degree situationally like it partakes in a hierarchy of good but switches situ absolutely yeah okay and so i i like the expansion because a human being doesn't really fit the tool category but then we can we can perceive human beings who are useful and on our side so to speak and we can perceive human beings that are who operate in a manner that's in exactly so allies and foes seems to be a nice way of conceptualizing that okay so then i i think you can i spend a lot of time on assessing the neurosystem of a tool produces positive emotion the apprehen of an obstacle produces negative emotion and it's the same with allies and or with yeah allies and foes it's the same with markers forward and markers of progress and markers of failure so the emotions become calibration systems that mark deviation from the pathway forward and i i talked to carl friston here's something cool i talked to carl friston about this so i had wrote a paper with some of my students about 10 years ago where we tried to relate anxiety to entropy computation so anxiety seems to mark the multiplication of pathways to a destination so if you're right right so it's an in marks an increase of entropy and friston worked on a model like that but he added a dimension that i hadn't conceptualized he said that the reason that dopamine marks positive affect is because positive affect marks a decrease in entropy as you move forward to a destination so he you can actually conceptualize both emotional systems from an entropy perspective i think this is fine not obvious but but on the right tracks all the way along in in my work i've come to the view that all control is done by emotions in the brain there's no there's no operating system the brain is a computer but it but it doesn't have a rigid operating system the way a digital computer does it it's all control is done by resting control in a war or a battle a conflict between different emotional states that arise in our brains and that's that's why life is difficult is because easy things are things that are emotionally closer to hand and they lure us away from the better answers this is whether you're doing science or making a moral decision or trying to solve a math problem uh self-control is the the arena of consciousness and emotional veilance is what does all the pushing and pulling okay okay so let me ask you about that and that'll bring us back to the religious question to some degree so use you you you you characterized the landscape of consciousness and correct me if i get any of my summaries of your ideas wrong because i don't want to do that as a battleground between emotions and so i would say do you mean a battleground between emotions or do you mean a battleground between emotions and motivations well motivation is emotion too okay okay fine so we're going to we're going to put those in the same bin i i've mean sort of conceptualizing the difference to to me it's it seems practically useful to conceptualize motivations as systems that set aims and emotions as systems that track movement towards aimes because there's a bit of a difference it seems to me there's a well you know it's not a perfect they interact they interact i know and some emotions seem to set aims like anger for example does yeah you know so okay okay but that's fine so do you are you familiar with mer elad's work by the way the historian of religion no well i i know of it but i don't i'm not familiar with it no okay okay well he's ab he's stunningly brilliant by the way and to the degree that you're interested in the scientific analysis of religion i can't think of a better source he's amazingly brilliant and much of what he says works in alliance with the things we've been talking about so let me give you an example and this this also has to do with the issue of self-control so ilat has pointed to a theme that's developed in mythology in many many different cultures and it's the war of the gods in heaven and there there are accounts in in many many theogonies stories of the rise of gods of a battle between primal forces that results in the emergence of a dominant player now you can imagine that that's you could imagine anthropologically that that might be a consequence of something like this so you imagine that as a culture amalgamates the gods of the local tribes come together at the same time and there's a conceptual war and as the culture integrates those concepts war at the same time sometimes in the form of act ual physical battles and there's an amalgamation of conceptualization that parallels the amalgamation of of of tribal units and out of that often emerges something approximating a monotheism and i think that parallels it parallels cultural integration but i also think it parallels cortical maturation i think there's an impetus towards unification that is equivalent to the to the battle between emotions and motivational systems and their not their suppression that's a freudian model but their integration towards a higher end that sounds roughly right yes i think that's what maturation is all about that's how we become self-controlled that's how we become autonomous is by learning how to control our emotions but it's not as if there's a homunculus in there who's in charge it's that the emotions themselves negotiate a a resolution yes yes you only do one thing at a time yeah and so the what emerges from all of that noisy struggle in the brain is a more or less unified more or less self-controlled more or less reliable agent that's what free will is okay okay great we're going to we're having a hard time finding something to disagree about here so i'm i i think we'll get to that but so far okay so let let me tell you a story let me tell you a story you tell me what you think about this so the egyptians in their cosmology they put something at the apex okay that what they put at the apex was the god horus and horus was represented by a an open eye you know the famous egyptian eye everyone knows that symbol right and horus was also a falcon and the reason horus was a falcon is because raptors have superb vision so the the the the egyptians hypothesized in their mythology i think this was an emergent hypothesis that the agent that should rule supreme over the war of states right this would be the agent that if i was equivalent to the aware eye right so they put attention at the apex and it's actually voluntary attention it's even more specific than that it's voluntary attention to the what would you say it's something like it's voluntary attention to error that might be a good way of conceptualizing it right yeah and so i get it okay okay okay and and so all right so let let's turn to your original definition because there's something there's something definite there that i'd like to that i'd like to delve into so i i suggested that the way that i've been conceptualizing the religious enterprise was an analysis of what should be put at the uniting apex there that would that'll tie that in with what we're talking about you objected to the religious enterprise in your book that you're the sticking point for you was the idea that there was supernatural agent whose approval needed to be sought or bargained for okay so in the old testament corpus there's an insistence that the relationship that we have with what's highest is to be conceptualized as a relationship right and so that's starting to wander onto the territory that you're describing so i've been very curious about why it's conceptualized as a relationship so let me let me lay that out for you and and you tell me what you think about that so for example one way of conceptualizing the the god of the old testament is that is is he's the force that manifests itself as calling so for example when moses is attracted by the burning bush the burning bush is a very good example of this so moses is a a shepherd at the point in the story where the burning bush makes itself manifest and the burning bush is a symbol it's it's like a symbol of the the dynamism of life that's a good way of thinking about it because a tree is a good symbol of life and a burning tree is a tree that's in the process of transformation and so it's like a it's like a vision of hyper metabolism that's a good way of thinking about it but it's also a combination of being and becoming and so it's the manifestation of being and becoming that's very abstract in any case what happens to moses is that he's wandering around and he's by mount si and something attracts his atten i and he wanders off the beaten path to investigate that and as he investigates it he goes into it more deeply he eventually takes off his shoes which is a symbol of his willingness to what would you say depart from his current journey it's a good way of thinking about it you wear shoes that are appropriate for a journey and shoes mark identity and to remove your shoes is to sacrifice your current identity for that pursuit that's a good way of thinking about it and as he goes deeper into it eventually the voice of being and becoming itself speaks to him and that's what marks his transition to a leader now so god in that story is represented as that which calls to us and there's an autonomy about that see this is also what the psychoanalysts figured out is that there are spirits so to speak operating within us that aren't under our voluntary control that have the capacity for example to grip our attention and you said for example when we respond with a startle response there's no conscious intentionality in that we're gripped by something and the grip of attentional interest that's manifest in calling is represented in the old testament as a manifestation of the divine and so i'm wondering what you think about that and and about about that notion of of autonomy in interest and calling i think it's it's like a manifestation of the unifying spirit that might be another way of thinking about it okay well it strikes me as a very clear example of the excess i'll use a philosophical word and then explain it hypostasis of a perfectly real phenomenon people are always wanting to make a thing an object out of a pattern that they see the pattern is real you've described it just fine it but it's it's it's not an extra thing it's just the pattern that's there in the way people control themselves and learn to control themselves it's this is this is the light motif of my whole career people people think that there's this the what i call the cartisian theater the place in the head where this movie happens there's no such place there is no cartisian theater there's perception but there's not perception doesn't consist in re perceiving something which is displayed in your brain that's an extra thing that doesn't exist and this this autonomous god yeah from the old testament is another extra thing it's not needed it doesn't explain anything but it's a very human foible to postulate such a thing sleep is a foundation for our mental and physical health in other words you've got to have a consistent nighttime routine to function at your best but if you're struggling

hyperactive agency detector something like that is that is that an idea okay fine so i understand your objection okay so okay so okay so now let me ask you this so you said earlier that the good is something that transmutes let's say and recedes and right it okay that does what transmutes and recedes the good it it moves around it's a moving yeah good yeah okay okay okay so so so let me let me ask you what you think about this it's like a suum bon explanation for the relationship between the concept of god and that concept so imagine that imagine that something calls to you in the manner we just described i'm not going to hypothesize a god in the way that you you objected to okay but you know in your life that there's a sequence of things that call to you okay so now imagine that there's a commonality behind that sequence that all those things that call to you are point in you in a direction like and the direction i would suggest that they're pointing you in is the direction that unifies that emotional and motivational conflict you see what i okay okay okay so that that seems to be an okay explanation as well because this is actually how the god of the old testament is characterized right is that he is the commonality of callings and there's another element too that that that emerges because it's important you could think about calling as the as the manifestation of the positive emotions that pull us forward that's a reasonable way of thinking about it but the god in the old testament is also characterized as conscience right and conscience also has that kind of autonomy right because you call yourself out on your misbehavior and it's it's something that in some sense is inescapable okay so the the dynamism between calling and conscience is one of of the most profound ways that the god of the old testament is characterized in the biblical cor corpus and it looks to me like it's an attempt to characterize the orienting function of what attracts your attention and what also keeps you on the pathway is something like that so so is there any of that that that you would object to like that the the the i no no i think i think you're making a fair l easy topic more difficult than it has to be but it's an interesting way of doing it and i am happy to grant you that interpretation of of it's it's a way of reading the old testament where it makes a little more sense than if it was taken literally yeah all right so i'm i'm going to i'm going to go with this from the same issue from a slightly different perspective because i want to zero in on this issue of relationship because i i think that's the most fundamental stumbling block that that would be useful for us to discuss and i think it's the strangest element of the religious endeavor we we've established a certain amount of common ground in relationship to the idea of a hierarchy of value or a hierarchy of good so i'm just going to leave that sit for a minute but i want to investigate the relationship issue because it is key to as you point out in your book it is key to what people generally understand at least as part of the religious enterprise and it's also the insistence that's probably most susceptible to the objections that you've put forth for example with regards to the hyperactive agency detector and so i've been very curious about why the relationship with what's good is conceptualized so often as a relationship right as an actual relationship okay so so let me let me walk through something and you tell me what you think about this so i've been conceptualizing thought as secularized prayer and the reason i'm doing that i supposed to some degree is anthropological because i think that prayer preceded thought developmentally i think that's what the i think that's what the historical evidence would suggest we haven't been thinking rationally for very long it's perhaps several thousand years we've been thinking religiously for much longer than that and i'm not trying to establish a qualitative primacy here i'm trying to count for the facts so i'm going to outline what i think we do when we think and i'd like you to tell me what you think about the outline okay so okay well so the first thing i would say is that thoughts orient us in a manner that's akin to our perceptions and our emotions so they're of the same enterprise we we use thoughts to move us towards our goals and then to transform our goals yeah we do it's the abstract okay okay good so and and then i would say that thoughts make themselves manifest in relationship to our aim right just like our perceptions do and so there our thoughts are defined at least in part by our aim so so this is this is what i think i do when i think so the first thing i do when i think is admit that i don't know something so i come to the process in humility and i admit i have a problem it's like here's something i don't understand it could be something i'm curious about it could be something that's bothering me but i have a problem and i also admit that i have the problem and i presume that there's an answer and i presume that if i get the answer that would be good and then i would say i do something that you could describe i i i allow myself to receive a thought it's something like that now i could say i think or i could say i think something up but i don't really like that formulation because i don't think i don't think it's a good description of actually what happens what happens is that i posit a problem and and answers appear in answers appear to me that's good i'm i'm happy with that it reminds me of plato in the theotis where he says knowledge is like the birds in a giant avary and you've got all these birds the trick is can you get them to come when you call and and so you've got all these this you've got all this knowledge that you've acquired and the hard part is getting it to come when it's needed and how often do we smite our forehead and say oh i knew that all along why didn't i think of it uh that's that's when we find that there was something we knew that didn't get used by us at the appropriate moment and the best way to make the new thoughts occur to you is to be in a discussion like we're in right now it's to get another mind to help you and we stimulate each other's minds and dredge up new corners of the other person's minds which may have interesting ways of putting things that we hadn't quite thought of before then oh that's a good way of putting it yeah i get that that's de cart's big error was in being solitary trusting to his own mind and trying to get his clear and distinct ideas ever clearer and more distinct and the only way he could trust them he thought is if he posited a a benevolent all knowing god we don't need that what we need is each other so okay so let me let me riff on that for a minute so there's a gospel insistence that where two or more are gathered in the name of the logos that spirit makes itself manifest that's a good way of thinking about it and so imagine that what we're trying to do in this conversation and what we hopefully are doing to some degree is to stumble forward somewhat less blindly toward the truth okay so that's dependent on our aim and if our aim is at the truth then the spirit that makes that journey possible that's how the religious that would be the religious formulation the spirit that makes that journey possible will make itself manifest in the space defined by interaction would seem to me that would be a good definition of science too i i i would agree with that but i we can leave the religion right out of it and say it is the organization of science where trust is assumed but tested where people of different opinions come together and sort things out constructively and that's the best test of all of truth you said for example that they they come together in trust yes so so that i would say that so that there's a precondition for the scientific inquiry to occur even at the level of dialogue and the precondition is that we can trust what are what are we trusting do you think are we trusting what are we are we the in that situation what is it that allows for trust it's the good will that we normally assume in a civilized world when you and i walk down the street we assume that the people that we see all around us most of whom are total strangers to us we assume that they don't mean us any harm we okay we okay i like the way paul sebrite has put this in his book the uh in the company of strangers if you put a whole lot of unrelated chimpanzees in a large room together they would be terrified they would be screaming and they would be unable to sit there calmly and i sometimes point this out when i'm in a large auditorium and there's hundreds of people none of them related i said is anybody here scared to death no no no we're not we're we we trust each other that human trust is the key to civilization and to science and it's under attack right now with artificial intelligence and misrepresentation and the the technologies of misrepresentation which are eroding trust in a very serious way okay so so i use the same example by the way when i'm talking to large audiences and and the chimpanzee example as well and so you said that the trust that makes even a scientific conversation possible is the trust in mutual goodwill right okay so all right so i want to relate that idea of goodwi back to something that we talked about earlier so i think that if the battle between emotional and motivational systems occurs optimally it produces a unity of spirit that makes that trust possible that's what you do when you socialize a child like children are really socialized between the age of two and four right they're pretty egocentric and temporally bounded at the age of two they kind of want they kind of want whatever their motivational system wants right now and to hell with the consequences that's the definition of a 2-year-old and there's some wonderful things about that and then as they mature and as their cortex matures those systems integrate and if that integration takes place then you have the presence of a overarching structure that enables that trust to be made manif a child will learn to take turns for example that's why i say that free will is an achievement not a metaphysical endowment you have to become you have to develop free will and the reason why we don't hold children responsible for misdeeds is they they haven't developed the self-control they haven't developed the sort of trustworthy reliable autonomy that we demand of each other the price we pay uh in self-control is a price it's the best bargain on the planet it means that we can walk around without fearing

so let me make a leap here because i'm increasingly inclined to believe that the divide between atheism and science is an illusion and let let i know that's a huge leap and i'll backfill it and but you know the the notion of the logos that emerges as the biblical corpus proceedes is as far as i can tell it's identical to what you just described so the notion is that peaceful harmony and unity emerges when people aim up so they're of goodwill the emphasis on hospitality in the old testament for example is a reflection of that hospitality as the basis of society it was a sacred requirement to be hospitable people unify themselves in their upward aim and then they participate in truthful dialogue that's dialogos that's the exchange of redemptive information and that's the foundation okay that's the spirit that in principle emerges in the biblical corpus as that which is to be put in the highest place now let me tell you why there's if you wouldn't mind i'll explain why that's conceptualized as relationship okay so imagine okay so well okay so imagine that i'm maybe i have a problem with someone right and so my relationship that with it my relationship with them is choppy and it's degenerating into mistrust and you already pointed out we know what happens when the default presumption between people deteriorates into mistrust that's not good okay so now i see this mistrust emer in and i think well i would like to rectify that and so then i can go let's say meditate on that how would i have to reshape my perceptions and my actions my patterns of attention so that a pathway to harmony and trust could be reestablished with this person you could imagine asking yourself that that's a particular kind of aim and as a consequence i'm likely not necessarily but i'm likely to get a revelation of some pathway forward does that seem reasonable revelation well i don't know how else to describe it it might occur to you an idea related an idea might occur to you i yes i it i i i think those i think those are i'm not trying not trying to force this but i think those are the same concepts a revelation is something that reveals itself now i know you the problem is it begs the source course but i'm not too concerned about that at the moment but that so here so here's here's a here's an idea the the the thought that will make itself manifest to you is dependent on the aim of your request yeah independently i mean indirectly yes okay okay f okay so the what i see happening time and time again in biblical stories and i've looked at them in great detail is that god is conceptualized as that which you can call upon that which which will respond if you're aiming upward in something approximating love and you're motivated by the truth that's a definition like it's not an insistence about some extra human agent not precisely it's a definition of how to progress forward appropriately and this is why the stories that are sequenced in the biblical corpus are what would you say they're attempts to characterize that spirit like the spirit that should be called upon to set things right and it's the reason it's conceptualized as a relationship this gets to the point precisely is because it is something that you can call upon that will reveal itself and you do that as if it's in a relationship like it's not much now you you know you you pointed to decart's error so to speak you said that he kind of got lost in his solipsism and that he needed other people to correct his thinking that's fine with me because i think that we can call upon each other to keep us moving forward on the appropriate path but we also do that in internal dialogue right and that the question is what is it that you're calling upon when you have the pathway forward to a new destination revealed that's what's characterized as god in the old and new testaments well it seems to me we've improved on that and we call it secular science including philosophy including what universities are supposed to do and so forth we we are assuming good will and trust and we are letting freedom academic freedom rain and we're allowing ideas in that are welcome as long as they are presented in a spirit of of i don't get to lay down the law i here's my idea and if somebody in the group has an idea that the others don't accept then the responsibility to get the others to accept that falls really on the person whose idea it is and anybody who says well my religion says that this is just has to be this way and there's no argument about it we said well i guess you're disqualified i'm sorry you're disabled you can't participate in this discussion if if if you can't put your own ideas if you can't defend your own ideas to us then you you'll have to sit this one out because we this is this is a dialogue among equals okay so so here's here's the concern i have about that you pointed out that that that scientific enterprise is dependent upon the two things the assumption of good will and trust but also the presence of goodwill and trust right those are really separate things because you could have that and i could distrust you anyways or i could trust you and that wouldn't be there but for the scientific endeavor to proceed your your proclamation is that that goodwill and trust have to be there and it they have to be assumed well yes but it's also true that right i got that i got that yes absolutely it has to be there yeah at the at the cutting edge of every interesting scientific question egos reain and there's battles and there's name calling and there's caricature and it it's rough and tumble at the cutting edge but what's behind that cutting edge is the solid heft of the axe all the agreed upon things all the things that they're not disagreeing about and that's what gives the scientific enterprise its power let me add a couple of things to that scientific conceptualization and you tell me if they're necessary and if you're if you're agreeable to them okay so one would be the assumption that there is an intelligible order the assumption that that intelligible order is intelligible to us the assumption that attempts to map that intelligible order are beneficial yeah rather than harm this is this is those are that's fine okay that's a working assumption i okay i think those working assumptions are religious by definition because they're outside the purview of science they're the ground upon which the ground that has to be established before the scientific enterprise can function and i'm i'm not trying to catch you here by the way this is a definitional move it's like because it sounds to me like you're making the presumption and and i think it's an accurate presumption that there are preconditions that must be met before the scientific enterprise can proceed in in its proper manner and my question is th those presumptions aren't within the purview of science no no they are outside the no i mean they're working assumptions not if they're preconditions the reason they are within science is because science has a track record you drive a car okay you drive a car we're talk we're talking using very high tech equipment right now so far the evidence that there's order and that we've got a grip on it could not be better we can measure things to the to the microsc and to the micrometer and and and we can plot eclipses centuries in advance that is part of science and part of the and it's part of the structure of science and that's why our working assumption that there's order is it's not not religious it's scientific okay okay okay well then fair enough fair enough you're you i it's science has a reputation and the reputation that it has is well founded and the reputation is as an enterprise that can reveal order and to do that in a manner that's reliable and productive okay no problem i think that's a that's a separate issue in some regard from some of the axiomatic assumptions that we listed out it's like an addition to it it's like right because we talked about the necessity of goodwill we talked about the necessity of assuming goodwill we talked about the idea of the intelligibility of the order you said we can also rely on science because its claims to have investigated that order reliably have been validated repeatedly right so it has a brand in a ref okay so let's let's let's let's let's look at an ex let's look for an exception for a minute just out of curiosity so i was testifying before congress yesterday about or two days ago about something that you alluded to right the breakdown of trust for example in an increasingly technological world now you know the the chinese scientists the engineers they've produced a system in china they call skynet after the terminator series right and skynet is made out of 700 million closed circuit tv cameras which monitor everything that ch chinese do and when the engineers who designed the system were pressed on their use of the name skynet because skynet became a system that went to war against humanity they said oh we're producing the good skynet which is of course what the original engineers presumed in the movie series and so it's surre insane and extraordinarily dangerous now how do you but you see that there's a danger in that techn olog run them up absolutely now well why is how do if we're careful how do we segregate the perversion of the scientific enterprise which is still using much of the same technology and approach like it seems to me that in china it's devoted towards evil ends and that that's an everpresent problem well that's an ever present and ever lurking problem and so is the science that the chinese are engaging in that has this element of the extension of control and surveillance can we is that a false science or like how do we how do we conceptualize within the scientific realm the deviation from from the ideal that the chinese are pursuing and that that and that now threatens us let's say well many many years ago norbert weiner put it very well he he said don't make the mistake i can't quote him exactly but he said when when you make a tool you also make a weapon and how you use it don't think don't think that your defensive weapons won't be turned against you as offense it's it's yeah 16 years is the lag right i think that was from weiner too he said any weapon you make will be used by your enemies within one generation it's something something like that so and every tool is a weapon this that's true and that's why we need government and law law and order in addition to i mean science depends on it science depends on freedom and order and that's why that's why the science that occurs in the free world is way ahead of the science that occurs in dictatorships right okay so th those are part of the preconditions for the scientific endeavor that we discussed earlier okay now i believe it was in your book you described stephen j gould's to magisteria notion right that they were independent magisteria and in your book you you you weren't you didn't you weren't particularly convinced by that argument that that's a good way of thinking about it i i thought it was let let me ask you okay okay great okay so that's very blunt okay so so let let me reframe what you just said including that realm of conceptualization that that's in contention between you and ghou okay so what i heard you say you tell me if i've got it wrong is that the scientific enterprise nests inside another enterprise yeah that enterprise is associated with freedom and order a kind of order civilization and regulated by by laws right okay okay and that that system itself is predicated on a system of fundamental assumptions so let's say in the united states for example the entire body of laws that allows for the order that makes scientific freedom possible is at least in part grounded on our conceptualizations let's say of inalienable human rights yes and and that nobody is above the law so that's a that's a stacking okay so what what that implies is that the scientific enterprise itself is nested inside another enterp see that's the conception i think this is where gould went wrong you know okay well so then we could say in terms of his magisterial argument it's not that they're side by-side systems in separate domains it's that the scientific enterprise is nested inside a moral enterprise by necessity and goes astray if it's not nested inside thatal enterprise yes where where where g went wrong was in thinking that religion was the authority on the moral side it's not okay let's delve into how could how could a harvard professor in the same university where john rolls and robert nosic and other philosop opers have been doing magnificent work in ethics how could he forget about secular treatments of morality that that's that's that's the question all right so now we have a model of the scientific enterprise proceeding in the west and proceeding appropriately and positively because it's nested in a you said nested in civilization and we have civilization itself predicated on a set of fundament principles well okay yeah fundamental but evolving we don't want we don't want to be foundationalists in the in the philosophical sense we don't want to be rigid f hey i've got something to to to to ask you about with relationship to that so you tell me what you think about this so there was a paper published in 2022 in the fall i think it's it's a revolutionary paper i think it should win a nobel prize it stunned me so mutations are essentially random for all sorts of reasons they're random in part because the effect of cosmic radiation is random and obviously random random in in one sense but not in another okay well i'll let you clarify that i i'll just walk through the paper and then i'll let you clarify that if what i could i don't remember i'll put it in the in the discussion notes i i can't remember the citation at hand so you know that dna has the capacity to repair itself it does that quite often it error checks and repairs itself you know there's a there's a hierarchy of repair so that the more foundational genetic elements if mutated repair with 100% accuracy so there's a hierarchy so the genetic code allows for experimentation at the fringe and preservation of the core and so this is the reason i'm bringing this up because it's it's the answer to the issue that you just brought up with regard to foundational principles and dynamism that there's a core set of principles along around which an area of dynamism and exploration is not only to be allowed but to be encouraged but the foundational elements there are foundational elements you know that you know the vitim extraordinar cla extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence there are foundational theories in science that you don't overthrow without a plethora of evidence because so many other ideas depend on them so okay so the foundational elements see this is this is why i introduced the the definition of the religious that i started the conversation with is that because my sense is that the proper religious enterprise is the inquiry in not only into the foundational elements let's say that underly the civilization within which science is nested but that also govern the relationship between that foundation and the transformations of the foundation that are necessary i i'll give you an example from egyptian theology remember we talked about horus earlier yep okay so the the egyptians actually had two male gods fundamental male gods well there was three if you count the evil god and i'll mention him briefly so their god of foundations was osiris now osiris had some fundamental flaws osiris was a great hero in his youth when he established egypt but as he aged he became rigid and totalitarian and willfully blind and because of that that made him susceptible to overthrow by his evil brother that's seth by the way and the word seth becomes the word satan through the coptic christians as that idea develops so the idea is that there's a spirit of the state let's say of civilization for that matter which can rigidify and become blind and when that happens it's susceptible to overthrow by by chaotic and malevolent forces okay what happens under those circumstances is that everything descends into chaos the egyptians repr presented that as the rise of isis the goddess isis she's the goddess of chaos and all hell breaks loose she gives birth to this other god horus horus is the god of attention horus who's the god of attention fights with seth who's the evil god who overthrows the corrupt state and he loses an eye in the battle he goes down into the underworld he gets the eye back he defeats seth he banishes him he gets the eyee back he goes down to osiris he gives osiris his eye and now osiris can see and then they both reemerge and govern the proper state and so what the egyptians conceptualized was that the proper sovereign was the proper balance between foundational tradition and dynamic vision and that's what they incorporated as their core the core spirit of the pharaoh yeah that's the the right way of thinking about it and so that's how they balance the conflict between foundational principles and the dynamism that keeps them operative and updated as the as things change and shift around and okay so so here's a here's the thought so we talked about the scientific enterprise nested in a moral enterprise predicated on a system of principles so those principles themselves have a foundational element right and the farther down you go into that into the depths of that hierarchy the closer you come to what the evolved religious enterprise is aiming to specify the evolved religious enterprise sounds to me like science okay so i want to return to the model that we were fleshing out a bit and because there's something i don't understand about about the our exchange of ideas at the moment so i want to recapitulate what we've talked about in the last 10 minutes or so and so we were talking about the way that the scient ent scientific enterprise can go astray and we seem to agree that it has gone astray for example in totalitarian china and and there's examples of that occurring in the past obviously the scientific enterprise went badly astray under the nazis and certainly under the soviets and i said how do we ensure that it doesn't go astray and use said well it has to be nested inside a civilizational structure right and there's a certain conception of man and his relationship to other men and women within that underlying structure now what what i what i would like you to do if you would is to clarify whether you see the scientific enterprise as nested inside that broader enterprise like what's the relationship because this was the steph j gould question right he talked about two independent magisteria we're looking at a model where one the scientific enterprise is stacked on top of something else and i'm wondering if if you think that's a more appropriate conceptualization i i just want to get that clear well where g went wrong is in thinking that the second magisteria was religious as opposed to secular ethics is one might say half of philosophy and almost all of it is non-religious it's secular okay but is it scientific all the all the advances in ethics that we've seen in the last let's say 5,000 years have been fought by the religions but have gradually been won over by the secular ethicist okay okay so i'm clear about this so now let me me re recapitulate then and see if i've got the way you're conceptualizing this right so you have the scientific enterprise and if it's properly oriented it's nested in a broader moral enterprise but your claim is that the moral enterprise itself is secular okay is it is it sec that is that is it's it's the advances are secular and the history of the evolution of ethics in the last 10 thousand years has been a history of the secularization of ethics a way away from new testament ethics which was terrible to and it's still evolving and we have issues today we have issues about vegetarianism and about about you know we've given up cannibalism and slavery thank you that's good but we but we we there's still no agreements on a lot of fundamental issues and ethics but those agreements have nothing to do with religion okay okay so i've got it so your your your your your model is the scientific enterprise nested in a broader moral enterprise but you believe the core element of that in so far as it's valuable is secular okay so all right so then is it what are the means of validation of the secular ethical enterprise and now they can't be scientific if science is on top of that structure because then you those two things just collapse into each other so by what principles do the secular ethicists validate their claims if they're not if they're not validated scientifically well there's science and then there's but i have to explain this carefully politics science is about what is politics is about what we should do now these are both rational exercises and what we should do normative normative inquiry about what the norms should be and it includes logic game theory probability theory let's stop right there yeah there's more to it than that but but there's there's all of there are there are normative disciplines and some of it is very abstract like mathematics mathematical game theory and some of it and and mathematical logic and arithmetic and geometry there's a right and a wrong way of doing these things which we've learned not thanks to religion thanks to our mutual understanding of what works the reason we trust arithmetic is because it works no proofs that arithmetic was good would be worth a darn if we couldn't count on it to count to count our cattle and to count our money and to count the miles from here to there we have this uncontroversial base of achievement from civilization which has encouraged us to pursue normative inquiry rationally and by and large religion has not had any role in that or if it has it's been a negative role it has been to maintain outdated standards of morality on occasion it has helped wonderfully the black church was a wonderful force in civil rights in the 20th century but only by fighting the white church the white church dug in its heels and it's digging in its heels now and that's lament able what we need is secular ethics and secular politics religion was a wonderful taming force it's what i call a nurse crop do you know what a nurse crop is no i i i i think i think i mentioned this in breaking this spell my neighbor an old when i planted my hayfields when i had a farm he said you want to plant oats as a nurse crop first before the timothy the hay comes up he says it'll it'll protect the young timothy you you can harvest it if you want or you can just let it go but it it's a temporary scaold which protects the tender shoots of the that's a nurse crop so so i think of religion as a nurse crop for science we needed religion to have the sort of stability of civilizations for several thousand years but now we don't need religion anymore as a nurse crop because we've got secular systems law and order and the understanding of secular ethics so we no longer need religious ethics because it's it's outlived its usefulness and in fact it's become more harm than good okay okay so so let me ask you a couple of questions about that the the first would be what do you think it was within the terms of your formulation about the religious enterprise that allowed it to play its role as a a a precondition or as a nurse crop as in in in your metaphor what was it doing that was was useful and and correct i i can explain that with an old joke a main joke and sitting in maine and had a farm in maine for many years one little main town had had a sign that said the speed radar controlled and a newcomer said well that must be pretty expensive and the old said no no it's just a few boards and some white paint and a little bit of black paint it's just a sign it's the idea that somebody is watching you it's the idea that god is watching you that that's that'll be shorthand for the role that religion played it was big brother in the sky watching you and and that was a great idea it was a brilliant way of and i think it was it was it hl menin who said that your conscience is is is the idea that somebody may be watching you very powerful idea given given it given the absence of evidence for its validity let's say from the secular or scientific perspective what accounts for its viability as a stabilizing and civiliz ing factor and and this goes back this is a very complex problem right because we all already at the beginning of our talk defined the the truth of something at least to some degree in relationship to its utility i don't want to wander too far down that path because i know it's full of pitfalls but but how do you how do you what do you see that as do you see that as a necessary fiction on my view of religion we started out with polytheism and this is every every community had its own it's goblins and and fairies and nymphs and and other supernatural agents and with various talents and histories and those were what were they good for no nothing they they were just the uh offshoots of human susceptibility human fears human curiosity that generated this was the hyperactive agent detection devices the these were the spawn of those and when they became domesticated they were feral initially they were synanthropic beings synanthropic memes they survived because they could they were just superstitions but then they got harnessed by civilization and rulers used them very effectively and the many of the ideas of religion were clearly very useful to ruling classes to kings to despots to maintain law and order and the idea that another one in the same family with somebody's watching you all the time was don't don't blame me it's it's the big guy who makes the rules this is this is we see it today when the used car salesman says well i can't make you this offer i have to go talk to the boss it's a it these are there are all sorts of wonderful devices tools thinking tools that religion has evolved which kept the anxiety about god watching everything you do alive for thousands of years god is not watching what you do because there is no god that watches but we can still behave without that myth okay okay so let me ask you about that so there's my mind goes in a couple of directions i mean the god who's watching in the old testament is watching for very specific reasons i mean so for example in the story of noah god is watching and dispenses catastrophe when things deviate to to great a degree now that mean that happens all the time horic story well but it it's also something that happens all the time in human society right is people deviate and get destroyed and that's a i'm not making a theological case for that by the way mean we saw that happen multiple times in the 20th century where societies degenerated into like a power mad lenti justness and were essentially obliterated in consequence which which indicates that they've deviated from the central from some when things go wrong they go really wrong right and they go wrong because they've deviated from some appropriate pathway forward well there can't be there can't be wrong there can't be wrong without the notion of deviation right because if there's something that's wrong there's something that's right yeah sure okay okay so so that means that the fictional god so to speak of the old testament watches just doesn't watch but also watches to see when things are going wrong and in the story of noah god is the voice that caus calls to the wise to prepare when things are going catastrophically wrong right and that's a good definition and so okay so let me ask you about that what do you what do you think of the state of the secular morality at the moment that permeates the universities that permeates the universities right now yeah it's got some real problems okay how would you characterize those problems because academic freedom is academic freedom is not what it should be right now in in the academy and and we have a uh curtailments of of openness curtailments abridgments of academic freedom that should not be that should not be allowed why and what what's your understanding see my sense at the moment is that the secular project within the universities has gone badly wrong is that is do oh i don't think so well okay that's what i'm trying to get clear is yeah yeah i don't think the religious academy is doing any better that is i don't think religious universities bob jones university or other religious institutions have a have a have a better record i i uh think on the contrary we're we're better off with with the with the turmoil in the secular universities but it is turmoil and it's and some significant revisions have to be put in place and it's going to take some very careful work to accomplish that but it's got to happen okay so so given that given that the universities were the central playing ground let's say for the progress the maintenance and progress of secularized morality i think that's a reasonable way of of thinking about it what what do you think has occurred to put them to make them go astray and astray from what you you mentioned freedom academic freedom and we could expound upon that but like what what do you think's gone wrong well i think several things have gone wrong one of them is hl menin has a saying i i love to quote he says for every complex problem there's a simple solution which is clear persuasive and wrong yeah definitely and problems are hard it's complicated as one says and several of the things that have gone on one of them was postmodernism postmodernism was there was a there were some good ideas in its foundation but then they got taken up by people who didn't understand them and who o o overused them and who went wild and and said all sorts of stupid things and the scourge was postmodernism i have an article called postmodernism and truth where i really blame postmodernism for some very bad things but that opened the door for the uh identity politics that we see today and the virtue uh signaling virtue signaling yeah and the virtue signaling that we see today uh these are ideas that are running off the rails and we have to point that out and calmly restore academic freedom and a real respect for truth we could we could modify the m proposition slightly because i don't think he was pessimistic enough so there's two things that the simple elegant solutions offer right first of all they're simple and wrong but they also offer the holder of those ideas an unearned sense of their moral superiority and so they're attractive in two dimensions right so the idea that power rules everything which is a postmodern idea it's wrong and it's simp simple but it also allows the holders of the idea to identify with the oppressed and to proclaim their moral virtue and that's an almost unbeatable combination right you don't have to do any work on the cognitive side because you've got all your explanations in one cliche and you don't have to do any work on the moral front because as long as you're allied with the right side everything is right between you and god so to speak and so that's an incredibly attractive combination for people who are inclined take easy way out and it's and it's poisonous yes all right sir look we ag we we've come to the end of our 90 minutes and i don't want to wear you to a frazzle and i still want to talk to you for another half an hour on the daily wire side and i i'd like to thank you very much for allowing me to pick your brains in in relationship to your conceptualization of well let's say the relationship between the scientific and and the moral and the scientific and the religious i'd like to talk to you for another 3 hours because there's many other things i'd be happy to discuss but but i don't want to impose too much on your time and and i want to leave so far so good yeah yeah okay well let's leave it at that for now i it's possible if you're inclined that i'd like to continue this conversation at a different date because i'd like you to i'd like to think about the ideas that we exchanged and i'd like to figure out how we could continue the discussion there's still some things i'd like to get to but they'd take a long time to unpack and you know that might be good for another conversation if you'd be amenable to it so for everybody watching and listening i'm i'm going to continue talking to dr dennett on the daily wire side as you all know and i'm going to walk them through some autobiographical recollections because i'm very interested and i'm very interested in finding out how people's interests make themselves manifest across time and so that's what we'll delve into on the daily wire side and so maybe you could just close what are you working on now i'm working on the dangers of ai the dangers of large language models and how they are the the most dangerous weapon yet are you writing a book about that more dangerous than nuclear weapons are you writing a book about that not a book i'm writing i i wrote an article for the atlantic called the problem of counterfeit people right right counterfeit money is dangerous it's been against the law and should be counterfeit people are much more dangerous and they are now possible but we we can we can we can put in place the technology and i'm working with people in ai who who who know how to do this we can put in place the technology to make it at least very difficult and very costly in terms of prison sentences for those who get caught using counterfeit people and and we and and we should institute this immediately because as jeff hinton has said these things can reproduce and we are about to create a new horde a new epidemic a pandemic of counterfeit people which are going to destroy trust they can destroy civilization you know i just spent two days in dc h interestingly enough talking to the people i was meeting with senators and congressmen really about the dangers of counterfeit people so obviously we share a concern in that regard it's a very great danger and i've been working on it almost full time ahu uhuh okay i'm retired but busier than ever well i'll keep that in mind because we we got some we got interesting discussions going in dc and we're trying to alert
