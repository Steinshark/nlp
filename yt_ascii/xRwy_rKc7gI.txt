say ty's gonna be first out. if you won, what would you buy? - imma hold on to it. - how about you, connor? - i'm putting half of it away, and the rest i'm going to disney world. - how about you, ty? what are you doin' if you win 10 grand? - good talk. - i'm really cold and
tired. morale's so low. so low. it smells really bad. i've
never done anything this gross. hello? - hey, you seriously wanna get out? - i don't know. it's so cold and smelly. - hang in there until i get there. - i can do that. - are you sure you wanna get out? - the hypothermia, man. - alright. - it's just tellin' me to get out. - well, she's out now. - feel weird.
- ew, there's literally milk coming... i'm sorry for putting you
through that. that's kinda gross. so you made it six hours. how do you feel? - such a great experience. no one's ever asked me to stay
in a bowl of cereal before. and my competitors are a
lot stronger than me, man. - so ty, how do you
feel now that she left? gotcha. cool. so two left, how you feelin'? - oh, i'm good. i can go another six days. - how about you connor? - i'm goin' to disney world. - no matter what? - no matter what. - alright, so with becca down we've pretty much divvied up
everything that jimmy gave her. and we've decided that if ty ever decided to come back to life, he
gets whatever he wants. - chandler is not a good coach. - chandler's brought him chick-fil-a once. - so we're seven hours
in. i want some coffee. you want some coffee? - eh, i'll wait till
the mornin' for coffee. oh, hi ty. good morning. - alright, connor. it's almost 11 o'clock.
you asked for gushers. you ask and you shall receive. how you feeling?
- feeling great. - how you doin'? - he woke up. he was out for three hours. - i'm doin' well. - chandler came by. - really? what'd chandler say? - he just said, "i came
to check up on you. gotta go see the girl." - didn't even bring him any food. - geez. - alright, so what's happening? - i'm gettin' out. - why? - they're not getting out
anytime soon and i can't hang. so heavy, bro. - and he's out. tidepool rego is out. think of all the things
you could have bought. - could have bought a car. - so many gushers! - and then it was just us.
let's see how this goes. - hello? - alright, so have you talked to ty? - no. - well did you know he left? - no. - you were asleep. you
should have been here. all you had to do was
sit here and babysit him and you coulda won five grand. - it was once full, but
now there are only two. cannor,
- huh? - has become virtually useless to me. i don't understand exactly
what's going on anymore. 14 hours. but, we're about to hit the
coldest point in the night. it's supposed to get down
in 58 degrees, roughly. it's gonna get real cold, real fast. see who gets hypothermia first. - what did i just hear? - i'm callin' it.
- connor. - thought i had it, but- - what about disneyland? - it's too cold now. - hey, i'm calling chris. if he doesn't pick up, you can step out. let's see what he says. he's not picking up. chris, you missed your
chance to talk him out of it. alright, with the whole world watching. go ahead, step out. it's not too late. oh, oh. your feet are still in. you take those out, you lose. like a fish. alright, connor is out. this means you won 10 grand, and jake, your partner, won five. oh gosh. you smell like urine and milk. alright, let's go wash you guys off. hey, what's up jake? - hey, you called me? - yeah. so your guy got out, connor won. - what? - yeah, it happened like an hour ago. i was tryin' to let you give
him words of encouragement. so how does that make you feel? you weren't here when he got out. - i'm bummed. - i know, right? you coulda been here for his support. okay, actually i'm just kidding. connor left. you actually won. - let's do it.
- are you serious? yeah we won, are you
kidding? it's me, jake. let's be fair here. - so yeah, jake, you won five grand and he won 10 grand. how does that make you feel? - holy this is amazing. - the competition's over, and in 100% truthfulness, connor lost. that's why i was trying to call you. i was trying to tell
you to jet on over here. 'cause, you coulda
convinced him to stay in. - oh my goodness. connor, why? - i told him if he got the dub i'd let him plug something. what do you wanna plug? - so, i stream every day
on twitch.tv/scotchty. - scotchty. alright. i hope you guys enjoyed. if you're not subscribed, subscribe or i'll delete
