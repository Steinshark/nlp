hello, everyone and welcome!  as you can see i am here with charles from hubblemechanic (hello) .com (.com) and we're going to be talking about 5 ways to prepare your car for turbocharging, because charles what are you doing to your car? so i have a '98 gti with vr6 2.8 liter and we are going to be bolting up a turbocharger to it.  super pumped, should see about a hundred horsepower to the wheel increase with the turbocharger yeah, so i have a question for you charles we're going to we're about five different things in order to you know get your car properly turbocharged, right? what's probably the first thing you need if you want to turbo charge your car, so after you [have] your car, okay? you got a car the next thing you need of course is....a turbocharger [you] would need a turbocharger or it is really hard to boost your car with a turbocharger if you don't have a turbocharger, and so you've got this as a kit. yeah, right this came all [as] a kit this is a garrett t3 t4 turbocharger which means it's a hybrid so the compressor inside is different than the exhaust side okay, cool, [and] this would be quite a bit bigger than most most oem gas small engine turbocharged cars and how much pressure are you looking to put in your 2.8 will probably be running? about 10 psi of boost so it's going to be low boost levels. i want this to be incredibly reliable i'm not trying to push it to the max of this or the max of the engine that's what [volkswagen] is known for pushing it to the max. i was going to say reliability and honesty and integrity glad we got all those out. pew pew pew pew it's the gangster wheel what about [when] i'm not that gangster you can work out. maybe this one the charles what's next on the list so next up on the list is going [to] be upgrading fuel components in most cases? the stock fuel components meaning fuel pump and tank [high] pressure pump if it has one and fuel injectors are probably not enough to deliver the extra quantity of fuel that your engine's going to need we're pushing more air into the cylinder and we need to back that up with fuel. right, more power you need more fuel. the oem are probably going to have something capable for you know maximum power obviously and then a rich air fuel mixture if needed, but not much more than that so you need to be able to have more flow and that's what these will do for you as well as the [inline] fuel pump now the other thing worth mentioning about fuel is if you're going to be turbo charging your car clearly you know you're putting some money into it you might as well use the best fuel out there you can buy the highest octane you can buy and reason being is because that reduces your chance of having knock it's just one less thing to worry about so get good fuel in it get a higher octane fuel so you don't have to worry so much about pre-ignition or knock occurring in using those low octane fuels which are more more common to have in these kind of situations--- right and some of this may be a little bit overkill for me and the amount of boost that i'm running but i'd rather as this build goes on do a little bit more than i absolutely need you know you might be able to run on stock injector stock fuel pump but the last point you want to run out of fuel delivery is at the highest boost level right and then your lean and then all of a sudden you're getting pre-ignition and then you have bigger problems way big way bigger problems. they are problems like holes in pistons because of pew pew. because of actually not bew bew more like beeeeww...bewwwww the third thing we're going to need when we're adding a turbocharger [on] to our car is proper engine management so the ecm [and] monitoring, and we need a way [to] monitor will talk about the monitoring in a second we're going to need to have a computer that can compensate for this increase in air and this fuel demand simply putting new injectors in it is not going to get it done in fact it'll probably in some ways make your car run worse on an old car [like] mine it is actually a chip that gets installed. so you've heard people talk about chipping their car that one literally is a chip if the car's more modern usually it just comes in the form of an ecm tuned some ecms do need to be opened up to do this like adding a ground wire is a really common [thing] or simply plugging into the [obd] and changing the mapping and letting the computer know that you are now going [to] be increasing [airflow] of course then [that] needs to increase fuel change timing perhaps it really depends on how much boost you're going to be asking [for] from the turbocharger and in certain situations you're potentially electrically controlling boost as well so we need to have a computer that can compensate for all that stuff. okay and so on the monitoring end you're going to be looking at exhaust gas temperatures and wideband o2 sensor for your air fuel ratio right right depending on how you're doing it you know a lot of these things a lot of these turbocharger setups come as kit so it's going to come [with] a tune or may come with a whole new engine computer that does make it quite a bit easier, but even though the ecm is going to be tuned for it we still want to keep an eye and make sure that we're not running too lean or our timings not way off or when we haven't developed some kind of problem like a boost leak like a failing injector so that we don't run the risk of doing damage to the engine the great thing about cars that come turbocharged [is] all those safety measures [are] [built-in] yup and good kits will have those safety measures, too but monitoring exhaust gas temperature and really more importantly monitoring air fuel with a wideband o2 that's the key is a wideband is vital to make sure that you don't do catastrophic engine damage now charles [a] tool i have found helpful over the years in explaining on how stuff works. [i] didn't know this was coming is this white board and so what i wanted to mention? we're going to get the reflections out there we go we go to the things basically you want to keep it safe and in order to keep it safe you want to start with a really rich mixture because that reduces the chance of knock so you start rich and then you start leaning out that mixture while you're tuning it and eventually you know your power is going to keep increasing and then eventually that power is going to start to drop and once it starts to drop you go back to where it wasn't dropping you can get peak power or you can stay a little bit safe and go left of that same thing with timing so you're going to start with heavily retarded timing. that's safer you're not going to run into knock issues or pre-ignition issues and then you slightly advance that time you keep advancing it you'll start to get to a point. where you reach peak power you don't want to get into a point where you start to get knock but basically you would you advance it as much as you can based on the fuel that you have the other parameters of your engine that allow [for] that and then you can reach a peak power [two] ways of tuning it but basically if you want to be as safe as possible you keep it really rich you keep the timing retarded and then you play with that in order [to] you know have a car that's more fun but still reliable and i think it's really important to mention that this kind of tuning is usually best done on a dyno to eliminate all of [the] other variables that would happen and not only it's a thousand times safer but to eliminate all that stuff that could [potentially] happen if you did it in the back street moving on to number four we're going to talk about cooling. so we've got three [different] things we're going to talk [about] here our air. yeah, oil. yes, and water-ish right we'll call it coolant. we'll call it water ethylene glycol. we'll call it coolant. coolant g 13++ in this case yeah, so we are going to be putting more air we want to you know one really common thing on most factory turbocharged cars. is they have a charge cooler whether that's air to air like this one or air to water like some other ones adding you know adding an intercooler or charge cooler is not mandatory you don't have to do it, but it's more efficient it's way more efficient and boy if you're going to go to all the trouble to bolt one of these babies on you might as well put in a little extra work and cool that air coming into the engine. i would agree with you. just don't paint it black. so when you compress air heap up you don't want that heat going in your engine you want cool air lots of oxygen and so you get one of these and you cool that you bring that intake air temperature down you make more power and you do it more efficiently so great thing to do one thing on this you want to make sure you're using an appropriately sized one you don't necessarily need one that's you know three feet tall right, and you also want to make sure you're not blocking too much of the radiator by installing one of these because that coolant cooling down the coolant is also vital in this situation right absolutely and you [know] as you mentioned if you get super big with this you lose the effectiveness of it, so it's not necessary in the first place and then also you're going to increase turbo lag because you're needing to fill this [entire] thing up with air before it gets into the engine right so not the smartest thing you want it appropriately-sized moving on to the turbocharger itself you could have a liquid coolant in this this one is just oil cooled and also, you know allows for what does oil do right, so this is friction so when it comes to cooling and lubricating [the] turbocharger this one is actually just oil cooled and lubricated there are other setups that would have coolant lines coming to and leaving the turbocharger as well, so we need to make sure we're pumping cooled oil into this turbocharger, and then having a way for it to drain back into the oil pan so typically you'll get an oil pan with a bung welded onto it so [you] can have a return you know the feed source for the oil it really depends on the setup on my setup it's going to be coming right out of the oil filter housing and then as far as coolant it would be just the [same] you would need cool coolant to it and then a way for it to drain out you know back to the radiator or whatever the setup? really best suits for for the vehicle, but you do on every single turbocharger i've ever seen have a spot for oil feed and oil return. and so then finally of course you're making more power more power means more energy and more [energy] means more heat ultimately because internal combustion engines are not perfectly efficient they're like not that efficient at all that's like [30%] or so we can tell so anyways you've got a lot of heat that heat needs to go somewhere you may need to upgrade your radiator as a result so you can compensate with that that could also mean getting higher flow fans and then you know some of these radiators if you get into higher temperatures if you're tracking your car things like that you may want to go with like all aluminum tanks rather than just plastic end tanks and really it really sorry to cut you off it really depends on the setup for that. you know it [from] my set up radiators fine i will be switching to two electric fans. the car from the factory had one electric fan and then one auxilary fan driven by a belt off the main fan which is [a] little bit inefficient as far as the overall efficiency of the cooling system goes so i am going to upgrade to two electric fans which will flow more air but as far as do you need a radiator. do you need to upgrade fans it really depends on the setup yeah, often you know it depends [on] where you live - so radiators are always designed for the worst-case [scenario] so they're assuming you're in phoenix, arizona, and it's extraordinarily hot and your flooring it, and you're not really doing that all the time but if you are and if you want to - then you know you need to think about that and size your radiator appropriately that is a pretty cool story bro, so number five the last thing we're going to talk about and it's a bunch of different things but basically what you'll learn if you turbocharged your car and do nothing else is that there are probably a bunch of weak points that you weren't thinking about that? you should [have] considered when turbo charging it so you know some of the more obvious ones if you add power? you need to have brakes that can handle that power you need to have tires that can handle that power you might want to size your exhaust appropriately because you have additional flow you know these are some [of] the more [obvious] ones clutch is another one that [you] probably really want to yeah clutch as well so it's not slipping but [charles] here has some different spark plugs. [yeah], [we] why do you have different spark plugs i'm actually going to be dropping a one level of heat range down on spark plugs so that in that higher boost situation we're pushing the heat away from the spark plug a little bit more efficiently [that'll] lead to less heat at the spark plug in a more even combustion so the way that you're changing that heat rating is by changing how much of that? insulator is exposed and so if you expose more of it and has a higher heat rating it retains more heat if you expose less of it it's putting more of its heat back into the cylinder rather than in the combustion [chamber] or the cylinder head, i should say cylinder head you know remember [that] if you are adding this stuff to your car things like the spark plugs were not necessarily designed for that application so you want to make sure that you're really paying attention to things like spark plugs like our cooling so like all the stuff we talked about today to make sure that you're getting it right and then one other thing we're going to talk about is compression ratios. so what do we have here charles right, so dropping the compression ratio is another way to play it a little bit on the safe side with this setup. [i] could have easily bolted all of this up and been on my way and had a really fun time with it but adding something like a head gasket spacer or lower compression pistons will drop the compression and it'll really in this situation the reason i did it is for if i ever want to upgrade the turbo i'm not having to pull the head off yeah, you know put new pistons and then or put a spacer and then i can simply add [more] power with a bigger turbocharger you might also find that you have other weak points in the engine a really common one on the this generation vr. is connecting rod bolts, so i'm going to be upgrading bolts i'm also going to be putting head studs instead of bolts, and then if i saw if i do have a problem i can just pull that off they also have a better strength higher strength, so they'll be less prone to failure but basically what we're doing here is you're choosing. you know how much risk do you want to have you can choose to do less of these things and as a result have more risk of something going wrong, or you can choose to play it very safe like charles is doing and you know putting in these extra measures to make sure that the car is more reliable, right? so that's kind of you know that's the balance you need to make and it would be my personal suggestion that you do all of them and [you] [don't] [turbocharge] your car, and you leave it stuck and you just change it at the dealership you let them do it then you take all responsibility out of your own hands [i] i? definitely agree with you. it's all about risk mitigation you know i'm going way more deep than i really needed to but i wanted a reliable car that built good power that i didn't have to worry every single time i put [the] key in to start it for every time i mash the throttle that something [was] going to go kaboom honestly if you blew kablooey if you can't if you don't have the funds to do it the right way it's probably best that you wait until you do you could easily by [ebay] turbo kit for $700 [bolt] that baby on and if you're looking to blow your engine up that night be an awesome lady it could be fun great [i] feel like we've talked about a lot of different [ways] that you want to improve your car and it turns out that there's going to be kind of expensive charles there's a few things you're changing yeah, yeah it's not you know a hundred and fifty dollar air intake or a $700 tune. this is big bucks in fact. i will have spent considerably more turbocharging this car than i did for the entire car i think i'm going to be doing this thing [with] my five thousand if i ever start doing it but [finally] the good news charles actually works on cars rather than just pretending like he will in the future so if you're interested in watching his vr6 turbo build you should subscribe to his channel i'll put a circle over your face not to cover it up. that's a little bit rude, but i don't want to click his face click my face and that's all we have in this video. thanks for watching guys questions, or comments leave below hello everyone and welcome it gets me every time it was so good - it was glad i've said it 800 times at this point if not more
