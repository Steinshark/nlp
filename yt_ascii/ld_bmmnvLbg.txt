china's workers have some of the longest working hours in the world those hours continue to rise year over year and has a serious effect on their mental physical and family health this brutal chinese work culture is so common that there is a name for it 996 9am to 9pm six days a week it's an indication of the brutal work culture that has been adopted by tech companies like huawei alibaba and tencent two years ago in march 2019 an anti-996 movement emerged out of developers working at china's rising tech companies over 200 000 people participated and it led to a serious backlash towards tech leaders like jack ma jack did not help his case much when he opened his big jack ma mouth and said it's great to work 996. i have previously done a video about 996. if you've not seen that go check it out but for this video i want to look at some of the big trends causing white collar workers in china and some other confucian influence cultures to find themselves in the office much longer but first let us talk about the patreon for those who have not signed up to the early access tier i want to call out a few of the videos queued up and waiting to be released right now as of this recording but can be watched i have one right now on chinese parenting tropes another comparing tsmc and aws and another soon coming about the singaporean foreign talents scheme so head on over to the patreon page and take a look i deeply appreciate anything you'd be able to sign up for thanks and on with the show chinese much like their american brethren work long hours in 2012 a survey found that chinese workers work an average of 8.38 hours a day 30 of them work over 10 hours a day and a significant percent work over 15 hours a day these working hours are on upwards trend from 2008 to 2018 the time that working men and women have spent in the office increased 22 percent worse yet the people who tend to work the longest and hardest in the office also tend to live further away from their workplace a few years ago they did an interesting study in shanghai using geolocation data to track people's daily movements between work and home they first figured out where a person spent the majority of their daytime and nighttime hours and tracked where they went and how long it took there they found that people who work at universities in manufacturing or in other such industries tended to work fewer hours and have shorter commutes the normal sounding 955 schedule or an unstructured freelance hour schedule why universities have dorms and student housing as they were endowed by the government and manufacturing districts tend to be cheaper because they aren't as nice and fancy so workers can buy housing close by people who work in finance and high tech however suffered the 996 or 007 24 7 working hours schedule they not only work really hard but they also have to suffer the shame of a 1.5 hour or two hour commute this is because finance and tech companies are unable to afford housing for their workers workers have to get their own homes and oftentimes they cannot afford anything close by that is because the chinese economic market is young and competitive this is especially the case in newer markets like internet and finance there are simply too many players out there and without a legacy of assets like with the universities or some form of government aid there is little that the companies can do about it yet even with that in mind certain aspects of the chinese working culture can make that working life and commute worse than it needs to be i briefly touch on the ideas of confucianism in a previous video of mine about mental illness stigmas i want to extend that understanding to help explain certain cultural aspects of chinese society that might lead to and worsen 996. confucianism like i said before is not a religion it's a philosophy a set of teachings that come to us from a guy named confucius those teachings would eventually be codified as what would we now call a management system and use an administrative practice during china's feudal age confucianist cultures elevate career success as a highly important source of happiness prosperity and pride not only for the person working but also their family so failing in that regard implies a failing of familial social obligations or shame so the family exerts its own kind of pressure as well other points of emphasis include the importance of obedience respect for hierarchy and a striving for harmony confucianist work cultures like those in china japan and south korea emphasize the idea of collectivism they draw parallels between a person's actual family and their quote unquote work family this means workers in a confucianist work culture are taught to hold silence in face of authority and subordinate their personal interests for the interest of their company it is a capitalist's dream by the way this is the second video of mine in which i make a criticism a confucianism having done so i do not want to leave people with an overall negative impression of the confucian system or the culture from which it springs same as with everything else there are its ups and downs i promise to do a video soon highlighting the good confucianism and i hope you would watch that many chinese workers in the big cities are not official residents of the cities they live in rather many are migrants people who were born elsewhere and came to big cities like shanghai and beijing to work their work is what allows them to stay were they to lose their job they lose virtually their way of life this migrant system is slowly being reformed but remains in place for large tier 1 cities like beijing and shanghai even so there remains the issue that the chinese social safety net is poor regardless where your residency is located there is no pension health care benefit or unemployment that people can fall back on so they very often need that job in order to stay afloat even if they live in that particular city management knows this and exercises power over others by constantly expecting their staff to show respect for their authority this can be in the form of little gifts from subordinate to boss sometimes called guangxi or can be in the form of scheduling over time randomly injecting uncertainty into workers lives this uncertainty is especially bad 996 workers complain about low pay and the lack of dignity yes but the thing that most often gets to them is not knowing when they would be required to work overtime worse yet is the possibility that they will stop receiving work then during the job performance review get asked why they did not have anything get done all those decisions are up to their boss due to the confusion tenets of having respect for authority workers feel like they can't do anything about this a key thing is that the employee does not have the ability to go over their manager and appeal to top management their career track depends basically on their manager liking and approving of them chinese labor laws banned these practices on paper but in reality enforcement remains extremely lacks a study down in 2015 found that 29 of employees work some form of unpaid overtime and 70 percent are paid less than the required 1.5 times overtime pay both numbers are in violation of overtime pay regulations in china overwork corporation abuse and overtime affects everyone but women and middle-aged employees can often find themselves especially put upon female labor participation in china is high 70 percent of women want to work and have a job and is good that they are able to have that opportunity to contribute representation at the higher ranks is better than in most countries many of china's most powerful corporate executives are women but there remain substantial challenges for women in the larger chinese workforce especially those who want a family life in china the burden of family life largely falls upon women they perform a majority measured at some studies to be 76 of the unpaid care work required to care for a family household work that goes beyond just that required to raise a kid this is also about necessary housework and personal care the demands of work are partially responsible for pushing the marriage age for china's women workers further back and the birth rate further down they're often seen by bosses as not living up to the quote ideal worker quote standard because of the potential of them starting a family so they need to work harder and longer to make up for this perceived shortcoming one that is not their fault middle-aged employees in china struggle to find work because they are also not perceived to be the ideal employee they often have more family responsibilities to which they need to give their time and effort employees often see such obligations as taking away from their time at the office furthermore them being older often means more health issues to consider than their younger cohorts many older workers also grew up in an age when china's economy worked differently they had been blue collar workers in factories or manufacturing or the like the economy has changed a lot since then going from making things to digital bits and bytes within 10 or 20 years i largely grew up within the internet and this new tick tock thing utterly baffles me can't imagine how that might feel for a person who did not even have that growing up overwork and over time is not an exclusive chinese problem commonalities can be also found in countries that share confucian traditions like japan south korea and taiwan but there are certain aspects of the chinese working culture and societal structure that encourage the worsening of this problem the lack of work-life balance the weak social safety net a strong focus on economic growth and the government's restrictions on assembly make it harder for put upon workers to demonstrate their discontent with their lot in life during the first industrial revolution in the us and uk workers frequently worked overtime and hours roads until the workers movements brought those back down for a time china's development economy means that workers working hours are still on the rise the country's gdp per capita remains far below that which can be found in the us and uk which means there is a much more work ahead for chinese workers without a coherent policy response by the government this trend of overwork and overtime seems likely to continue alright everyone take care of yourselves out there it's crazy times stay safe
