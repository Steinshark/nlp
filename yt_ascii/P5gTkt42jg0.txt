welcome to a very special unboxing straight from south korea because that's the only place you can get this thing from right now we've got a galaxy s 10 we've got a galaxy s 10 plus and the real reason we're here the galaxy s 10 of 5g i feel like the company's missed a trick here by calling it the s10 5g they've almost implied that it is basically the s10 with 5g functionality when actually it is so far ahead i would almost call it a generational leap for starters it comes with a 25 watt fast charger well above the 15 you get on the normal model you get a usb type-c to full size usb adapter we've got a pretty standard usb c cable but what is cool is they bundled in a pretty high-end pair of akg earphones there's also a bit of a hidden compartment in the top of the box if you turn the lid around and take this little box out you've got a sim ejector tool on one side and then if you open it up but you've got instruction manuals and then a clear plastic case and take a listen to this the most immediate thing you'll notice about this version is the size it's gigantic and yet it's still almost an identical thickness to the pretty slim s10 phones and it still weighs in at less than 200 grams ca it feels like a beast but at the same time it's about as subtle and sleek as we've seen from a phone with nearly a tablet size screen on there we're talking about a device with a six point seven inch display and this panel is not just larger but has an even higher screen to body ratio than the whole s10 line eighty nine point four versus eighty eight point nine on the s10 plus it also looks even brighter to me i tried turning this and the s10 plus to their maximum level and you can probably see the difference for yourself that is no small deal coming from the already bright as 10 plus they're also a couple of design tweaks worth pointing out you can see that the back powell curves a lot more around the body leaving a slimmer side trim which then protrudes around the hardware buttons that nightmare power button a real problem on the s10 plus is somehow more reachable on this larger phone they brought it further down the body it just makes a lot more sense here and the royal gold color option you see here is exclusive to the s10 5g although personal preference i would stick to prizm white what's also cool is that they've used this extra space inside the phone to boost the battery capacity even more than they already have you might remember that the s10 plus already has a souped-up four thousand one hundred million power cell well this new device comes with four thousand five hundred only time will tell how much longer this will last though with its large display and the fact that the 5g modem itself might consume more power than just having a 4g one the cameras are really exciting though take one look at the back and you can see that samsung weren't playing around you're looking at their most powerful most capable smartphone camera system ever you've got a 12 megapixel wide-angle camera 12 megapixel telephoto and a 16 megapixel ultra light and on top of all this a time-of-flight camera the importance of this is that it gives the phone real-time information on the depth of objects this unlocks the ability to use portrait mode using two different magnifications versus just one on the s10 and it lets you take live focus video we saw this feature in the recent galaxy aat but it works even better here due to the higher quality camera sensor if you flip the phone round you'll also notice a super elongated hole-punch cut out it almost looks like there's a very strong positive correlation between the size of the phone and the length of the cutout samsung uses it's not just for show samsung has replaced the secondary depth sensor on the s10 plus with yet another time-of-flight camera which means you get live focus video on the front camera to plus next level face tracking for ar emojis it doesn't change the fact that i'm still probably not going to use it but if it is a feature you like there is no better place to experience it i also tested the speaker quality versus the s10 plus and the s10 and in anticipation of that oneplus are sent over this there isn't any major discrepancy but it does seem a tiny bit louder so that's also positive and then you've got the 5g itself and to give you an idea you could expect download speeds that are 10 times faster as well as almost non-existent latency when it's set up and because this 5g infrastructure may be a long way off especially in some countries i don't think it's the biggest selling point of the phone if you convert the korean price you end up with around $1,000 and i've no doubt when ends up hitting the market you could be paying eleven hundred or even twelve hundred dollars but here's the thing even putting 5g aside for that extra money compared to the s10 plus which is already considered by many to be the best version of 2019 you're getting so much more you're getting an even larger battery you're getting even faster charging speeds you're getting a bigger better display and not to mention a multitude of design improvements and a better rear and front camera this is a serious phone and within about 40 minutes of me opening it up it already set up as my primary device with my sim card in it thanks for watching guys and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
