well i think there's a number of things we need to tease apart when we think about net neutrality there's the fundamental arguments about what that means in in in technical sense and we could look at that and then there's the the context in which people legislate for net neutrality which is done on a per country basis and the way in which it fits into each country's legislation which leads to some of the slightly weird arguments that you hear so i think we start with the technicals that's where i'm safest i mean the idea of net neutrality is that you shouldn't discriminate on the basis of you know where i p packets come from so what server you're talking to or who the client is and you shouldn't discriminate on the basis of the protocol being used now we've seen this a number of times we've seen certain sites getting slowed down because well we don't like what they're doing and this is the argument that net brutality advocates would have which is that it can't be at the whim of a commercial provider a service provider decide to favor some websites over another and it's particularly the case there's a concern that for example isps might be able to favor some websites over others by asking people to pay for preferential access so you know large company a pays you know the internet service provider to make sure that their website's fastest and that's considered a disadvantage when it comes to innovation because obviously small new interesting startups wouldn't have the budget to be able to go in and pay those extra premium and in fact you know there's good arguments here about how much innovation has happened on the internet we have seen lots of small companies grow into really big companies on the internet in a short time and we do have to remember that amazon and ebay used to be minnows compared to what was out there but things like whatsapp and instagram you know if if the likes of facebook or even before that if myspace had been able to buy bandwidth and hence discriminate against facebook then facebook wouldn't have risen so you know this these are i mean these are arguments that can be had about the importance of the openness for innovation so that's about discriminating based on the service or the ip address there's also discrimination by protocol and this was quite popular for a number of years because certain protocols came to the attention of the serbs providers because they were consuming lots of bandwidth so particularly file sharing now whether the isps took a moral stance on this and said that file sharing is wrong because it can only ever be used for a breach of copyright or whether they simply took the view that well we don't have enough bandwidth to go around and these are heavy users and they're making you know they're ruining it for everyone else it doesn't really matter but they started discriminating against that and a bit torrent was the classic where lots of people were discriminated against bittorrent but then of course it turns out that many people were using bittorrent for perfectly legitimate reasons yes there were bittorrent foul sharing and there still is plenty of it around and but then world of warcraft uses bittorrent to update its very big patches very useful it is too because that means that in the days when my two kids used to play world of warcraft as well then we only had to download one patch to the house and then it replicated inside the house so there's probably good reasons discriminating on protocol is a very blunt instrument because you have no idea what people are using it for in reality so those are some of the arguments about why net neutrality there's always the case that service providers have the right to engage in certain traffic management even where there is strong net neutrality law in order to keep the network operating so for example during a distributed denial of service attack one of the things that lots of the isps do is they will shut down where the attacks are coming from and they will throttle them and it's like you couldn't say that that's a bad thing and likewise as we already know certainly in the uk but elsewhere there are varying degrees of blacklisting of websites some of it because the material is clearly illegal others for example certain countries have lists of sites reckoned to have adult content and while not illegal many countries have put in place legislation that says that that that consumers need to opt in to see that rather than opt-out so there is filtering going on there are times when isps need to do things and so it really is about getting a sort of a rational balanced view on the on the technical side about promoting innovation and not allowing incumbents to basically just hold on to their business because they're the ones with the deep pockets and that's that i think that many people view that as being critical for the success of the internet so that's sort of the technicals and that's the what these net neutrality don't discriminate based on you know protocols or sources but then we get into you know a lot of the arguments are going on at the moment and particularly with the fcc is really about previously the way in which the it was decided that they would try to enforce net neutrality which was to use a particular piece of prior prior legislation that had been used to regulate phone companies for many years and this leads to lots of arguments which in a sense are to do with the details of that legislation and not to do with this really the issue of net neutral neutrality buried in the legislation is the requirement for universal service provision and the ability to essentially tax all the consumers a small amount in order to make sure you can deliver service everywhere and that was very important the universal service provision for telephony was a major thing 80 years ago or something which was to make sure that everyone could get a phone since it was considered critical especially as we started moving to you know emergency services available by phone and the ability to make in our case in the uk 999 calls um at any time and indeed we see that today you see on your mobile phone you can always make emergency calls so embedded in that legislation was you know things were there for a perfectly sensible reason but it's now being used as sort of a bit of a bogeyman to say well in the future under the current u.s legislation in the u.s government could decide that these isps must raise these enormous tax levies and that's being used as an argument as to why we can't possibly have this legislation on the books because that's got nothing to do with anyone else anywhere else in the world there's a very specific argument within the us and so we need to tease apart those issues that are to do with the underlying philosophy of net neutrality and it's you know enabling innovation from the very specifics of what happens in any given country so again we look at some other countries i mean the eu has put in place legislation on net neutrality although there are some people are concerned just like loopholes there because in portugal at least one provider is is charging differentially for different services and that's viewed as perhaps not in the spirit of what the legislation was meant to achieve but on the other hand it is legal so they can currently do it under eu law and there's other you know other countries have looked at this in different ways india certainly i was very concerned that some of the proposals around sort of free internet access for certain websites sponsored by certain large companies would essentially prevent any indigenous service provision and you know social media provision in particular coming forward so that's we've got to look at each country in turn try to understand what's really going on then the question is of course that could could the change in the position in the u.s radically affect anyone outside the us i mean most of this really reflects around the the consumer internet service provider i will not transit you know that us consumer networks in order to get the services even if from the uk or elsewhere in europe rentals in the world we're going to some large server farm somewhere the chances are we don't don't necessarily traverse those networks so for a lot of people you know it wouldn't make any difference but then actually we need to look more generally at the way in which large-scale services are deployed these days most of your streaming video comes from a content delivery network where the content's been replicated all around the planet and the fact that you know in the uk large amounts of our content will be coming across the very narrow pond to the republic of ireland we'll be getting all of our content from there if it's not already in the uk then in fact what the u.s does and what u.s carriers do in the us will have absolutely zero effect on us whatsoever the danger always is though as the us even though the governance structures and everything else for the incident has changed over the years the us is still seen as sort of you know a leader in this area and one of the concerns that many folks have is that if they start going down this path how many other people might you know think it acceptable go down that path although as i say given that the eu in particular has put in place legislation then i don't see us doing a u-turn on that if by us i mean those of us currently in europe let's let's see where brexit takes us with that legislation in the future people pay for services they want they usually pay more if they want a better service right what what's different about this rollback of net neutrality in those two well yeah i mean the world is full of you know first class seats and planes and business class and a premium economy and economy and people paying different prices for different things and you know in the in the internet world you would say that yeah there are different tariff structures available primarily and not here i can only really speak you know for the uk primarily simply based around volume so it's not about discriminating one against the other one service against the other but simply by volume so people will buy i think i have four gigabytes a month on my phone at the moment and i hope i up and down that depending on my usage i have to have you know no limits at home because i simply cannot control the kind of content that you know knowing that i have two grown grown lads at home streaming videos all the time and playing online games uh we would we would blast through any cap that anyone would want to put on us so there is that it's the differential pricing between different services and it's viewed as just a very on internet thing to do to differentiate between the services and i think that's slightly different from having you know tiered prices which you know simply reflects the amount of resource that you're using in the network and perhaps that's where this really comes down to is that you know a packet is a packet i mean yes maybe many of the isps would like to look at some of those packets and go that content is of higher value and someone's making money out of it why aren't we getting a piece of the action you know that's a very natural commercial behavior but we don't charge differentially for you know a kilogram parcel depending what the contents are i mean maybe you pay insurance but the actual carriage is the same so it's the same principle here it shouldn't be that the content is the thing which is either the service or the protocol should dictate that these things are different because bits as bits as bits it's like it's just like how many of them they want to move and i think if we stick with that then you know that that general principle with the exceptions i mentioned about you know defending the network against attack and other scenarios that are perfectly valid for as i say an operator to manage their network but stick with that principle then you know that seems a reasonably sensible one and you know the basis on which many view the internet haven't been a great success there's a difference between the physics and the engineering engineering one of those gates and actually changing all the computer architecture to move towards those type of fredkin gates is going to take an awful lot of effort and an awful lot of cost but in principle if we could do that and if we had a perfect perfect fred can get then there would be no energy cost to computing
