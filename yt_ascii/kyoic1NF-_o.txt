the paul brothers are doing this cryptogrift right now and it needs to be exposed another one otherwise they just have a money printing machine i'm sorry to say and another one and another one and another one and another one that goes for all these influencers right they're just using their fans as personal piggy banks just reaching in there taking cash whenever they want it and we have to talk about it listen i've got to give you guys a little context before launching into the new project but let me say i usually make these family-friendly warning to my audience this one's kind of necessarily a little crude but that will soon become obvious why it just kind of is before we get into that i want to talk to you guys bring you back to a project that has sort of been forgotten about by the internet dink doink this was a project promoted by logan paul he tweeted about it saying he's all in this [ __ ] coin while not disclosing the fact that he actually created the coin the ceo admitted it in a statement saying that logan paul created the entire idea we might as well you know be be honest about how this came about logan designed the character on his phone on snapchat of course the crypto tanked because it was built on absolutely nothing and logan quickly distanced himself from the project but now jake paul is following in big bro's footsteps and running his own scheme and not telling people the whole story let's let's pull up the board here and talk about it just a couple days ago jake paul tweeted about a new nft going on called stick dicks now is that exactly what it sounds like yes it's stick figures with well i think you get the idea now my man has gone on an absolute shilling spree he's turned his profile picture into one of these awful nfts he said just broke up with my girlfriend because she didn't mint a stick dicks big dicks energy and so from his social media post you think wow he's really excited about this new nft project is he even affiliated with it well like his brother it's hard to tell from his public statements about it doesn't really appear he's affiliated just seems like he's excited about this new project but also like his brother logan did with ding doing it turns out that jake is more involved than he lets on see when you go to the website and you scroll all the way down all the way down here jake paul is called an ambassador for the coin just like logan paul was an ambassador for dink doing right when he actually created the entire idea of dink doink as admitted by the ceo what up dink doing telegram it's me logan paul and it looks like jake has now done the same thing if we go to the blockchain we find out the real situation i have here in front of me the sticks deployer address the one who created the whole all of the nfts here right the whole contract for this and would you like to know who funded this whole project the biggest dick of all jake paul that's right ladies and gentlemen far from being an ambassador or just like somebody interested in the project it turns out the first person to give any money one ethereum to this deployer right before it created the whole thing was jake paul and do we find that anywhere do we know that no of course not just like with logan paul the whole idea is to just hide how affiliated you are with these projects you're the creator but you don't want to be known for that right because the truth is what does this actually tell us it's a ridiculous thing right and this project is getting nowhere despite his incessant tweeting about it no one wants these things obviously quick update guys stick's twitter account just got hacked and they just released an allegation against jake paul that jake paul is receiving 55 percent of the project's profits now remember this is an allegation but the person who hacked this twitter account says stick dick's holders when they figure out jake was being paid 55 percent of mint for promoting sticks nft and was on the team behind it now we've already unveiled that he was on the team behind it in fact he's the person who funded the contract but this provides even more evidence now again this is just a screenshot we don't know who it's from but this is in line with what i would kind of expect jake was getting paid and the total mint was worth 1.4 million dollars so bear that in mind that would be worth over 700 000 if this is true anyways that's the quick update back to the video but it tells us something very important about the paul brothers and just about influencers in general see it turns out you give these guys millions of dollars and the most and their whole job is to create viral things and the most creative jake and logan paul can get is creating dick related cartoons logan paul's big contribution to the world has been dink doink and jake paul has followed it up with stikdix i think unequivocally proving what we sort of already know the paul brothers yes they will take cash and leave you holding the bag but at the end of the day they're just a couple of dicks i might play you sometimes i'll i'll lead you down a path [music]
