(chill music) - at the time i'm recording this video, i have 8,000 subscribers
and 1.8 million views. so whenever you see this, compare these numbers to whatever i have when you watch this. what's up, guys? it's currently october 4th, 2015. yes. i'm probably like a freaking
grown man when you see this. i'm still in high school right now. and whoa, this camera's tilted. when you see this, i'm
actually going to be in... i'm not even gonna be in college. this is gonna be after college. wow, dude, this is gonna be crazy. it's 2015 for me right now. dude, what if i'm dead? dude, if i'm... ooh, that would be weird. that'd be so weird. rip. oh, that would, that'd be really weird. but so let's see. dude, if i don't have
a million subscribers when you see this video, my
entire life has been a failure. i hope i have a million subs. i better have a million
subscribers when you guys see this. (mr. beast sighs) dude, that'd be... i don't even know what
college i'm going to. but by the time you see this, i'll have finished high
school, gone to college, probably be doing youtube
as a job, hopefully. maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe? yeah, i really hope i have
a million subs by now. please, future me, please. what am i doing with my hand? please have a million subs. i probably should have thought
about what i was gonna say. just, hey, hopefully
you have a million subs. and, dude, i wonder if you still, all right, so i should be
studying for a history test and i wonder if you remember
what grade i'm gonna get on this history test that i take tomorrow that i'm not studying for
because i'm making these videos. so, i'm probably gonna... dude, if you still
remember the grade i get on this history test, that's crazy. i better have a million
when this goes public. deuces. i'm not pewdiepie. screw that. i don't wanna do this over again. see ya, future me.
