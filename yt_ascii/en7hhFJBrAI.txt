right now extreme ultraviolet lithography is working boundaries are using dozens of these 150 million dollar machines to create amazing patterns nanometers wide the industry labored for decades on this intricate technology but there is no time to rest asml is already looking ahead at the next generation of the uv high nauv the sent a million dollar machine that will be better than regular euv in this video we're going to do a deep dive into what's next in the world of euv asml's follow-up to the most complicated nanolithography system ever delivered but first i want to talk about the asian nomentry patreon if you like what this channel does you can support the work by joining the early access tier early access members get to see new videos and selective references for them before they are released to the public so head on over to the patreon page and take a look i deeply appreciate anything you'll be able to sign up for thank you and on with the show today euv technically works and of course we should not ignore just how impressive that is however at a commercial level there remain substantial challenges the biggest problem has to do with throughput how many wafers a single machine is capable producing over a period of time right now tsmc's leading edge n5 process has about 14 to 15 uv layers uv machines are slower than older machines so if you want to be able to push out as many wafers as before you need to have more machines so in 2020 tsmc opened up the checkbook and bought as many euv machines has asml could make by the second half of 2020 they had 50 percent of the install base it worked but each n5 wafer is estimated by industry analysts to cost as much as a car nearly 17 thousand dollars a theoretical eighty percent price jump to get that cost down you need to put out more wafers to put out more wafers you need faster throughput now on to tsmc's next full step node and three that right now uses more of those slow euv layers about 20 to 25 as compared to n5s 14 to 15. there is a risk for throughput to decline even further worsening foundry's ability to produce enough wafers and reach the necessary economies of scale furthermore all things being equal tsmc is likely going to have to resort to a technique called multiple patterning for n3 this is where you use another exposure to improve the feature density imagine you got a canvas of dough and you want to cut out some noodles about 13 nanometers thick this is so that you can make a nano bowl of taiwanese beef noodle soup for your nano sized buddies but alas your nano size noodle cutter mold thing has its metal mold teeth things 26 nanometers apart you can really tell i spent a lot of time in the kitchen anyway so how can you cut a 13 nanometer wide noodle it is possible if you are extremely careful if you position the nano noodle cutter mold thing exactly right you can make a second pass on the dough and get your 13 nanometer wide as you might expect this doubles or even triples the amount of time it takes to process a single layer multi-patterning makes euv already pretty slow decidedly uneconomical tsmc could try to buy more of those 150 million dollar euv machines but asml is already selling those as fast as they can make them the more economical alternative would be to get uv machines that do lithography better and faster and that is what high n a is all about the n a in high n a stands for numerical aperture it is a dimensionless number measuring how much light an optic system can collect and focus to explain why this is a big deal we go back to ray lee's formula resolution is equal to k1 times light wavelength divided by na improving the resolution means either shrinking the k1 or the wavelength or increasing the n a literally math the k1 has a physical limit and we are already close to it so that is out the lithographic window and the first generation of uv brought the light wavelength down to its current 13.5 nanometers after all that i don't think they want to try pushing that envelope again anytime soon so the last major factor left would be to raise the n a re-engineer the optics so to collect and focus more of that sweet uv light that is essentially what this entire system is about more light the most advanced euv machine from asml is the nxe 3600d its na is 0.33 and that translates to a 26 nanometer pitch this meets tsmc's n5 process requirements which requires a 28 nanometer pitch that machine can churn out about 160 wafers per hour asml's first high n a uv machine the exe 5000 will increase that na from 0.33 to 0.55 translating to a 16 nanometer pitch this is a sixty-seven percent improvement very meaningful and the preferred way to make the n3 process work furthermore not only can high-end a euv do lithography with a much smaller pitch they can also print at a far higher resolution resulting in less defects less defects mean more good wafers per day and if high n a euv is as good as advertised then you can start using it to replace layers that have been previously done with multi-patterning at lower wavelengths why make two or three passes when you can do only one savings like this is what would truly justify the use of high n a uv okay enough with economics let's talk engineering there are two major challenges associated with high n a uv the optics and the resist let us start with the optics and the starlit 5000 optics system from our old pal calls ice okay we are going to talk some optics i really honestly hope that i don't lose any of you guys in my previous video i broke down the components of the starlit 3000 the starlit 3000 series consists of the collector optics and aperture illumination optics mask or reticle as it can also be called and projection optics then finally it hits the wafer to achieve a higher n a the starlift 5000 must be redesigned to essentially allow light at more angles to hit the wafer the old systems with 0.33 and a had a thinner light cone at mirror 6 right above the wafer going to 0.55 means making that cone thicker as a result of the m6 light cone being thicker the first big challenge has to do with the mirror right before it mirror 5 or m5 because multi-layer mirrors with their 50 euv reflecting layers are limited to reflecting at very specific angles about 13 degrees the m5 mirror has to be positioned very close to the m6 light cone side note yes the super mirrors are back and they are bigger than ever a meter wide with an accuracy of a picometer if you were to blow it up to the size of the earth the largest aberration would be the diameter of a human hair anyway back to the case of the high na m6 example the way this setup is right now the two light cones will interfere with one another this causes big imaging errors and we do not want that so how do you have your bigger light cone and eat it too with some wicked brilliant engineering you drill oval shaped holes into the mirrors holes in the mirrors zeiss calls them obscurations and they reduce the angular spread on the mirrors and significantly increase the transmission of the optics how i don't know the documents don't say but it works and i'm sure all the optical phds will let us know why in the comments below the same effect happens a few stages up the optic system at the reticle or mask the mask is essentially a grading in front of a mirror and it contains the chip design pattern redesigning a mask costs millions of dollars so one of the design requirements for high-end auv is that the mass size cannot change in order to achieve a high n a at the wafer stage you have to have a high end a at the mask stage the two are linked by a mathematical formula the twinscan nxe 30300b is euv enabled and like i said has an na of 0.33 and a magnification factor of 4 times the reticle mirror mask reflects uv light at 6 degrees with that we can project a 132 millimeter by 104 millimeter reticle area onto a 33 millimeter by 26 millimeter wafer area got it all right so what happens when we increase the n a the same thing as we already talked about the two light cones are bigger and thus they overlap by one degree what are we going to do about that the obvious solution would be to raise the euv light reflection angle like from 6 degrees to 9 degrees nice however that is a no go because it creates weird mask shadowing effects like i mentioned the mask is essentially a great in front of a mirror what happens when you shine a flashlight and then move over to the side the shadows move the only other thing left to change is the magnification factor and that is what they did they raised the magnification from four times to eight times and that worked kind of you get the higher n a without fatter cones or compromising mask shadows but when you magnify something the light area at the end gets smaller and that is exactly what happens that 33 millimeter by 26 millimeter wafer area shrinks to a quarter of that size 16.5 millimeters to 13 millimeters now if asml was anything like me then they'd shrug and be like oh well you know but the situation is economically unacceptable for their customers it would take too long for the euv machine to crawl its way across a wafer tsmc is going to pay asmr hundreds of millions of dollars for this machine for all that do they really want to get a four times slower product so we got to fix this the first thing that comes to mind would be to make a bigger mask twice as large as the current six inches in fact but as i said earlier this is not feasible the machine would not be able to handle a 12 inch mask anyway so what zeiss and asml did was to use something called anamorphic imaging magnification factors can exist on both the x and y axes but they are not necessarily linked together one to one we only really need the eight times magnification factor along the y-axis not the x-axis with this new optics technology the system can project a 16.5 millimeter by 26 millimeter field half size just barely acceptable asml and zeiss announced that they were working together on this solution back in 2014 they borrowed anamorphic technologies from the movie industry where they are used to project movies with unusual widescreen aspect ratios onto standard size screens the optics make up the majority of the technical challenges involved with high n a uv but not all of them there are still a few others and the other major one has to do with the resist if you can recall the photoresist is applied on top of the substrate before the whole thing gets exposed to the euv after that you can either keep the exposed portions a negative photoresist or the non-exposed portions a positive photoresist a higher n a means that the resist needs to be thinner too this is to lower the risk of pattern collapse or line collapse the concept is easy to comprehend if the resist is too thick then the lines after euv exposure will be too close together after exposure the wafer is washed and the resist washed away after that it is dried if the lines do not dry at the same time then the surface tension of the water distorts the design the lines might even fall over or peel off the substrate thus you are aiming to have a resist layer at least 50 percent thicker than your pitch with a 16 nanometer pitch that is a 20 nanometer thick resist companies are experimenting with new resists asml is working with a variety of partners like imec psi and cxro to try and find a good candidate as of this writing they're still working on this one there remains a few other engineering challenges too for instance making bigger mirrors the mask frame layout the pellicle or the metrology system metrology in particular will be challenging this is a system of sensors and programs that checks on progress and quality it is crucial to know what's going on with the lines on your wafer but how do you inspect something less than 20 nanometers wide right now asml is looking into e-beam inspection techniques but that has yet to be finalized as always the technology exists and is well established the problem is turning it into a shipping technology competitive against the next best alternative the machine remains in development the first machines are expected to head over to customers sometime in late 2022. two years later after that in 2024 or 2025 would be an improved version the exe 5200 with an expected throughput of 220 wafers per hour everything about the exe 5000 will be chomp the light cones the optics themselves the whole machine will be massive it will be as big as a crouched t-rex and of course the machine will sport a massive price tag too topping 300 million dollars each with that you can buy the second most expensive painting in the world hold 8.8 squid games or pay gas fees for one nft 300 million dollars i can only imagine the twitter replies the exe 5000 is an engineering marvel but we'll have to justify that monstrous price alright
