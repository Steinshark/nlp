so tell me if this has ever happened to you you want to learn something new like coding or start some new project you're really excited about it and for the first few days everything is going great but then something happens you no longer have the motivation you initially had and every single day instead of working on your new project you always just end up going to your bed and watching netflix you get stuck and you never seem to be able to finish that thing that you used to be so excited about yeah i'm not doing that again well i wouldn't know anything about that because i am a productivity guru and us gurus we never procrastinate we are immune to all of that stuff yeah that's not actually what happens well the truth is i don't stay motivated but i put in the work anyway everything worth achieving is hard at least at some level that's definitely true with coding so there's necessarily going to be times where you're not going to feel motivated where you're not going to feel like doing the things that you actually have to do so what you actually need to do is just do it not through motivation but through self-discipline and i realized that this is something that's much easier said than done so that's why in this video i want to talk about how i managed to build rock solid self-discipline and how you can do it too but first i want to quickly introduce you to our sponsor so i recently set myself the challenge of learning the swift programming language so with any sort of project like this a part where most people actually struggle the most is just getting started and meeting that pesky procrastination and the best tip i can give with this is to keep your why in mind you want to have a specific end goal that you keep in mind at all times because when it gets difficult that is what's going to keep you going for example one very good motivator for learning to code fast is the hefty salaries that software engineers can make once you do make those hefty salaries it's also really important to learn how to save and invest that money to make it grow even more what i look for when i'm investing is not only high returns but diversification today i want to talk to you about a very interesting alternative art the total wealth held in art is estimated to be worth 1.7 trillion dollars and deloitte projects it to grow 900 billion by 2026. in addition contemporary art pieces out based the s p 500 total return by 164 from 1995 to 2021 and i know you might be asking well why should i care i don't have money for that well that's where today's video sponsor masterworks comes in masterworks is the only platform where you can invest in art just like two-thirds of billionaires do but for just a fraction of what they pay through masterworks you can invest in a portion of many exclusive pieces of art so far masterwork has successfully offered and sold three paintings which is realizing a net annualized gain above 30 percent per work now legally i do have to add that this is not an indication of masterworks overall performance and past performance is not indicative of future returns oh wow 30 plus percent and this price appreciation only goes up as inflation goes up by the way currency is sitting at 36 on average getting started with masterworks is super easy it only takes a few clicks you visit their website create an account browse their artwork like this super cool looking one and you can diversify your portfolio with one of the most stable assets around over 400 000 people have signed up and you can gain priority access by clicking my link in the description below and it also really supports the channel so go check it out thanks for master works for sponsoring this video but do bear in mind that i am not your financial advisor and you should always do your own research because with everything investing there is always some risk now back to the video motivation gets you going but discipline keeps you growing so with anything worth achieving in life it usually works like this you're here and your goals are here and in between there's just a whole bunch of work that you need to somehow get done most people think that the way to bridge this gap is through motivation but i don't think that's the best way at all so the first step to getting out when you feel like you're stuck is to realize that it's absolutely normal to not feel motivated all the time once you realize this you can stop worrying that there's something wrong with you because there's not and start focusing on the practical things that will actually allow you to start getting things done even when you don't feel like it like first of all building the right habits in other words it's all about working smarter and i talk about that in depth on this video but in summary first of all you want to adopt a deep work strategy the way our brains work is that the toughest part is always just starting but once you do start it's much easier to keep going so once you're able to push through the initial hump you need to be able to guard this state of focus by any means necessary and i cannot stress how important this is this means closing your door and putting on some low-fi music which has been scientifically shown to actually increase your concentration and focus and throwing your phone out of the window okay maybe it's enough to just put in another room or just put it on silent or something once you work for a little bit you'll find that you'll reach the state of flow which will allow you to keep working potentially for hours on end without you ever even realizing how much time has passed it might seem like a small thing but science has actually shown that as little as your mum shouting at you to tell you that dinner will be ready in 30 minutes is enough to take your brain out of that flow state and it can actually take you up to 20 minutes for you to get back to the same level of focus just achieving the state of flow is one of the most important things you can do to keep your focus because when you're able to keep your focus you're gonna be able to get done in one hour what someone with distracted focus might do in like three hours so focus is king but what i think is even more important than any of these productivity tricks or hacks is just your mindset and specifically becoming accountable to yourself and fundamentally altering the way you think about yourself in a way so let me just explain what i mean by that as humans we tend to act in a way that matches the image that we have of ourselves let me give you an example if you think you're a lazy person if you tell yourself that you're a lazy person it actually causes you to be more lazy i'm just gonna challenge you to do this from today start telling yourself that you are the type of person who gets things done you are the type of person who has really strong work ethic you'll find that once you do this and you remind yourself of this constantly you actually start to take actions that a hard-working and a disciplined person naturally takes because it's in accordance with the image that you yourself have of yourself in the past i used to be very physically unfit i wasn't like super fat or anything but i wasn't a very fit person and that really lowered my self-esteem i really didn't feel good about myself that's how i saw myself as but then one day i just decided okay i'm going to become the type of person who's physically fit i'm going to become the type of person who exercises every day i'm gonna build a reputation for myself as a type of person who does these things and i'm not saying i'm like a fitness model or anything today i say i'm really happy with my physical shape and ever since i started doing that it became such a part of me and the self-image that i have of myself that it was obvious that i'm gonna keep running that i'm gonna keep going to the gym because it became a part of my identity so if you wanna become disciplined if you wanna start getting things done you wanna build those qualities to be an integral part of your identity but essentially it just becomes a habit for you to be like that it's frustrating to me to see how many people think that for example learning to code and becoming a software engineer is something where you need to be like born super smart or something like that or where if you want to be physically fit you just need to be born like that and most things like 99.9 of things in life don't work that way almost anything in life that you want to learn or you want to become you can do by just putting in the work it's really just that simple do it just do it so if you take nothing else away from this video i just want you to be able to adopt this growth mindset when you start believing that you can do anything and that sounds like something very selfish or like egoistic like oh i can do anything it just means that whatever you put your time into you're probably going to be able to do it because as steve jobs said everything around you was built by people who are no smarter than you no one's really special there are just some people who believe that they can do it so that then causes them to put into work to actually do it and then what do you know they end up succeeding sure there's always some luck involved but the question is are you going to be the type of person who focuses on the external factors the factors that you cannot control which do exist i don't deny that or are the type of person who focuses on yourself and the things that you can control so in summary the reason why you can't stay motivated when learning to code is because that's just how the human brain works and that's okay so the way you fix not having motivation is by not trying to fix it at all because you really can't you need to stop waiting for motivation to come to you because it probably won't because motivation is something that's really hard to control no matter how hard you try what you want to do instead is become the type of person who puts in the work no matter what every single day but if you're trying to learn how to code even that is not actually enough you also need to learn the right methods and strategies to actually learn and internalize the things that you're learning so if you want to learn more about that you should watch this video right here where i talk about how i was finally able to figure out how to study effectively and force my brain to learn how to code
