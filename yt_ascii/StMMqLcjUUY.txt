how many programming languages do you need to 
know in order to be considered a successful   software engineer well let me reverse that 
a little bit how many programming languages   do you need to know to be successful in 
your software engineering career today   i'm going to share with you my thoughts on 
how many you should learn to start with and   how many most programmers end up learning 
in their career before we get to it though   you know the drill we need to collect coffee 
let's go come on okay wait wait wait wait wait   before i head out actually we need to talk 
about the interact conference it is a free   virtual conference that i will be attending 
and i want to see you there i attended the   last conference and one of the best things about 
it is you get to learn from the top engineering   leaders and what i really found helpful is it was 
kind of like a day full of mentorship and guidance   from some of these incredible leaders that you 
wouldn't get to typically hear speak otherwise   especially all packed into one day also there are 
two tracks that you can focus on at the conference   one is dev interrupted where you will listen to 
stories of failure redemption panels featuring   the biggest names in engineering leadership this 
track has insights processes and really lots of   know-hows on how to turn engineers into leaders 
and companies into unicorns then the second track   or the other track is linear beyond learn about 
tactical practices insights and success stories   that linear b customers have used to transform 
their their value delivery pipeline okay i keep   on mentioning engineering leaders that will 
be speaking at this conference who are they   some of them include ruckmany reddy who is the 
svp of engineering at slack charity majors cto   and co-founder at honeycomb and lewis tapp 
the vp of engineering at blockchain.com   and there are so many more make sure to check 
it out i linked it down in my bio so you can   check out who is speaking one thing i like to 
do before conferences is really check out who's   speaking and then also to think of ways to follow 
up with them after the conference it's a great   way to kind of you know start a conversation you 
heard them speak you really appreciated certain   points that they made and then kind of open that 
conversation up that's just a little side tip also   speaking of networking and mentorship there is 
a live event to connect with speakers and other   audience members so if you are there make sure 
to come say hi to me virtually and you get access   to the dev interrupted discord channel this is a 
great way to also interact with other engineering   leaders now a question i get asked a lot is do 
i have to be an engineering leader in order to   attend this conference the answer is no no matter 
if you are currently an engineering leader midway   in your career just starting out this is a 
conference that you'll find a lot of value   from i linked it down below go sign up today did 
i mention it's free and come say hi okay let's go okay we are on our way to the co-working space 
and of course to get some coffee some much needed   coffee coffee and code or coffee and tech in 
general they go hand in hand in my opinion i'm   curious though are you a coffee drinker or 
are you more of a tea person do we have tea   drinkers in the audience here let me know okay 
let's get to the question here though how many   programming languages do you need to know as a 
software engineer and i'm going to answer this   in a few stages the first one being how many 
you need to know when you are starting out   looking for your first job second part i'm going 
to answer is throughout your career how many do   you need to know because that changes as you 
grow in your career okay one thing though i   should know before we even get into this video 
is how many programming languages do i know   so i'm going to share with you how many prank 
whoa we got bright quickly here for myself for   programming languages the first one i learned was 
javascript and honestly it was a really good first   programming language to learn for me i think if 
i was to start all over again it might be python   that i would learn first but javascript group 
was the first one i learned i was learning the   mer and stack so [ __ ] express react and node and 
after that i spent a lot of time with javascript i   ended up focusing mainly in the front end with 
react side of things and absolutely loved it   then as i progressed in my career there was some 
requirements to do php so i did php full time i   was really nervous to dive into php because 
it does have a bad rap i think it's a great   programming language actually but it doesn't 
have the best reputation in the tech industry   i find especially when you're starting out people 
are like oh php but once you grow in your career   i think it's a really really great language to 
learn and it's used in so many different areas   that it's a really important one to learn as well 
then as i progress further in my career i wanted   to pick up python and this wasn't because it was 
required in my job but it was required or sorry   wasn't required but it was something that i was 
super interested in it's very popular and i knew   it was a skill or a language i really wanted to 
know so i did the self teaching method at that   point it was really easy because i had already 
picked up two other languages now i want to take   a second to note here that when going back to 
javascript when i was working my last job at ibm   i was on the consulting side so i was doing a lot 
of projects for different companies which really   meant working in different tech stacks so the main 
one i was working with for a framework was angular   but also there was some react as well and then on 
the side i was tinkering i would say with view a   little bit it not so much anymore but i found 
that as i progressed in my career whether it be   for my day job or even through you know finding 
resources and learning for this channel for my   tech channel it slowly became less about learning 
new programming languages and more about learning   new frameworks especially with javascript but 
that's just the way i preferred to grow it doesn't   mean it's the way you have to go going back to 
how many programming languages do you need to know   if you are just starting out start out 
with one programming language and there   might be some debate around this i find but i 
think starting out with one typically there's   always different use cases is a really 
good way to go because you want to focus   on learning the fundamentals you want to focus 
on learning the basics and what that will do is   if you are able to really grasp that later on 
in your career when it's required to learn more   languages it'll be easier to pick up because 
you actually have a strong foundation versus   you skim the fundamentals and went straight 
to a programming framework the next question   i get asked is well what programming language 
to learn first and it really depends on what   you want to be programming what you want to be 
building so i'm going to list more generic ones   overall overarching but take this with a grain 
of salt in the situation of depending on what   you want to learn so if i was to go all over again 
i would learn as i mentioned probably python first   but other great ones to learn first would include 
javascript or i would say java those are the three   main ones if you are going the self-teaching route 
that are something that you can learn on your own   and easily pick up and there's a lot of resources 
online about them which really helps too also if   you're wondering tiff why aren't you going to your 
co-working space i thought you're getting coughing   going there i got locked out so we're just going 
for a walk around toronto and talking and walking   a very casual friend intimate way of doing this 
video which i you know i love okay so as i just   said one programming language to start with now 
as you grow in your career does that change or   can you just focus on one programming language 
and the quick answer is yes you can focus on   just one programming language and really dive 
deep into that for example i had a co-worker who   they had been programming for 10 
plus no not 10 that would make sense   they're all going for a very long time all 
they focused on was javascript and react so   and it was right when react came out how many 
years was that when react came out but anyways   right when it came out till now they went hard on 
react they love react you can ask them anything   about it and they will know and that's kind of 
them going really deep into one they have zero   interest in taking a job or a project though that 
would require learning a different framework   or programming language so that's definitely one 
way to go really deep into one there can be some   downsides to that such as if you're not willing 
to even be flexible or consider you know you   might be missing out on some opportunities but on 
the other hand some companies might really really   want someone who's a very deep specialist in that 
so it's not a negative or positive i think it's   just a preference thing for me anyways i never 
went that way because i'm way too curious i love   exploring different languages and frameworks 
the other way to go though is more like what   i did where you were growing in your software 
engineering career and naturally as you go from   company to company over time it will be required 
to pick up different programming languages and   when i was looking online and i spoke to i do a 
little poll actually texting some of my software   engineering friends who i've worked with in the 
past and said how many programming languages do   you know not tinkered around with but like 
actually no and on average it was around two   to three i would say closer to three for most and 
they are mainly individuals who are midway through   their career so still have a lot of growth to do 
so maybe that will change as they grow but what   i find is that really depends on how you grow in 
your software engineering career which i mean you   can go senior engineer and continue to grow and 
be coding your entire career but more often than   not we see that software engineers end up kind of 
evolving with their roles as their career grows as   well and i think that's why the number three is a 
good number for typically on average the number of   programming languages that a software engineer 
will know really in depth now as i mentioned   there's a ton of different caveats to this that 
you could include but but i would say on average   based on my research about three now i don't want 
that to stress you out though if you are starting   out in your career it doesn't mean that you have 
to know everything right away please do not take   this as that but it's more something i was just 
curious about how many programming languages do   most developers know actually on that note leave 
in the comments how many years you have been   a programmer for or been coding for and how many 
languages you know once again not just like tinker   around with but really no okay i hope you found 
this video very helpful in a fun and casual way   i really wanted to connect with you on this topic 
and there's no right or wrong answer to this this   is just based on my research what i've learned 
and my experience i think more than anything   to have a successful career as a software 
engineer and continue to evolve it's being   open to learn new learn it's being oh my goodness 
you can tell i needed that coffee it's being open   to experiencing and learning new things i think 
that's the most important thing of all okay i   hope you enjoyed this video if you haven't 
already as i mentioned earlier leave in the   comments what programming languages you know 
how many you know and if you haven't subscribe   for more tech coding and career related videos 
i mean i'm sitting in the middle of a park here   people are looking at me and i'm filming for 
you so give me some love give me a like give me   a subscribe and also let me know down below what 
other questions you have i make these videos for   you based on what you want to hear so leave in the 
comments and i'll see you all soon thanks everyone foreign
