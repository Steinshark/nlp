hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about v5 engines, something there aren't very many of out there honda actually made a v5 engine for motorcycle racing and they were actually super successful with it and volkswagen has what they call a v5 engine they used in the 90s and early 2000s it's actually more appropriately would be called a vr5 engine. so that's what we're going to be talking about in this video the agz 2.3l vr5 engine out of volkswagen and really what it is is just a vr6 engine and you've chopped off one of the cylinders. so if you were to look at the block here you've got 3 on the right 2 on the left and your cylinders are 1 2 3 4 5 easy enough then you're firing order which is kind of interesting 1 2 4 5 3 so it just goes in this clockwise circle here as it rotates around and you get your power and everything so it's interesting you know volkswagen i guess decided you know the vr6 is too big and too powerful for some cars and an inline 4 just isn't quite enough, so this sits nicely in between and did at the time as far as power output the first one only producing 150 horsepower, but it was still a little bit more than the inline four-cylinder at the time and they eventually went to four valves per cylinder instead of just two valves per cylinder and improved output to something like 170 horsepower for the 2.3 liter pretty interesting and actually this firing order is the same as an inline five-cylinder. so it's a lot like an inline five-cylinder except it just kind of smashed into the wall and all the cylinders got bunched up, but from from you know a dynamic standpoint how it works things like that it is pretty similar to an inline five-cylinder engine it just does have a single valve train up on top which is a cool thing about the engine that volkswagen has done with these vr engines so this is a poor sketch of what that looks like but you've got a camshaft on one side for the intake so you've got a camshaft on the other side for the exhausts and it will stretch over and you know activate that intake on one side activate the intake on this side depending on where those pistons are and one of the interesting things looking at this engine here, so it's at a 15 degree angle and because of that angle and because these cylinders are so close together you can imagine that as those cylinders are bore down as you follow that bore down into the cylinder those those cylinders you don't want them to overlap or contact each other you want some space between there for coolant jackets things like that of course you just need some metal between the cylinders and so there they had to offset the cylinder so they'll push them out a little bit in order to do that and as a result the interesting thing is that the centerline of the cylinder does not line up with the centerline of the crankshaft, and that's pretty much the case with other engines an inline engine or a v engine you'll have that centerline of the cylinder match up with the center of the crankshaft and that keeps kind of a smooth even motion as that piston goes up and down as far as how it rotates it's a it's a little bit different, but it's almost the same going up and coming down versus well with this engine here it's actually going to be quite different you know as its going up there versus as it's going around here so it's got a kind of weird motion as it's going up and down at a different motion you know for going up versus going down with regard to this crankshaft here, but just kind of an interesting design feature there i'm sure that's something that you know makes it a bit more challenging to balance another thing that's interesting about this engine is how they've oriented the cylinder so they've kind of flipped them around on the other side of the engine so you've got your intake valve on the right on the right on the right and then they're flipped over on the other side of the engine so now it's on the left and on the left and so you've just got your intake manifold on one side of the engine you've got your exhaust manifold on the other side of the engine and then within the cylinder head you can see you've got these paths so it allows you to pair up two of the intake valves together pair up two of the exhaust valves together as it's exiting the engine within that cylinder head makes a little bit simpler within the cylinder head to have this design when you have those cylinders switched on the other side so you can pair up the intake and exhaust valves it is a bit weird though. i mean think about it you've got five cylinders and two of the cylinders out of those five have a longer distance for the air intake air to travel and then two of those cylinders have a shorter distance for the exhaust air to travel, so you know it's a little wonky. it's a little strange now it's also interesting to think about from a balancing perspective. you've got two. you know cylinders going up and down on the left you've got three cylinders going up on down on the right and an inline five-cylinder actually isn't that poor of a design from a balance perspective it has a rocking moment where you know the engine itself kind of wants to rock back and forth along that line but you know ultimately it's it's a fairly smooth running engine this however you've now split that up, so you've got different forces going this direction and this direction because you've got different number of cylinders so you've got a different mass on each side and you can counter a good amount of this using your crankshaft design and having counter weights that balance that out, but ultimately there's probably gonna be some kind of unique vibrations that are associated with an engine like this. so you know what's the logic of it? well again it's that happy medium and at the time it may have made sense to do of course it was killed by the inline four-cylinder turbocharged engine like a cool a lot of cool engines out there it's you know. i guess unfortunate, but it's not all that logical it's neat to kind of look back though and see something as as strange as this that actually made it into production. you know there are still i'm sure cars with these running around out there so kind of cool i'm sure it has a unique sound as well that kind of an inline five-cylinder sound to it but with different, you know length exhaust so it's got some unique characteristics to it for sure so thank you all for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave those below.
