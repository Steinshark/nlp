but yeah then kind of the the virgin mary kind of appears you know oddly in this very masculine way at the end is as kind of this apex figure within this kind of spiritual test and she's kind of she's kind of like yeah she's pretty terrifying there's something pretty scary yeah but that's okay you have definitely have traditions in the orthodox church itself about you know aspects of the virgin which are are kind of terrifying like she's the protector too like she has this she protects her child so there's something about that you know you you take a icons of the virgin on the wall of constantinople when the wall when the city is being attacked you know there's something about that there's a there is a kind of mother bear aspect to the to the to the virgin as well foreign [music] this is jonathan petro welcome to the symbolic world [music] hello everybody i'm really excited to be here with brandon dayton brandon is an artist i know mostly as a as a graphic novelist he made a he he wrote a book which if you follow me on social media you see me shared quite a few times it's called the green monk and it's a really beautiful graphic novel about a young it's a a young boy who is finds himself in a russian monastery and there's a whole kind of fantastic story which surrounds the graphic novel it's very it's very beautiful and airy the story is kind of told through the succession of panels and it it doesn't need a lot of words it really is this kind of beautiful flow of story so i'm really happy to have them with me to be able to talk about about the graphic novel and his his inspirations what would brought him to make it so brandon thanks for talking to me yeah super super happy to be here and so tell us a little bit about what was the what was the impetus behind this book oh man that's such a good question because there are like there's always like little ideas that bubble up that are interesting ideas or images you know and so there's i can like trace different threads of like very early on having this idea of like a blade of grass as a sword and then having some sort of i remember at some point having it be some sort of like my chance to to do star wars the way i wanted to do it i'm going to be like okay i'm gonna tell the story of star wars i want to tell it but i'm going to put it in this other fantasy and instead of lightsabers it's going to be like this like grass sword and that kind of faded away but then when i was introduced to tarkovsky's andre rublev that was like when things kind of clicked and this is like going way back to college like as this is like first time i saw that was in college and i had this character and i was like oh yeah i want to put this character in that world and that's where things like really started to fall together like come together for me but then there is also like you talk about impetus and then there's just like a feeling there's a certain feeling about a story that starts to emerge and there was something about this character and like what this character represented to me that just really got to the core of like what really mattered to me you know i mean if i could put it in in other terms it felt there was something that felt like sacred about it to me like an actual member i was this is actually i was i was finally finally out of it takes me a long time to to make art so this is like i was out of college and i was i was newly married and going through like therapy and i remember having this thing where i was like i have all these ideas all these stories i want to do i don't know what to do with my life at that point i was like wanting to make movies and and thinking about doing screenplays and i remember going through this process with this therapist where it was kind of like well yeah but which of these things like really are you most drawn to or feels like most important and meaningful to you and it was like oh yeah i have this story about this monk and i really feel like it has to be a comic book you know and so once i landed on that i'm like oh yeah this is this is what like i really feel it's like warmth in my heart about this thing i kind of put everything to the side and i was like okay no more trying to make movies i'm just gonna make this comic book and see what happens and that was the very first mini comic and then so the very first mini comic of green monk was was the product of that and so how what was the reaction because i guess you came back to it a little bit later to the same story and kind of put it back together yeah so i mean i've been trying to i mean i wanted to to be a big famous amazing artist storyteller in some way so i'd always been like trying to make art and putting it out on the internet and stuff and i'd been to conventions and nothing really ever connected and then i made this book and i started going to connect conventions with it and things like that and the response to it was like fantastic it's like more than i could have expected i was like oh wow this is so yeah if you like kind of follow your heart do this stuff it seems like most important they'll be a good response so it's to this day it's the thing that sold the best at conventions i mean i remember i'd go to conventions and i'd sell like 60 copies of this and this is as me being an artist no one knew about you know i had no name no previous experience with comics and i would i for me it seemed like i was selling quite a bit of those and and i've never sold stuff like that i have a volume of books you know ever since then either but it also got within that time it got nominated for uh y'all said the yalsa top 10 teams for book list award and was selected for their list in 2011. so that was a really cool honor because it was the only self-published book on their list that year and it was just cool that it got into the hands of the right people and i had a chance to talk with them and they were just like yeah we really want to support staff that's not coming from larger larger publishers so that happened but you know i was also in the midst of working and trying to support a family and whatever the next step was there didn't seem very obvious to me and i was i was working a job as a concept artist within the video game industry which is very demanding and so it was it was a big challenge to put my energies into making art during the day and then to try to come home and and trying to move things forward with the comic books you know yeah make more art like make art in your job and then in your spare time it's like exhausting yeah and i'm not i've just kind of come to realize that i'm just not i don't have the same worth of work ethic as other artists out there and so it just it just like it it really burnt me out trying to do that and finally i got to the point i i was working at disney interactive in in salt lake city and i just was making tiny progress on on the the latest book blood of the martyrs and i finally talked with my wife and i'm like you know i'd like to just quit disney and just just work on making this book and so he talked about it like what would be the best way to do it we had some savings and my wife was like no let's not go through the savings i'll start working and you can work on the book and so that's next i think four or five years was me working on the book slowly so wow foreign and i was dealing with all sorts of like depression and other issues as i was like like trying to do that but i at the end of the day i did finish it and i was very happy with how how it turned out and just feels like a very authentic you know true part of myself and i'm kind of proud of what it is and it was like well reviewed i mean there's lots of people that i respect that have that have spoken well of it and so that's been great and so i'm curious about some of the elements like because there are some of the elements which are obvious in terms of the the storytelling and there's some which are just it's like how can i say this it's very mysterious let's say some some elements of the story are quite clear and straightforward and some of the elements are quite mysterious and so i'm wondering if so for example there's a scene with all these like giant demons for example like these huge kind of giant demons and so i was wondering if you're pulling from certain mythologies or if it was really just your imagination that you were kind of pulling from yeah with with this book the fantastical elements of it it's it's a much it was a much more like kind of intuitive kind of imaginative imaginative thing there's there was definitely kind of a flavor i wanted to that you talked about kind of the mysterious quality of it and i yeah or this kind of like esoteric feeling particularly there's kind of some moments where like he's given kind of these clues or these like messages or signs and you're not really clear exactly what they mean or how they fit together but it's just it's more of like the feeling that i wanted to get from that [music] and kind of this like descent into this kind of spiritual realm i just i really enjoyed and the ambiguity of like what is like what is dream and what is reality is something that that was was really interesting to me as i was doing this as well yeah and there's a there's a sense in which the main character is some kind it like you talked about star wars it makes sense like you get a sense in which this character is somehow chosen but is also possibly a dark figure no it's not clear you know it is kind of that luke skywalker idea or the skywalker idea and and there's that wonderful moment where he chooses his weapon i think that's probably the obviously the high moment where it almost feels like he's being forced to become what he is right he's he he's resisting like the whole book he's just kind of he's resisting one way or another certain things he he's reacting to to different to different things around him and then that's the moment where even in his own he resists like picking the weapon and then that ultimately would lead him to end up having the weapon that that he didn't want to have in the first place yeah yeah yeah and so you did you so had you already thought about what the sequel would be like did you you kind of planted on your head or you were just kind of you you just kind of finished it and you were you were because it feels like when it ends like it like this book has to have a second i know oh i know it's it's really frustrating because i think it's very unlikely that a sequel is never gonna happen to this book i mean i understand i understand it i mean especially if it took you it's it's interesting that you're saying it took you like five years to work through it because i can see it when you say it i can see it because every panel seems like it has been completely thought out but also but it still it doesn't feel labored at all because i think it's probably because of your drawing style there's something about it which feels like it's just flowing through like the entire story just kind of flows through and the panels are flowing almost like yeah like there's water rolling down and you're just you're just kind of tumbling into the story especially with the character kind of falling into imaginary spaces and then coming back out and everything there's that whole thing going on yeah talking to you really makes me want to make comics again that's great if i can do that that's awesome we need you making comics we want you making more comics because it's interesting because one of the things that is funny to me is like how much did you know about let's say russian orthodoxy before you you made this i knew i knew andrew black and that was it right right right so i've i've read i did a little bit of reading after that like a lot of wikipedia stuff i did another little short story that's connected kind of tangentially connected to green monk it actually kind of connects the mini comic to to blood of the martyrs so it's kind of the one connecting threat is this little like four page story i did that's much more based on russian mythology it's like it's straight out of a russian myth that i kind of used i had kind of two pieces from each of this the the stories that kind of end up in there so that was it yeah i did some reading and that definitely kind of influenced how i looked at it but there's other things i've been learning afterwards that have been really interesting that have given me like more insight onto which sounds funny to say but you know reading more about like like kind of eastern orthodox traditions of contemplative practice yep and how that how that affected those communities and things like that that have been but i've i've kind of said before that i'm kind of like i'm kind of like my knowledge of like russian history and and and religion is kind of like similar to sergio leone's like understanding of like the american west right you know it's kind of like this beautiful caricature let's say yeah yeah something like that yeah no i definitely that i mean i definitely because i definitely got that in in the book because i think you might not know i'm orthodox myself and then okay so i'm actually an iconographer that's my prime let's say work and so it was interesting to kind of go through and see your interpretation like even of the icons and kind of how you you brought different elements together and how you kind of interpreted the the iconographic tradition so i find that i found that very fascinating so there's because even like so there's a sense in which obviously you have this feminine character yeah that repeats let's say through the through the story right it starts with the boy's mother but then appears in almost like a mythological way and then it kind of revealed at the end but and so were you trying to because the sense i get is that there was something of of the virgin mary in that imagery but you're also trying to pull in more almost like a this goddess figure that was kind of being pulled into the story at the same time so i'm curious a little bit about that in terms of that that that feminine the repetition of that feminine character through the story yeah yeah that's that's interesting it's it's that's the one i think that's really exciting me about how this story worked out and a lot of this some stuff is kind of intentional but a lot of the stuff afterwards you look back at it and you're like oh my gosh this is like seeing these huge parts of my psyche i wasn't aware of you know because it's very much a story about like masculinity as far as this boy being raised in this this monastery and this particular form of like spiritual masculinity you know and i i was i was a raised mormon so that has okay yeah it has its own flavor as far as like what does it mean to be a man and be like spiritual so that the whole sense of like being in being raised in a house that is a house the fathers where you're just surrounded by all these fatherly figures you know is really interesting and i've actually been i've been criticized i mean i've had a few people criticize me to be like hey there's like no women in this story you know but then it's like the feminine is very much a part of this story as far as like obviously his mother as this as this figure this like connection this balance between like paganism and and you know orthodoxy and how they kind of unite in in his person but yeah then kind of the the virgin mary kind of appears you know oddly in this very masculine way at the end is as kind of this apex figure within this kind of spiritual test and she's kind of she's kind of like but that's okay you have definitely have traditions in the orthodox church itself about you know aspects of the virgin which are are kind of terrifying like she's this protector too like she has this she protects her child so there's something about that you know you you take a icons of the virgin on the wall of constantinople when the wall when the city is being attacked you know there's something about that there's a there is a kind of mother bear aspect to the to the to the virgin as well yeah yeah so i mean it's really one of these things that as i look back on it it's so delightful to look back on it and just and as a map of my own like interior world and obviously those things always map to some sort of greater like you know archetypal realm whatever you want to call it but yeah that's one of those interesting things is seeing how like the masculine and the feminine kind of kind of play out in it so yeah but i think you're i think it the way that you treat the feminine characters in it is really i think it's very powerful you know because there is a sense in which right now we're trying you know every story is always trying to now to replace the hero with a girl like it's like every year you know as he replaced with a girl but there's something about that which is artificial and there's a there's a missing of what the feminine can be in a story even a story of adventure which has usually is a more masculine has a more masculine trope but you know the image of the the woman who is there as it's kind of hidden guiding principle and is also like this this mysterious agent which is pulling you forward you know i always use the image of galadriel in in the lord of the rings movies which it's like oh yeah he's not she's not in she doesn't feel like she's important in like how much presence she has in the story but she she cuts to the chase and is like this like secret figure that is motivating the characters to go to actually go on the quest you know and so i felt that definitely in your book as well where this feminine character is always hiding in the background and is there to kind of pull the the the boy you know into his into becoming what he's going to be ultimately yeah and and her figure i mean his mother kind of reappears as this mystical guide like in in his visions and yeah she is always kind of pulling him away from like the realm of law like that's kind of her like thing is he's in this this monaster that's all about law and you know order and all this other stuff and she's constantly like okay there's this other thing yeah i don't know and so you grew up you grew up you grew up mormon do you still consider yourself more man or not at all yes so that's been an interesting thing i i left the lds church which is kind of the largest denomination probably about eight years ago okay but which is a very very painful process when you leave like a religion but i've come to a point now where like that identity is is really important to me so i i say that i i consider myself a mormon but it's a very like individualistic like way that i i define that like it's just this thing that like feels right for me like in a way that connects me to place and you know certain people and i haven't i haven't like figured out all the details of what that means as far as like how it affects how i live or whatever but yeah it's something that's still very important to me yeah but so you don't you're not part of like a community though you kind of live it individually yeah yeah although i don't know much about i don't know much about mormon church so so i'm just kind of asking these questions i don't know yeah it's it's it's one of these things where like i i believe that i i feel like mormonism and like mormonism is actually like an ethnicity but it's also it's so because of like mennonites or yeah views or mennonites yeah the the way that it's it it kind of emerged and kind of evolved you know was very isolated in the rocky mountains and it was this one organization that really kind of like tied everyone together this one faith and so i think now like nowadays it's really hard for people to separate those two things and they'd be like oh you can be mormon and not be a member of this church is is something that i don't think people see as a possibility which i think is kind of a shame because there are people that leave and they're just like okay like what the [ __ ] am i now that i'm i'm not this thing you know so i'd be interested in a community of of of mormons that that aren't connected to the lds church but i don't know what that looks like community of ex-mormons or like let's say individualist mormons or something yeah yeah i don't know i don't know if there's any of that exists for sure i don't know so but i i'm wondering about because i don't the the book there's something very mystical definitely about like just the whole approach of the book and so is that something how do you perceive that in relation to your own path let's say to your own to to the way that you're living out your own yeah your own spiritual path let's say yeah yeah i mean i i look back at it now and it seems like there's a very clear message in it for me that i wasn't aware of and there's there's very much this sense of i mean it comes back to kind of this like owning owning your spiritual path where you know you have this character that's very conflicted in trying to trying to somehow reconcile these two extremes that he's part of very very much has a love for this community he's a part of but then there's this deep rich interior world that that speaks to who he is and comes out in these like you know these violent heroic fantasies that he has and then i mean the kind of end is is very interesting too because it is kind of like what comes next and there's something there in that truth of kind of the unknown like him walking out into into the winter as far as you know eventually does take responsibility and he does like take action and even though he's like made this vow to never take a life he ends up you know saving his monastery by by you know killing all of these invaders and so that's a very exciting question to me is like where you end up when you decide to you know take responsibility for for your path in life and it's not simply like [ __ ] the monastery you know because for him he's like he's still wearing his robes it's like this still matters for him you know it's interesting i was really surprised too about the ending because there's something you might not know about the orthodox ethos of war which is that on the one hand in the orthodox tradition there's a sense in which war violence and combat is inevitable that it's going to happen there is there is to some extent the possibility that you could attain something that there is it's not completely devoid of of value completely but it's also not totally sanctioned and so for example someone who a warrior that goes out to war when they return from war they're they're barred from communion for a certain amount of time they actually have to go to confession and they have to do penance for their combat but it's not like they're saying what you did you know they're they're recognizing the value of the combat but they're also realizing that there's something about it which is due to our circumstance it's like it's due to this fallen world in which we are and so you have to do some penance and you have to you have to atone for the killing that you participated in so it's just interesting because i don't think he probably didn't know that but there's something that comes out in the end of the book at something like that where it's like he doesn't want to kill anybody he doesn't want to be violent and then he's forced to do it out of love for his fellow months but because of that he it's almost like he also now has to leave the monastery so it's like a thing where he he saved the monastery by by doing this he engages in something which is like a trespass so he has to be exiled but he did it for them and so there's like it's an interesting it definitely is in terms of narrative it's a very powerful moment i thought yeah thank you that's a really interesting interesting perspective when i kind of made the decision that oh these are like pacifist monks that was a real speculation i'm just like i don't know if that's something that ever existed you know within like eastern orthodoxy i know it's existing monks are not supposed to fight like that's for sure you're not supposed to take up weapons there have been weird exceptions to that but the the they're definitely are not supposed to fight yeah yeah but then yeah the there is also there is also at least the archetype of like the warrior monk which is which is yeah it's more of a that's more of a it's definitely more of a western archetype like the the idea of the but it's funny because you have that in your in the book don't you you have these you have an image of these these monks that they were western like warrior monks i guess who kind of gave up their ways to become to become eastern eastern monks yeah that's right yeah and so and so then it's like then he so it's like you come to a point where now this this young character is going in that direction he's like he's going back in that direction yeah in terms of narrative i just thought it was so it was so ripe with with possibility definitely yeah and that's one of those things where it's just like man it's just like a tribute to how important it is to follow like intuition when you're like working through this these things because there's never a part of me that's just like here's what my morals are and i'm going to put it down in this book but as you work through these things it's just like there's something about this that just feels right and i don't i still don't even know why like i feel like i should be giving you an explanation about like what it means that's okay i can i can i can i say sometimes it's better when someone else finds the meaning because it's you seem like to be really an artist in the sense you said like artists are more like a lot of artists are more they're more like tuning forks right yeah like they get they get the pattern right they can tune in to the to the harmony and they put it down but it's like you know you don't necessarily know all the implications of what that is when you do it when you're doing it but but i do think it speaks to something as far as like like how i feel about morality like in in the sense there's a feeling in in the conclusion just about like morality is this living thing that you experience and it's not necessarily like a a list of rules and it's like you like you said there's something about what you talk about like yes you can go to like circumstances bring you to war but then there there needs to be some sort of penance at the same time for what you you're done and kind of the complexity of of morality it's there's something about that that just tastes tastes right to me i guess yeah so tell me a bit about in terms of the art let's say i'm just curious about who you see as your influences in the in the work do you have influences are you you're like i certainly do it i can remember at least when i was doing green month that it was something that that changed changed quite frequently and like i am like struggling to even even remember some of the names right now i'm thinking of artists and i can think of their arts but i mean no big deal like is it more is it coming from the world of traditional art from fine art or or just from comics the guard was in a mix of different influences lots of different things one one that comes up to me that was really big for me is christoph blaine and he's he's a french artist that did i was first introduced to him he did did part of dungeon he was part of the dungeon series and he is just this really expressive very fluid artist and i just loved his layouts i love the way he like laid out pages and the dynamism in his stuff and i remember that being a big influence on when i was doing this and there's other there's other artists that names escape me that affected like how i was trying to like ink and stuff like that yeah no worries if you don't if you don't remember that at the moment but for sure the inking is is an important part of the the style because it has it really has this kind of loose fluid feeling to it which which helps in the this fluidity of the story itself that i was saying where it's like it almost feels like on the you could almost read it's interesting because like if you wanted to you could read the book and like 15 minutes right you could just kind of flip through but then you go back and then you just slowly go through all the all the subtlety of the the changes and the character growing up and all these little reactions and then you can spend hours with it just going through so it i mean it's it's interesting that a book can be that way because i could i could i could really see it like it just flows like water all the way through yeah yeah i love hearing that because that's that's like my experience with it that's one of the really satisfying experiences of that is having this sense of like a flow like the way like i did this thing where when i would finish a section i would kind of do it in chunks when i would finish a section i would lay out all the pages on my floor and like stand up on my couch and just like yeah yeah how all the pages kind of went together and i love that way of thinking about comics i mean you can certainly think about them as panel like each individual panel but i love this idea that of the subtle changes between each panel how each panel connects and how it it becomes this big hole and that was definitely a lie for me with color like the coloring of this book was something where i was thinking very very carefully about how like color like transition from from panel to panel and how that kind of tied everything together [music] but yeah there's something about that as far as like the flow of the story that that just feels like really important to me is particularly with this book yeah well definitely i could i could definitely see it you know and so yeah i think i think like for me i'm just happy that the book exists and i hope i really hope that that that i mean if we don't see another green monk book then at least something from you because i because i i really think it's it's wonderful and i encourage everybody to get it look green monk it's it's you can get it on amazon it's very reasonable and it's and it's yeah it's great for kids too like even kids it's like good in my my all my kids read it and they they really liked it you know they didn't have to you don't need like you you can get all the subtlety of the changes but you can also kind of read it as a fun story about you know this this kind of rebel not rebellious but like rambunctious young man who who kind of finds his way so so thanks for thanks for the book yeah yeah and i wish you the best as you kind of figure it out like what you're gonna do next yeah thank you appreciate that that's probably some more comics at some point in the future yeah great
