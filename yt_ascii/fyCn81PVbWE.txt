ladies and gentlemen have you ever been on a plane there's really nothing quite like being suspended 35 000 feet above the ground in a flying car going thousands of miles an hour and so i do what any normal person would do on a plane we just hope i don't die now some of you can sleep on planes i can't sleep on planes so i like to keep myself occupied and what better way to keep yourself occupied than challenging the plane to chess it's always a thought of mine to battle various pieces of technology hardware software in chess i once lost the game to a treadmill okay at a hotel in texas at a chess tournament this got me thinking should i make a series on this channel where i play against the bots that are programmed into certain devices and i think i will and actually the next thing that i want to do is play a tesla in chess because i'm sure they have chess so tesla let's do a collab seriously here's a photo of me playing it i'm also giving it the middle finger coincidentally that's me you might not believe it but yeah that's me i played this plane in four different levels okay it had four levels programmed into it the last level was called the grand master level so we're gonna see whether or not i can defeat an air airplane okay terrific stuff all right and yeah maybe this is the start of a new series let me know what you would like to see okay so i opened up against airplane level one with d4 now here's the thing about bots you don't know if level one is martin chessboard on chess.com which is you know essentially a recovering alcoholic which of course you should seek therapy and help if you need it but doesn't play chess like he ever got sober knight f6 knight c3 and the memes begin early as plain level one plays rook to g8 that's a new move i swear to god i have never seen that before and you know i it got me thinking like why haven't i seen it before i mean it's a logical i yeah so what do you do when your opponent plays stupidly you take the center right i mean you got to be principled you can put two pawns in the center you should put two pawns in the center and already the bot is completely lost because when your opponent puts knights out against pawns you should attack the knights you're actually going to learn some stuff here as a beginner i mean i know this sounds kind of dumb but you will learn some things because yeah this planes level one mode was not very good when you have pawns against knights you should attack the knights and actually in this case this knight can now no longer return because of the really powerful move rook to g8 what i was not expecting however is the next move because the bot went rook b8 and i was like oh my god i almost didn't play the rest of the levels just because this because i thought all right well this is just really stupid this isn't going to make good content but then i thought actually this absolutely will make good content because i could probably talk about paint on a wall and you would listen because i'm funny and thank you for that tennis ball anyway it takes f6 g takes f6 knight f3 e6 d5 now of course i can continue to develop and everything but i'm up with cereal and i have a little bit more kind of central presence so i want to bust open the center of the board because that will allow me to transfer pieces into my opponent's territory my opponent plays knight b4 and i play the move a3 here essentially forcing off a trade of knights or i don't know my opponent would lose this knight take take take and now of course there are two ways to win a chess game when you are already well i guess there's multiple ways you can also win on time but i mean you can just go for mate you can use your overwhelming material advantage to go for a checkmate or you can just simplify down into a winning end game i went bishop c4 threatening a checkmate now to the bots credit it did hang made in one but it took a free pawn which i suppose is a moral victory then it promptly got checkmated okay that that was the equivalent of me walking down to the playground here in new york city and kicking a four-year-old in the face which for legal reasons i don't condone unless you're also four if you're four and you beat up a four-year-old that's fair game i mean can we just keep that's a reasonable statement you could even be three or five all right we'll we'll take either i'm not this this was not i'm not impressed by this but i had to share it all right now game number two all right game number two oh i didn't even change my name here i'm just white whatever walter white d4 again this i'm i'm trying to test out some of my d4 lines i have no idea how good this is now i played the tripowski and to my dismay level two plane plays a main line i was like what the what this thing played c5 that's one of the best moves now d5 and you know the computer here can play queen b6 or d6 or g6 and it plays knight e4 which is i mean we're literally in a main line from palestine i'm panicking all right i'm i i i am not happy about this i do not want to be playing a bot that like knows some sort of openings now i play h4 which is known as the raptor variation this is in my my d4 dynamite course but also just one of my favorite lines to play in the trumpowski the bot goes here i play knight d2 forcing a decision out of the night which way it's going to capture it takes and this gives me various tactical possibilities on the h file generally white is very happy here bishop g7 c3 and this time instead of blundering in two moves the bot plays a stupid move in seven moves however i will say that to me it's stupid but like to the average player it might not be so obvious why my opponent's next move is bad what is so bad about the move f6 i mean if you think about it it's trying to get me to make a decision right it's trying to but here's the thing i'm stronger here okay i am stronger on this side so by playing a move like this which also blocks your bishop and weakens the light scores around your king you're fighting back on the side where i'm stronger and in reality you should probably focus more on the center queen out maybe knight d7 bring a knight you can play h6 that is a little bit more reasonable than f6 because it doesn't weaken your king but i immediately spot some weaknesses and i play queen c2 and the idea of queen c2 is obviously first of all like in long castle now but there's a tactic and luckily the bot does not see the tactic and the tactic is really quite glorious it's not queen takes g6 because that's defended but it is sacrificing the rook on h7 and now queen g6 hits the king and that rook so after rook h7 there would be this and i would be winning back my rook and i would also be up a pawn and this king can't castle and i've got various very nasty follow-ups so my return on investment was quite quick with rook h7 however here the bot plays the top computer move ironic it plays king f7 which is actually the best move and that kind of guards g6 and material is equal but why is white plus two white is plus two because white has a good structure white has a little bit more center space black's king is very weak and white has very obvious targets so here i play the move knight f3 targeting the pawn on g5 i was expecting bishop f6 after which i would go here but the botwind g4 unfortunately g4 just loses the game on the spot so g4 loses to knight g5 king e8 queen g6 king d8 knight f7 king c7 and now before i took the queen i played the move d6 check king b6 discover check took the queen made a new queen i should have promoted to a knight and hunted down the black king with my queens can't take because of the pin multiple pins here discovered attack and this one took me 23 moves to checkmate the bot but i did all right now this one was a little bit better but i still managed to win the game the next two were pretty intense though before i show you those games though today's

the video hi it's me again i hope you enjoyed that ad read so now it's it's game three and i decided i couldn't play white every game so i decided to play black once again i have absolutely no idea how good the plane is so we have a queen's gambit so i'm like okay and i play a6 a6 is my upcoming repertoire queen's gambit declined with a6 i'm going to be launching this on chesley quite soon and this game the bot played like a super solid opening i mean it played a queen's gambit with b3 supporting the center and i'm playing a very solid and defensive setup now here the bot trades on d5 right away this is a little bit of a rush decision there is really no benefit factor beneficiary of this trade uh other than me i mean i i am i am really quite happy here about the turn of events i'm gonna go bishop d6 i'm gonna go bishop b7 i'm gonna castle i'm gonna put a rook in the e file and life is going to be good so bishop d3 and you see all this and i castle and this is sort of me finishing my developmental scheme now the pawn on a6 is actually very useful because it prevents knight b5 in many cases and i can even consider playing the move b5 myself it's a balanced game but i also have ideas of advancing with c5 bringing my rook to c8 and as you can see when everything opens up my bishops dew point in that direction so how would i activate that i would plot my knight into the center which clears the queen i can also play knight e4 pawn to f5 and that allows both my queen and my rook to rotate over this way and start some sort of attack this only works because a lot of kind of the infiltration squares from my opponent are covered and i'm winning the battle for the center so bishop b2 rookie 8 so far so good and here i already can kind of make this bishop make a decision will it isolate itself on h3 or will it go somewhere back there but i decided i'm gonna play the move knight e4 immediately this was actually not the most accurate move because here my opponent can probably get a knight into the center somehow if they want to they can also play like knight e4 de4 and then knight e5 trying to get a bunch of exchanges going and if the bot had done that it would have been here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here and probably a draw i mean if this would have happened it would have been crazy i would have been like wow i can't even beat level three how on earth am i going to beat the gm level so instead of that however the bot went here and i continued supporting my center and again i've talked about it winning the battle here for the center is very important i'd like to ideally shove these pieces back a little bit so i played queen e7 more support in the center and rook d8 on the way and notice how i've completely restricted my opponent's piece play none of these pieces can really get involved and none of the pawns can really get involved which means it's now time for black to start calling the shots and i play the move g6 g6 forces the bishop to go there because if takes i would be winning material so bishop h3 and now what alright black is better but now what well now what i decided i'm going to remove any play so i'm going to play b5 so now my opponent's knight can't move forward at all and the next thing that i was gonna do what's like the tipping point of this position where can i actually break in and i realized on the king side i realized that due to the complete lock nature of the position i can use my ah h and g pawns now the computer likes this move to play something like knight g5 king g7 rook h8 and started an attack like that i mean it's super sophisticated stuff i was just thinking h5 i really like this idea because first of all i have this and second of all i can anchor my knight in on g4 h5 is a really really nice idea i was very proud of this actually i know you think oh this is dumb you're playing some bot on a plane what a stupid video you clickbaited me you're you're losing your hair your hoodie is ugly i don't know these are just probably things i think about myself due to my imposter syndrome but king h1 and i thought you know h5 is a nice idea i was i was very proud of this because the center is completely locked i'm keeping the tension i'm disallowing my opponent you know from doing anything in the position so king g1 and now knight g4 and i thought i'm in great shape now as it turns out of course i'm not in great shape because i rushed with knight g4 and apparently i should have gone here first and only focused on the queen side this is what the this is what stockfish wants after i went knight g4 apparently my opponent could have gone takes takes knight e5 which i thought didn't work but due to due to all the tactics it does you see i would be winning a pawn but unfortunately i would be walking directly into the line of attack and this is too dangerous looks like i'm you know potentially starting so i have nothing i'm just losing material so rook dd1 was played in the game though and the bot fell apart it just couldn't sustain my pressure it ended up sacrificing its queen oh my god and we want now the way you win a game where you have a queen for some material you trade the rooks you get the queen in and bishop b4 and actually the bot resigned here because i guess the higher level the bot gets it realizes that resigning is an option so we just decided to resign it but if the thing is they can't really defend itself like if it plays rook c1 i'm gonna take take and then i'm gonna sack my queen for checkmate and i don't know i gotta be careful though i really shouldn't piss the chess board off on a plane who knows what it'll do to like the engine and stuff although there's four of them that's what they say anyway bishop b4 i would be simplifying and just the move rookie one doesn't work because queen e1 and then it's back rank mate so 3-0 we've moved on to the grand master level bot all right and this was a fun one all right this was a fun one i began with d4 and it went queen a5 check and i was like what this is your grand master level bot i mean i'm pretty sure it called it kasparov it was literally trying to say that it was modeled after kasparov if you if gary kasparov saw somebody play queen a5 on the second move he would punch them in the face like i don't know how i don't know if gary has violent tendencies but knight c3 and and by the way i love how stockfish saying this is an inaccuracy anyway just like we saw in game one two pawns in the center if possible now the bot in this position played queen before which is a very funny move it looks like a fork right but it's not it's not a fork because after a3 white is winning if you play queen takes b2 like you can't take that because the queen is hanging and in this position i had calculated that after rook b1 queen here i just have a winning position after knight b5 and you cannot stop knight c7 and by the way i don't i i might not even have to go knight c7 but knight c7 does win a rook like i can maybe even go here and if knight a6 there's a way to trap the queen with rook a1 which is just really brutal so i tricked this grand master level bot right and i sent it backwards and we had the following position i mean yeah stockfish here is just giving me some like you know it wants me to go e5 you guys know the feeling you play a great game you run it through game review it tells you that you have seven brain cells left if even in general this was the position from the opening and i had a slight advantage right so i played bishop c4 which would cause a mistake even though you know it's plus 1.4 and after this it's plus 1.1 shut up all right castles rookie eight all right and here i was very proud i what it just wiped the names of all right whatever that that was not supposed to happen it wiped the names of the players because i removed the feedback of like the question marks all right terrific love it excellent stuff thank you chess.com rookie eight d6 now you may ask yourself levy isn't d6 just losing a pawn two different ways if you play it yes if i play it yes but also i had an idea the thing is if i just slow play like if i play rookie one what is my opponent gonna do d6 right and i'll play another move and then they're gonna develop and i'll defend and they're gonna finish their development and sooner than later i'm not gonna have as big of an advantage although it says it's plus two because you can play g4 but if i play a bunch of natural looking moves i might lose my advantage as you saw here after h3 it's down to plus one after d6 it's down to like plus one it was plus point eight a moment ago but whatever so i played d6 why did i play d6 d6 is a really cool idea the point is that something has to capture this and my bishop now sees f7 and here i calculated the entire sequence of moves after this bishop d6 knight g5 so i'm making my opponent be gluttonous to take this pawn and now they have to guard f7 and they're a move behind developing two moves because they have to move this piece so opponent goes rook f8 now how do i add another player to the attack my knight is good my bishop is good my other knight is good this is probably going to happen so what do i need to play right now i need to bring my queen so that if h6 happens i can go in and normally it's bad to get give up a bishop for two rooks but that's never my idea my idea is rookie one and there is no way to stop my infiltration with queen and rook because i have i have completely immobilized 11 points of your material so d6 was a super nice idea blocking the development of my opponent why did i say i was gonna say the developmental plans and then i said development and i said development so queen f3 and here the bot decides to be greedy and take a second pawn and from this point forward i played 10 straight top engine moves so in this position i played 10 straight stockfish moves to win the game first queen d3 the idea of queen d3 defending c2 threatening to trap the queen queen d6 and various queen h7s b5 now in this position i can take and i can also try to maybe trap the queen but then this and then this so in this position i played another top engine move knight d5 threatening to remove this knight with check and checkmate on the next move that is now my threat opponent needs to block however this had a secret idea the secret idea was bishop c3 and now the queen is trapped because if bc4 trying to counter-attack me i have a check then i have a double check and then i rotate my queen and threaten a mate while your queen is still hanging so bishop c3 forces the bot to sacrifice its queen i take the queen back and now obviously any person would resign here but knight g4 knight f6 check take take and yes i'm losing my bishop on c4 but it doesn't matter because i bring a rook and in this position i am threatening various forms of attack but none more brutal than the following knight takes f7 and my opponent never had a chance to finish development knight h6 is mate so you take and i go check here boom that was fun airplanes successfully defeated some of these games were harder than others this was not a gm level bot to finish things off and we won humanity prevailed let me know if you would like me to make this a series i can try to play toasters refrigerators i don't know i don't know what's out there that has a chess bot programmed into it but ever since i lost that game to a treadmill at a hotel in texas at a chess tournament i've been thinking i should play like a tesla in chess i should do some more fun collaborative stuff this was a good start but yeah 4-0 gotham vs airplane
