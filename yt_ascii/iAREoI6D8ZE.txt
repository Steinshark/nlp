ladies and gentlemen wouldn't it be nice if you could successfully predict the future wouldn't it be nice if you could foresee all 14 million six hundred and thousand possibilities tie them back to today and make the right decision but when you cheat at chess that is exactly what happens you see when you cheat at chess you play god and that means that you know all the best moves that are coming in the future and what is best in the present and so in today's video i will be showing a game where i unknowingly defeated a cheater see the other day i was just sitting around doing what any human does on their couch in 2023 i was playing chess and i had no idea i was paired against a cheater i booted up a three minute game i tried my best it was a hard fight and all of a sudden i won how did i beat a cheater that's what you're going to see in today's video normally when i make videos folks i like to show you the eval bar this thing not today we will not have an eval bar because you are going to experience this game the same way i experience this game while i was playing this person then i will show you how i actually won let's go my opponent played the move d4 i play some games off stream like when i'm not live on twitch or when i'm not just making youtube content especially when i'm in the middle of making courses and i'm currently in the middle of making an opening course and i want to get some experience in it so i'm making an anti-queen's pawn london all of this like knight f3 stuff i'm making a queens game but decline course and so i'm i'm playing some queens game but declines right d4 d5 c4 e6 my opponent played knight f3 and i played a6 this is going to be my main recommendation and the idea of a6 is to take this pawn is every single arrow going to be blue today what that was weird okay i forgot how to draw red arrows so we're just gonna draw yellow arrows essentially what you want with the move knight c3 is you want to take this pawn and you want to play b5 and in many intermediate games white is just completely incapable of getting the pawn back imagine taking a toy from a three-year-old and holding it like this they're not going to get it back right so it's just sort of the same thing it's the equivalent of bullying a toddler yes very good that's the point of playing the move a6 now at my level many people play the move cd5 here and we just get an exchange queen's game but declined which is kind of boring but at your level you're gonna get a lot of people who just lose this pawn and then you just go like this my opponent played g3 so i was like okay so my opponent's playing a catalan style type of game but the catalan doesn't make as much sense as it would against just the typical development because i'm gonna take the pawn and i can just hang on to my pawn very quickly admittedly just like many of you i didn't remember my opening lines a lot of you get a course watch a video play an opening don't know your lines get a terrible position but you win and then you don't study the opening because you won nobody studies games they win you have to study games you win too not to boost your ego but now there's a couple of lines for black i can play knight c6 and then get out of this pin and play b5 but i just decided i'm gonna play b5 right away you just can't have my pawn back and if white just plays slowly here black just plays bishop b7 and i'm really just telling you like white is never getting one of these pawns back white is gonna have to spend the game compensating all right has a terrible personality but drives a really flashy car you know one of those things instead of that my opponent played the move knight e5 so immediately taking advantage of the open diagonal now i did not remember the line here at all and naturally when i saw that i could go here but then knight c6 would happen and that's a fork i thought that doesn't look very good for me what i had forgotten is that queen b6 is fine and even though this happens you can just play rook b8 so you're okay i didn't remember that so i thought me rook attacked miruk move not a good move all right rook a7 not the most accurate move and i thought but it's okay my opponent's gonna castle and then i'm gonna play bishop b7 trade the bishop and i'll be fine but then my opponent played a really annoying move which is the move a4 now again i don't suspect any cheating i just suspect my opponent caught me in the opening so i gotta do my best here right and i'm in a little bit of trouble here now i know that sometimes you can play f6 but i was like i don't know about playing f6 in this position so i decided i'm gonna go bishop b7 because this is my opponent's prized possession right and if we trade this i'm gonna be happy so what did my opponent do immediately played e4 but in my mind psychologically i thought oh that's a win for me like i just did a good thing because now they're blocked and then here i thought go back so that your rook is actually defended you may notice that i'm i'm not like i'm not touching these pawns because if i go here everything is weak so i thought okay well i'm just going to play bishop before check and then i'm gonna play knight f6 and castle and i'm gonna be great i mean i'm gonna maybe give my pawn back but at least i'll be equal i thought i was in good spirits i thought life was good i had no idea i was playing a cheater right i'm just i'm playing like a 2700 i'm 2700 blitz online not elo actual and i thought you know my opponent might go here and then we'll trade so my opponent played knight c3 which i thought was reasonable i played the move knight f6 and i thought well now they've got to defend this pawn because i'm threatening to take and to take why would my opponent right and so i thought maybe they would go bishop g5 and i was gonna do this and they were gonna do this and i was gonna take with my pawn or my queen but i actually really like that and i thought this is really nice for me because i'm winning another pawn i can play c5 so once i played knight f6 i thought oh yeah that's it i mean it's just a matter of time until my opponent's position disintegrates but when you are playing someone who is cheating when you're like 700 they just buzz saw you at my level when you play a cheater they play moves that have very subtle details and those details only become obvious to you once the move is on the board so i thought i had a very clear idea here i am posing some problems white cannot really take on b5 because i'm gonna take on e4 so what did my opponent do they just castled or rather stockfish castle then they relayed the move onto the board well what about this so here's the thing that was my idea right i was going to do this this was this was the idea but this doesn't work because queen g4 and also bishop a3 and i'm never gonna be able to castle it's like oh so my entire idea just doesn't work none of this works huh okay well that's a problem i guess i'm gonna castle now and now i thought okay they're gonna go a takes b5 and then i'm gonna do that now that my king is safe i got my king out of the center of the board now i can take and then i'm gonna take and i'm in good shape still i don't think they're i don't know they're cheating they're not like it just never really crossed my mind bishop takes pawn takes and i took on e4 and i thought well what an idiot i mean imagine you're literally playing someone that's cheating and in your mind you are actively thinking they're so bad like it's an amazing psychological phenomenon now i thought okay my opponent might take and now i'm attacking this and you know they have to go here of course none of that happened like every move they made surprised me a little bit they played bishop a3 which i had seen i didn't think that there i didn't think much of this move and originally what i was going to do in this position is play bishop here disregarding the attack on my rook and then i was thinking to play queen d5 check but this doesn't actually get me anywhere and after bishop a3 i just thought all right what a rookie i mean what's what's the big deal i mean bishop a3 is such a dumb move i thought like literally i was like i can't take here because they do this so what an idiotic short-sighted decision to attack my rook now i can take back on b5 i mean seriously what a  i mean this dude is so bad like oh my god he is garbage i have never played a worse chess player there's all the stuff that's going through my mind while i'm on the couch my opponent takes and i'm like what but now i have this and this like everything is hanging and i'm i'm still up a pawn and then here i started getting a little suspicious because you can miss a couple of moves in a game against someone your own level but once you start missing some really ridiculous moves you go ah you know it no still i was like wow we fighting i mean it's all good so my opponent played queen f3 queen f3 hangs a fork i mean this move did not even cross my mind in the slightest i mean i had only been looking at queen e1 which defends on attacks queen f3 invites a fork because queen f7 so if i play knight d2 in this position yeah i'm busted but i'm like you know in my mind i'm like well this is still a short-sighted move because i played knight g5 i attacked the queen i defend my which is the best move and now my opponent went here and i was like oh that's so annoying if i take this they have f4 removing my knight from the defense of the f7 pawn so i thought all right i got nothing else besides playing the move g6 right i gotta i gotta make sure the queen doesn't hit my f7 pawn and then here i started thinking well okay i'm gonna take and i'm gonna move my c pawn and my rook is going to defend my seventh rank i'm thinking of all these creative ways to guard my king opponent infiltrates a little bit further and now i have an option here between playing ab5 i didn't like this i thought it was too dangerous for me i also saw a ridiculous tactic which is bishop e7 which is just such a scumbag move it gives away a bishop but then white takes my rook gross so i played f6 and and now i'm like all right well now the knight's gotta go right i mean f6 attacking the knight and the knight will leave and i'll take and then i'll probably just play like c6 and i'm just gonna get my rook over here i mean i thought this was really smart i thought i'm fine so played f6 i'm like all right it's just a matter of time until i win the game and then i got hit with this bishop and you know what's crazy i swear to you i still was so confident i didn't think i was playing a cheater really i just thought that this was a stupid move it turns out that after f6 black is better except bishop c1 it's the only move it's a top engine move and it disallows me taking the night because of this and it's not like i'm getting mated but it's just that white dominates on the file and the dark squares and i'm much worse even after i got hit with bishop c1 the thought never crossed my mind that i was get playing a cheater i just moved my knight i thought oh what how stupid and and how are you gonna guard this pawn now you're gonna guard this pawn by not by sacrificing the knight if i take you fork me and you get material back but then i was like wait a minute but this has no threat this is not a threat that's not a threat what an idiot i'm gonna take on c3 and then i'm gonna play 92 and i'm threatening b5 still and i'm threatening d4 i still thought i was winning i still thought in my mind i was winning this game because white is just bluffing and there's nothing there my opponent played rookie one and i was like well if i played queen d4 i think it's a little too dangerous i think i'm gonna get pinned so i thought all right rookie won now c6 my turn to play the top engine move now i am threatening to take on b5 and i'm gonna get my rook over here and naturally after c6 i thought white has to do something right white has to maybe take on a6 or just make me make a decision well as it turns out the best move is to just retreat the knight completely ignore the fact that this pawn is just hanging and hit me on e6 and now i thought okay but what about this knight takes b5 and if you take on e6 i take on d4 i thought dude i'm up two pawns now no i'm in cruise control but now my opponent played rook takes c6 which is a according to this version of stockfish is a slight in accuracy the other stockfish on a high depth thinks 96 is winning other stockfish meaning i think the one i'm currently using is the weaker one but it really likes rookie 4 rook g4 but cheaters don't always play the top engine move sometimes they play the second one because they're trying to avoid getting caught i didn't know that at the time though at the time i'm like ah rookie six great i'm gonna go here which is horrible move i played knight takes d4 and my opponent took and i took back and then they flagged so in this position we both had like 50 seconds on the clock and their time ran out to zero i was like okay i'll take the win then i went to their profile i was the second person to ever beat this person this person had 20 wins and they had made their account that day that day they had made their account i thought that's weird that's so weird and i went through the game but i went through the game with the engine and as it turns out best move best move best move best move best move all of their moves except for two were the top line of the engine all of this and i fought back i kept even with someone who was literally using an engine knight g5 and then finally i blundered because i'm a human and i mean bishop c1 is such a scumbag move oh my god and sacrificing and then just calm rookie one knight f4 out of the position like your pawn is hit twice and you just move your knight like you don't even ah rookie six was a was was not the top engine move of course and at the end they made two slip ups and then they just set their clock out and as it turns out i had only really made one blunder i guess they could have played rook f6 and i would have been in serious trouble but mentally i thought i was playing for a win the whole time it never even occurred to me that i had been playing somebody who was cheating and essentially the way i won this game is i just was slightly worse the whole game i kept playing the best responses in a slightly worse position so i was just defending against an engine cheater and then something went wrong i maybe they clicked the wrong move right because if they're cheating with their phone and then they come back and they play the wrong move that's what might have happened maybe they're i don't know maybe their internet crashed and they got banned they didn't get banned in that game but they got banned in a day like they played a few more games than they got and i was like what this dude for real yeah it turned out that i kept even with a cheater for over 20 moves and yes they lost on time but i won i got the rating and i was just the second ever person to beat this account and now that account no longer exists so what a wild turn of events this was pretty cool i've i've almost never beaten a cheater i mean i usually just lose because they're cheating but in this case i played well enough that even with them using engine assistance the entire game they only got a minimal advantage against me and then they messed up when they could have had a big advantage and then they lost on time so yeah i'm gonna go around today saying that i i basically cheated the chess gods there you go hope you enjoyed this video let me know if you want more cheater content hope you're having a nice day evening afternoon i'll see you in the next one get out of here
