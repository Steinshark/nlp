come down a little bit of a rabbit hole with me do you ever feel like alice so this is an update on 8 by8 nights tours a night's tour is the path that a kn can take to make all the way around a chessboard and it hits every single square once and it's closed if it ends up back where it started and it's open if it doesn't and it's each square once and only once only once yep mhm so here's a nice example of a closed one and an open one so nights tours really really cool excellent area of math to look at but we can take it one step further and combine these nights tours with magic squares i'm sure you've done a video on this before but here's what a magic nights tour looks like actually this one is the most magic nights tour which is a night's tour and as the night goes along it kind of traces like here's first position second position third fourth all the way up to 64 and if you look at all of the rows and all of the columns they add up to the same number and then if you split it into four again each of these rows and columns add up to the same number but it's even cooler if you look at the diagonals no pych it's not the diagonals don't add up who would call that a magic square i actually think that when something is impossible in maths that's where that's where the most creativity happens so let's think about this an 8 by8 magic nights tour is not possible there's semi-magic ones which are the ones where the diagonals don't work so where are you going to go from that what are you going to do mathematicians have kind of come up against this brick wall they've been told you cannot go any further that's not something mathematicians are going to stand for so there are two things that you could change so you could either change the piece that you're using you could look at a different kind of tour maybe not a knight's tour like a king's tour or you could change the size of the board that you're working on so although we've kind of we had to do an exhaustive search and computer-wise check every single 8 by8 nights tour to see if any of them were magical there's no diagonally magic 8 by8 nights tour we know that now took a while here's what we do know every single chessboard which is 4n by 4n where n is strictly greater than two does have magic nights tours which are diagonally magic 12 by 12 16 by 16 all of them h all of them work but not not 8 by 8 doesn't work for 8 by8 and 4x4 doesn't work no 4x4 doesn't work either everyone so as we go up up to like like 400 by 4 you know it should exist yeah uhuh every single one so you can start kind of combining them you know if you take a 16x 16 i think you can translate it over into four different places and then now you've got a 32x 32 magic one that will work here are some cool graphics to show you as some fantastic night tours people are always really drawn to the symmetrical ones you get ones which are more symmetric than others so the other thing that i want to look at is other than nights tours which can be magic in 12 a 16 onwards so cool you could also look at kings tours as well so on an 8 by8 board you can get a magical kings tour there are 47 bially symmetric magic kings tours and i just love when things come in a little closed group i think they're really cool so the groups are labeled by their diagonals i guess here are all of the a ones they have the same kind of diagonal i might draw like one a one so here is h the first a1 magic kings tour so we'll start up here and it's closed so it's going to get back to the start here but i won't actually close it just so that we can see where it starts and where it ends so that's the very first a1 ba symmetric magic kings tour and i think this was discovered really quite a while ago'00s or something and since then we've now got 46 more of them and i believe that closes the set that's all of them so when it comes to numbering you can if you wanted you can start here 1 2 3 4 all the way along round to 64 or you can go the other way around you can start here 1 2 3 all the way along up to 64 so it doesn't matter which direction you go it'll still be magic the diagonals are magic so they pair off so here's where square one is going to be and here's where it ends up at square 64 once it's done all of its moves and then two and 63 and three and 62 and four and 61 one so they're kind of pairing off 65s and that's how you end up with the magic number of 260 so four lots of 65 let me just double check my maths on that yep 260 so the magic number for this is 260 all the rows all the columns all the diagonals and that's because of that pairing thing that happens when you look at this you might be wondering if this is a1 how can i use this as a base to then work off and create the other magic king's tours so you want to keep the diagonals the same because that's how they're classed the diagonals have to be this but what could you change about which will not change the diagonals maybe when it gets to this point here instead of going straight along this alleyway and straight down here it could go like down up still around here like this same on the other side cool same with this you can kind of twist and untwist some of these and that creates all of the the a ones so we're going to do f1 which i think is really cute to look at really nice and interesting so it starts towards the middle it's going to start here and we're going to shoot straight up across this way nice little corner i assume that you're going to time lapse [music] this okay and we finish off there so that's closed as well it is closed yeah all of the ones in this little set that i'm investigating right here they're all closed i find this very pleasing and when i first look at this this might be a bias from where i grew up but it looks to me like celtic nwork yeah it looks like the kind of things that you see on stones that's not not 100% wrong so there is a stone in perth called the st mid's stone if you go go to perth museum you can visit just sitting there in the foyer and it is a 20x 24 king's tour not magic unfortunately well as far as i can tell i've tried different starting places i don't think it's magic there's a lot of rows and columns which add up to the same thing but there's four that don't a lot of celtic nw works so the the most famous one the one that everyone looks at is from the book of kels really fancy looking one again is also it's two kings tours linked interlaced and a lot of celtic nw workk is a king's tour so you might be thinking to yourself wait have we just kind of discovered something that we always knew did did they know this back in ancient times i'm pretty sure they weren't playing chess i don't i don't think that it came from kings tourist i think that's using our current maths but it is it's something that people have found pleasing all through time i a king's tour seems kind of natural though it's not very chessy is it the ability to just move up down left right or diagonally it's quite natural yeah uhuh and especially when you're looking at the magic ones because another way that you could state this these magic kings tours is completely forgetting about the king like how can you have connected consecutive numbers like can you make a magic square with connected consecutive numbers on an 8 by8 board yes you can and so it just naturally becomes a king's tour but yeah it is it is kind of linked with with celtic artwork which can be viewed as a king's tour with your kind of nowadays lens what do you think's more awesome nights tours or kings tours cuz the knights tours to me seem more wow the king's tours like look nice but they don't seem as like dramatic yeah okay so nights tours nights tours have to win it out because when you're drawing a night's tour i i just love drawing these things if if you've not seen h things that i do before but i i obsessively draw things that take way too long to draw things that normal people would generate on a computer or use a printer like i'll draw it and when you're drawing a nights tour there's two angles that you can make and in my head i always think of them as like throwing out a wide arc or a a more thin arc and they're really pleasing to draw so yeah definitely the nights tour has to win it out but the king tour has a beautiful closed set of eight by8 that does work they're bi ay symmetric and there's more magic kings tours than this these are just the ones that i've picked out because they're nice and symmetric and that's what everyone likes artwise so in conclusion both of them are good but yeah come on the next tour has got to win it so yeah mathematicians when you find out that you can't do an 8 by8 magic knights tours you've got these other routes that you can go down you can do an 8 by8 kings tour or you could do a much larger nights tour do you think they stopped there nope no mathematicians are unstoppable so now we've got things like h you can have three i think there's a 16x 16 threedimensional magic nights tour there's teral magic nights tours on like you know go one side come in the other it really is a rabbit hole that you can tumble down and you should [music] if this video does make it to being a video just know that a guy called pete did a lot of work because i am not going to draw all of these nights tours after 2016 steps it must it it gets stuck it cannot move every square of every one of the eight squares around it that it could move to it's already been to so it the sequence dies at that point after 2016 steps and the last number that it reaches is 284 and i have in my notebook here a picture of the spiral
