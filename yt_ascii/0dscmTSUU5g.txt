ladies and gentlemen welcome back to norway chess 2023 this is a super tournament with a very unique format where every player goes head to head and they compete for three points per game if the game ends in a draw they go to an armageddon format and they compete for a little bit less by the way we're back on the main setup no longer on the hostage setup hopefully you enjoyed the recap today's recap features a handful of things it features a fantastic game by hikaru it features a game by magnus carlsen that was deemed 2350 elo according to chess.com game review and two other absolutely sensational games i'm gonna show you some games i will show you the standings welcome back to gotham chess recaps welcome back to the studio setup the very first game that i have for you is none other than ali reza ferrugo versus shakuria mamidyarav and this one we are gonna get started with a banger we are going to have bangers in the middle and we will bang until the very end this entire video is going to be a banger the game begins with ponte or we have d5 let me return on p sounds c4 and now pawn takes c4 this is called the queen's gambit accepted and generally not a good opening for intermediate players because you're surrendering too much control of the center but chakra is hardly an intermediate player and he responds with the most principled response which is giving up a pawn back in the center now it looks like this is a free pawn but taking is not very good white loses the right to castle and white's pawns in the center are actually bigger liabilities than their assets knight to f3 is played instead bishop b4 check is a line knight c3 and now knight f6 you'll notice that the staring contest continues because nobody really wants to help the other person develop knight takes e5 and now mohammediara plays the move b5 mamidyarev has given up the pawn in the center but he has safely secured the pawns over here meanwhile fioruja is building up a very very powerful diagonal on this side castles a3 the bishop slides backwards alireza tries to attack the integrity of that structure and black plays a6 you will notice both sides have played nine moves both sides have not thought whatsoever because they know what they're doing they know that all the moves that they have played have either been played before by players or computers and they have worked this out in some capacity ali reza now plays the move bishop to e2 that was played after six minutes of thought which means he is now no longer in his preparation mamid yarov spends 13 minutes which means that he probably got locked in the bathroom for 12 and a half and then made it back to the board no both players are now comfortably thinking on their own bishop b2 i don't have to explain to you this move i might black does not develop anything on the queen side and instead tries to remove the knight from e5 and also wants to play c5 in the future and is trying to maintain the c6 square for that night now alireza doesn't castle and plays bishop e3 his intention is to do something like this where his bishops will laser beam the queen side and make it quite difficult for make it quite difficult for from for mommy jarov to move you know i just i noticed i i don't it because of this new setup i don't know if i'm kind of looking in the same direction that i always have been i feel like generally i'm kind of looking i don't know anyway i'll play around with it if i'm looking in the wrong direction please let me know i feel like normally i'm looking this way unless i'm going crazy i have to re-watch some of my videos this is very funny let me know in the comments if i'm looking in the wrong direction then i'll put the board on this side that's very very humorous we have c6 though we don't have the move knight take c5 played we have c6 knight takes knight takes and still all of these possibilities exist in the position castles bishop b7 and now queen e1 the center is very big the queen is rotating over to this side of the board with some attacking possibilities plays the move f5 the position i mean it's it's it's already complete insanity on the board black can play b4 black intake black can take this black can move the queen in any of these directions but i can move the queen there black and put the bishop here black and put the rooks on any of those squares so many possibilities which is why alireza thinks for eight minutes and decides to capture inducing the rook to come forward and plays bishop d1 with the intention to play bishop c2 and go over here my mediaf preemptively moves back with the rook queen goes to g3 lining up not just on this diagonal but also on the straightaway to the black king we have knight f6 knight d5 queen b6 and the pressure is mounting on the white position my major has done a very nice job despite being down 20 minutes on the clock and now we have queen h4 bishop d2 and as you can see the computer is actually heavily heavily preferring white's position at black's position and things after something like b4 black has very very strong pawns and the position for white is very difficult but my major chooses not to do that bishop g6 and now bishop back to b1 and and after this all the rest it doesn't take and again b4 is coming at some moment my major decides to capture like this knight goes to f4 pressure on e2 pressure on g2 rook g6 possibilities in the future c5 is coming by the way at a moment's notice and the white position is under heavy existential threat computer of course doesn't prefer c5 the computer prefer the black plays queen d8 which i can't really explain to you but i think it's g5 yeah but the computer wanted that my major plays the human move and bulldozes his way into g2 and at this point for rouge's position is looking quite dire okay we have d take c5 queen to c6 bishop d4 and things are just not looking very good if you're farugia but all of a sudden but all of a sudden but all of them wait a minute who's actually losing here because if you go back a few moves my major have looked like you know every one of his pieces was about to participate in the absolute bludgeoning of the white position and within a few moves i think he drastically underestimated the resilience of ferrugia's position and all of a sudden farush is winning all of my mediaf's pieces like the knight is hanging the queen is hanging in the bishop and now the root the bishop rook is hanging over there and now this rook sacrifices itself and ferocious just takes the other rook i mean farouza got who doesn't care rookie three rook d1 rook f3 and farusha just escapes rook f1 check looks like it's checkmate but rook f1 back is check which is why after 40 moves black resigned as after king g2 it's game over for black just something like rook g2 or queen c7 my major if could have played on i think but he either lost on time in this position or he decided that he had had enough and he just resigns and farouja wins a very complicated back and forth game but you haven't seen nothing yet i'm about to serve you this is one of the most insane games of chess i've ever seen and then we still haven't even looked at hikaru's game and we still haven't looked at magnus carlson getting called you know getting called a low elo player by by chess.com's game review and for some reason it doesn't even have timestamps so that's great i think maybe the timestamps never carried over from the armageddon game but it's okay we will take a look if necessary e4 bytari this one is a rosalimo sicilian d6 castles bishop d7 and it was in this position that tari went back to f1 after just playing rookie one it's a very close position so what the story when he wants to play c3 and d4 and he wants to be in good shape which is why in this position it was extremely extremely wild that knows your back abdul sotorov played rook g8 rook g8 with the intention of playing g okay well at least he got tari to commit his deep on but folks it got real it got real crazy real fast because in this position my man arientari played b4 which is a move that is protected two different times but the point is that you are sacrificing upon in order to win time on this side of the board and not just time the idea is to win development bishop takes or knight takes are good you could even not take with anything you could go d4 e5 and basically just completely ignore the pawn on a3 no dear back does not take the pawn he tries to sacrifice the pawn which is why tari plays c4 and tries to win the pawn back with his queen while maintaining a clamp on the center both guys in prep g5 queen b3 g4 pawn takes knight takes now judging from tari just spending 30 minutes on the move d4 you would think that he expected something else and he did go to the confessional booth they have this really cool thing at norway chess where the players can talk to a camera in between rounds and confess things like you know this is my prep or i i don't really like my position or i shower with my socks on or whatever grandmasters confess to i think tari was only anticipating bishop takes g4 knight takes g4 now d4 and basically this is tari's game plan tari's game plan is me push me push me take me take me take me take me get king queen a5 queen a5 has eyes on the rook and also wants to play queen h5 with various pressure on the h2 square tari just developed knight c3 you will notice that ari andari spent 50 minutes on the neck on these two moves that's not going to work in the long run but for now it does bishop g7 and aryan strikes forward with e5 a computer absolutely gushing over tari's position really really likes it thinks it's really good and yeah i mean it's it's quite convinced by the position d takes an atari plays bishop d2 which is something we call a little zwichenzook he wants to play knight d5 on the next move and after knight d5 and forcing the queen all the way back he wants to continue the hey you know queen b7 all this good stuff bishop before i gotta get a new mouse queen d8 is played by noiserback and d5 and i mean my man aryan is just like galloping forward his position looks absolutely sensational i gotta tell you this this is really looking bad for nodier back whose king is in the center of the board he now has to move his bishop there to arbitrarily block this but now we just have f4 so the bishop is going to get sent packing anyway bishop h8 bro like unironically bishop e5 inducing f4 this man just put his bishop in the corner and his rook like this looks like fish are random i don't know what we're playing meanwhile tari plays c5 tari just confidently marching forward now king f8 sidestepping off the e file this is ridiculous what are we even analyzing here this doesn't even look like a real position i mean this looks like an insult aryan plays rook c1 and rook c1 is not a good move i mean i don't understand something about chess you've moved every piece what are you supposed to do apparently you're supposed to play rook a b1 that is what the computer wanted well here's what the thing is about this position it's actually shockingly difficult to make forward progress so he goes here d3 now which can be taken two different ways but the bishop is trying to go to d4 and if you take it with the queen now bishop b5 comes in so bishop c3 antari just goes c6 i mean he's all in apparently e6 was an inaccuracy take take queen h4 looks mildly unpleasant and tari's winning tari is completely winning here with a sensational defensive measure in this position black is threatening made in one one of the ways to escape maiden one is to take this pawn and run the king but there is a completely winning sequence in this position that uses offense to play defense in the words of espn commentator mark jackson good defense better offense mama there goes that man and among other things what happened to the game i love well in this position white can play check to the black king check to the black king and g3 and mate is covered by the queen it's ridiculous check check g3 however that does not happen and instead of that aryantari goes here and takes here's the problem now his king is going to get hunted now his king's going for a little walk little walk all right he takes d5 queen e5 he comes into d7 but not your back meets him right there and it moves later nordeback is gonna get that knight back and now folks we are in an end game and when the dust has settled it's black who is up material knight e5 and he's two pawns up no tearback played one of the most ridiculous defensive games i have ever seen i've never seen something like this this dude has king f8 rook g8 bishop h8 when he plays like that he's a defensive specialist when i play like that i'm an idiot right when i play king f8 rook jade bishop i'm stupid when he does it he's a defensive savant queen h4 aryan misses a ridiculous geometric resource and all of a sudden everything's said and done he's down two pawns in an end game this is heartbreaking because aryan played a really really fascinating opening idea and then it just didn't work it just didn't work so that's how it goes sometimes thus saddles no your back is up two pawns and he very confidently very methodically brings the rooks down to the first rank and tari's got nothing here as his king is boxed in made us coming on h2 and that's the end of the game it do be that way sometimes sometimes there's nothing you can do meanwhile hikaru was the car was putting in work hikaru was playing against he played a taraj defense which i've never i mean i'm sure he's played it but he hasn't played it recently and we had a totally symmetrical position from gukesh who played the move a3 there's a little bit of pawn capturing bishop's sliding back to d3 and the position became an isolated pawn position early or a move like knight takes d4 does not work because a little tactical skirmish discover check and rook on d4 would be hanging so that doesn't work out all right so he takes d4 bishop to e7 and in this position white is going to be happy if white is able to utilize the pawn as a shield and play around it creating problems for black black is going to be happy blockading the pawn trading down the pieces and winning an end game alright white likes dynamics so white trades the knights puts pressure the bishop is going to come out and the rook is going to put some pressure here and maybe d5 hikaru in the meantime is going to look for exchanges he's going to look to trade the bishops okay he's going to look to trade the queens just very arbitrarily alright something like this look at how much this trade benefits black knight goes to b3 rooks come down white is losing a massive chunk of advantage by trading pieces so hikaru plays knight a5 rook c1 and queen back to b8 bishop d5 and queen b7 he's created a blockade around the isolated pawn right very sophisticated stuff here now obviously there's more to it than that there are more in-depth continuations there's you know lines that you've got to calculate it's it's it's it's not that straightforward bishop d3 played and in this position hikaru played one of the most controversial moves i have ever seen and i don't say that lightly hikaru here could have played knight b3 and forked the rooks and we would have had a very crazy forcing sequence like bishop h7 and queen h5 and rook d4 but instead of that hikaru played the move f5 i feel like the move f5 would have made some grand masters of the past gag because that move is a very very very aggressive pawn thrust that completely sabotages the dark squares like white will now live on the dark squares forever but for that you completely negate this attack you also create a very powerful light squared stronghold and you never have to worry about being mated and now you can begin operating on the other side of the board f5 is potentially a disastrous anti-positional move but it could potentially be a brilliant dynamic move so we have knight f3 and rookie one all right and kikoru is doing what he's supposed to do he's rerouting he's putting pressure on the isolated pawn queen e5 and rook cia and so far kikaru's game plan has worked gukashes has not so much one rook trade down the maneuvering continues all right queen d7 now here comes go cash it's very clear what gukash wants all right very clear he's trying to checkmate hikaru in the meanwhile trading pieces he knows that the end games benefit him not just because of the pawn because now of the bishop pair all right we need five it's still very clear what gukesh would like to achieve hikaru is just trying to trade the pieces down like hikaru has a very methodical approach use potentially anti-positional measures to suppress the play of white trade pieces down pawns are going to be a weakness in the end game lucas has no trade hikaru says okay a5 now that pawn is a permanent target that pawn is a target and that pawn is a target says all right bishop b5 and a few moves later knight f4 but hikaru picks up a pawn queen d2 but should be five hikaru is in good shape he's in cruise control here right the pressure is being applied there's a squeeze happening bishop d4 but in this position the computer gives an utterly ridiculous defensive countermeasure which would have been bishop f1 a backwards bishop move that would have pinned the bishop to the rook and if you take there would have been rook d8 and checkmate to follow but gukesh misses it bishop e2 played we need four and it's just a matter of time as hikaru is up upon in an end game but it's more than a pawn it's more than a pawn it's the entirety of the queen side basically as hikaru is going to get down there put pressure and the majority of pawns is going to prove decisive he advances and in this position gukesh resigned as he cannot sustain anymore he cannot sustain g4 is hanging the queen side is always falling white's position is stretched too thin to sufficiently defend everything so after g4 bishop e6 kukesh resigned and hikaru won a very very very nice game with black a very nice game with black there was one weird computer hiccup but overall this was a fantastic game and really the question is is f5 a work of art madness genius everything i mean is it deviants f5 is a ridiculous anti-positional move it's it's definitely an option but like i said i feel like soviet grandmasters if you told them to move f5 they would projectile vomit all over you and they wouldn't even clean it so fantastic stuff now magnus drew his game in classical so they had to go to an armageddon he and wesley the time was not a massive factor so we're gonna look at this game and okay i guess chess.com did not copy over the timestamps if you give me like 30 seconds i'm i'm gonna see maybe maybe i can pull up the timestamps but if i if if i pull them up then there's a chance that there's not going to be all right well you know what we'll have time stamps but we won't have we won't have the players won't have like images and stuff i'll get you time stamps there's the timestamps i do apologize for i don't know how that happened but sometimes when you watch a game and you haven't refreshed the timestamps don't load anyway magnus has white e4 e5 we have a berlin no berlin and remember black has three minutes less but black starts with three minutes less because if black makes a draw black wins bishop c5 and from an early standpoint magnus was playing quickly confidently and aggressively knight bd2 wesley started pushing him backwards and actually wesley got the upper hand from the opening the computer really liked his position but magnus is maintaining a two and a half minute time advantage which is really no joke wesley plays pawn takes d4 c takes d4 and clearly it is wesley right now who is calling the shots i mean he is i mean it looks like magnus is playing with his shoe size together which i gotta tell you i don't think it's the biggest deal in the world for a chess player to tie their shoes together because you play chess seated and chess players don't move around a whole lot queen a4 bishop takes f3 knight takes f3 magnus has sacrificed the rook bishop takes e1 and he's done it to get into a7 magnus just sacrificed the rook to get a pawn now the bishop doesn't have just so we're clear the bishop doesn't have enough time to run away because knight e5 and mate so black would have to sack the queen so queen a7 queen b4 rookie one but knight takes g3 h takes g3 i mean magnus is just down in exchange but what does magna send these up two minutes he's up two minutes on the clock that goes a long way all right queen back to b6 of course wesley knows that this end game is not something that magnus is interested in he doesn't have enough artillery so he plays queen b6 but in this position apparently wesley could have just ran if check king e7 that's it that's the whole attack and then if you try to defend yourself on d1 i'll trap your queen you can go here and you can check me but i'm gonna run to g7 so yeah wesley plays queen b6 magnus of course gives a check and runs away no queen trade f6 and magnus just keeps going d5 just d5 again maintaining a two and a half minute time advantage which is almost the full allotted time of the armageddon bonus king c8 back now pawn to e5 all right and here comes downhill magnus not even you know no hesitation whatsoever two and a half minutes up it's armageddon you gotta win with white wesley plays king to b8 pressure you know heartbeat elevating pawn takes f6 pass pawn and also knight e5 knight f7 opportunities wesley plays c takes d5 which is the best movement now f7 hello hello i'm not just attacking you on the queen side i'm also knocking on the door and my pawn is an anchor from my rook that's gonna go to e8 and threaten promotion queen f6 that's great 95 i'm defending my pawn i have knight d7 ideas this is very unpleasant for black who is now down a whopping nearly three minutes on the clock the entire amount of time that you are given for a time advantage for white and they are getting rookie three oh oh it's checkmate coming what is wesley gonna do is he gonna panic is he gonna play c5 c5 for k3 there's no checkmate the king is going to c7 you can give me a check all you want i'm running away so c5 is the move but wesley decides i'm going to sacrifice my rook back magnus uninterested uninterested in collecting the night the rook for the night c6 magnus says queen a7 king c7 rook b3 hello hello you can play defense watch this i'm zipping right back rook f3 now if you take rook f7 king d8 i am not interested in this i am interested in this and black is going to lose the rook you see in this position if black played any other move he would have lost the rook so magnus utilized two infiltration spots a8 and e8 to cause head spinning complications here and this looks like it was a very clean game of chess the computer hated it though the computer thought foreign stockfish after this game thought magnus was 23.50 and black was 2 000. which just goes to show you that armageddon causes these players to play at a level below their actual ability which is not really fair to them but that's just unfortunately how it goes so let's check the standings shall we standings after day two after round two of norway chess here they are this is this is not a very pretty website but there you go and it's currently i think hold on a minute i i think that this one is cleaner that no both bad all right i gotta crop it anyway maybe this one maybe this one nope all bad all right fabiano caruana in first place with with four and a half if i'll be winning in armageddon and also winning in classical no dear back has four this doesn't really matter we're only two rounds out of nine into it but these are your standings aryan chakra magnus wesley these are players that have scored points in an armageddon hikaru is doing quite well he has four one win in the in a classical and a loss in armageddon so four points anyway if you're confused about any of this norway chess uh.com or dot no dot no see you the next video get out of here
