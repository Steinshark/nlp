hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by mobil1 we're going to get a behind-the-scenes look at engine oil development and testing i think it's very difficult to appreciate just how much continuous development and validation is going into that bottle of oil sitting on the parts store shelf and how well engineered these modern oils are i was provided access to engineers and allowed to peek behind the curtain of testing involved for mobile one's latest formula which seeks to improve performance protection and cleanliness the best modern engine oils undergo extensive validation testing so in this video we're going to cover three critical tests for evaluating oil performance these three tests include a sludge test an oil viscosity resilience test and a 120 000 mile test with extended drain intervals complete with a full engine teardown to understand the effectiveness of an oil first up sequence 5h which is a fascinating test that seeks to operate an engine under terrible conditions in order to create significant amounts of sludge this standardized test uses a ford 4.6 liter v8 but it's modified to make the test rather abusive to start things off the fuel used is an especially dirty fuel it's not the clean stuff you're used to from the pump this fuel contains sludge precursors in it designed to help gunk up the engine oil so how does that fuel get into the oil well part of this is accomplished by running the engine cold and rich which makes complete combustion a challenge this is a 216 hour test which continuously cycles through three different stages two of those stages include dramatically reduced oil and coolant temperatures by using a water cooled rocker cover as well as a water cooled exhaust as you can see this engine is running and has been running for hours and yet i'm able to touch both the rocker cover as well as the exhaust this is something you should absolutely never do on your own car as you'll severely burn yourself oil and coolant temperatures are kept as low as 45 degrees celsius making it more difficult for the fuel to fully vaporize when injected on top of this the engine runs rich during one of the cycled stages using an air fuel ratio of about 11 to 1 meaning you're injecting about 33 percent more fuel than needed which can't be burned because there isn't enough oxygen and as if that isn't enough the piston ring gaps are increased to dramatically increase the amount of blow by occurring meaning the contents from combustion are pushed past the pistons and into the crankcase what does all of this mean a lot of fuel ends up in the engine oil in fact during the test fuel makes up 12 to 15 percent of the circulating engine oil in a normal engine you want this number to be zero but the terrible operating conditions here force really heavy fuel dilution which ultimately can lead to serious problems for your engine including sludge so what are the requirements to pass this test well after the test is complete the engine is torn down to examine the rocker arm covers baffles timing chain cover oil pan and baffles and valve decks all parts are rated using an industry standardized system with a 1 to 10 scale and there are minimum requirements for both sludge and varnish to pass the test here's an example of a piston which has failed the test you'll notice the dark third ring length and significant varnish on the piston side skirt and here's an example of a piston which has passed the test you'll notice a mostly clean third ring land and minimal varnish on the piston skirt of course on both pistons you'll commonly see heavy deposits on the piston crown and top ring lands as a result of the poor quality fuel used and significant blow-by how do you know if an oil has passed this latest test you'll want to see an api sp or ilsac gf6 certification and if you see gm's dexos gen 3 it has passed this test with even higher margins and mobile one has their own internal testing requirements in addition to these certifications to ensure they're exceeding the standard labels next we get to the sequence 3h engine test which looks at how much the oil thickens as well as piston deposits accumulated while operating the engine under extended severe conditions for this test a chrysler 3.6 liter v6 engine is used the engine operates at a constant high load with the engine held at 3 900 rpm the oil temperature held at a very high 151 degrees celsius and it's producing a constant 137 horsepower you might think 137 horsepower doesn't sound very high but in reality it is especially when we're talking about a constant load held for 90 hours when your car is driving down the highway it's likely only making around 20 to 30 horsepower so we're talking about a load around five times that constantly for 90 hours the only interruptions that are occur are at 20 hour intervals to check the level of the engine oil and again a special fuel is used that's significantly tougher on your engine than what you'd find at the pump so what are the requirements to pass this test starting with the oil's viscosity it cannot increase by more than 100 percent basically what this means is the oil cannot double in thickness during the test this is a significant change versus the previous industry limit of 150 increase in viscosity from ilsec gf5 and api sn plus ratings yet mobile one claims their product way outperforms here exceeding the industry requirement by 10 times in the case of standard mobile one or less than a 10 percent increase in viscosity or 20 times in the case of mobile one extended performance or less than a 5 increase in viscosity in addition to viscosity piston deposits are analyzed there are two requirements here no hot stuck rings meaning at operating temperatures the piston rings must be able to move around as they normally do and the average piston deposits must have a minimum rating of 4.2 again on an industry standardized scale out of 10. here's an example of a piston which has failed the test you'll notice heavy black deposits on the third ring land with visible raised texture you'll also notice significant varnish in the third ring groove and here's an example of a piston which has passed the test you'll notice significantly less deposits on the third ring land and nearly perfect with minimal varnish within the third ring groove and again to know if an oil you see on the parts store shelf has passed this test you're looking for api sp and ilsac gf6 certifications gm's dexos gen 3 runs a similar test using a v8 ls engine with tighter requirements for both viscosity increases as well as piston deposits certifying the oil is even better suited for high temperature performance finally we get to mileage accumulation dynamometers testing or mads testing in this case a 2019 toyota rav4 was selected for a 120 000 mile test the rav4 with its 2.5 liter engine featuring both direct and port fuel injection was selected because it's one of the most popular vehicles sold in america and representative of what many people are driving of course they've run similar tests with all kinds of different vehicles whether that be suvs with small direct injection turbocharged engines or trucks with large naturally aspirated engines to ensure their product is effective among the wide variety of options available for their latest test the rav4 covered 120 000 miles on a dynamometer this dynamometer can change the load the vehicle experiences simulating various driving scenarios so the vehicle repeats a drive cycle that alternates between city driving highway driving towing a trailer and driving up a grade the first oil change occurs at twenty thousand miles significantly longer than toyota's recommended oil drain interval of 10 000 miles for regular use or 5 000 miles for towing use of which a significant portion of this test simulates so the test at minimum is doubling the distance oil is used and that's just for the first oil change the remaining three oil changes are at intervals greater than 20 000 miles until it finally reaches 120 000 miles now it's worth mentioning mobile one guarantees their standard product for a 10 000 mile drain interval or one year and their extended performance product for 20 000 miles or one year this test is intentionally going beyond these guaranteed oil drain intervals to make the test more difficult now there's two critical parts of this test i want to go over monitoring during the test and then the engine tear down after the test as the test is running fuel flow rate is monitored for example a portion of the test sees the rav4 holding 65 miles per hour on the highway and that requires a certain amount of power which requires a certain amount of fuel by monitoring the fuel flow rate you can monitor the vehicle's efficiency of power production if an oil starts to break down say after 20 000 miles of driving you'll notice the fuel flow rate increases because the thicker oil will reduce the engine's efficiency mobil one was able to verify consistent fuel flow rates indicating the oil's ability to maintain the engine's power output oil samples are of course analyzed throughout the mileage as well assessing for wear metals viscosity changes and oxidation but most importantly is the engine tear down here's where you really get to see how the engine held up the whole thing is torn apart and everything is evaluated using a numerical scale to determine the levels of sludge and varnish as well as hard measurements to evaluate where the process is pretty fascinating a technician who is certified in rating sludge and varnish looks at each individual part and rates them providing an average score for each part on a scale from 1 to 10. this might sound subjective and arbitrary since it's a person rating the parts but it's actually a standardized procedure for which there are only 13 total people certified in the country and they have to re-certify every year to make these evaluations let's walk through some of the results some parts were actually evaluated before and after the 120 000 mile test if they didn't require an extensive engine teardown such as the top valve deck the valve cover the oil pan and the bottom deck evaluating these parts isn't invasive thus keeping the engine in its original manufactured condition the parts were scored after an engine break-in setting the baseline and then after an additional 120 000 miles all of the parts started off well above nine again not a perfect score because the initial measurement was after break-in and all of the parts ended up just slightly lower though still well above a nine rating i asked the technician at what rating you start to get worried about the engine and oil used and he said anything 7 or lower so there's a healthy margin here they also measured the main bearings rod bearings and camshafts for wear and here's where the results are extremely impressive all of the engine parts were still within manufacture tolerances for brand new parts in other words these parts had no meaningful wear and could theoretically be acceptable to use in a brand new engine another fascinating thing to look at here are the intake valves because this engine does use direct injection however it's toyota's d4s injection system which means it uses port injectors as well carbon buildup is a common problem with direct injection engines but as you can see toyota's clever system has kept the intake valves extremely clean i asked the certified raider for a quick rough evaluation of the intake valve and he claimed it'd probably fall in the 9.8 to 9.9 range out of 10. and again this is after 120 000 miles to give you context here are the intake valves on my naturally aspirated 2.0 liter engine with direct injection with less than 35 000 miles on it less than a third of the miles and look how much carbon is already on the intake valves it's pretty impressive how effective toyota's system is so this has been a glimpse into just a few out of the many many tests a modern engine oil undergoes in order to achieve the proper certifications you'll find on the back of the bottle a huge thank you to mobil1 for providing so much time with their engineers and getting me behind the scenes as always if you have any questions or comments feel free to
