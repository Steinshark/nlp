hello everyone and welcome and i'm james not yet we will get to that you are watching two jason's one car i'm jason and i'm james okay nailed it so speaking of throttle house though on our last video together that we did on the lucid somebody wrote i love throttle house but they'd be pretty nervous if the two jasons were a regular combo lol well don't be ridiculous it's not like you can film or edit or have any style as if you do your own editing okay the jason eh wait till they meet knife gun okay i'm i'm thinking this is gun knife this is going to be a oh yeah see what you're saying yeah getting across the border is going to be pretty hard getting across the border yes that is going to be hard yeah [applause] yeah i want it i so we are sitting inside of the 911 st what is the what's the deal with st what does that what does that mean it means jason can afford it he wants it st i i like that they call this st because this is the new 911r and andy prer who is the sort of god of gt cars at porsche told me once he's never going to use 911r again he's going to pull historical names and use them once because he doesn't want to piss off the people who bought a 91r so st is another historical name and it was basically a package that you could get that combined all the s stuff which is all the sports package stuff effectively with all the te stuff which was the base model stuff for lightweight so think of it as the lightweight special yeah so you can buy a porsche 911s you can buy the 911t well what if you combine the two and essentially if the gt3 rs is the most tracko friendly 911 that exists well then this is the most road goinging 911 that exists like as endearing to an enthusiast as you could possibly make a 911 for the road which means a 9,000 rpm naturally aspirated independent throttle body flat 6 and a manual only yes so you've got 518 horsepower same as the gt3 rs this is the same engine as the g t3 rs which has those updated cam shafts for slightly more power which you can feel right there it is pretty noisy in here i mean you hear all of the mechanical everything happening which is exciting i mean this is the lightest 992 that exists they've done a ton of work in pulling out weight and as a result yeah sound deadening is part of that yeah you unlike almost all modern cars where you're only treated to select frequencies of of of exhaust and then what the speakers are playing this is raw actual mechanical noise you hear intake exhaust engine mechanical noise but then gearrain noise you hear lash at low rpm you hear the throwout bearing squealing if you start to rev you hear the pressure plate rattling it's nuts nuts you hear everything so as far as some of the things that they've done to pull out weight there is extensive use of c rp carbon fiber reinforced plastic which maybe sounds you know sad when when you hear the word plastic porche does use the word plastic though some companies will say polymer to try and make it sound fancier than it is i mean it's fancy stuff and it's expensive stuff so it's cool use but the roof the hood the front fenders the doors carbon fiber reinforced plastic so they've taken out significant amount of weight there the seats have pulled out weight the largest factor of which they've pulled out weight do you know what it is the clutch not the clutch actually the wheels are magnesium so clutch is second yes the most weight has been pulled out thanks to using magnesium wheels they also have a lightweight single mass flywheel and clutch that pulled out 22 lb alone 22 think about that just in the clutch and flywheel so the revving is like it's it's hard to describe like when people say that modern manual transmissions are no good because of things like rev hang and you know the there's emissions compliant that's come in and that is the reason why the car's transmission is no good it's like here's an example right here a modern car and you cannot react quick enough for these downshifts or upshifts like either way you go the revs drop the second you push in that clutch very quickly and then the other direction you just give it a tiny bit of throttle just 10% i mean it's it's unreasonable how quick for those who can't see the t those blips were 3500 4,000 to 9,000 and back this is carrera gt levels you know that car was famously a v10 with with basically no flywheel and this is as blippy as a cgt yeah it's nuts okay so what i want to ask is when you get in a car and you're and a car is obviously that is oriented for sporty driving on roads what are the things that you are looking for there there are this from the engineering perspective what i'm looking for is a car that does exactly what i ask of it because what happens is you wind up not having to drive around peculiarities and remap your control inputs for some nonlinear way so the car just goes away and shrinks around you and becomes effectively like a hulk suit right it's just you're just you feel like you're you only stronger and faster in making more flat six noises yes and so i think part of that is like you want the car to do exactly what you ask of it and then the second part of that is when you ask it to do it and in the measure you've asked it to do so right and so there is this delay that is very typical of modern cars where you ask it to do something you wait for it to happen and it happens and eventually like you say you adjust your brain to that delay and that sucks because you become less connected to it right this and i think i think like just as well like it's hard for me to distinguish between this and an electric car in like responsiveness of throttle like the if i go to a proper gear where we can actually get some it's absurd how quick it goes from zero to nothing and there's a lot of work that goes into that response so with an electric car response is a choice right it's it's up to the software team how do you want to tune that motor because mean mechanically it's all very possible with combustion engines it's a bit of both everything's you know fly by wire these days all throttles are electronic so there is that choice but if you just open the throttle you still have delays to wait for with combustion engines that you don't have to worry about with electric cars right now here those delays are gone gone and it's like how do they do this so one of the things i think is really cool if you look inside this engine there are nine butterfly a typical engine is going to have one so why are there nine do you know what all nine are for well six of them are directly into the individual throttle runners so six individual thrott and then the other ones are lengthening and shortening the effective length of the manifold the manifold and taking advantage of residences close so i actually had this discussion with the performance engineer cheat last night i did cheat but i want to provide real in my videos in of just winging it so there are six there are six oh it doesn't want to close now sorry sorry we've upset the p there are six individual throttle bodies then there's two in the intake manifold and that as you mentioned is for adjusting how those pressure waves bounce around and ensuring across a wide rev range you have good torque which this does have and actually i don't know of a car with a higher torque per liter than this today as far as naturally aspirated engines 458 had it beat back in the day but not sold today i think this is the highest so that's okay two in the intake we still have one more so there is one main throttle body and this was the one that was confusing to me because it's like why is that there because the advantage of individual throttle bodies is that you bring atmospheric pressure as close to the cylinder as possible so that when you do put your foot down you get that torque immediately and you don't have to wait for all of that pressure to fill the entire intake manifold then go through the runners then make it to the cylinders it's just going from those runners into the cylinder very short distance you have one main throttle body that is purely there for safety it serves no real purpose in normal driving if everything's going good the thing is open always always okay that sounds fully unnecessary and wasteful so actually and it's not that new of an idea cuz i was thinking about this bmw does the same thing so they use valvetronic which is their system of adjusting how much does the valve open in order to regulate how much air goes in the cylinder they also have one main throttle body and it's pretty much always open unless something were to fail i asked the engineer i was like so tell me a situation in which you close this man throttle body and he was like i don't know well then don't put it in i here's my scenario that i thought of in my head that i don't know if it's real or not let's say you forgot to put your engine filter on a rock makes its way past okay it goes into your intake and then it gets lodged in one of your itbs so now your itb can't close stuck open so your itb is stuck open your throttle says i'm off throttle so your throttle individual throttle should read i'm at zero but it won't because that rock has it stuck open so now because your command is zero the main throttle can go uhoh we have a fault because something is saying what the driver is not asking for so we will close the main throttle and you have a a safer situation then you go and you pull the rock out that's the only thing i can come up well you can also but in that situation the computer could also start to cut fuel and spark like it does with a limiter or traction control or anything else the only scenario i can think of actually is a a runaway dieseling situation where you have a ring blow you have oil that's being sucked in or even worse you flooded the engine you have a a ton of fuel in the oil which then comes through positive crank case ventilation and you have a car that runs that's like an extraordinary amount of oil well but fuel actually fuel vapor will a car can run on fuel vapor that has made it past a broken ring so you could do that and that's a way to shut it down but you could also just shut the par f up so i i think that's i'm going to have a word with a manager this is two karens one car i want to talk to the manager so that is purely just the the air side of things right that's just what's coming into the engine and how do i make response very quick so it makes sense from the engine standpoint then there's all of the components that you have to rotate so anything that you have to rotate means additional energy is spent towards moving forward so you have to move the car forward but you also have to spin up all these things to move the car forward right so for example titanium connecting rods if you go to the clutch like we talked about lighter flywheel lighter clutch if you go further back from that you've got carbon ceramic brakes you've got magnesium wheels so every step of the way from the engine to the tire you're looking at all these things that are pulling out mass and so that means every time you know you go down there's very little mass that has to be accelerated so the response is so much better it's just like a really cool like check all the boxes kind of approach where you look at every little detail along the way and say how do i make this respond as fast as i possibly can and that is absolutely like my biggest joy or my the biggest thing that frustrates me is when i get in a car and the throttle pedal doesn't do what i want it to do and this is a car where it's just like syned with your brain and it is perfection all of it the throttle the clutch the the everything is perfectly sned and to answer the second part of your question about what am i looking for in a driver's car it's exactly this right in terms of what everything you've just said plus an experience and this thing is i mean i hate to say it it's the best sports car in the world that's what i think no i truly do think like i am not this was not rehearsed yeah it wasn't and and i am not the type of person that's like i don't know what you you call but like a track fanatic like i don't need to spend all day on the track i like cars that are fun on the road and most people that are car enthusiasts do most of their driving on the road and if it is a road-going car like it's a production car it's like well it ultimately is designed for the road right so that to me is like so what is the best of that and i land here like it does everything you ask of it so well the response is insane it sounds crazy i mean it revs to 9,000 it's like so many elements that you want it just does perfectly yeah and i mean the the crazy thing is porsche didn't put us on a racetrack and obviously the first thing i want to do in any 911 is go on a racetrack and slide it around drift it through all the corners but we made it maybe 2 miles and i was like i'm done i know already 3 whatever $30,000 what and you can't get one unless you you know do horrible things to the it doesn't matter this is one of the very very few rare modern cars that are a spectacle and a whole experience just driving out of the parking lot of a hotel and 2 miles down a back road you're like okay do do you need to slide it around no but i do i want to of course but i would have it just for the experience of being in this thing and listening to that noise and dealing with that clutch yes and we were chatting as we were just going along and you were kind of giving it you know 30% and you were having a blast and i was like that is like the sign of a good car when you don't have to be at 1010 and you're still smiling like that is miata to me like people are like oh miata you have to ring it out it's like no you can you can really have fun in miata at any speed and this has that mentality of like whatever you're doing you're going to enjoy it like it's so responsive everything is so well connected predictable but yet like with some tenacity that it is so enjoyable clarity of purpose this car like all the other gt car divisions from gt division cars from porsche has a very clear mission the people who are doing this know exactly what they wanted and no one was standing in their way like there's no one going well i think that's a little loud or maybe it shouldn't ride so stiff whatever there's no freaking bean counter in there look not into to his compromised to begin with this interior is plasticy and rattles but you take the car and clearly the guys at the gt department were like we know exactly what we want to make out of this car and they did it [music] yes all right let's talk a little bit about gearing so whenever i get an a manual porsche pretty much the first thing that always comes to mind is oh i love this i love a good manual i like driving porsche but but i wish it had shorter gearing i wish it had more aggressive gearing pretty much every porsche i ever get in i don't know if you feel similarly 100% first and so as this is the most road-going enthusiast 911 ever they have shortened the gearing by way of the final drive ratio so thank you porsche i feel like i've said it in every video you've probably said it in every video probably everybody said it in every video like hey it'd be cool if it had shorter gearing so it does it's about 8% so it goes from a 3 96 to a 4.3 final drive you've got the same gear ratios but with that shorter final drive so i think that helps would i do more yeah i'd still go more aggressive because it's like okay it's limited to'6 i'm not going to go'6 in it and maybe leave the sixth gear to go'6 i'm fine with that but 1 through five could all be shorter to me i mean what i do like about it is in sixth gear you're over 3,000 rpm at 70 mph that is like 1980s 4 cylinders car level of short gearing however on the other end of the spectrum first is good for 47 yep second is good for 74 y and third is good for 104 right and so it's like third gear is illegal speeds on any road if you max it out and i just feel like you know i i don't know what the the correct way of thinking about it is but i'm just like i want to be able to ring out first second and third like that feels fun and can't do that without being like oh you could lose your license if you actually go top of third third gear yeah third gear in california is over 100 and in california 100 is they will take your car away they will impound it so this is an interesting thing so the last manual porsche that i reviewed was boxer spider okay and i say about the same thing and i heard from a german engineer who was very upset about my and he was like you know whose f this is california wait california is the reason for the 9911 having tall gearing for all of the porsche having okay so i am this before you shoot me i'm relaying a message that i was given by a very angry you yet yeah look i found the shing gears too so what i was told is california's drive by noise regulation test is 100 meter box with six microphones one every the start and the finish and every 20 m and their microphones at every 20 m i' have to measure the sound level obviously a car comes in at 50k 28 mph 50 k an hour whatever it is 30 30 something and mats it in third gear in an automatic the they can give full throttle the car does not have to perform a downshift at all and this i know if you ever in a nissan gtr and at 28 29 mph you floor it you will see 3 seconds of or two seconds of nothing like every minivan will go by you yes you just wait and you wait and you wait you wait you know why so it's halfway through the noise box before it all happens so i think it i think the transmission also isn't that great in that car it's not however but that it's that one speed where you're like what the i just got out dragged by a city bus yes so in the case of por of manuals though the test has to be conducted in third gear and if you think about it the tesla model s p100d failed the test and this is a drive by noise regulation test because it was so fast by the end of the test that just the wind and tire noise alone were enough to fail it so you think you're penalized effectively for a fast car because the faster it gathers speed the faster it's going by the end of that 100 m and therefore the quieter the engine has to be so your choice is you can be slow or you can be loud but you can't be b both and so to slow the car down and to quiet it down porsche has to make the third gear longer and longer and longer and longer until it just passes and in the case of this car if that's the reason for this gearing that happens at 104 mph third gear well then now you have to choose a one two and a 456 that are appropriate to that third gear that's what determines the final drive ratio it's a california problem okay i i have objection your honor i do too so i want to hear your so what what i just feel like okay this has an exhaust button that supposedly changes the exhaust mode we've been driving a lot and we cannot tell any difference except that idle unless we're at idle and not moving but were it to be me and i had to do this california test i would have off mode for the california test standard mode where i close some valves back there i make the obnoxious pathway to get that air out so that it silences it and i have exactly what gearing i want that's my so that was my exact objection same thing other people do it other people do it and the response to that from the angry german was yeah and then you're driving around if there's a huge delta between i'll go back into my normal voice part of it for my it's like i was having trouble understanding cu you weren't german in that sorry if there is a huge delta between the closed sound level and the open sound level then as the valves are opening and closing for different speeds for different driveby testing then you have a very big marcket difference in the engine's tone this happens for example in aston martin v12 vantage or even a repeat so you start out and it's like and it's constantly opening closing and you really notice that as a driver so the first thing you do in an ason is always pull that fuse out because it sounds broken like it's allowed to be idle it's allowed to be loud at idle and then it gets quiet then it gets loud again it's annoying so i am pretty sure that is the compromise i would choose and say to the customers it is definitely not perfectly marked in the owners manuals that fuse number 14 is very specifically for making lots of noise exactly like i feel like for example a similar thing tesla's came from the factory with really high tire pressures and they're like hey this is the tire pressure that we're supposed to tell you to use and they're like if you want an actually decent ride you should lower it like 5 psi they probably do that for range right all it's like okay we pass this range test we send them from the factory with these really high pressures and if you want to use it yourself like the warning light won't go on even if you drop at 5 psi so it's like okay then like there's this compromise to be made and i feel like there could be a clever solution there ford has it for example dark horse you can start it in quiet mode and drive around in quiet mode so that has an infinitely five stage i think it is variable exhaust and and porche needs to do that i also just feel like the jaguar ftype svr [music] [applause] exists yeah and if it exists anything can exist right that's true that's the leaf blower of the automo i like it i maybe i like leaf blowers you do drive a subaru oh burn you can't hear it though it's a cross trck it's it's silent but powerful you can't hear it over the disappointment the sound of disappointment of everyone else on the road well what is interesting is that i do drive a cross trk and it has a healthy amount of rev hang and so i am adjusted to you know just learning that and like giving a long delay before shifting and here literally the second you push that clutch pedal in the revs are down they're down so not even the slightest hint of rev hang which is beautiful also the throttle pedal you use 100% of it another beautiful thing to see because so often in these kind of cars manual cars you can leave your foot resting on the throttle a little bit you got to take it completely off when you shift gears otherwise that little bit is enough to raise the revs and you might think oh it has rev hang no it's just a tiny bit of throttle and those revs are going up so yeah the throttle and the shifting and the lack of rev hang it is truly beautiful dynamically steering is for electric power assist beautiful but they got rid of the rear wheel steering which i find interesting they did so that took out some weight but yeah that that does have some stability benefits one of the interesting points though is that they changed the lockup ratio of the mechanical limited slip differential so it actually has less lock up versus the other gt3s reason being on roads with tight corners that gives you a bit more agility you're not using as much interference in the diff on what the wheel speeds are side to side and the way they make up for it going out of the corner is using brake based torque vectoring so if you get really hard on the throttle coming outside of a corner it'll break a little bit that inside wheel gives you a bit of better yaw and gives you more torque to that outside wheel off you go right it's the reason why lotus doesn't like to put anything but open diffs and mclaren same thing they interfere with some steering feel and they induce under steer so without that rear steer they put a less aggressive diff in it they also slowed down the steering ratio up front which i thought was interesting i thought they would do the opposite i did not know that yeah they i thought they would put a quicker rack in but apparently they went from 14 to1 to 15 to1 the the irony of this whole thing is that porsche is the only one that does rear wheel steering correctly right i get into a porsche with rear whe steering and i can't t yes when you get into like i was just in a i7 yesterday and every time the guy turned the wheel you feel that secondary yawn moment from the back and you're like jesus christ are we sideways what's going on i i cannot agree more with you there because whenever i drive the gt3 i'm like wow this thing steers incredibly and i really like it it does what i ask of it when i got inside the lc500 and i drove it at laguna sea i thought i was over steering constantly and i wasn't over steering the rear was doing weird stuff that every time indic to my butt dino like hey the car's sliding and i'm correcting for things that weren't happening and i'm like this is insane like the disconnect was too extreme and with porsche you don't feel that but it's gone in this car sav some weight this is the lightest 911 992 so current generation 3,56 lb i 3,56 lb for the us market 3,42 for the european market wish the us market got this carbon fiber roll cage we don't get that it is i think they should just put it in the car in the trunk and say this is not for you on street what is that so let's get into i'm sorry beautiful actually holy sorry all right let's get into favorite and least favorite thing about it so starting with what's your favorite thing about this car the powertrain power i think that's a a solid that's all you really need to say to me i i'm just going to say the word response like like the throttle pedal is as good as it gets and like every company that ever wants to think like oh what should a throttle pedal feel like like here it is it's right here and and have it act this way i'm happy any anything that replicates this i'm happy with i love how direct it is how linear it is how you have so much control and how you get it split second like it is as fast as you ask for it you get it everything about the engine is just extraordinary and go one step further and say if you as an automotive engineer want to know what clutch takeup should feel like and how a clutch should engage it's this like it's just perfection the shift from the short shift to the clutch take up to the engine response to the whole thing as a package this powertrain is 10.0 all right enough gushing over it let's take it down a notch least favorite thing about the 911 oh easy okay well second least favorite thing moving right along by the way feel free to leave in the comments who your favorite jason is just use first name only okay good least favorite thing is it's unattainable yeah actually can't have one that's that's mine as well and i i think that's such a shame when when i start thinking about like it's more obtainable than some cars i'm like okay like there's almost 2,000 of them built 19 63 60 years of pora but i mean it's it's it's not accessible you you can't just go find this thing and buy this thing and i think that is said i i wish it wasn't production limited i wish they made as many as were ordered and yeah i think i think that's a real shame i think we're look it's $337,000 and porsche priced it correctly because what they've done in the past with 911r and gt3 and gt3 rs and touring and all of the gt cars is that they're all selling for 50 or $100,000 over sticker well that tells me that not that the car is overpriced that tells me that porsche underpriced the msrp yes so 330,000 bucks or whatever these cars are sure they're pricing it properly the problem is we're in in a market where there is no substitute for this experience there's nothing else agre and so people are willing to pay a quarter or a third or a half a million dollars for this experience and that's wonderful i just i can't do it and i wish that there were more either more of these gt cars being produced or more selection for everyone else but the reality is it's supply and demand so you know frankly this should be the base 911 i in that the bas 911 should feel like this forget about the turbos forget about all the rest of the crap this is the experience you should have on bas 911 for 990,000 bucks so it's attainable to people who are successful not just people who have bought 75 porsches before and the dealers or what like whatever so that's a little bit rude no it'll it'll it'll all be included you people just have to use their imagination yeah they're they're they're stooping you know it's it shouldn't be about who you stup and how many other cars you buy and what's else is in your garage if everyone should have the opportunity to have this experience and i think it's sad that they can't and that's my biggest peef for there yes so on that note like do you think it is worth the money $300,000 i think is about where it started is it worth the money yeah because the and and it's not up to me i can't come close to buying a car like that but the market has responded and said yes and to beat this in experience yeah i don't know if you can yes i mean maybe it gordon murray car yeah so i hate personally i hate to say anything over like $150,000 is worth the money i just think it's insane it makes no sense and i have a bit of like a utilitarian mindset of like but 10 me up is more fun than one gt3 and so like that that side of me breaks but when i drive this thing i'm like looking at the market if if you look at a pagani if you look at you know a coning se if you look at the prices behind these cars and then you look at this it's like yeah it's worth the money easy like easy to those who could afford it yeah it absolutely is and you can't do better but i just don't like saying that like same it makes me uncomfortable i don't like it either i wish it was more accessible like you said i want i would have a brz over this once you and money less than 200 lb lighter with less than half the power like this isn't that much heavier than a brz this is lighter than a civic type r oh my god with 500 you know 20 horsepower na na na that's the biggest part it must be na it's magic the s is magic cat so final question for this video is this the best driver's car road goinging driver car i can't think of a better one so yes okay and to me like i haven't driven anything above half a million dollars so it's hard for me to say like definitively but when i drive this i'm like this is every bit of power of performance that i could possibly want on a road and it is yeah it's perfection to me so this is the best car i've ever driven easy never driven ever yeah i mean i don't here's the thing i don't get attached to like historic things i haven't driven that many historic cars but also i i don't get attached to them newer is better to me if it's done right and this is today's everything you want done right so to me that's always better and i get there's like nostalgia for mechanical throttles and no abs and that sort of feel that analog feel that you can get with other cars hold on there's nostalgia for all that stuff because the modern stuff sucks yes you don't need to be nostalgic for air cooled non-abs throttle by cable cars when you drive a a modern computer controlled car that behaves exactly the same way yes so you don't that's the craziest part is you don't need to go back in time this drives like an old car in in all of the right ways and then like a new car in all of those right ways yes so everyone will say like car companies will say like oh we can't make cars light anymore nd miata exists and you're like like no you can and then everyone will say like oh we can't make cars drive like they used to and then this is like no you can like it is mechanical it is analog and yet it is using all modern equipment to do so and it is such a connected experience yeah i think if we put in a 99 if we got out of this and got into a 997 gt3 rs 4 l i think your mind would be blown okay i haven't driven one w fair enough but it's all of this excitement times 1 and a2 because mostly the engine is the most angry thing you'll ever hear and the steering is otherworldly you feel everything this is electric this is the best electric fire steering on the market but i think we are up there in the top echelon of probably the top five or 10 cars best driving cars ever made yeah it's extraordinary so yeah well that's a solid summary last time at the end of our video we recommended a couple videos to watch and i thought that was like a nice thing to do and throttle house did participate what do you think should we recommend like their vinfast video is that i mean listen i i watch all their videos because oh they're my friends but they make me laugh they're hilarious you don't make me laugh well actually you do it's but it's at not with yeah no that's fair i mean everyone needs a punching bag in their life so that you know they can feel superior yeah i mean poor thomas oh just kidding no his physical comedy is the best while we're live on on camera let me say thomas you son a you stole my trip and fall in the middle of a of a line move i did that first i stole it you were the first person to trip andol no i completely stole that from from kunk on earth if you saw the fil on earth yes yes so i stole it and in my video of the gr yarus i literally tripped and fell through a bush 17 times it was 17 different takes really got hurt i'm still hurt it's a year later totally worth it it was hilarious and now thomas just stole that same idea of tripping and falling but his looked mine was real because i literally tripped over a bush he slipped fell rolled and recovered and kept going it was hilarious i'm so mad at you thomas and james you know all right james so that's the video i'll link to is him tripping and falling because who doesn't love to watch that yeah and how about a video of yours have you driven anything notable i feel like you've kind of been off the radar as of late was there like a cyber what's it called wait wait it's a truck that belongs to the cyber no space police space that's what it is it's a space police i saw something on the platform x about it i did cyx somehow one of three one of three people who got exclusive access to the cyber truck
