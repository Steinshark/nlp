the reason my company has been successful in terms of this is because of an idea meritocratic decision-making a process by which you can get the best ideas you know what's an idea meritocracy an idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas that are available out there and to work together with other people and the team to achieve that so if we can look around a little bit longer the idea of an idea meritocracy it's fascinating but especially because it seems to be rare not just in companies but in society so there's a lot of people on twitter and public discourse and politics and so on that are really stuck in certain sets of ideas whatever they are so when you're confronted with it with an idea that said that's different than your own about a particular topic what kind of process do you go through mentally are you arguing through the idea with the person sort of present is almost like a debate or do you sit on it and consider the world sort of empathetically if this is true then what is that war look like does that world make sense and so on so what's the process of considering those conflicting ideas i'm gonna answer that question but after saying first implement implicit in your question is it's not common okay what's common produces only common results okay so don't judge yes anything that is good based on whether it's common because you're on it's only going to give you common results if you want unique you have a unique approach yes okay and so that art of thoughtful disagreement is the is the capacity to hold two things in your mind at the same time the g i think this makes sense and then saying i'm not sure it makes sense and then try to say why does it make sense and then to triangulate with others so if i'm having a discussion like that and i work myself through and i'm not sure then i have to do that in a good way so i always attention for example what let's start off what does the other person know relative to what i know so if a person has a higher expertise are things i'm much more inclined to ask questions i'm always asking questions if you want to learn you're asking questions you're not arguing okay you're taking in you're assessing when it comes in to you does that make sense so you're learning something are you getting epiphanies and so on and i try to then do that if the conversation it as we're trying to decide what is true and we're trying to do that together and we see truth different then i might even call in another really smart capable person and try to say what is true and how do we explore that together and you go through that same thing so i would i said i describe it as having open mindedness and assertiveness at the same time that you can simultaneously be open minded and take in with that curiosity and then also be assertive and say but that doesn't make sense why would this be the case and you do that back and forth you
