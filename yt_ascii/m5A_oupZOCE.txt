so before getting into detail in to the various quantum technologies past and present and future i think it's important for all of us to be able to be on the same footing regarding what quantum effects are behind them and really kind of have a thorough sort of list of of all these con effects that really i think at this point everybody should know about because they're really kind of prominent in many of the technologies that we already use so here's the four quantum effects for the layperson the first is probably one that everybody already knows about because it's almost something that defines quantum mechanics and and your first conversations about it and that's discreetness of quantum states or discreteness of energies of quantum states and it basically just says that a quantum state a that that you can pick from does not occupy arbitrary energy you can only have a set of states that occupy certain quantized or discrete energies the word quantum even comes from this one simple system that we can demonstrate this with is called a particle in a box there's some box here there's some position x here that we can denote and this is very similar the states of the system are very similar to the slinky that professor moriarty and his monkey were dangling next to the wall and if you imagine you know a slinky you can sort of drive it to to have to be in a standing wave with with no nodes you can have it be in a way with one node you can have it be in a way with two nodes etc and the energies of this are one two and four for this quantum system and the point is that here the energies are indeed quantized was there a reason why you've got energy levels one two and four no three a particle in a box its energies are the energy is proportional to the square of the number energy is proportional to n squared where n is the number now when do we see this do we see this in the real world are my hand positions quantized is your mashed potatoes in the microwave kind of quantized temperatures when you measure the temperature not really you need to see you need to have for the most part small and a cold system to be able to start to see or resolve these different energies because they come you know sometimes the unit of quantization is pretty small so this is maybe it's at first seems really strange because in our world we're at such coarse grained scales and there's so much energy around us that you know we don't really see any of this minuscule microscopic quantization but it's definitely there and it's extremely precise namely that we use this this quantization of energies to determine many of our fundamental constants we've been doing that for a while now so we're basically it's all basically certain that all of this is kind of there if you know where to look so for a quantum system you know going forward you you want to just have some system of writing these states and denoting their quantum and what we do is we put them in a cat so this is called a cat and inside the cat we put in the picture or some symbol or a number denoting which state we're talking about here so we're talking about here the the no note state so i'll just draw a picture of the no note state same here here's the cut for that one and then there's another cat for this one and you know these is the stuff inside these cats can be whatever you want to denote the quantum system it could be a cat that's alive or dead you know the famous example it can be some real number etc it can be a binary string a string of zeros and ones to denote the state of a state of qubits of a quantum computer even though the the set of states occupy discrete specific energies that are spaced apart in some energy difference that's very precise there can still be infinitely many of them and as you can see here you know this is no node one node two node three node etc so quantum systems can be an arbitrarily high energy states but you know as you crank up the energy you get you lose a lot of the control and so it's so so for the most technologies we really use just a few low-lying energy states and the simplest case is just two states hence the name cubit the second principle is the principle of superposition and collapse this to me is probably the weirdest one even though this is something that you also see in wave mechanics for example dropping pebbles in a pond you have some fixed types of waves that you have in the pond and if you drop multiple pebbles you can these these waves will interfere or super pose with each other similarly the states of this quantum system that i have say this no node in this one node state can be in quantum superposition with each other now what's different between the superposition of waves in a pond from say one pebble and another pebble and this quantum superposition well two things for one there's a source of intrinsic randomness here so we really don't know which state that this this system is in let's say why is this intrinsic well let me compare this to ordinary randomness let's say i flip a coin and i put it down on my hand and i don't show it to you so you don't know what the outcome is the coin is as it heads is it tails and does that mean that to you the coin is in quantum superposition no because somebody knows let's say i look i know but even if i don't look the skin on my hand knows whether it's touching the heads or the tail side of the coin so this state of the system has been predetermined you just happen to not know it the tree's already fallen in the woods you know it made a sound you just didn't hear it the difference here is that this isn't truly a quantum superposition namely nobody knows where which state this is in and the second part that's different is that you change the state by looking at it so the principle of collapse here says that if you say look at it look at the state you will project onto some set of states with some probabilities associated with them and this will be intrinsically random you don't know the outcome of priori and once you look at it it'll immediately collapse to one or the other outcome let's say here just as an example i can collapse to this state with 50 probability and to this day with 50 probability now if i go back to my pebbles in the pond and throw a bunch of pebbles in a pond and i look at them the the waves could care less if i'm looking at them or not so there's going to be no collapse happening so the wave mechanics part is the same however there is something that that happens when you look at the system and the the what you get is intrinsically a random outcome and as you may suspect this intrinsic randomness that's that's true for quant that happens in quantum systems can be used to generate certified random numbers which is one application of this principle another application you can maybe infer is is trying to do you know computation in parallel because you have the ability to generate a state that has multiple different components in it however this is kind of misleading because it's not as powerful as you might think and the reason being here is that yes you can generate superpositions in that sense there's some parallelization but you get to look at these things and they immediately collapse ruining their for ruining the superposition and even though you can look at them and from from all sides and directions and in diff you can perform different types of quantum measurements you still only get a a one-shot look at partially what the state is so you have to look at it in multiple times from say many different directions to really get a feel for what the state is and so it's not like you have this bona fide state that you can really you know observe there's a live superposition so the the principle of parallelization here is not quite the right analogy third principle is uncertainty and here i can demonstrate it using the ingredients we have in our quantum system and i want to immediately say that this is also principle that you see or hear more precisely in when you hear a classical music concert or any music concert and this just has to do with the fact that being precise in one uh variable or parameter comes at the expense or price of being imprecise in another let's use our ingredients here for our for our particle in a box and the two parameters we're interested in are frequency and position i'm going to measure these things and how come i can use the word frequency here well because if i let's say start with a super high energy state that has lots of these nodes here then this state that almost fills up the well and i'm trying to make these all look the same so pardon the artistic rendition the these these types of high energy states they they basically start to look like waves for high enough energy especially if you ignore the ends of the box or make the box really big really wide so when they start to look like waves then they begin to gain a notion of frequency and you can see that if you fit a lot of repetitions of this of this wave in here for in for a high frequency this can happen for a fixed size of the well then you can see that you can more or less discern the frequency with relative certainty now conversely if you were to try to look at where the position of the particle is remember the position here is x for us so where where where is this particle can we pin it down to a precise position by looking at it in a way that measures the collapses it onto a position well then we would be more or less uniformly distributed our guess is to where this particle will be if we look at it is is more or less uniform we don't it's kind of all spread out all over the well and in that sense this particle doesn't have a very precise position when it is in this high energy state so relative to the frequency that we can already see by just looking at the studying the the wave function here the position can is is less certain of this particle okay now let's look at the sort of the converse state or the closest counter example to this type of behavior by looking at the ground state the one with no nodes and here if you even consider thinking of it as a wave which you know you don't even have a single wavelength fit in here you have half a wavelength fit in here so because you don't have a lot of repetition you can't really discern any repetitive behavior and so any notion of frequency here is very much less certain conversely if you were to try to guess you know pick a pick some range of numbers where this position would be in contrast to this case where this it's very delocalized here you know it's it's more or less dr kind of focused on the center and it tends to ignore you know it doesn't like being near the ends as much as it does near the center now granted this is not as sharply as sharply peaked as i would like in this analogy but it's sort of the ingredient we have for this specific system so i don't want to make things more complicated by drawing something that we don't have out of these although in principle it's possible to engineer something like that by superposing a bunch of these and there are videos on fourier analysis that you can you know look a number file and so now if we look at this position right the it kind of tries to avoid the ends a little bit and so you can say that relative to you know having any notion of frequency it definitely has a clearer notion of position so what is the point here well the point is that you can create states of quantum systems that are more precise have more precisely determinable values of one parameter at the price of being less precise in another parameter and this is useful for sensing quantum or quantum sensing or quantum metrology or quantum imaging because creating a state that has a very precisely centered and a sharp distribution of one parameter allows you to sense shifts in that parameter very nicely let's say i wanted to sense the kicks in position say i have some probe that that kicks my particle a little bit changes its position which state would i want to use well i want to use the state that a priori has an as a well-defined position to begin with so that when there's a small shift the position for sufficiently small shift will also remain more or less you know focused and we'll be able to measure it precisely just by looking at the position if we if we're trying to kick a position of a state whose position is smeared on all over the well that's not going to work and what's interesting is that this sort of total uncertainty between one variable and another is constant and so you can smear it around you can you can make one variable more precise at the expense of making the other one less precise and this is something that people have utilized in detection of gravitational waves the fourth effect is entanglement and this is something that there's also misconceptions about but it's not really nothing but the upgrade of the superposition principle to multiple systems multiple quantum systems so far i've looked at one quantum system and i've showed you that has different states but now let's consider we have you know two systems or two particles and we want to study what states they have well to draw a cat of two particles we need to have some way of denoting which state the first one is in and which state the second one is in so we need to have basically comma separated symbols and let's say we have some the state of the first system or first particle is in the no node state and the state of the second one is in this one note state and now to demonstrate entanglement we just apply the principle of superposition and just superpose it with another two body state let's say now where things are the opposite you have the first system in the one node state and second in the no node state so this is an entangled state and what is entangled about it well the point is here that the two particles are following some rule which leads to them being correlated in a way so what is this rule well the rule is that if you have two states they can be in but if one of them is in one of the states the no note state the other one automatically is not in the no node state which means it's in the other state the one note state likewise if the first particle is in the onenote state the other one second particle is in the no note state because it cannot be in the one node state so this type of rule makes these particles correlated in this way and because these are in quantum superposition this correlation is intrinsically quantum and this is what's called entanglement the rule though is something that again you see in classical physics because the rule is something that i can show demonstrate using socks if i promise you that i wear opposite colored socks red and blue then if you see a red sock on my right foot then you're going to see a blue sock on the on the left foot and there's nothing spooky about that or anything it's just in setup by the rule by the sort of the the type of state that i'm looking at here so what's cool about the quantum version of this is that you can infer the state of the other system just by looking at the first system because of this rule if i collapse the first state in this way onto one of these other or the other uh you know no node or one node state i will be able to infer what state the other system is in if i get the no node outcome for the collapse of the first system i know the other one will be in the one note state it doesn't matter how far separated these are the rule has apriori determined the correlation that they're going to have and it's only up to now the collapse principle to figure out which one of these states they're in and this powerful notion of quantum correlations or entanglement is useful for quantum computing and while it's pretty simple for two systems as we scale it up for n being greater than 2 3 4 etc this gets pretty complicated and it's really because for two states per system you have two to the n states for n systems and meaning that the number of states doubles every time you add one more particle and you have a nice video about that demonstrating that and the usefulness of that in quantum computing because each qubit itself is doubling so you have to think of that number of doublings each time these are basically the four quantum effects the hope is really that everybody will will know them because they're really been utilized for metrology being utilized now for computing utilized for gravitational waves mri lasers etc but really all four are necessary for modern quantum technologies is a superposition of waves on that string this string can be in a range of different types variety of different types of modes of oscillation waves of vibrator written it onto this file but it's left the rest of this file intact because it's not truncated the file so if i take a different
