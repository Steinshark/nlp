we need to have a little bit of a talk okay we just need to have a little bit of a talk here okay now i personally i'm not a very big fan of dhh okay i think the way he writes his blog posts is a to try hard for me the things he does i think sometimes are pretty exciting i think sometimes they're stupid you know i think it just totally depends on what he's doing and i'm a bit surprised at how much tech twitter just tries to go against anything and everything he says with absolute ely no thought to what he is saying do you know what i mean it is a little bit strange how you can have such a preconceived notion out of the rip and then just no matter what he says oh he's saying it in just like a rude way no he didn't say anything in he just said they're doing no builds now i do agree with this whole assessment that this made that as your files get as you get too many files you do start getting penalized also when you have too many individual files compression such as gzip can't do as good of a job because it doesn't have as much information to compress on but there is a compression window right there's only so much compression that can happen in any one window so which one is it yeah i totally get it yeah there's some good things there's some bad things but real talk this is a really good observation by this guy right which is this is so od about tech discord you can literally do nothing let's see you can literally be doing things at great scale shopify rails and people will claim it doesn't scale or be given a method for years hey no bill js and they'll claim it doesn't work and i don't think people are claiming it doesn't work what i think what people are claiming is that they don't like dhh you know what i mean that's it and i think that people need to quit being so annoying it's okay to dislike somebody but if they state something technical you should be able to argue why inside of your head it's both correct from their perspective and then why you think it's bad you know what i mean like put like apply a touch of critical thought i think tech twitter's biggest weakness right now is there is just no nuance there is no critical thought it's pretty much like oh you're not using reactjs you're stunting your growth oh you're not using tailwind you're a jerk and you hate css oh you're using tailwind oh you don't even know to write real css right like it's there's like 10 thoughts on tech twitter and if you fall outside of the overton window of tech twitter you are literally the worst person who has ever walked through earth now do i like again do i like dhh no i don't have i'm not really for or against what he has to say i think some of the things he says are exciting i think some of them are kind of stupid just is what it is no build javascript guess what guess what the chrome inspector is written in javascript for this exact reason the chrome debugger inspector that we all rely on is written in such a way that that it does not require a build and just runs so that way while they're developing they can move as fast as possible now you may say okay i don't believe that is real they're not moving as fast as possible it's somebody else's program and it's their way of doing things and it's at least been that way for a very long time they may have changed it in the re in recent memory but when i was working on it a year ago that was not the case so just think about that for a second that incredibly complex pieces of software much more complex than anything you work on raw dogs it with no build right so just something you got to think about and so i really want you guys to just take a moment and instead of just looking at a person and reacting and reading what you like how do i say this what's a good way to say this this is a it's it's a first off this is a big skill and it's going to benefit you in a huge amount of your career is that we all carry in preconceived notions about people right no matter what it is no matter who they are even people you don't know the moment you hear a southern accent there's a whole group of people in the silicon valley that will think you are stupider than you are and yes i ed the non-real word stupider on purpose okay that is a real thing it's a really well-known thing so what i want you to do instead is when someone says something technical try to adopt it as your own opinion you know what i mean real talk try to adopt it as your own opinion see what it feels like walk through the use cases try to become a critical thinker try to become a real skeptic right try to become something that's different than what tech twitter is because honestly tech twitter is just the worst and it is by far the worst group of people at making they're the they are the group of people that i see so often talk about the values of diversity and everything and they're the fastest people to judge someone they don't know at the exact same time don't be that person don't be there don't be that person critically think apply skills it's going to just kill at your job because anyone that brings up a new idea you can actually just think through it like it's your own idea you can actually walk through it you can become the most knowledgeable and well-rounded person at your job to where you are the person people go to to talk ideas because you can hear an idea for what it is that is that right and i think that that is an incredible incredible talent that most people don't contain because they're too busy being wrapped up in their own causes people also under underestimate how fast you get with specific tools once you get once you use them a thousand times yes this is very true there are plenty of people that can outperform full front-end frameworks in raw javascript with some typing speed even complex apps yes this is what i keep saying over and over again dx is not a measure of how good whatever tool is you're saying is good it is a measure of your familiarity and that is that like that is that and i know that hurts i know that hurts a lot of you react andies out there because you've been told over and over again developer experience is the pinnacle of what you need and you need to use this for the best developer experience the people who are telling you that have been using react for 10 years and guess what they're super used to react so guess which has the best dx the one that they simply have built 500 tools with i know this may sound crazy this may be the craziest thing you've ever heard but it is a real thing the person with whom is most familiar with their tools will claim it has the most dx anyways the name is i really do hope that you like and subscribe got them
