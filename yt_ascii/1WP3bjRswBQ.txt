ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the world chess championship 2023 contested by yanyupomnishi of russia and dingly ren of china this is game number four it is two out of three for yanyupomnishi it's one out of three four dingly ran as young leads two to one and a friendly reminder that it is first to seven and a half points it's a best of 14. and today's game was absolutely incredible it was sensational it was epic and i cannot wait to share it with all of you before i show you the game though remember i've ran a 50 off courses promo and it ends tonight so if you've ever wanted to get one of my courses today's the day to do it watch the recap click that first link in the description or you can sign up for chelsea plus incredible training games and there's free samples of everything so last day all right sounds good let's do this c4 is the first move that is played in the game and this is already i mean okay this isn't the surprise but it's the english opening and it's played by dingley wren after in game two he played d4 and the players reached the queen's game but declined and then ding went h3 so i do think that this position will happen again i do not think dingle play h3 in that game so he plays the english now ding really likes to play positions with the bishop on g2 so when he plays the queen's gambit declined ding likes to play the catalan when he plays the english he likes to play g3 bishop g2 alright and actually ding has played the english opening against yanipomishi before he played it against him in the first game of the candidates tournament last year and it did not go very well jan was a muslim was like a the terminator in that game and the move c4 is very useful for d4 players to add to the repertoire the of course the major drawback of the move c4 compared to d4 is that black can play e5 right and now you're not gonna play d4 you're playing a reverse sicilian and e5 is the sharpest line now what was interesting in this game is that jan actually shows to play knight f6 which is not e5 but after knight c3 he decided to play e5 which is very interesting and you can play like that like you you're able the point is that after e5 white doesn't actually have to play knight c3 white can play g3 and obviously that completely avoids knight c3 it's just a completely different subset of things and after knight f6 if if g3 happens you could play like e65 and take you can kind of playing catalan style so to the surprise of i think a lot of folks dig actually plays e3 now again these are very very high level subtleties and for most of you you don't really you don't honestly none of this matters you will never see this in your games and frankly you're probably kind of bored right now but listen i'm trying to make this recap so anybody 100 elo can understand and anybody you know 27.95 elo can understand i would imagine my ceiling is what yanyishi's rating is i don't think any grandmasters are watching this recap but if they happen to be you should they should let me know in the comments it will flatter me the point of e3 is to play for d4 right that's what white wants white wants to put a pawn on d4 and and develop a bishop and castle right now the main line here for black is bishop b4 so that's another kind of benefit of black letting white put a knight on c3 because now this bishop can come out and be traded off here the main line is queen to c2 and black usually castles after castles there is knight to d5 getting out of the way and after knight takes pawn takes black snake gets dislodged so rookie 8 is often played here and then here there's a very funny move queen f5 okay you absolutely never need to remember this but the point is that all of this stuff has been played before but here jan does something much more concrete by concrete i mean he doesn't do any of the stuff that i just showed after castles he instead takes the knight he just removes the knight from the board and you would think that the idea of playing queen c2 the other idea of playing queen c2 is that after bishop takes you take with the queen right i mean duh no actually the reason for that is black has actually found a way to equalize quite comfortably against this move black plays queen e7 e4 and d5 like black is actually completely fun there's even lines like d4 right away e4 knight g1 d5 like there's some very interesting lines here black has equalized there's a game wesley so had the white pieces against awander liang if you want to look at that game instead he takes like this why would you put your queen to see son that doesn't what so that you can control the center and play e4 this has been a very modern idea so there's very few games played here already we have a very complicated position black has given up a dark squared bishop but he's damaged white structure and he's going to be rock solid on the dark squares now it's interesting that jan plays d6 instead of castling right now i've actually had this position once myself over the board from a slightly different move order and and i played e4 and i i had a good position but i i didn't really know how to handle it i didn't know how to handle my position because it's so closed and black is so solid and my opponent in that game played like a couple of moves and then played for f5 okay so we have castles and now ding does not play g3 bishop g2 ding plays bishop e2 alright so we're even deeper in the tank here only about 20 positions have ever happened in the masters database and they've gone knight to h5 the reason they've gone knight to h5 is because black has no other way to do anything in the position you see if black just plays natural developing moves like this and queen d7 and connect the rooks sooner or later white will play the move like h3 and then white will play the move d4 and white is basically completely winning i mean that's like a little bit of an exaggeration but white is going to overrun black and center it's just black has no play so black needs to start firing away with pawn breaks all right and pawn breaks are opportunities where you can exchange pawns to improve your position or potentially obviously damage it you have to evaluate if upon pawn break is good or not best way to learn about pawn breaks middle games master class literally never been a better time to buy it because it's 50 off right now improve your middle game go check it out whole free sample chapters about making a plan in chess do you struggle with making a plan yeah you do yes don't lie to yourself and i give you that whole chapter for free learn how to make a plan for free i mean i'm i don't know how to make it any simpler for you folks literally zero zero zero dollars knight to h5 jan's plan is to play f5 put his knight on f4 maybe queen f6 now fascinating thing about this position after d4 knight f4 is that it's only ever happened one time ever and it the person playing white is a hard report and why is that important it's important because report is dingly ren second for this tournament like he is his training partner his coach he's in his corner like in fighting which is fascinating so i mean look i don't think that like this is completely inspired by a report but it is very interesting and report won that game obviously he played it in bundesliga not the football league but there's a bundesliga for chess not it's much less exciting teammates don't punch each other in the face and whatnot so you guys like that current events football joke so bishop f4 ef4 now what's funny is that this is an inaccurate move and anish giri a lot of the other commentators they thought that jan mixed up his preparation like queen f6 has been played here and and f5 f5 has been played here as well but you will notice that jan played this move in about three minutes and got to this position and white has a very very healthy big boy center that's what we call that we call that big boy center bbc and so e takes f4 obviously leaves white with a very nice position but black is a couple of moves away from firing away at it with rookie eight knight a5 and and so on and then maybe queen f6 so it's it's it's not all you know rainbows and butterflies now report remember i told you report is the only person in history to have this position yeah he went here and then after his opponent played knight g4 bishop g4 he undeveloped his knight and then i think later at some point he played king f1 and just launched the giant attack it was hilarious report is crazy ding did not do that ding castled queen f6 and now it's it like ding is making some slide improving moves but jan has caught up and the position is equal and and things advantages is kind of gone again that's not good all right now i think instead of bishop d3 ding could have done something else he had to probably prevent the move bishop g4 like this was probably required in the position and then he enjoys a very very nice advantage we know i mean how many of you play h3a3 to just you know play random moves h3 is so pretty pretty much always a good move it you know it stops bishop g4 and he also could have maybe gone aggressive with c5 but ding makes an inaccuracy and he has to move his knight out of the way and jan is in pretty good shape now i mean like he he's kind of solved all his problems rook d8 and life is good but the position's pretty hard it like again it's it's a difficult position because at any given moment white's pawns can come forward and this pawn is nice but it's only temporary okay i like i can probably trade that pawn off and jan immediately invites trouble okay jan thinks for two minutes two minutes on well i'd say a removes the knight from the control of the center and is basically waving a red flag in front of a bull okay and there's only so long that dingley red is going to be able to resist this opportunity and here's ding plays c5 okay thanks for 12 minutes he plays c5 and the idea of c5 is that now the pawn is no longer ever a target and if you ever take me which you probably will have to do because if you don't i'm gonna keep building behind on the queen side behind the pawn after you take me i have no intention of taking back my intention is that now i have removed your pawn from the control of the center of the board and now e5 and i open up a battery to h7 you have to go defend it now d5 the center is sealed and for the cost of one pawn i have dominated the center of the board and your knights can now not return home and if you play a move like c6 to try to trade pawns with me i will just defend myself or i'll walk into your position and that's really bad so ladies and gentlemen this is officially the greatest position that dingley wren has had in the first four games of the match can he win and level the score and it will be match on rook to d8 okay rook to da the rooks are now staring at the ponds ding plays c4 a very tense moment this is the worst position has had in this match the pawns are triumphant if at any point you try to poke at them they will ignore you and walk forward so we kind of have a quagmire between these two pawns and the two black pawns who is going to budge all right and how do you play this position if you're playing with black because if white trades the bishops and plays rook d1 and just starts advancing how are you gonna defend yourself so we have b6 of course you have to play b6 because you need to get your knight back but also you need to just make sure your your structure is solid h3 the bishop has been removed and now here queen c3 bishop f5 all decent moves bishop e4 decent move trying to decide which of your pieces you're going to put on f3 rookie seven rookie seven is a waiting move jan thought for 17 minutes and slid his rook forward one square you kind of wonder what is going through his head right right like i mean really like you're in a very bad position here ding is kind of walking you down rookie seven now slide my queen forward one square you know what the computer is saying black's best move is after something like a4 just like doing nothing king f8 queen c3 king g8 i mean like i'm not i'm not even like exaggerating like i mean at some point black is out of moves so queen c3 he lines up the pressure onto that pawn but ding was ready of course he plays bishop f3 and i told you if the bishop trade happens it is a massive improvement for white because black loses the only active piece that they had if black trades the dark squared bishop it's kind of the like the los angeles lakers not resigning alex caruso basically the stupidest decision of all time knight b7 played in the game now you will notice the move d6 here attacks the knight and hits the rook but not and not quite because the knight can take and that that doesn't work so rookie two and now ding is probably going to play here now here jan does something bold but correct okay bold but correct he doesn't have to do this move jan can continue to sit there with these pawns staring at him and just go well you can't move them forward instead jan goes here now what folks what did i tell you a long time ago i told you that if one of those moves happens e6 okay that looks good right it looks good but look at black's blockade i mean john has a complete and total blockade in the position now here the computer actually wanted bishop g6 and the fascinating thing about bishop g6 is that the computer is claiming white cannot break through the computer actually is looking at this position and just saying this is the optimal blockade jan has actually solved all his problems this is nuts i mean dingley wren had his greatest position in the match and he's still unable to break through yanip it's a bummer i mean it's a bummer really like jan is in amazing form i don't know what ding is gonna have to do to try to secure a victory in the match really like i i just have i don't know it's it's kind of a bummer like bishop g6 and that's it you've completely sealed everything off okay knight f5 is fine but again he should really be sitting there like he shouldn't in any way shape or form be allowing anything to go forward but okay i remember i told you how like allowing the trade of bishops might be bad for black well it happens and now rookie four and the queen comes back to h6 and obviously white has a more pleasant position okay the computer likes white's position a bit more so now we have queen f3 right attacking the pawn on f4 and folks i'm gonna ask you a question how do you defend the pawn on f4 it's not a trick question okay how do you defend the pawn on f4 well you gotta go g5 right you probably gotta go g5 and if y tries to play g4 you play knight d6 and you know you get your fortress right so queen f3 you gotta go g5 in this position plays the move knight to d4 he plays that move in two minutes are you seeing what i'm seeing knight d4 the idea was queen f4 queen f4 and something like c6 but after knight to d4 in this position tingly ren sacrificed the rock rook takes d4 and after c takes d4 nobody cares about the f4 pawn any longer as the pony is now going to gallop to b3 to d4 to f5 2c6 to e7 and the legendary pawn chain of dingly ren reigns supreme black can play c5 to try to hold it all together but dingley wren is not going to fall for the trick of onpasson he's gonna play d6 and if you take his pawn on e6 he's going to play queen d5 pinning the pawn to the rook to the king and if you play a five defending that he's gonna play d7 rook takes d4 blundered with 30 minutes on the clock is exactly how yan lost his match against magnus that is wild i mean when you put the knight on d4 the the knight can be taken of course if you're gonna win material but all of a sudden dingly ren is winning dingly ren is off to the races pawn to g4 trying to secure an outpost on the f5 square fg3 fg3 knight f5 walking him down e7 the black rook is suffocating on e8 it cannot move out of the way queen f7 now we have d6 d7 is a knockout punch so you've got to take this pawn and accept the fork 98 queen e8 dingly ren has converted his initial investment and he's gotten significant return the pawn on e7 is going to queen nobody can stand up to it and this is the way you remove the blockade you bring the queen to e6 both players get their extra time black is defending himself intelligently but check takes rook f6 check hunts the king out you can't take the pawn because of rookie one you play rook g6 and i get to your queen and in this position jan resigned because after rook to g8 black is lost anyway because of rook d8 or this and the point is my pawn is using my rook as a infiltration point and e8 is unstoppable what you don't do however after rook f rook g8 is play this because that would be a tragic blunder ladies and gentlemen rook g8 excuse me queen g7 and queen f8 dingly ren wins the game and he has one he he oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness it's two to two it's two to two oh it's match on dingley run started slow but now the slate is clean two to two after four and i'll see you back for game number five welcome to the world chess championship 2023 and make sure to get a chestly course while it's 50 off get out of here
