wishing you health happiness success on the chessboard off the chessboard some of you are finishing school work etc etc if 2023 was bad then well it's over and if it was good savor the moment let's make 2024 even better cheers with my little container of water here this is going to be a very unique video in this video i'm going to talk a lot i always talk a lot but i'm i'm going to really really talk a lot i'm also going to leak some of my analytics like my youtube dashboard i'm going to leak my some of my instagram analytics to all of you mostly with the purpose of giving you a a deep dive and insider look in to what the chess world currently is is the growth that we've experienced problems that we face opportunities that have yet to come and that's i think unique i i i'm not sure you can get a perspective quite like mine because i'm frankly not sure that other large chess creators are doing something like this and and aside from chess.com and i guess fay the international governing body of the game i i am one of the largest entities and the reason for that is because of you at the end of the day when we talk about subscribers and viewership that's you listening or watching right now so we're going to go through a calendar of 2023 the big moments the events and then i'm going to leak some of my analytics to all of you talk about the growth of the game actually why don't we start with that right now o currently watching dolphins ravens on because this year i've been converted into a nfl fan i've never really watch football that much but i currently have the nfl playing out there let's start with this these are my youtube analytics from 20122 325 million views in a year last year i gained 780,000 subscribers and i had 51 million total watch hours and these are the views and the analytics in 20123 1.4 billion views 94 million watch hours and 2.4 million subscribers gained obviously the first half of the year was massive we're going to get into that in a second then it slowed down a little bit pick back up again around august and then obviously we we ended the year quite strong four to five times greater viewership nearly double the watch time a lot of that was through the short form content which i will get into and yeah i mean i had 2 million subscribers when when the year started and now it's up to 4 and a half and it's it's unbelievable this year i also published the book i have the book right here i'm going to talk about that a little bit later going to talk about the book and the point of this is is not a video where i tell you about things that i did there will be a bit of that but it's mostly to give you a like i said a deep dive an insider look into the world of chess maybe you might even have opportunities for yourself to get paid work or start a club initiative at your school or do something at your local with your local community and potentially try to angle toward a college application there are so many opportunities you might not be thinking of in the world of chess and i would like to give you my unfiltered perspective so let's start off what happened in the beginning of this year in january january of 2023 we had this but even before this we had this we had the mogul chess boxing championship presented by that's not sponsoring today's video but that was what we had it was an unbelievable spectacle it was it was boxing it was chess it was it was lwig i was there commentating and this this this was unbelievable and then we had mittens that was that was december january and then we had mittens and one other thing that we had around this time around this massive explosion was of course ch.com servers going down when in one day on february 3rd they had a record 403,000 people sign up and their traffic more than doubled in the last few months right so instead of 7 million they had 11 million daily users that was in january of 2023 what happened in the beginning of this year is a lot of things going right right at the right time but there was no bigger explosion in january of 2023 than short form content a lot of you watching this right now are probably teen aers maybe you're like 9 or eight years old but you are at at your ceiling is like 19 and that shifted in 2023 i'm going to show you when i get into my youtube analytics in a in a little bit it's probably i'll tim stamp it the average age of the viewer actually went down in 2023 by several years because of the explosion of short form content scroll up content right we have our phones we're browsing we're scrolling up on instagram on youtube on tik talk and that stuff is generally associated with like sort of brain dead meme content stupid content and then it can make us laugh but chess in particular i really struggle to understand how to make into meaningful short form content until this year highlights narrating through what magnus carlson or hiar nakamura are doing or a chess drama or anything a gambit an opening trap an endgame idea how to checkmate with a king and a queen in january of 2023 all of my content on every platform youtube twitch instagram tik tok had 300 million views in one month for the entire month of january of 2023 short form content bringing people in through the algorithm averaged for me around 10 million views a day that is absolutely mindboggling and all those people went to chess all those people tried a chess course all those people started playing in their school a lot of a lot of the teenagers started playing in school they started playing each other they got their friends into the game and it was it was really a wild thing to see this was our third and our biggest boom by far don't listen to any reddit thread don't listen to any website don't listen to any theory i am telling you right now as the person who has studied the analytics of the chess world for the last 5 years and who has been deeply involved in this we had the queen gambit which was the single greatest thing to happen to chess then it was the cheating scandal for viewership for scaling the whole thing but short form content in january of 2023 nothing has beaten it the reason for that is chess captures an audience i can watch an opening trap that's 30 seconds long and i want to go try it how many of you did this you would watch something and then you'd be like oh i want to go test this out you would you would get it or you would not get it you would me make a mistake i need to learn what a tactic is i go to you can watch the long form content but you can also watch the short form content and that's how you made your way in in fact let me know in the comments how did you make your way into chess was it this year was it 2022 was it in the last 5 years have you been watching for 10 years did you get back into the game did you just pick the game up right so many incredible things earlier this year the average age of people getting into the game was middle school and high school because elementary school kids don't have phones yet they they don't go on social media that much middle school and high school queen's gambit it was a bit older cheating scandal it was everybody and i'll talk about that a bit later with my book and book tours and the incredible lifetime value and and and loyalty and commitment of folks to the game of chess but january was absolutely massive then february march we're also strong april world championship ding len versus yan pishi a crazy match a match where yan pishi was in his second world championship ever i thought he had a slight edge going into the match he led the match yan pishi led the match dingly ren came back not just to tie the match but also to win it in a fourth game playoff the'th game of the match this is a clip where nepo basically shoves the pieces down the board and he can't believe it and yeah the other crazy story is that there was no magnus carlson there was no magnus carlson involved in this world championship and the reason for that is he doesn't want to play he doesn't think there is much to game he finds classical chess to be extremely boring extremely stressful and the truth is i'm a firm believer in the fact that if the world chess championship was like winning the us open in tennis or like winning wimbledon in tennis we had the right sponsors we had the right tv and broadcasting deal the players pricee funds were 5x 10x what they currently are maybe we would get magnus to play because it would be a really big deal but the way the current format is is it's a 14 game classical chess match which you have a year to prepare for you have to hire a team of people and classical chess is a 6-hour game where you you all are are using super computers to create opening ideas and try to get your opponent out of their preparation and every single move carries so much weight and gravity and there's so much time there's so much time at the board to figure out all the problems it's just not worth it at the end of the day for magnus he's already the five-time champ so that was weird this is the first world championship we ever had in the last decade where we didn't have magnus carlson and dingly ren won but then dingly ren did not play another tournament dingle ren won the world championship in april of 2023 he had registered for a tournament right after which he played and then he never played again he never played again he might have played like one or two games in china but i don't think i think he went back to china and never emerged i'm not even sure he did that much media now the thing is the winner of the the world championship ding nepo you would think would have had the full backing of the nation like if if yan pomi became the world champion you know we know obviously there is a tremendous amount of russian history and culture and influence in the game of chess you know in modern times it's rightfully so it's a bit of of a sensitive conversation and 100% justified but the truth is the soviet union has had world champions since 1950 so it could have maybe been something good for the game but if ding won i thought well maybe the chinese will get into chess there's one and you know what is the population one and a half billion something like that i was very optimistic but then we never saw ding again and that's a shame it's really a shame it's a weird situation we we're kind of in a weird it's a weird thing let me turn on this light i i have this really strong yellow reflection cuz i like i i have a setting on my computer that's like nightlight light so it's easier on the eyes but it makes there we go this is my makes my teeth look much more yellow than they actually are which is just not that's just not a good look you know i go to the dentist i promise i'm a normal person hair could use some work though but you know we'll figure that out so that was weird that was weird and it's a shame that the ultimate title in the game of chess itself is the world championship and we can't seem to figure out the international governing body of the game can't can't seem to figure out how to how to how to get a scale going on the whole thing you know i'm sure you've had this experience you look at the world championship or you look at some of these events that are put on by the organizing body and you're like where are the sponsors that i'm used to seeing the microsoft the banks car companies the watches how has chess not had a watch sponsor how does that make any sense we got a clock the whole thing is there's a clock involved like where's the watch sponsor for chess you know what i mean that's it's it's it's a it's a problem it's a problem and that was the world championship and you know my thoughts on it are it's a gigantic shame that magnus is not playing and and i don't blame the guy because the upside is not there he's clearly proven he's the best player in the world he doesn't need to play this title thing which just is a massive stress inducing thing and there's not a whole lot to gain and it's also a shame that we didn't get to see ding again obviously i'm wishing ding all the best healthwise mental physical you know all that but yeah it's a shame it's it's really it's really a shame that we're not you know we're not seeing him again and i don't know i i i mean i really really hope he returns that's about all i can say now then it was then it was peaceful we obviously had some other updates we had updates like magnus winning the world cup that was a big thing that was one of the things that he had not won yet and we had we had hans demon we had the sorry light mode they don't have a dark mode the the hans demon lawsuit was dismissed i guess they settled we'll never know we nobody's ever going to know hans demon got reinstated to chess.com and then you know he he he kind of went to be the bad boy of the game and very curious to see how hans develops in the chess world i have said from the very very beginning that i think if hans just sat in front of a camera and just said i did some stupid stuff when i was a teenager and i've never cheated over the board i can understand why people are suspicious but i can assure you like i'm 100% legit blah blah blah you know he would have a lot of fans but he's kind of going a villain route like first he attacked alexander botes on on twitter and then he came after me for a video title and he you know is ribbing at hikaru because of the whole lawsuit thing and you know it's he he's free to do what he wants i'm not his adviser he has plenty of those i would imagine but i'm not sure that that was the best course of action but i ain't him and i'm mostly just sitting on the sidelines eating the popcorn right now let's talk a little bit about analytics i've timestamped it we'll pause in august of this year because the last quarter of the year was very big very very big and i personally experienced a lot of you know growth and over the last three to four months i've been doing a lot of thinking and the thinking that i have been doing is i want to evolve as more than just a chess youtuber i i understand you might come here on a daily basis you might learn from me i might make you laugh i'll cover a magnus game i'll cover low elo chess ai chess whatever whatever it might be i might play some games myself oh my god my nose is so itchy and then it's just great like we're just enjoying chess but at theend but my i'm trying to adjust my my goal for the next three to five years into certain buckets right so number one i want to do cooler things on youtube i don't just want to sit here and talk for 30 minutes i want to maybe get out into the world i want to do deep dive videos coffeezilla esque videos he's a he's a big scam exposer he's very good at like uncovering all these different schemes like i i don't think there's big elaborate schemes or scams going on in chess but i want to get to the bottom of certain issues like the history of of women in chess women's titles women's tournaments sexism and certain issues that they face like and and uncovering just that's a very serious subject for example or you know just more fun content like going out into the public and and and playing people and the person that lasts the longest against me wins a very expensive chess set or something along those lines or limited series types of content for a netflix or a hulu if they're watching please sponsor this please pay attention you know and the the whole purpose is to generate as many new eyeballs as possible for the game but also improve the current experiences of the people in it for the last 6 months 1 year 2 years 3 years five years etc with the courses with chesley like some of you might not know but like that is that's that's all those are all my courses and that is my educational chess platform and i want i'm i'm going to work really really hard in 2024 to make it the best chess learning experience possible i'm going to make sure you want to use it every single day and that that courses aren't just something you spend money on like going to the gym you spend money and like that's it you know and then you you don't do it again different types of content that i'm thinking about live fan events okay live fan events like for the book all these different things that i'm thinking about media media around chess i just interviewed magnus carlson some of you well most of you probably watch that interview i want to do more of that i want to get an hour with magnus i want to get an hour with fabiano hikaro an geary i want to talk to these guys humanize them make them do fun challenges against me answer serious and tough questions about their career or life and i and i just want that to get out there because we need to think about what the future is beyond magnus and hikaru we need to think about the n abdulov the dennis lavic of the world the pranas of the world etc etc we need to build media around those guys because the same way you watch sports cuz you care about athletes or teams we need people to watch chess to care about athletes there's no teams but to care about athletes to care about the things that they're competing for and that's that's going to be my focus and i'm g to i'm going to build bigger than youtube you know and and that's that's really my plan speaking of youtube i told you i would give you some analytics so here you go this is straight from the source first i will show you 2022 numbers this is very interesting stuff these numbers are only available for 90 days in 2022 shorts were not a big part of my channel but my content was recommended 4 and a half billion times which is a number that i have i have i have talked about quite a bit and ultimately it was clicked on you know this many times and that's from impressions versus subscriber feed and that that's that's a very fascinating number and then this year 2023 is is really wild 9.3 billion 900 million from shorts and 54 million from videos the major concern when you have too many short views is that people watch your shorts content but they don't come for your long form content i haven't really seen that to be the case mostly when people find me on the shorts feed they end up watching a longer video or they end up watching a highlight and i do find that to be very fascinating the audience is also very fascinating this year you know we you can track like new viewers and and all this information but what i find to be really interesting is like subscribed and not subscribed is 50/50 the geography is really interesting and the age like i said this year got younger so if you look at 2022 it's actually 38 31 and then this is five and then this year you know short form is very much like a young audience type of thing which is why sometimes i you know my my content gets accused of being very the content is very childish or but it's not true like a ton of people are watching and it's it is it it is very interesting to see this stuff this is also straight out of analytics this is instagram over the last 30 days here in december 22 million accounts were reached that don't follow and this is all different chess content right se this number says 72 million impressions i can't scroll out 72 million and the point of of showing this is again what i just said my whole purpose with everything that i'm doing is to build for you the current audience but also try to convince as many people around the world to play chess as i can because chess is a is a very unique piece i mean just of life in general but let's just say specifically of content i'm not a person who has a very specific audience that is very loyal that's going to buy my merch that's going to do this that's going to do that that's going to go to my events it's not like i'm building around this chess is ageless kids come up to me who are five and six years old and they play with their older siblings they play with their parents people come up to me we 25 30 35 70 75 people connect with relatives people connect with generations people play at their local bar they play somewhere like it's it's an incredible thing where the it doesn't matter what age you are it doesn't matter where you live in the world you can actually play this game and you can watch the content and you can relearn chess or you can learn it for the first time it's really beautiful and i found that i'm not the biggest channel there's youtubers that have 100 million subscribers or 50 million or 20 million but that doesn't matter to me because all i do is i just share my passion and love for the game and i'm just trying to grow it as big as possible cuz cuz i only have a certain amount of energy and time left and and i'm the guy to do it you know that's kind of what i've what i've realized over the last let's say year year and a half i'm i have very strong sense of empathy and understanding how people perceive something specifically as it pertains to chess how they see chess on a screen how they visualize components of a of an analysis board and what we should be showing and what we shouldn't be showing how we how we can make the best chess viewing experience possible and with all that in mind that's how this thing happened how to win a chess a modern chess book designed to be the best first chess book anybody ever reads and i just want you all to know i've i've shown this many times but every move is highlighted at the end of the chapters there's qr codes you scan the qr codes and it's a really pretty book it's hard cover and the incredible thing is it's now in spanish with some mistakes there are some translation mist mistakes always in four editions it's going to get fixed i got a german edition right here germans do their own thing they they like black books it doesn't even look like the same book but it's here we i have a an addition that's coming out in greek italian cck polish french isn't that nuts like that is mind-blowing over 53,000 books have been bought 53,000 the book's been out for two months and it was designed to be the best first chess book you could read it is supposed to take you from literal nothingness demystify the game make it funny make it exciting make it interesting and get you on boarded to the level of an advanced beginner or an early intermediate and i did exactly the same approach that was exactly why i did it that way because everybody has preconceived notions about this game everybody whether they're young or whether they're old everybody has a preconceived notion about themselves about learning this game how hard it is and i wanted all of that to go away and it's been wild i mean i've traveled in the us i've traveled to london to do fan events and i'm going to do a real world tour in 2024 i'm going to go to europe i'm going to go back to england i'm going to travel around the us a little bit because it's been crazy just meeting folks that stand for like two three hours in line just to chat for a few minutes just to get me to sign their book tell me their story why they're into chess they play it with their kid they play it with their grandpa like they play it with their spouse i mean it's really it's really a beautiful thing and it's just what i want to be building behind and this makes me super excited as a last little thing that's you know this this might be a nice humble brag i got on a new york times magazine cover this was super cool i have a paper edition coming as well if you haven't read this read it it's pretty it's you know and then forbes 30 under 30 which apparently i learned is a cursed list and i'm going to end up in jail or something hopefully not i i'd like to think i haven't i haven't done anything illegal not that i know of anyway so that's you know that's the chess update the chess update is that in december of this year we had we obviously had a lot of different dramas end up going down as well kramnick and hikaru magnus winning just about everything in his path and we've got a very interesting situation in chess we have a boom that's now lasted from 2020 to 2023 we are higher now than we've ever been as i showed you from some of those analytics way beyond and way way higher than we've been in the queen's gambit now it's about building for the future now it's about putting sustainable things in place i want to build a foundation i want to build a nonprofit i want to give high school maybe and college scholarship grant to people who use chess to improve their lives and other people's lives around them i want to tackle bigger issues as well in the world of chess i want to have some sort of say or contribution into the future media and and building behind all the players both current and the future players as well like the teenagers and and then doing as many interviews with these players and traveling around the world and interviewing players at tournaments building a gotham chess club here in new york city if you're watching this and you're working a hedge fund private equity reach out i'm going to need investors you know what i mean i've had people reach out as well you know making my courses platform as welcoming and easy to use as possible make it as fun for all of you as possible those all of you of courses thank you so much for your support getting out there meeting people in germany and spain and in in the you know in uk in america who have the english version of the book like i want to do all this stuff and i'm super excited it's been a it's been a really incredible year it's been the best year ever 2021 was unbelievable but 2023 is the best year that chess ever had ever it's not even close you wouldn't even imagine the possibilities that some of you have for giving lessons or contributing to your local community center or applying to college doing some community service hours through chess or you just you can't even imagine all the possibilities i really urge you to to think about it to consider it more and i'm going to try my best to not just be the youtube chess guy i'm going to get out there i'm going to meet many of you around the world through the book through live guest the elo events i'm going to try to work on the next big media push and be at the forefront of that for the world of chess whether it's through limited series or interviewing players or building whatever that next next media package might look like i'm going to obviously keep making videos as well and covering top tournaments and making fun exciting content for all of you the gotham chess club here in new york camps maybe a elevated podcast will come in the future collaborations with athletes or or or celebs i got a lot of interesting ideas and i'm really excited for 2024 and once again happy new year to all of you thank
