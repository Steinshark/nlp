beast hoodie you're wearing. - oh, thank you. - or, party beast. - well, look what chandler got. oh dude, this is game over. - and it got the double strap. - i don't know if you saw, but garrett dropped
beef jerky and he lost. so he didn't get anything, 'cause he dropped one thing, one thing. - it's tragic, so tragic. - you're gonna need a plunger. - i already got a plunger, dude. first thing i buy is a plunger. - you take viking sized poops. - good job, there you go. yay. - can i also get "sekiro"? there you go, right there, oh yeah. - rollercoaster? - no, i don't need it. - but why not? - i would like to check out. - so so far we're at two grand. i told you i was gonna beat chandler. - so right here as you see it, there's an l, i'm gonna
have to hand that to you. - i'll just add it to my collection. - well, at least you got stuff. i went to party city, i have
a dora the explorer costume. - yeah, that's true, here you, sorry. - yeah, thank you, i'll take this l. - i have too many anyways. - all right, jake spent $2,500. - the champion. - chris, it is your turn, draw a store. - fusion skate shop. - did you just fart? all right, fusion it is. - oh my god, my car smells like a sewer. - i'm gonna get the squad sunglasses. and then apparently get this
blouse 'cause i touched it. - you didn't have to grab it. - it just was a complete
reaction and now i have this. just gonna go ahead. - you're cute, man. - thanks, man. oh, look a doggo. if i touch it, can i buy it? - no. - i'm going to pick out
five pairs of sunglasses. all right, i'm gonna facetime my mom and get her to pick them out. hey, what's up? i'm gonna turn the camera around and you tell me which one's dad wants. - the bottom ones, yeah. - appreciate it. - what am i getting? - i don't know, what do you want? - i've always wanted a surfboard. - get it chris, he's
gonna get you a surfboard. - i'll get you a surfboard. - love you, bud. - love you too, bye. so i facetime my parents, ask my dad what he wants, sunglasses, easy. my mom wants a surfboard. that's heavy, all right. - if you have any issues,
blame it on your mom. can we just stop filming
and play with dogs? - grab that baker board. all right, now the very bottom lock board. all right, now put the shorts on top. check out, check out,
check out, check out. - one more item. - this is really complicated. no, just put it on the surfboard, we can pile things on the surfboard. stop adding things, it's so heavy and it's official. - since it's a skate
shop, it only makes sense for him to go down the ramp with all the stuff he just bought. if he drops it, he can't keep it. all right chris, don't drop anything. - i landed on my nuts. something hit me. - guys, the sunglasses
are okay, we're good. since you've sacrificed your
nuts, you can keep everything. let that be a lesson,
if you drop something and sacrificed your balls,
i'll let you keep it. hannah is one of our trio of editors. please draw a store. don't look, don't look. - no! - wait, what does it say, let's see. - it says dollar tree. - dollar tree it is. all right, we'll see you there. - okay, hannah, what's your game plan? - now my game plan is probably find the most expensive thing i possibly can. which will probably be a dollar. - whatever you can carry, have at it. - we'll do it one time. - all right, but guys,
you have to have two. - oof. - get something for ethan. - oh my gosh, what would ethan want? - dog food. dog food. - okay, so we're having an easter party and we're gonna get lots of chickens. - don't let her drop it. - i love how you're making easter baskets and we don't even know when easter is. - what if it's today? - happy easter, happy fool day, happy- - look, it looks like ethan. which one reminds you the most of ethan? - that's ethan. chris, how do you feel about ethan? he's not editing this video

"frozen" tattoos. okay. - put it back. - okay, i'm sorry. - this is gonna be the game. the main attraction of the party. for six years and older. chandler, you can't play. - it's gonna take you six years to put that together? - let's get out of this dollar store. let's go to ours, ours was way better. all right hannah, congratulations. - thanks. - you having trouble there? - no, i think it's going fine. - this is fine. - many of you may not know this, but we're actually still
