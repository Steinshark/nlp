hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by qualcomm we're going to look at what the future of cars entails and also discuss the question are today's cars too complicated to dive into these questions qualcomm brought me to ces a trade show demonstrating the latest in technology and innovation with a massively growing automotive segment and if you're wondering wait a minute what does qualcomm have to do with cars you might be surprised to learn that they're already working with pretty much all of the major automakers but back to wandering the halls of ces it's apparent that the future of cars is not a continuation of the mentality that they're purely a tool from getting from a to b but that they're an extension of your daily living and working environment connecting you to your devices minimizing the burden of driving providing entertainment and creating a safer architecture for transportation though if there's an inevitable truth to humanity it's that for better or worse change is not always met with open arms so let's start off with a question the comment section is likely already addressing are today's cars too complicated i want to focus on three major points first the maintenance concerns second the cost concerns and third what historically has happened starting with maintenance personally i find this to be a strong argument against the continual complexities introduced in cars though technology has also served to make this process easier on one hand as cars become more and more computerized the requirement for specialty diagnostic and repair tools can increase at the same time we've never had more access to low-cost digital diagnostic tools as well as very good free online tutorials for how to fix our cars it's also worth mentioning that the vast majority of consumers rely on dealerships and third-party shops for car maintenance while personally i may want the job to be easy and accessible the reality is most car buyers rely on service centers and the complexity of the job only matters if it means it's going to cost way more to maintain so speaking of cost let's get into the rising prices of cars considering all of the new technology that's getting packed in take for example a honda civic a very common and popular sedan in the year 2000 the four-door sedan started at 14 930 20 years later that same four-door trims msrp was 20 thousand dollars taking into consideration inflation at about two percent over twenty years the two thousand civic would cost about twenty two thousand five hundred dollars in twenty twenty so the starting price of the civic is actually cheaper today than it was 20 years ago and yet with way more features way more technology and highly improved safety so while it's packed with all kinds of new systems the cost really hasn't gone up and yet new vehicle transaction prices are at all time highs as of october 2021 the average u.s transaction price for a new vehicle is over 46 000 10 years earlier that was about 30 thousand dollars so average transaction prices have far exceeded inflation what caused this well there are many factors including costs related to limited supply but also u.s consumers are buying larger vehicles and they're buying more luxury vehicles at higher prices so for example the most expensive trim of the ford f-150 offered in the year 2000 started at about 30 000. in 2020 the most expensive trim started at over seventy thousand dollars so while the bottom of car prices have remained mostly in check with inflation companies are now offering significantly more expensive models packed with features and technologies and well people are buying them which leads us to the third point regarding the complication of cars what has happened historically because truthfully whether you're an enthusiast who wants a bare bones car with a raw driving experience or a techie that wants all the latest features the overall market has been doing the same thing since its existence pick a car from absolutely any decade say the year 1990 you'll notice a significant drop in features and technologies going back to 1980 or 1970 or when computers were first introduced in cars in the 1960s jump ahead and you'll see a massive increase in tech as you leap from 1990 to 2000 2010 and 2020. cars get more complicated with time because we come up with new technologies new ways of thinking new demands and new ways of winning over customers while it feels like it's a continuous argument that today's cars are too complex it's entirely true that historically this has always been the case things advance whether you're ready for it or not and today we're in a really special moment where this transformation is happening rather rapidly thanks in large part due to the advancement in computers and processing technology and after exploring the halls of ces i'd like to focus on three key aspects of what we can expect today and in the near future first the digital chassis second autonomous driving and third vehicle connectivity the chassis of a vehicle is the structural framework that serves as the vehicle's foundation the bones of the car so to speak but as we introduce modern touchscreens cameras sensors and customization qualcomm has created what they're calling the snapdragon digital chassis the physical bones as well as the software upon which to build the many digital elements of a modern car they created a demo of this technology at ces with their processors powering the eight screens on board there's an interesting challenge in the automotive industry here for example the average age of cars on the road in the united states is about 12 years old so automotive computers need to be future proofed for far longer than other similar technologies used in consumer electronics we can't have cars that become irrelevant in three years so the hardware needs to allow for the software to continuously change and keep up with the times this also means that modern cars aren't likely to remain the exact same over their lifetime when you buy a laptop or a cell phone you'll get updates over time that change the product if not the operating system entirely that mentality will pass through to cars and in fact for many makes and models it already has but it will continue to become increasingly common it's important to note that when discussing these technologies qualcomm isn't trying to referee what they think is good or bad they're simply supplying the hardware and software options and allowing the manufacturers to choose a la carte what features they want built into their cars they can incorporate as little or as much as they'd like or scale the offerings depending on the trim of the vehicle purchased and i think this is a really interesting time for car interiors where some companies are doing it right and others are creating things overly complex and difficult to use turning on your windshield wipers shouldn't be buried beneath three layers of touch screen menus nor should accessing defrost for your windshield people like volume knobs and physical hvac buttons because with commonly used physical buttons muscle memory means you don't have to take your eyes off the road for very long if at all to adjust settings but things like resetting your tire pressure monitoring system after changing over from summer to winter tires yeah it doesn't have to be super prominent and it's still a very useful feature not requiring a physical button which can be built into the menu system another thing to think about is that the devices in our pockets are incredibly customizable and that's intentional there's an overall platform in place but ultimately the user is responsible for the layout of apps and how they're organized cars will begin to mimic this allowing the driver to customize the layout to their liking these interior changes become even more inevitable with a major shift in the driving experience as autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems become the norm there are a lot a lot a lot of wild marketing claims put out there in the autonomous space so let's start this off with a very clear definition of what autonomous driving actually means sae defines this in five levels for level one and level two if you're in the driver's seat you are driving level one means the car assists with either steering or accelerating and braking level two means the car assists with both simultaneously for example lane centering and adaptive cruise control together it's important to note that all of today's road cars claiming some form of autonomous driving are currently level two systems you the driver are most definitely still in charge and liable for whatever happens for levels three through five you are no longer driving the difference between three and four is that with level three the car can request that you must take over the driving if it requests you must drive both levels 3 and 4 are limited in what conditions they'll operate in they'll have their own checklist and only operate if that checklist is met finally there's level 5 autonomy where the car will drive in any condition and like level 4 it won't require the driver to take over control for level 4 and especially for level 5 pedals and steering wheels might not even be in the car qualcomm's current goal is to offer their snapdragon ride platform which is essentially an autonomous driving kit that manufacturers can select and use for their cars they believe level 2 and level 3 systems will be the most popular through the 2020s decade so that's their initial offering goal they've already partnered with gm for helping support their ultra crews a more advanced version of gm's supercruise autonomous system and again they leave the choice up to the manufacturer as far as which sensors to use whether that be cameras radar lidar or any combination cameras are great for object detection and recognition but they're challenged by things like fog and snow radar is great for accurately measuring the speed of nearby vehicles and lidar is great for creating a realistic image of the surrounding environment that the vehicle can use for decision making though it is currently expensive i was able to experience qualcomm's autonomous driving on the streets of las vegas of course with a driver ready to take over at any moment and an engineer in the back monitoring the status of the system the really big question that genuinely seems to not have an answer at the moment is where does this technology top out at there's a quote i really like that sums this up only humans are dumb enough to think that they can drive in all conditions robots are smarter than that to me it's not hard to think of a scenario where a computer would struggle to drive say you're on a mountain pass with steep drop-offs no guard rails thick fog and snow oh and for fun let's just say there's lava on the road it's an unwinnable scenario and yet we get news stories all the time of people driving trucks under bridges that their vehicle doesn't fit under or through flooded roads which vehicles are incapable of forwarding so there's this weird ceiling in the technology that has to occur where the manufacturer takes on the liability for their actions their car chooses to make but also has to ensure that the vehicle is functional in all the scenarios a human might need it in scenarios where the car has to choose between multiple unwinnable options what's supposed to happen we don't really know yet this leads us to our final point on future technologies to be incorporated into cars and that's connectivity we already touched on this briefly in that internet and 5g connectivity allows for the vehicle's onboard features to be updated while the car sits in your garage at home but connectivity will extend well beyond this in what is called cellular vehicle to everything or cv2x with cv to x your car can communicate with surrounding vehicles infrastructure pedestrians and networks and can greatly help with safety especially in the sense of autonomous driving if your car is alerted of all the surrounding vehicles people and buildings as well as traffic information and traffic like data it can use this information to safely navigate a surrounding with far less dependence on predicting what will happen around it because it's already being fed that information there are fascinating technologies coming into play in this space and there are also very big very legitimate questions as to how they might end up implemented i don't know where we'll end up but i enjoyed roaming the floors of ces to get a glimpse at where folks think this industry is headed a big thank you to qualcomm for sponsoring the video and as always thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
