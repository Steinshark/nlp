what's in your view is the difference between our perception, how we think the world is, and reality? do you think there's a huge gap there? we delude ourselves the
whole thing is an illusion with just everything
about human psychology, the way we see things and
how things actually are. in all the things you've
studied, what's your sense? how big is the gap between reality and-- - well again, purely speculative, i think that we will
never know the answer. we cannot know the answer. there is no experiment to find
an answer to that question. everything we experience
is an event in our brain. when i look at a cat, i'm not even, i can't prove that there's a cat there. all i am experiencing is

video game because of neglect, versus a real cat? it seems very different
to us psychologically. i don't really feel bad
about, "all my gosh, "i forgot to feed my tamagotchi," right? but i would feel terrible
if i forgot to feed my actual cats.
