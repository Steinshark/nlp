everyone and their dog is still angry over the outrageous pricing of nvidia's rtx 4000 series but if you're trying to figure out some way to justify the expense it's worth considering their dlss 3.0 the newest version of team green's ai powered tech that gives you much better performance in games without absolutely thrashing your gpu and it's only officially available on the 4000 series so is it worth it if you're not familiar with nvidia's previous generations of dlss here's a quick primer the basic idea is that instead of asking your gpu to render every frame at your preferred resolution from scratch it uses a machine learning algorithm that runs on special tensor cores that live on your graphics card this algorithm attempts to upscale images with little to no discernible quality loss so if your card is having a difficult time rendering a game at say 1080p the idea is that you enable dlss set it to performance and instead you just have your gpu cores render the game at 540p with dlss filling in the blanks to give you a 1080p image that is almost as good as native resolution for far less computational effort but the specifics of how the ai works have gone through several revisions dlss 1.0 released in 2019 relied on a neural network that was trained against specific games by a supercomputer at an nvidia facility reception to the feature was mixed at the time but dlss 2.0 was much more warmly received when it debuted in 2020. not only did 2.0 run better on your card's tensor course but it had a more generalized ai model that was still generated by nvidia's supercomputer but didn't have to be trained on specific games making it more broadly applicable dlss 3.0 which was just released does everything its predecessor does but takes things a step further with one really cool feature and we'll tell you what it is right after we think msi for sponsoring this video msi's meg z790 ace is their new eatx motherboard built with overclocking your processor memory and graphics card in mind with support for 12 and 13th gen intel cpus and ddr5 memory the z790 ace is great for your next high-end build and its 8 layer pcb with two ounce thickened copper provides high performance and long lasting stability without compromises to learn more about msi's motherboards check out the link down below the big change with dlss 3.0 is what team green is calling the optical flow accelerator kind of sounds like a part of a time traveling delorean but what it's actually doing is inserting entirely new frames between the ones that your gpu has already rendered here's how it works the ai examines two sequential frames from the game you're playing specifically looking for how the pixels are moving from frame to frame each pixel is examined for changes in lighting reflections and particle behavior to create what nvidia calls and optical flow field basically a model of pixel movement dlss also keeps track of how geometry in the game changes such as how the road moves below the character on their motorcycle in the example that we're showing although it is possible to generate frames for smoother motion just by looking at geometry quality can suffer as other effects like lighting won't be tracked correctly as you can see in this example where the shadow cast by the motorcycle is distorted but dlss 3.0 combines the optical flow field with geometry tracking to give more accurate inserted frames giving you significantly higher frame rates while maintaining image accuracy it'll be interesting to see just how high you can push frame rates in popular games now that dlss is inserting entire artificial frames in between frames that were already being upscaled by dlss nvidia is claiming that your gpu only has to render 1 8 of the pixels that it would have to for similar performance and quality without dlss unfortunately the official line from nvidia is that dlss 3.0 is only supported on the new rtx 4000 series of cards the report has already come out that the restriction is due to a simple software lock one player was able to bypass it and double his performance in the notoriously demanding cyberpunk 2077 while using a now two generations old rtx 2070 though there were some stability issues we're going to keep our fingers crossed that nvidia will officially remove this restriction in the near future especially since they probably want to clear out some stock of their existing 3000 series products keep in mind though even if it does happen it's unlikely to work as well as it should on 4000 series due to its less powerful hardware another caveat of dlss is that it's still a very sophisticated form of guessing as to what an individual frame should look like so depending on your game and your specific hardware your mileage may vary and it could add significant latency to your gameplay even if the image quality is great so maybe dlss 4.0 will come out with such a good ai that it can render artificial frames and even play the game for me i can only hope
