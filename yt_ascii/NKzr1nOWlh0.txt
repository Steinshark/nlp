all right for those that don't know who j blow is is that he's a fairly controversial software dev it seems like his takes can be really hard but there's a lot of things that i agree with him on and there's a lot of things i don't he's one of the funnest people i think to watch and discuss his ideas so let's do that now you remember me saying something like do you think einstein believes in work-life balance in some giant bomb discussion video in order to talk to the life balance well it's not even that it's like the concept of work life balance assumes that you don't care about work and that work is not an important part of your life okay because it's offsetting work versus life and okay if you have a job and you're not that interested in the actual work at the job and you're doing it to earn a living which is a totally reasonable thing then that concept makes sense but if you're fortunate enough to have work that you really care about then the idea of work-life balance ceases to as it is popularly explained in current american culture it really doesn't make sense anymore i could buy that i can buy that argument which is i definitely think there's a function there's a there's definitely like some sort of you know continuous function of what you're doing what what you're doing and how much you love what you're doing versus how much time you're willing to put in even hours that you don't get paid for the amount of mental thought effort when you're sitting in a shower you know i do think he's also right that we do have this weird you know distinction that life is purely no work and work is purely no life i mean i think these are good these are good takes these are good initial takes thank you for calling me more educational than any other tv science channels yes that's because tv science channels are pop signs pop science is stupid and so the the problem that i have is that people who talk about work-life balance do not bring into the discussion this situation where work is actually good for you and enjoyable right and i think that warps the discussion terribly because you cease to see a lot of possibility that is open to you you saw a tweet of john carmack once saying he was never forced to work 80 to 90 hours per week on the other end he said that he enjoys working 60 hours minimum because he wants to yes and the thing that i would add as well and i don't like to bring this up in discussions because it's talking about somebody else and i don't i don't really know how john c's life went and i can't really say anything about it but the way i think about it is like look he's a very famous programmer known for having accomplished really big stuff okay just let them cook people okay i'm very excited about what's about to happen here all right do you think that he would be the famous john carmack if during the 1990s he clocked out at 5 pm every day and went to the nightclub or like whatever right no i think there's a very fast able opinion today you'll see this everywhere right i guarantee you in this chat right now when i say this i want if you disagree with me i want you to say something okay i want you to say something if you disagree with me there's people in this chat that say that people who are intellectual workers can't exceed so many hours a day of working something like you know five hours a day is your really your maximum good and if you're doing anything more than that it's not it's not it's not really worth it a lot of people would say that i say that's [ __ ] that's what i say that's how i feel about the situation i think that when properly motivated of which i've been properly motivated many times in my lifetime i i don't think it's hard to work intense thoughtful work for about 12 hours a day but it's all about motivation it's all about motivation you know when you're when when you're at here's here's a little story about my life i've briefly brought this up from time to time but when you live in an apartment and the person below you is smoking meth and have threatened to kill you on multiple times you and your wife don't you think you might work a touch harder in a touch more intense about things because of your situation where you feel like if you fail you're going to be homeless if you feel like if you're not going to be able to do things like life is going to be ruined well guess what when i was properly super motivated not only was i motivated by the person downstairs trying to kill me in my situation i was also motivated because i liked what i was doing i would program straight for 36 hours i don't know i could i can't do it i literally cannot do that anymore but when i was 25 i would sit and i'd program from 8 am one day up until 10 pm the next night just constantly going i loved it i absolutely loved it i thought it was fantastic i could just be perpetually motivated to do it and it has great greatly absolutely completely changed the trajectory of my career no you can't call the cops on that because now it gets to he said she said you know what i mean oh i didn't say that yeah you did no i didn't yeah you did now i do i think you should program that much no i don't think you should i don't think it's healthy i don't think it's good for you don't do that it was bad on me on my part i had no self-control i should have i should have taken the time to sleep and properly do a nice eight hours of of sleeping every single night i think that that would have been a very good move on my behalf i would have probably been a lot more you know successful upstairs you know this is your brain not sleeping you know like it would have been much much much better than me but i was motivated by two factors which is need and desire and that just caused like a huge huge huge like influx into my life oh no it's just it was just interesting i'm just saying that you know i don't think this five i i think that humans are much more capable than they they think they are that's all i'm saying i think that we can do a lot more a lot a lot more but we live in a world where there's virtually no needs and there's a lot of wants and what i mean by no needs is that none of us probably in this chat yeah none of us are probably wondering when we will have our next meal real talk i bet you there's nobody in this chat that has that feeling that's a very different feeling right there's people today that feel that way they're they're gonna have a much different motivation than we are like they'll they will fundamentally act different than we will we have a lot of needs how many people in this chat want some stupid tesla or some car like that who here wants a ferrari right that doesn't motivate you you know what i mean that doesn't make you it doesn't make you any better once wants don't they don't do anything for you needs tend to drive and when you start losing your needs i feel like it just starts it starts it starts changing your world a lot and i feel like it's really easy to be just feel really meaninglessness you know what i mean i don't know just thought anyways let's keep on going on this no he wouldn't be he wouldn't be the greatest not only because he would have only gotten half the stuff done that he did or less than half the stuff done they did but because he wouldn't be as good as he is because putting in the hours is how you get good dude straight up that's that's just such a people hate that phrase especially on twitter twitter hates that phrase if there's ever been something i've gotten more [ __ ] on twitter for than saying the word work hard do we'll do it right now we'll do it right now and i bet you within a small period of time some shitty thing will be said working hard is good tweet that capital letter and all boomer tweet let's go paste it by the end of the day i will have several people being like well actually there's a caveat to that thing actually the caveat is that corporations and then it's just like okay i don't even know what's hat what the hell are we talking about at this point all right let's get back to this okay it always happens you know it happens you know it happens where's your asterisks you need to describe everything okay so like this is also missing from these discussions of work-life balance like okay let me put it this way people seem to understand that if you want to be in the olympics as a an olympic class i love this argument by the way you have to train very heavily for many years when you're like a teenager because you have to be young to perform at high levels right it's so much more than that that people have no idea my brother-in-law swam got sixth place in beijing breaststroke and dude like what he had to do to do that is just like it makes my it makes it makes what i did nothing right like when i hear his stories of like how hard you have to bust ass to be at that it's just like it's such a completely different world it's just it just feels different and i think there's one thing that is a little bit different which is that you are using your body and i do think that using your body has a completely different experience than using your brain like there it is very different and so you can't bust an ass is a lot different than bustin brain you know what i mean it's just it's just a different experience i really have been enjoying my recent workout routine which we've talked about yesterday where i've been every single time i use the bathroom i do 100 of something except when i'm on stream i didn't do 100 or something it's it's really it's i i feel so much better you know using your body is a great thing and so that's why i think this olympic argument is both great and horrible because it's just you can't just use your body if you feel worse and worse you i mean you can't just use your brain it feels worse and worse and worse whereas if you use your brain and your body it feels great you know what i mean people understand that but they somehow don't understand that the same thing is true for other disciplines right look if you want to be a world class if you want to be an olympic programmer you have to put in the training that should be obvious right and it's not for some people i don't know why like you can't clock out at five every day and compete in the olympics that's not how that works yeah it's just not yeah i'm on that saying you can like what you do and still one o'clock i i will say i'm slightly bit offended by this line right here if you can't see it it says sublime project right here okay i'm a little hurt a little hurt right now seeing the words sublime but okay we'll keep on going i mean i'm also hurt by the whole fact of this windows but he's a game deaf game devs love windows okay it makes perfect sense not offended by that clock out at five that's fine that's totally cool like if you enjoy working you know nine to five or whatever with a three hour lunch and then and then you got some stuff done that day and then you want to go to the movies or something that's cool that's i'm not objecting to that yeah i'm just saying that if that's your life choice just realize you're not going to be one of the best programmers that's just how it is that seems completely and people want anybody disagree with that statement is there a singular is if type one in the chat if you think that what he said is wrong i mean there is these small possibility there is that exceptionally gifted individual that can literally look at anything and forever understand it i'm not that person i'll just never be that person but besides for that that unicorn of a person floundering around on this world so there are a few people that think that no way dude tell me okay mayor why how do you think that you can clock in nine to five and be an olympic level you gotta hit me hit me with some facts right now because i i have to know because it just seems so it just seems so implausible to me one i just wanted attention okay that's no problem but i i am curious if you believe that help me understand do [ __ ] at home absolutely i think you should do [ __ ] at home maybe she's born with it she could be born with it absolutely there is there is a person that can be born with it i totally believe that no clearly not okay cool says it too the hussein bolt of programming built differently plus hard work absolutely absolutely hussein bolt would not be a famous person if he did not put in the hours right yeah i'm not saying only your job he was making it very clear you go in there recuperation six hours of intense as hell 12 hours of rest and six hours of needs and socializing i don't think you will make it to an olympic level programmer straight up with that six you missed what mayor said oh what did he say can somebody what was it it was a mayor sorry can i click on it oh i can't click on it user a mayor there we go because i am curious i i'm trying i'm trying to understand this consistency though can make you achieve great things without sacrificing absolutely you could definitely get like single a baseball for sure i am fully on that team for those that don't know there's three levels of baseball in the professional world right there's single a double a and triple a triple a is like the majors and then the other two are like a minor slash feeder leagues and so the majors obviously not only are you practicing as hard or harder than anyone in the double a in single a you also have a bit of gifting so there's always going to be a gifting i don't know if i have that gifting i i personally think it was just hard work that got me where i was i don't think i'm somehow exceptionally smarter than anybody i don't think i'm somehow person that's like some sort of amazing individual intellectually i'm not an intellectual powerhouse i'm just a dude who tries really hard of course it's exaggeration there's only so many but i'm just saying i try really hard on r d nine to five is is a construct i cannot let's see i cannot follow to be successful is it construct like yeah i get that too nine to five is kind of a weird thing why classify as olympic what exactly i would i don't know see that's the hard part also you had good education maybe it really depends on the person if every sprint are put in the same work as hussein bolt would they all be on his level probably not absolutely not that's why i'm not saying that's why i did say there's the caveat for the the genius part which i think there's geniuses i i think we could all agree that george hots geo hots is probably smarter than me okay i just the guy who made the the the inverse square root algorithm probably just smarter than me i'm getting sued by sony no you're not is that real but i mean but real is that actually real i'm just saying i don't think i i think there's definitely like a mix there real talk have you heard about israel oh no i haven't heard his rap no it's a hots reference yeah i think there's a mix here there is definitely a mix don't you think work-life proponents are against hard work to achieve greatness or just promoting general well-being you did wow zombie jew okay hey respect to zombie 2. the problem with it is that there's a fundamental assumption that i he that i i see a lot in people which is i shouldn't have to work hard to get what i want that's what i feel like that's how i feel when i see it is that i should have whatever nice lifestyle i want but i shouldn't have to work hard no one should have to work outside their work to gain status that's how that's how i hear it i don't know what makes someone a genius that's how i read it is i shouldn't have to no one thinks that there's plenty of people that think that you see it all over twitter i don't know if it's true i don't know if it extends to a lot of stuff i'm just saying that's what i see maybe i'm wrong i could be wrong that's entitlement oh there's definitely entitlement in it but yes there's definitely entitlement i agree that is entitlement work hard for yourself not because your boss likes it or your company i totally agree with that i i don't i don't work hard because i want netflix to love me i work hard because i i work hard for myself i work hard because i must i'm pretty heavy into work life as someone who manages people the way i structure work forces people to disregard personal life on the way i structure work forces people to disregard personal life that is a failure with that said i work on a ton of side projects outside of office because i want to be great dev my distinction is that what you choose versus what you are forced to do based on the way you work is structured i can agree with that so i guess it it all depends on how what you think work-life balance means and what do you think it's ramifications are does that sound fair the most talented programmers will always be faster than their colleagues right from the start and we'll have the rest of the day to gradually improve to either to reach i do think this is also true i think people that are just simply better can save more time absolutely i worked from nine to five once they did not last more than a year they were only a junior and i thought they could be successful only working minimum and thought they could be successful i do think it's very hard if you only work at work and you do not do any dev like dev outside of work i i think it's really hard to keep being a dev i used to be let's see let's see let's see i used to be what some cloud described as a gifted kid okay i'm not anymore i didn't lose it i just became content my adhd hyper focus helped me but the recipe is simple eight hours of sleep work work out at least 30 minutes a day the rest i work because i was highly motivated seems pretty good right i do i try to get eight hours of sleep myself i got seven and a half last night i consider that par that's good and i do and i like working out i think it goes even deeper you need to define work no seriously is work the passion in which you want you want to excel or is it rather something to keep you and your people alive that's a good that's a good point these are all good points i like these let's keep on going i like what you guys are all saying though this is actually a good discussion who would get who would have thought twitch would have had any any chance for a good discussion can we just be like real here for a second i'm not gonna lie to you most the time you guys are just nothing but a bunch of dummies just nothing but a bunch of dummies in there a savvy feet pack i lost a free dance for me you're gonna live in this this wishful thinking reality where like they can work five hours a day and also think they're one of the best programmers in the world and that's just not how it works yeah i i think everybody could agree with that it's not how it works you think the difference is that nobody should force you to work more than 40 hours a week but you shouldn't shame people for wanting to work more on their own projects to better themselves either that is true right so again i'm not justifying like crunch okay so this is actually so i i'd say that that's a solid take so maybe we're misunderstanding so when he says work what what this guy means by work is simply enhancing your skill or doing what is required so 40 hours a week doing that but when you clock out you don't clock out intellectually you clock out physically and i think that's a big that's a very very very meaningful distinction at game companies i'm not justifying an employer telling you to work over the weekend if you like your job that's not cool okay these discussions that everybody likes to get mad about on the internet need to acknowledge that some people want to work a lot more than 40 hours a week and those people are going to be the most successful people that's just how it works because they're going to be a they're going to just get more done so some people try to make this argument that you get more done at 35 hours than 60 hours i hate this argument by the way well i get more done at 35 than 60. i do no you don't no the only way that is true okay we're going in the hottest take of my of the day right now the only way that is true is because you're not working out and eating healthy that is my 100 belief your sleep sucks you're not eating well and you're not working out and your body just simply cannot handle that much stress okay your body is that of a 75 year old and you cannot go further than 35 hours a week work out eat sleep that will change your life jump stops get scholarships okay you just went through this alta for it's true though alta four tell me this is not true alt f4 if you don't if you're not eating well you're not sleeping well and you're not working out tell me how much did you start feeling horrible i work about 60 to 65 hours a week on on programming and programming things lately twitch is since i've only been doing like react content stuff like this it's really gone down a lot i've been working out again and drinking tons of water and my posture is even better yeah i'd agree yeah it's it makes a huge difference like such small little things is crazy like just work out and drink water and go to bed like what don't don't take your phone into bed that will just make such a change in your life that alone will make such a change in your life it's just like not even hard yes drink water it's like not even hard yeah the the the big agree on the phone to bed phone to bed is the easiest way to rob your sleep right what exactly do you use for an os what kind of what where are you we're not even close to that discussion it's so true it hurts i it's i'm not trying to be a when guys drag them out how much they work at tick tock i don't know if i want to watch tick tock i have kids i can't use arts we already talked about this it's not pleasant for me to work out i hate working out i'm gonna be real with you guys i hate every single moment of working out from the first weight lift the last one i hate it every moment and i do it six days a week it has nothing to do with how i feel i abstract how i feel versus what the hell i need to get done you just have to you have to because or because or else i would never do it because i hate it i was that's nonsense okay like that's true for people who don't work out their jobs and you know just need relaxation time or whatever but if you really care a lot about your job like if you really find it fulfilling you would get more done at 60 hours than at 30 hours right so that's first of all i agree with that and secondly again the more time you put in the better you are and then again there's the third difference which is just if you're working for someone else's company that's not the same as if you're working on your own projects right [music] through the web world is that the skill gap is not big it's really not that big whereas with game programming i feel like the skill gap is huge so working more on a game you like you you do get better skills like you see more things you have to solve more problems i do think there is something there that makes yeah game dev is just insanely hard building a button is not that hard okay i know you want to do server components i know you want to abstract all of your logic away and if you think if you keep unwrapping every last function in another function eventually you'll never have to actually write code and everything will just simply work first try well guess what it won't because that's stupid but still it's just not the same it's just not the same it's not the same and so i'm not saying that you should work for someone else's company for like 80 hours a week if you want to be the best programmer i like that it could work for somebody else's company you know for for the regular amount whatever your regular work week is part-time full-time whatever and then go home and put the rest of the hours into your own thing that's totally reasonable i'm just saying that don't don't be too seduced by this rhetoric that everybody in the world should work a 30-hour week or whatever because first of all it's not realistic because the people who don't do that are going to out-compete you right yeah secondly it's not realistic because it ignores the fact that a lot that's actually a really good point he just brought up i don't know if he caught it but there's there's this fundamental problem about working the minimum which is somebody else is willing to work more and if you have enough it's one of the shitty parts about company culture if everybody is a workaholic on your team but you it really can be hard to survive on the minimum do you know what i mean it's not viewed i wouldn't say that it's viewed as a competition i would say the hard part is is that if you're if your boss is looking out at the landscape and 9 out of 10 employees whether your boss realize it or not they're doing 60 hours and you're doing 40 hours i really do think that there's like this there there is going to be a pers a perception doesn't matter if it's unfair perceptions do not care about fairness right you can make it illegal or culturally unacceptable i think that's good i i do think it is culture i i think that is a really good thing to have on a team to make it culturally ungood and that is one thing at netflix that they've for the most part have been really good we have this saying which is you should be able to get your job done in 40 hours meaning if you're working more than 40 hours something's wrong something's wrong it could be that you're over committed but b you might not be a right fit really like if you're working a whole bunch just to get what everybody else gets done in a smaller amount of time perhaps maybe it's not like maybe you're just not in the right position and if you're doing it if you're doing what you're supposed to be doing in 20 hours you probably deserve a promotion right like there's like this this whole notion that there's this work expectation and overworking is is equally as bad of a sign as underworking but the bad is different it's much much different oh well look at this well thank you oh that's very lovely i can't really eat chicken wings or salad though oh i appreciate that thank you i love you beautiful wife you can just put it anywhere love you bye-bye all right let's watch more of this pearly i'm supposed to press k okay that sucked who told me to press k who who said that a lot of people getting life through work space bar okay and if you deny them that they should be working you're denying them a significant portion of the meaning in their life so it's a good take all of that should that's interesting totally makes me rethink things right just saying be part of the discussion and it generally isn't because the internet is stupid do i ever find working long hours negatively impacts my physical health not usually do i stay physically active yeah i know maybe not as much as i used to and he's drinking green tea we have those at netflix they're delicious not as much as long as they should but in general i'm fine if you work 60 hours you can't keep up with more than 20 hours next week i don't think that's actually true yeah i don't think that's true either i think that's only true if you are burned out and don't enjoy what you're doing working 12 hours a day with any job or task is exhausting though well yeah i work 12 hours a day or technically 11. i do 11 hours a day it is a little bit it is a little bit and then you catch up after several days and just work eight or nine hours that day and sleep extra how does time i do it five days a week but i completely disconnect on the weekends all right i just i just i just close my eyes and never look never even think about it right it feels really good good disconnecting i do 11 hours but you gotta remember there's there's a few hours of twitch youtube i i don't connect on the weekend i barely even open up twitter on the weekend i just try not to do any of those things do i have personal projects yeah a lot of them too many of them i have an elephant graveyard of personal projects but i get all my work done during the work day from five to four pm i work from 5 a.m to 10 a.m every day at netflix two hours ish on twitch an hour sometimes doing youtube stuff and then the rest of the rest of the time until about 4 4 30 at netflix play with my kids help out do all that work out make sure i get an extra little workout and then do all this stuff read to the kids yada yada yada when i have extra project deadlines such as the one i'm doing this friday roast course i'll stay up from 7 40 till 9 something every day yeah well i think that for me that's fine i'm a very high energy individual and i work out eat well and get plenty of sleep investment correlate with burnout i think that's an individual thing burnout oh this is a big one because i have very high feelings about burnout i think burnout is a i think a lot of burnout comes down to misaligned expectations is not just about time investment it's about whether you succeeded or failed at what you were doing and whether what you were doing was worth the time investment and that depends on individual cases if you do what you love you never get tired and only sleep because it's fun i don't agree with that you get tired if you're using your brain really hard for many hours that's actually tiring but you don't get tired in the way of like i just don't want to do this anymore you're just like oh man i want to keep working on this but i can't think very clearly right now so i'm gonna go rest if you've never had if let me put it this way if you don't frequently end up in that mental state that i just described of wow i want to keep doing this but my brain is just too tired right now then you're not actually working at the productivity level that you could which may be fine if you don't want to be productive oh man that's gonna make twitch chat angry hey twitch chat how do you feel about that one let's go twitch dad oh man twitch chat that was that is the hottest take of the ball all right we'll try it we'll keep on going that was that was a great take you think it's a lot about the working environment too if you hate all your co-workers you'll be less productive well that's probably true yeah i agree on that yeah probably true some people you're not really friends with your co-workers real talk most of you aren't friends with their co-workers your friend lee with your co-workers i think there's a big difference and i think sometimes people mix those two up though there are people that are actually friends meaning that if you left the company how many people remained your friend i think a lot of people mistake genuine relationships for work relationships and i think that leads to a really sad you know i think i think it hurts in here you're always respectful you know i'm always kind respectful when i try to help i see them as i try to be friendly to them you know what i mean but i but i noticed that if i got fired is anyone gonna come hang out with me no no they won't no they won't someone might reach out how are you doing and that would be probably the end of it you know probably get that tired in six hours others could go for 12 hours or even more there is definitely a variation that is true there's definitely a variation but the part that is missing from the discussion again well the part that's not so so people use that variation as an excuse like oh some people get tired after six hours and that's just me so i'm only going to work six hours it's like no that's just you not wanting to work more than six hours which is again fine oh i'm just not going to be an olympic athlete if you work for six hours okay and just accept that right the thing that's missing from the discussion dude that was a scorcher all right that was such a scorcher holy cow and is hey maybe if you get tired after six hours that's something you could train yourself up so that you only get tired after 10 hours later after a lot of training or whatever right i do agree with that i think this idea that you could build i do think we could i do think mental fogginess is definitely there's definitely there's some there's some input there right like if i take a if i take a a month break if i go on vacation even for two weeks i definitely come back and i definitely can't like it's not the same it's not the same at all it's different it takes a little bit to ramp back up there's definitely there's definitely something about that muscle or improve your confidence at ability to be productive is is missing i i guess it's present but only in the the stupid cheap trick kind of way like again there's all sorts of like oh you know set set a timer every 15 minutes and take a 30 second break or whatever the [ __ ] all this stupid things that people come up with it just he says [ __ ] [laughter] [laughter] i am not a pomodoro timer kind of person my break is what i have to pee all right when i do my little peepee break i do a little bit of an exercise come back refreshed ready to rock dunking you know what i mean duncan these nuts all right or just like you know use spaced repetition to like memorize things and then you'll be able to program faster like whatever those things don't make any sense usually and they're just excuses like just train your muscles train your brain muscles and your psychological muscles to like do the job better just sit just get better five head this is i i i actually i mean i actually really do like this take in the sense that it's there's just there's something really amazing about this take okay it just just hold on hold on with me for a second and what i mean that there's something amazing about this take is that so much of how you experience the world whatever that is whatever that percentage is is you psyching yourself up or psyching yourself down honestly if you think that you cannot work more than six hours you know it's it's it's just like i i don't believe in speaking things into existence but you can most certainly psych yourself up and psych yourself down right if you're just like i can't work past six hours i can't do that i can't do that well guess what you're just not gonna do it i i had to believe in myself that i could do it i still remember just writing
