- oh boy. - what's up jake followers, today we're actually being jake paul. today, we're destroying
jake's sisters house. thanks for giving us permission. - no problem. - we got clearance from her
brother and her husband, so we should be good. we're going to destroy
everything in this house and then replace it with new,
better, more expensive things. basically give her a home makeover. - look, i'm a light house. - i had her husband make
a list of everything she doesn't have
sentimental attachment to. so we're only going to destroy things that we know for a fact
don't matter to her. they have a three year old daughter. what do you think about her jake? - she's adorable. - yeah, i'm thinking we just fill her room up to like here with toys. does that sound good? - that sounds good to me. - okay. - she'll love it. - this is their bedroom. - no jumping on the bed. - no jumping on the bed. you know what the most annoying
part about furniture is? - what? - you walk in the room, there's a corner. oh, i hit the corner. - happens it all the
time, dude. all the time. - just. - okay. - now there's no corner. so look. i'm good. - you're good. you're golden. - oh, forgot the other corner. - yeah, yeah, yeah. get it. - there we go. - dude, let me try, let me try. okay. - you're good. - whoa. - you're good, dude. - dude. jimmy, you gotta try that. - oh wow. - they didn't take the
dishes out of the dishwasher. give us one second to get the
dishes out of the dishwasher, so when we blow up their dishwasher, we don't ruin their dishes. 'cause we're trying to be considerate. why are there ramen noodles everywhere? - because you threw them on the ground. - oh yeah. good thing they did a load of dishes before we blew this up. oh wait, we're doing the fridge too? - yeah. - jake! - yeah? - we need you. - oh god. all right, move the fridge. - you might want to get the trolley. - i love having a viking around. - ow! - so before we blow up his fridge, we need to make sure there's
nothing valuable in it. - there is the most valuable
snack in the entire world. - wow. this is more rare than bitcoin. to destroying delaware's house, cheers. - chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug. - that's super good. - wait, this actually looks really good. - nope, put it back in there. - yeah, we cannot eat their
food, that is stealing. - chug, chug, chug, chug. - to the farm. - i think that's everything, yep. - to the farm. all right, i'll see all at the farm. - that's a good spot. - i think it's cooked the food. - yeah. it blew the door off. - so i have a little science experiment. this is the dishwasher, i want to test a new way
of washing my dishes. my theory is if you obliterate
the dishes, they'll be clean. a dish that doesn't exist can't be dirty. i'm stuck. what do i do now? that's how you fix the dishwasher. - i think it's going to work perfect now. - yeah, it works. - perfect. - if you cut a chair in
half, do you get two chairs or two halves of a chair? test it. what do you guys say, is that two chairs or a chair and- - hey, oh, . all right, perfect. - so we're back at their house and it's time to put all
the destroyed stuff back in. they get back tomorrow, so we got to put everything back today, so when they come back tomorrow morning, they see a destroyed house. so this is the carpet we lit on fire. - perfect. - i just remembered
something really important, we never took that chair
or that to the farm, chris. there's only one logical thing we can do. - what? - wait a minute, we never did anything to the stove. - hold on. - all right. we're good now. - now we did. can you
confirm, is that broken? - it looks broken. - it felt broken? - yep. - all right. jake, can i have permission
to paint the wall? - yes. you have all the permissions. - i do? - yes. all right, your turn chris. - well, i need to let everyone know, when they sit on the couch, their butts go on the couch, this part. - yeah? - well what if i want to put my butt here? - um, nah, it's got to go like right here. dude, you could even sit
right here if you wanted to. - but wait a minute, where can jake sit? - according to the orbeez
video, jake would sit right- - whoa! - awe. - whoa. - wow. - whoa, whoa, whoa, jake, jake, i need you to execute
him from the building. get rid of him. you have been banished. that is the mark of the beast. - wait didn't you just get those pants? - no! - he has been banished. - we don't want him to come back in here. - yeah. - we need to make a no viking symbol. no vikings. - . - is he spray painting that? - ah! - oh, hey. why are you doing all the walls? - you were the clock that
was ticking in my heart. - oh nice. - this way. - this way. okay, okay. - let's check out caroline's room. didn't we buy her a bunch of toys. - caroline rocks. - yay! - okay, let's go grab all
our toys and put it in here. now we're going to fill the
three year old's room with toys. here's all the toys we bought caroline. now let's organize them. and there you go. that is caroline's new toys. wow. we might have just
ruin christmas for her. we might have completely
destroyed their house, but at least we didn't ruin
the three year old's fun. - that's all that matters. - hello? - hey, chandler wants a
snickers. can he have it? - yeah, y'all have- - okay. thank you. you can have it. - thanks delaware. bye. - i like my snickers warm. - wait chandler, throw
your snickers in there too. jake, give me your m&ms,
these need to be heated up. - i don't know what this is, but this is- - oh, it smells good. - it does smell amazing. - does anybody want to eat it? - that's hot. it's pretty good though. - all right guys, so it's the next day, today's the day where delaware and his wife and his daughter come home and get to see this mess we created. so they're on their way home, i just want to show you guys
what it looked like before and after. and yeah, guys, let's see his reaction. they're here. they're here. she's looking at the u-haul. there's a u-haul in the front yard and they're probably wondering why there's a u-haul in the front yard. - that's a very good point. - jake, can you go tell
him why there's a u-haul. there's kind of a couch blocking the door, you might want to get through the garage. we fixed your washer and dryer. the dryer's way better
at a drying clothes now. - your computer is just totaled now. it's got a virus. - yeah. - you're going to have to
give it your credit card. - yep. - caroline's, oh my god. what happened? - so that's the fridge. - yeah, your fridge
wouldn't fit back inside. - caroline, what happened? - that's how bad we destroyed your fridge. - this looks like a frat house. - that's what we said. - yeah. - o-m-g. - what is all this? you got new toys. - look at all the toys. - these are all yours. - you get to play with them all caroline. - is that my name? - yeah, it is your name. - is that 'cause this is your room? - yeah. - are these your toys? - yeah! - oh my goodness. - go ahead. - go play. - hmm. - hmm. - the first thing you got
to play with, of course. who's that? - minnie. - that's minnie? - yeah. - do you like minnie? - yeah. - hey, all this is yours. - wow. - it's all yours. - thank you uncle jake. - you're welcome. - is that a self portrait of chris? - yeah. - if you look in the mirror, you'll have a mustache now. - yeah. - my new door. - yeah. - well, we wanted to keep jake out, so we drew a viking- - an anti viking symbol. - and then we wanted to keep garrett out, so we crossed out tinder. so, that's why he's not here. - i really like your new stove and your new fridge. - i think that shattered glass is a good look. - caroline, you want to see
one more thing we got you? - do you see this? - yeah. - what is it? - a car. - we also decided to get her toys, so that way, even after
the house is cleaned up, it'll still get destroyed even more. - yep. - this is permanent destruction. how do you feel of the
way your house looks? - yeah. - i mean, you knew about
this, so you don't- - i knew about it- - there's difference
between knowing and seeing- - yeah, like i knew there was
going to be things done but, to what level, i had no clue. - we made sure to push the boundaries. - yes. - the artwork is beautiful. - yeah. - when we destroy things,
we replace them nicer. so let's go shop and replace everything with nicer things. - are you doing, you make a mess? - we made a big mess. - aw. you clean it up, okay? - we will clean up. - obviously, we're not butt holes, so anything we destroyed, we're going to buy you
something two times better, but you already know, but she doesn't. - right. she didn't know that. so i can take her shopping? - mm-hmm. have fun. a little bit of behind the scenes stuff, but we have a lot of business cards, 'cause we spend a lot of money and they all have like low caps. so there's about six of them, they each have a $5,000 limit. so, have fun. - meredith, you ready to go shopping? - okay. he cleans the yard and now we have a hundred
million orbeez in our yard, and my house is red. - but we're going to fix that. all right, let's go ahead and here, let's fix it real quick,
so people don't hate it. - okay. - so it's a couple days later and his house is completely revamped. and the other thing is,
his wife isn't here. i didn't know, but she's not
getting back till next week, so we don't even get her
reaction to the finished house. yeah, this is his new house. this is a rug that's not torched. what was right here, jake? - that was tiny. - ah. - i like this couch. - yeah, sit on it, you picked it out. - real quick, let's see if
caroline liked her toys. yeah, i take it she had some fun? - yeah. - oh this is her favorite? - yeah. she opens it up and
there's a little mirror and she likes to brush her hair. - okay, see this should be better content if your kid was here. we didn't think this one through. oh, nice bed. - nice bed. - nice tv. wow. there's no guy on your wall anymore. - there's not. - ooh. everything looks so nice. - you know what's nice about this though, remember earlier the corners, look it's rounded now. - it's rounded. - yeah. - yep. that's why we got this one, so we wouldn't have to bust the corners, they're already busted. - my fridge is the coldest it's ever been, 'cause you know, it works now. - ooh, ooh. - new microwave. - oh really? 'cause we didn't even
destroy the other one. - yeah, you did. - well, i mean microwaved
the snickers, but. - yeah, all over. - it was destroyed. - yeah, new oven. stuff's kind of already in there, but- - fancy. - but honestly my favorite thing is, 'cause i love to bake with my daughter, we got a new kitchen aid mixer. - ooh. - so we can bake cookies and cupcakes. - hello. - hey we need meredith. - she's not with me. - okay. - is her phone not working? - well, she didn't answer, so. - how do you like her new house? - i love her new house. - how's caroline like it? i hear caroline. - is that my dad? - yes, your dad, look. - i don't see my dad. - i'm right here. - daddy! - hey baby. - do you like your toys? - i love my toys. - that's all we need. - that's all we need. perfect. - what we need to do is we need to destroy his house again and then replace everything again. you know how funny that would be if we did this again? - oh my god. - and surprise you. like what? your wife's in connecticut, this is actually perfect. what if we literally
trashed everything again? and then we replace the
house one more time for her. - that would be hilarious. - how do you like the house? - i love it. - yeah? - it's awesome. that fact that mr. beast
will forever be on our walls, secretly behind the paint. - yes. - all right, for real though, we have a couple days until she gets back. let's trash your house. comment if we should
destroy his house again and surprise her when she comes back. i hope you guys enjoyed that video. before you go, i need
to tell you about this, honey gave me a thousand
dollars to spend on toys, to give to the less fortunate, they believe everyone should
be able to enjoy christmas. and fun fact, when we spent
that thousand dollars on toys, we actually saved that,
which is kind of funny, like how honey gave us money and then when we spent their
money, they saved us money. i don't know. but thank you honey, for
allowing us to help those kids. and i hope you guys enjoyed the video. like and subscribe or bigfoot
will eat all your cheesecake. - mr. beast, oh. mr. beast, oh. mr. beast, oh.
