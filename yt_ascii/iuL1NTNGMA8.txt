- we're slidin' into another
intel extreme tech upgrade. this time around it's hoffman, one of our editors who also does (camera shutters)
all the shoots for me, for lttstore.com. oh yeah, work it, right? - yep, you look great.
- he has me work it. thank you very much. (claps) today, we're gonna be
blowing the budget apparently, because he's got an oled
tv, he's got an rtx 3080, he's got a core i9 cpu, and there's no way this fit
within the $5,000 limit, but--
- there's one more thing. - yes.
- two systems. - two systems?
- behind you, right there. - oh, my gosh.
- it's a nas. - [linus] how on earth are
we gonna do all of this? - oh, you also need
these, since you're here. please.
- oh, sorry. i'm not supposed to be
sliding on the floor. sorry. (upbeat music) (loud whooshing) not gonna lie, this looks
extremely ambitious. you have a full pc build, new tv, and what are we doing with this? it's a nas.
- yeah. - i wanna store--
- i love it. - oh, yeah. - so, basically, i'm giving you the work station that you need to leave me and go back to independent work. - oh, how did-- you're kinda too smart, actually. (linus and hoffman laugh) - you dick! what are we doin' first? - pc first, i guess. - okay, pc first, ask questions later. bang! - yeah! - [linus] why'd you choose this particular motherboard cpu combo? - it's, well, the motherboard's cheap, and the cpu's a i9! i mean, what's cooler than
us saying i have an i9? - (sniffs) don't you love
the smell of new electronics? that manufacturing stank. (sniffs) oh! oh, my god, can i play with this first? - [hoffman] oh, the camaro! - does it have battery-- oh no, it's on now. there's no way it's gonna--
- oh, it's-- - i need a usb charger. god, this thing looks ugly, doesn't it? oh, my god, i need a money cat. it's a solar money cat! - for good luck. - oh, i know what it's for. i know what it's for you got,
"bring me that money, baby!" - thanks, intel! (laughs) - all right, let's see what
you've stolen from the office. - [hoffman] oh, no. no, that's mine! oh. - wow!
(hoffman laughs) academic excellence and
third place doubles! - i also did kumon. so if you need math questions,
just find me, you know. - oh, that is wonderful. what is level j200? - [hoffman] i don't
know, i don't remember. that was grade eight. oh, can we--
- that's for the study breaks? - is it work now or--
- keep that with your academic trophies? - do you want some, i
got some soju, as well. - oh, my god, i love it! wait a second, no, you've
told me about your jank mod with the pc in the mag case thing. back when we did our thing, you were like, "oh yeah, i have one, too." and then you showed it
to me and i was like, "oh, that's pretty jank,
i think we can do better." - mm-hm. - wow, it looks awesome! oh, my god, this is like
walking into an apple store. (hoffman laughs)
there's just apple everywhere. okay. the fact that you still have the g5, like water cooler, shroud things on there, you were doing really great! really great up until the hard drive just being in there.
- oh, that's not the only thing, so.
- that dust, though! hoffman!
- what's up. - [linus] have you ever cleaned it? - (scoffs) no. you know, when i go to the apple store at the genius bar usually they tell me to get a new computer, so.
(linus laughs) - [linus] wow, so you actually
already have a decent gpu. why do you need an rtx 3080? - everyone's getting 3080. 'cause i can. - (laughs) oh, my god. are you at least gonna
try and get into gaming? - yeah, well, i actually game sometimes. look here. look at what this is.
- we race sometimes. - yeah.
- really? - yeah! - i didn't even know you
were like a racing game guy. - you know, no one has beat
my score in project cars. - yeah, that's true.
- yeah. - you can't beat it, andy?
- no. - not even edzel. before that, edzel kept
talkin' about it in the office. he's like, "oh, you
should play this track." and then i played it.
- i think someone's getting called out right now. - yeah, a little bit. - carry on, though.
- it's been a year. - i like it. - can we have some competition, please? - [andy] we had a chat
called "race for mcdonald's". - we only had one race
and i won that race. - i had no idea the
editing team was so spicy. (hoffman and andy laugh)
and i had no idea you took my prusa printer. - oh, it's been so helpful.
- (laughs) okay, i found something, that
didn't take that long. is this from work?
- yep. - oh, for are crying out loud, dude. is this one of the new m1 ones, too? - [hoffman] mm-hm. - okay, these were for the lab. those are not really
actually for internal use. - you're fine with this
one, though, right? like this macbook here? - why do you need two
macbooks from the office? (andy laughs)
do you realize that if everyone took two macbooks, we would need to issue 120 macbooks? - yeah, but you know,
they just sit on the shelf 'cause no one ever uses
macbooks in our office. - all right. fair enough.
(hoffman and andy laugh) hey, are these the ones that ek gave out at the christmas party?
- yeah! - wow. clever budget use. i'm starting to understand
how this happened. - no, it's not clever, 'cause there's another cooler right here. - oh, you have two coolers. - yeah.
- what the heck? - are we building together? - yeah, sure, why not?
(hoffman squeals) (hoffman and linus laugh) - where's your screwdriver? - are you gonna bring it-- well, in my butt, obviously. - no, don't say that. oh, yeah, but seriously, i
need you to decide for me. - okay.
- can you settle a debate? air or water? - air. - okay.
- but maybe water. - okay.
- all right. - i learned nothing.
(group laughs) - this is gonna be your nas then, right? - yep.
- have you given any thought to networking at all or...
- no. - no, so do you have a switch? - no. - how are you going to
access your files on the nas? - that's something you have to teach me. - oh, my gosh. we're gonna end up going shopping today. - no, we're not, we're not. i have a really long
cable i stole from work. like ethernet cable that we can run from the router to my room for now. - there's so many things
wrong with what you just said. (group laughs)
- i don't even know where to begin. is this a super microboard? - it's, yeah.
- how do you have this? - got a zion in there. - is it from work? - no, i got it from craigslist. - okay. so, basically we don't need
to change anything about this other than to blow some dust out of it. - exactly.
- oh, that's not too bad. - yeah, i was like, "it's not too bad." andy, that's not too bad, right? - [andy] ehh. - not as bad david's, honestly. - david's was the worst.
- yep. - [linus] wait, why
didn't you go 12th gen? - [hoffman] oh, 'cause
i made this whole list like couple months back. - oh. you got screwed by the bad timing of the 12th gen release.
- a little bit. - i mean it's still very, very fast cpu. - so i think we, this thing, right? that's the cpu.
- wait, you know how to build a computer, come on. - kind of.
- stop pretending, i mean, you built that, right? - no, i didn't.
- oh, really? - no, it came as a whole.
- oh! - that's why it's so cheap. - oh, but didn't you build your mac? - i did.
- okay. - that was a long time ago.
- i was gonna say, actually.
- took me a month to do it. - that was a while, okay. - corner to corner. which corner is that? that corner, okay, cool. and then i see that you always wiggle it. - yeah.
- and then you close it and then that thing will pop up. ta-da!
- he knows how to build a computer!
- yeah. the, the, the-- - the speed is like--
- the system works! (hoffman laughs) - make sure you gotta
keep this flap right here just in case you gotta rma
it or something like that? - okay, all right. are you done takin' the piss? - and then we got-- i forgot what these are. two sticks of 16gb? - stop, i forgot what these are. enough!
- no, i meant like the memory like how much there is.
- rom? - ram.
- rom? rim? rub? (guys laughing) two sticks of 16gb. 3600 cl 16, 16gb. nice! - this is the part that
gets crunchy, right? (loud clicking) oh, that crunch is healthy, right? - yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a good crunch. now i'm craving captain
crunch all of a sudden. honestly, this is going so well. i feel like you don't
really need me anymore. - mm-hm. - just be hoffman tech tips.
- yeah. - you have so much tech tips, though. - [linus] hoh-teh-tih. - huh? - hoh-teh-tih. - what's-- is that like a baby singing
linus tech tips or-- - hoffman tech tips.
- oh. - [andy] oh, you know my kid
just learn how to say ltt? - oh, really?
- really? - [andy] yeah, 'cause
i'm wearing the ltt thing and he always points at
it and he's like, "ltt." - that's so cute.
- oh, my gosh! (laughs) (soft upbeat music)
oh, my god, that's so strong! linus! (shouts) - i was like, "kyle, i want the biggest "possible magnet embedded in the shaft." he's like, "is this big enough?" i'm like, "is it the
biggest possible magnet?" "no." "well, then it's not big enough, is it?" the screws don't come off! - [hoffman] i like that. i'm gonna steal one when it's out. - let's get the case. oh, it's there. - it is there. we don't have to go to
the store and buy it, so. ta-da! okay.
- why are you takin' digs at edzel, takin' digs at nicole? is he like the department troll or what? - it's a white case! it's pretty! - it is pretty. but the thing we gotta figure
out is our cooling solutions. i would go with the nh-d15 personally, because i just don't like hassle. - mm-hm.
- and an air cooler with two fans on it is basically-- - good to go?
- bulletproof. it'll be running in 10 years. i give you my personal
linus tech tips guarantee. - but the aio is more expensive, right? - [linus] the aio is more expensive, yeah.
- and it looks prettier. - [linus] it looks prettier. - i need a hobby so i think we should use the aio.
- okay, we're goin' aio. let's do it. so have you ever installed an aio before? - nope! - okay, so now we're
crossing new ground with you, mister is this the ram? - i mean, i've seen you struggle
with the aio all the time. - you know, mr. smack-talk here, it's a pretty good idea to make sure that you're gonna be better at it before you come at someone else about how much they struggled, 'cause i'm getting real unhelpful feelin'. (guys laughing)
i gotta say. - that's a cooler. - yep. - am i gonna do it or... - i told you i wasn't
feeling very helpful. i really--
- where are the tech tips, linus? (laughs) wait, don't you have to
install this before-- install the motherboard before this? - i don't know. - oh, it's a quiz.
- i've developed some amnesia here.
(hoffman groans) - what is this again? - what is what? - wha-tour culling? - huh? is that a reference again? - (sighs) no. - oh.
- we can put this in now or we can put the motherboard in now and we can install this after. it doesn't really matter. - okay! - [andy] if you put that in the front-- - yeah.
- will the gpu fit? - oh, crap. is that what happened last time? no, no, that was with
the other case, andy. - yes. you're right, though, let's make sure. yep. easy-peasy, no problem. - see that, nicole? (guys laughing) - you know she's your supervisor now, right?
- yeah, she is. - okay.
- yeah, so what? she can't fire me. - she can advise that you should be fired. - oh, sorry, nicole. nicole, you're amazing. (hoffman laughs)
- she is amazing. you're also gonna need
to pop the front panel. yeah, just grab the bottom and pull out with a jerking motion. yeah, jerk it. (hoffman grunts) - do you wanna jerk it? would you jerk it for me? (laughs)
(andy laughs) - oh wait, is this screwed on? - oh thank, god i didn't force it. so that's how we break things
on camera sometimes, huh? (hoffman laughs)
- yeah. do you want looks or do
you want convenience? the best looking--
- looks. - you want looks.
- yeah. - can i talk you into convenience? - okay, yeah, let's do it. - okay, let's do convenience. so we're gonna have the
radiator fins right at the front and we're gonna have the fans pulling air through the radiator at the backs. if you put the fans at the front and they blow air into the radiator, then you have to take
the whole thing apart in order to clean the dust out of it. and i've seen how much
you like doing maintenance on your computer. - did we ever do any tests
about the stock paste? - oh, ek ships decent
paste with their stuff so i wouldn't worry about that. there are manufacturers
that ship super cheap paste with their products, but, honestly, i would just assume
this is fine and use it. okay, maybe you could get a degree, even two degrees with
something else but... - oh, i thought, (laughs) i thought you were telling
me to go back to university. - oh no, no, no. no, kumon is all you need. (andy and hoffman laugh) gee, hoffman, you know, i
think you could be not (beeps) if you just got some
more education, you know? - oh, (beeps). - it's like out of nowhere... - you know i'm working for you, right? - yeah, i guess it speaks to
my poor taste if you suck. and we're gonna be done
this build in no time. i love it.
- see, andy, i told you, it's gonna be easy. - and i love these accents. why do you have a 40 pack of
anodized aluminum washers? - they're like (sighs) why not? - but what are they for? - oh! is it the motherboard? yeah, it is.
- for the motherboard. - i think so, yeah. - dude, i don't think so. is that what these are for? - yeah. - but i have never heard of people just like putting things on
there like that and for bling. maybe i'm just not cool anymore? - no, you're the coolest. - oh, stop. - it's safe, right? - i mean, i wouldn't do it. - that's okay, as long as it looks cool. - [linus] not gonna lie. that looks pretty cool. - oh, i have cablemod cables, actually. - do you?
- i do. like that.
- wow. - [hoffman] and got some gold accents too. - [linus] white, black and pink. - well, it's gray. - with gold accents. - bling, bling. - i mean, wear it loud, right? - you like it, you like it. - i do like it.
(hoffman laughs) gotta love those cable combs. you go from like tangled to dangle. - i wish my life could be like that. - good, solid power supply. we've gone with an rm850x. - are you gonna comment on 850 on a 3080? - it's fine. i mean, people have done much worse. james tried to get away
with a 650, didn't he? - i don't remember.
- i can't remember. that didn't work out. actually, two of the ones that i warned about their power supply
have had their power supply either fail or their system
(snaps) shut off sometimes and they have had to replace
their power supplies. - [andy] my power supply exploded. - yours was no good? i wasn't even counting you
so that means three, then. well it's not pretty, but i think we dealt with
your super long cable here. let's see if that panel's
even gonna close. (chuckles) oh, yeah, there it is, thanks. people ask me, "linus, why
you work out, you know?" "why you try to get such a big booty." so i can close the case. - all right, hey, not bad! let's get that gpu installed, right?
- let's do it! here you go. - well, no, you're gonna do it. that's your job. - [hoffman] oh, that's true. - [linus] we're gonna just have
a big loop on this, i guess, because i screwed up. - well, that's perfect 'cause
i paid for those cables. i wanna see more of it. - [linus] good. more bang for your buck.
- (laughs) yeah. - sick! (claps) let's find out if it works. you ready, no, you do it. you do the honors. - no, you know what, you do it. - no, you gotta do it.
- no, you do it 'cause you built it. - no, you gotta do you it. this is your machine.
- you named it fluffy bunny. - fluffy bunny.
- it's your machine. - but you built it.
- but you configured it. - okay, fine. can we do it together? - we can do it together, okay.
- ready? - crap.
(hoffman snickers) did you turn it on the power supply? - i did not, i did not. i did not, ready? - okay, try again, try again. (hoffman laughs)
oh, crap. there you go, yay!
- ooh! (laughs) - hey, i love this! stolen from work. "the abc's of gaming." - [andy] can we go to l? - yeah, we can go to l,
is that your favorite? - what's, what's l? - l is for loot.
- no, l is for lttstore.com! - thanks, andy.
(guys laughing) oh boy, it hasn't turned on yet. - how do you know? - well, 'cause it, oh, oh, the monitor was off.
- it was off. - hey! nice! everything looks totally fine. whoop, what mouse are we using? really, hoffman? - yeah.
- the least ergonomic mouse of all time. - you know, what's the best for this is slipping into pockets. - that's actually valid. - you know, i actually
used this as a clicker for powerpoint when i was in university. i would tape the bottom and then hide it in my
pocket and click it. - wow, that's slick.
(hoffman laughs) - yeah.
- i like it, actually.
- yeah! that's the only thing it's good for. yeah, so i have a decklink. like if i pass this all
the nvidia driver system os color management stuff. so that we can have a
clean output to the tv. - on that tv.
- yeah. so you'll sit in bed
with a wireless keyboard and mouse or something
and be working in the-- - no, i can just look... well, okay. - i question your ergonomics.
- okay. - your touchpad for this computer is here and then you're gonna have
your color accurate output for this computer over there. - this computer actually
goes with this monitor. - i see.
- yeah. so this is the windows computer. - how many computers does one person need? how did i not notice this?
- oh, lord. i'm sorry.
- oh, my god. your paint's coming off your wall. did you stick this up with
just double-sided tape? - [hoffman] yeah, i did. (linus snorts) - classic, let's go get the nas going. do you have any hardware for this case? this is an older case and it
requires those special screws with the spacers for hard drive mounting. - no.
- no, huh? i mean we could just
do it the hoffman way. just rest it on there and put it in. there, hard drive installed, right? right, hoffman? - (chuckles) yes. can i swiffer the inside?
- let's power it up. - i don't know, can you? - this is a good budget
kind of editing setup, huh? like the whole pc and the nas? - i love it. - yeah.
- i love it. you need to not have a
gtx 580 in here, though. that's phenomenally stupid. - (chuckles) what should i have in there? - nothing. - wait.
- you should use the onboard video that's
definitely on here. - [hoffman] oh, okay. - (chuckles) yeah. all right, that was it. that was your big cleaning effort? unbelievable.
- yeah, what? - 'kay.
- what else is there? - i don't even care.
- okay. - doesn't even matter. i think you should call it big nas-x because it's big and it's--
- oh, my god. i just wasn't really expecting pop, like new young pop culture from you. - yeah, thanks.
(andy laughs) what if you put that
one on top of this one? - oh, that's pretty crazy.
- you stack 'em. oh! - what was that? - okay, let's do the peel. - [hoffman] peel everything. - peel all the things.
- yeah. - suck it, andy. i'm gonna sneak into your
house and peel all your (beep). - [andy] i still have the
fridge peel waiting for you. - oh! now we are definitely
giving up some cooling on the bottom of this one, but i really don't think it's a big deal. we got like three hard drives in there and we're definitely gonna
take out that gtx 580. - [hoffman] i could
sell it for a bit, huh? - [linus] i don't know, maybe 20 bucks. - [hoffman] oops. - even now it's not worth much. "overcurrent have been
detected on your usb device. "system will shut down to
protect your main board." what did you plug in, my man? - maybe the keyboard? - [linus] is this cable safe? - [linus] i think so. - [linus] hmm. - you can figure it out. - i'm not gonna lie, andy. i am extra confused right now. did we miss something? did we accidentally get one of the little metal tabs in one of the usb ports or something? no, there's nothing. i can't tell if these are queued up errors or if they're new ones. i'm gonna get some drivers installed and then we're gonna see how that goes. - okay, sounds good. look at these! i got the hs8s. they are big. they are eight-inch subs. there are other smaller subs
but i went for the eight because it's like the
endgame speakers for me. audio is 50% of the video
and i wanna get better at it. and these speakers are
really gonna help me. with studio monitors, they're
usually very flat sounding and not much flavor in them, just so that we can have
a more accurate reference. so i'm not expecting these
to really boom my room, but i really wanna hear all
the range in the frequency. and these are gonna do just fine for that. i've mixed a couple videos
with my old speakers and there's a lot of complaints in the comments.
- hoffman! - yeah, linus? - [linus] what on earth did you plug that ethernet port into? - oh. - is this a 100mbps port? - [hoffman] shouldn't be. - [linus] something smells bad. - what? - sometimes you get a
little bit of corrosion on the connections and if you just give it a little unpluggy-pluggy,
it'll smarten up. i think i speak for everyone
when i say that eight inch is really too much. - yeah, it is. - yeah.
- yeah, for my rooms. - four, five that's lots. - oh, what are you talkin' about? - i sort of figured out the usb thing. your keyboard does not like being plugged into a usb type-a port. - oh.
- so i plugged it into the type-c and it
(snaps) immediately lit up. i stopped getting that
error as soon as i reseeded the internal usb type-c header so i'm hoping that we're good to go now. - so it was your fault. - that's one way of putting it. - that's all right, linus. well, the fact that you made a mistake and corrected it, you know,
(chuckles) that's a lot. - [linus] that's what life's all about, right?
- yep. is it turning on? - [linus] no. - oh, lord. - wait!
- oh. oh.
- i hear some-- oh, god.
- oh, my god. look at how big this is. - oh, my god. - the eight-inch is definitely
overkill for this room. a hundred percent.
- uh, yeah! you're like right there! (hoffman laughs)
this is ridiculous, dude! - i have a c1 right here. for sdr grading, this
tv's actually perfect. hdr's not actually that
good because it is woled. so that means it's got rgb
pixels plus a white pixel so when you go very bright in a scene, the saturation will actually down. before sdr, totally good. (loud whooshing) - this looks great! - [hoffman] uh-huh! - perfect. ready, it's a good thing it was on right, eh?
- yeah. - yeah! 'kay, so you tell me where you want it, 'cause that does not look very-- - counterclockwise, please. - my counterclock-- okay, that's all i got. - do it, go ahead. that's perfect. - how's that? - yeah, sure. - yeah, sure.
(hoffman laughs) all right. yeah, this is not very level, hoffman. you've got a solid, frickin'--
- 5 degrees or 10.-
- like inch or two from one end to the next. poor hoffman, is gonna
edit someone's portrait and send it to them and
they're gonna be like, "why is it like this?" (laughs) let's go back to the nas. so the way i configured it
is you're gonna have 16tb of usable space out of 24.
- nice. - but what's cool is that
as you add more drives, that's all gonna be pure capacity. so as long every drive
you add is 8tb or less, you just get the full
capacity of those drives and you can add any (beep)
mix of drives that you want. (upbeat music) those are really tight. - tight as in... - like...
- good? - good.
- oh, that's good. that's good. - how much were these? - 3, 4, 500, around that range per, so it was like less than a
thousand dollars for a pair. - should we just have something like this in the booths at work? - i mean we could, but we need to isolate the sound of the room, but i actually, i was working from home and
i managed to actually mix a video on these.
- woof! - i'm gonna check on my dog, i'm sorry.
- oh, sure. - [men on video] cpus are hot! - whoa! that is very stereo, sir! - right?
- yeah! - you can hear everything with these. - you can really hear it. it's like head phone level separation. that's really cool. all right. 'kay, lg, hello! why would anyone have a tv subscription? there should be an option for none. - it's like in case my
grandma gets a tv, i guess. - roasted. - oh, the blacks, it's so good. i mean, it's off, but...
(tv dings) - we can lay the bed
down and watch something. - okay, i mean, that's not awkward. - yeah, well. - [andy] and there's no bed
frame so you can't break it. (hoffman laughs) - i also don't have netflix. could i use the company netflix, please? - wow. - i'll log out after i'm done with it. - uh-huh. i gotta say, one thing that's
trippin' me out a little bit. aside from your crooked ass tv, is that our sound is over there. - yeah. - that wouldn't bother you, though? - i'd probably play it through the tv. - so with the choice
between great quality audio that's coming from the wrong
place or atrocious audio that's coming from the right place, you take the bad audio
from the right direction? it's a tough call. i'm not saying there's
a right answer here. - i don't know what to do, linus. but i think in this situation,
we can go with the tv. oh, never mind. - yeah, so i don't think you can do it! (hoffman laughs)
right? - yeah! i feel like the theater's over there but i'm watching from here.
- yeah. - that's all right, though. - happy with the setup? - super happy. - you know what, i could
get used to this bed. just like i could get used to
saying, "hey, thanks, intel!" another extreme tech
upgrade is wrapped up, we've got more coming. if you guys enjoyed
hoffman's tech upgrade, where we figured-- man, you got new gaming
slash editing machine, sick audio setup,
upgraded nas, freaking tv. you really know how to
stretch your dollar, i gotta give you that. - took me a while. - if you enjoyed this one, go check out some of our previous ones. we broke andy's bed,
dennis wasted his money. - oh, and you in a girl's
room for the first time. (upbeat music)
- that's such a cringe title.
