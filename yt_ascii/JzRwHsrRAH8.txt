so i had this love for still the physical especially physical science that i was trying to use in my studies i was talking with you to try to get more into the symbolic quy i was also talking with john riki about the cognitive science side and also in in general he was great on the the physics side and i was always trying to bridge mainly between you and john i would say it took several years i would often like run arguments by you and by him and like try to see if i can make something through this i developed i think pretty carefully a path from materialism all the way to the symbolic world and even up to the more let's say esoteric debates in symbolism like how is it exactly that the world exists in in christ and how is it that the world exists through human consciousness and like all of these more esoteric kind of [music] questions this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic [applause] world so hello everyone i am very happy to be here with jp mao jp for those who have followed the channel for a very long time you've seen him on the channel for years he was the editor of the symbolic world blog he's really been a partner in kind of developing a lot of the symbolic world ideas and we're going to launch a course where he's going to be giving a class called the metaphysics of symbolism where we're going to look at the relationship between metaphysical ideas and the symbolic world as we kind of present it and also his take on it i'll be part of it to some extent he'll be doing part of it alone and we're also go announcing that we are going to publish a book on the same subject by jp and so i'm really happy to see all this coming together he's just been such a great help all this time to help me think through because he has such clear thinking more than i do i get kind of he has a very kind of clear thinking we've been doing a french podcast for years now that you can also find on youtube if you just write jonathan peo france french you can find the you can find the podcast we'll put a link in the description so jp it's good to to to see you and i thought maybe we could start with you telling people a little bit how you came to this you know what what your what your story is cuz it's pretty interesting yeah for sure thanks i never told it on your channel basic background was really into science during my teenage years i had been raised catholic in in quebec classic practicing family but when i was a teenager drifted away from the faith mention science as one of the excuses let's say to make my parents stop bringing me to church but i was still interested by questions of meaning i think these questions pop up naturally if you push let's say the scientific world view far enough i was just not very impressed by the philosophy that i had seen when i was younger let's say in high school or a cp that we have here in quebec so i decided to study math and computer science in university because i was mainly interested in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science there's all kinds of cool theorems you can prove about certain formal systems what they can and cannot prove gives you sort of an idea of how far you can push knowledge in some areas so anyway i was really interested by that but i think like many people with a basic scientific education what i ended up sort of inheriting as a side effect was a materialistic ristic worldview where i guess you spend so many hours like trying to do problems where you reduce things to their constituent bits that at some point it's sort of became normal for me to just see the world as particles moving about and even people like it was hard for me to see people as something else than just complex sets of particles that evolved randomly through natural selection to like have complex behaviors but fundamentally it's just reducible to to particles and yeah i just add this basic kind of worldview where it was hard to find meaning like in my ontology and also epistemologically in terms of what we can know i was really drawn to mathematics because it seemed like you can have like sure knowledge of things in mathematics that that wasn't the case where that that wasn't the case for the philosophy courses i had before like mostly people were just doubting everything in philosophy that's what i i thought back then but at least in math i could prove stuff so like maybe it's not obvious how i can talk about meaningful topics in mathematics but at least we seem to be going somewhere because like we seem certain of what we're doing but even then in mathematical logic i i i like tred to take as many courses as i could early on to see the proof of a good incompleteness theorems and now when i when i saw the proof i saw that well i guess if within math you can't be that sure of what you're doing i had heard about girdle's famous theorem that no formal system that is coherent will be complete and i had heard about it but typically when you have these really cool sounding theorems in math or physics like when you actually get to to them and you see all the postulates that are required for them they they're actually not that cool but in that case that was true like it was really as devastating as as it sounds so what ended up happening is like okay like i had this worldw where i saw everyone as just bits of matter where it was hard to find meaning in that and my knowledge like my access to knowledge in the world that used to be mediated by mathematics even that was destroyed by good old theorem so i was a bit a bit to drift like like is anything worth doing really i wasn't doing that bad like it sounds more depressing than it was it just it just was great but i thought like if everything is meaningless anyway i might as well think about it to make sure that like i'm not screwing this up somehow so i decided to do a masters in the philosophy especially about reductionism to try to see if like something was wrong with my worldview is reductionism wrong and can we talk about meaning and good and evil somehow can we recover that i no expectation at all that it would work but i thought well if everything is meaningless anyway as might as well try you know well there's literally nothing to lose so during the course of my my master's duran peterson up onto the scene and as soon as i heard him talk about meaning and good and evil in terms that i hadn't heard before i decided to look into it and through that i also stumbled upon you i think i started i think i started contributing to your patreon as soon as right away you one of the first people that that supported me yeah was crazy because i i i knew you were doing something interesting and i wanted to talk to you because i didn't really understand what you and jordan were doing to be honest but i i wanted like i wanted some kind of access to to try to dive into it and i had lots of time because i was doing my masters in something related and one of the first things we talked about was zombies because you were having you it was an existential question for you it wasn't just a theoretical question yeah exactly i think i wonder how common of a thing that is like obviously it's present in the common imagination because there's lots of zombie movies and books and and so on but basically if i think back about this period of my life while i was studying abstractly nihilism and materialism during the day in my studies i would spend like all night long exploring the same topics symbolically having zombie nightmares so like for literally like all night every night for about a year i had like zombie nightmares it it's it again sounds worse than it is like actually what ended up happening after a while is i sort of figured out what was like going on like cuz initially if you just wake up every time you have such a nightmare like you'll never sleep so at some point i sort of understood that it was just like just yet another zombie nightmare so like even if i would get eaten or someone i wouldn't actually wake up i would just like i knew that i would just start another dream but it never stopped so like to just this endless cycle of zombie nightmares but i i ended up getting rid of my zombie problem in part thanks to you and john veri it was really a series of of steps first in my studies i was looking at specifically arguments against materialism and trying to find alternative ways of framing the world at that stage specifically i i had seen enough arguments against materialism in philosophy that i could drop materialism and adopt pism at the time i i thought that was a nice easy bridge to make and then from there started to dive into some and yeah what i should say is as soon as i did that the zombie nightmares started to go away like they were cut down i don't know 50 90% like to to a good extent like they started to go away i still add them but it was less frequent and then next step was diving into a little bit of classical metaphysics especially with regards to virtue ethics okay if there isn't just matter in the world if people aren't just particles following blind laws is there like also some kind of good and evil that we can talk about it's not imed mediate like just because you're not a materialist doesn't mean that you'll necessarily have an ontology that allows you to speak about good and evil but through classical philosophy i was able to find good arguments for that things you can find in plato and aristotle but also new arguments coming from cognitive science some of the the things that john riki and jordan and you talk about so like a big thing for me was realizing that in general perception is something that we practice and it's not just our moral perceptions that we need to practice and improve it's just our perception of everything it's something that we know from developing infants like initially infants can't really see like it's something they really have to practice and when when you sort of know that this happens in infants you can start to pick that up also in yourself an example i always come back to is brazilian jiu-jitsu or like any complex sport really like if you look at it initially you won't see anything like you'll just see chaos basically like you know okay at the beginning of the fight two people like are setting up and at the end there's one person that's obviously losing and is tapping out but you don't see really what happened in between you don't have the the the perception to make up the pattern from the multiplicity of moves going on literally had that experience that we talked about it where i'm watching a match and then all of a sudden the people that are there are cheering and i'm like what am i there's not there's nothing happening i don't see what's happening like they know that the now the person is in the right position to do this or that but i have no idea i'm just looking and then like you said at some point one guy loses and i'm like what the hell just happened i don't know what i what i would just watch and but but if you practice the sport and you discuss it with others and you also like have a habit of watching it eventually you start to pick up the patterns like a child who is learning to see objects h you learn to see moves in jujitsu and the the same thing happens with more abstract truths as well that's basically what happens with i think moral truths there's even this good theory i think by jonathan i and a few of his colleagues about um moral foundations theory he says that we it's kind of like with per with visual perception let's say there's all kinds of photons in our eyes there's like all this multiplicity but it takes time for us to turn that multiplicity into coherent patterns to make out the world in the same way we seem to have basic moral intuitions that we use to make up more complex moral judgments like we have disgust that like is a very basic emotion that protects us from pathogens and dangerous substances in general but it's also a moral emotion that we end up exacting to reject certain injustices or let's say ideas that are also pathogens for our tribe and this kind of stuff so like he has i think this good theory where you can see how there's like the these basic senses that we have to perceive initially just chaotic multiplicity in the moral realm but as we grow up and we try to practice our moral perceptions we end up being able to perceive more and more complex patterns yeah but it's it's important to say just just as you as you go through this that understand that what's important to understand in what you said is that it makes the analogies real that that when we use the analogy for example if we say you know that that this person is parasite on the system that the analogy between and even the mechanism by which we recognize a parasite let's say coming towards something dirty something that that is that is dangerous physically is the same mechanism that we use to then see the moral or societal parasite yeah and also like it like having this continuum of like when you understand that perception is something you need to practice not just in morality but also even just to perceive very basic objects it makes it really hard to reject moral realism on the basis of varieties between different nations or groups or tribes for instance because if you were to look also at developing infants like they also can't really see the world like they're they're very confused it it takes a long time for them to be able to perceive like faces and objects and pick things up and like it's something we need to practice the same way that if like you're just starting to do jiu-jitsu you won't perceive what's happening yeah you'll be confused and it's going to take longer for you to perceive jiu-jitsu moves then to perceive like basic objects when you're an infant like in the same way it's going to take like all of your life to improve your moral perception and still then like you probably won't be able to see everything perfectly unless you become a saint so it's not surprising that different cultures disagree about like how they perceive morality it just like so so the these kinds of ideas were able to like destroy my moral relativism and in like immediately when that happened my zombie nightmares were again cut down by like 50 or 60 or 90% so at that point i was starting to have like way less zombie nightmares i still had some but like it was very manageable i honestly thought it would just stay like this forever but because i was supporting you on patreon we had like these regular chats and we became friends and at some point i asked you like what would you do like if if you were in my position where like okay you were having a zombie nightmare right now like you're the you're the main character in a zombie story let's see what do you do like what's the what's the solution how can i get out of this and we ended up working through it together do you remember what the solution was you don't remember yeah i remember what it was actually we we also like further improved it i think two three years ago on the french podcast but the initial solution was like it took us a few iterations to figure something out but the basic idea we came up with was to do what jesus would do because like zombies are you've talked about this on your channel before zombies are a parody of the christian resurrection they're really a parody of the the christian world viw specifically the christian apocalypse because zombies come back to life but they don't have this glorious body they just have this decaying body they are all together but rather than being in communion they just like follow the imp their impulses in the same direction they look let's say unique and special but it's only superficial really the only like all want to eat is the same thing they like they they eat brains because it's the last remnant of meaning in the materialistic universe like they're trying to destroy like the only thing that doesn't fit quite right in the materialistic worldview like even if they try to to deny it so anyways there's all these parallels between zombies and cushan where zombies are trying to basically destroy the ancient meaning systems and there's also the key i think in jesus's story against this again well to trample down death by death so jesus even today like in the eucharist he lets us eat him but doing that he actually eats us the same way that he he let us kill him 2,000 years ago in a way that would bring us into his story to make us saint so like there's this key inside of christ story and we could go deeper into many details like what we do especially during the eucharistic lurgy is the exact antidote to the the meaning crisis and the zombie crisis because zombies like they they just grown they can't make sounds but we sing when we're in the church zombies just like jumble up to eat stuff and destroy stuff thinking only about themselves but we're in church we're praying for one another we're being thankful towards the same thing rather than just consuming everything for ourselves so there there's all these parallels you can make u to see how christianity is the specifically participating in l in lury is the solution to the zombie problem and what we came up with was okay then what you would need to do is like somehow let yourself be eaten by zombies like you would have to do something like spirit like like pray or like find some way in your zombie universe to become a saint and then you let yourself be eaten by zombies to save even the zombies and when we worked through that then my nightmares disappeared i never had one since then the the only times i add some after were when i would explicitly be trying to write about my experiences for others but i never add this again for myself the the dreams just went away yeah and what's crazy about that is that we kind of we did came up with this like like a story almost like a narrative about the idea of a a a saint like like that that get that rem remain that lets himself be eaten and then wakes up truly let's say resurrects truly doesn't come back as a zombie but comes back as a as a kind of glorious being in the zombie story and it's weird because it seems like that's a story that should exist like somebody should write it you know that the idea because i don't think that exists the idea of a zombie that wakes up from his state and and retrieves you know a kind of even a a better level of consciousness that they had before so you know that's out there folks whoever does it you know if you don't do it i at some point i'll write it myself just because that story has to exist yeah i think the closest i've seen is worm bodies it was made into a movie but there was also a book from few years ago but the zombie doesn't come back to a glorious body let's say he comes back to the like same kind of existence and there's like interesting i i think let say facets of the christian story you can see in that movie and especially in the book like in the book there's almost a baptism scene at some point the the the zombie like he's starting to wake up basically out of love for one girl because he ate the brains of his his boyfriend but like he ends up like slowly like developing feelings towards that girl and he saves her spends time with her and like through this attraction he becomes more and more human but at some point he has to make like a kind of confession and there's a kind of baptism scene like in front of a church when it's raining and he's washing his mouth from blood because it just ate someone like but he didn't want to anyway like there's this progression and the the zombie ultimately spoiler alert shut shut this down if you don't want to read the the book or watch the film but at the end the zombie comes back to normal human life by sacrificing himself for that girl so like he has to basically like wrap himself around her as they're getting shot and he has to like drop in like a building i think and like he's thinking he's going to die doing that but he eventually like drops in a pool so again there's this water baptism thing and then when he comes back like he sees that he's bleeding so he's become human again so like you can see glamors i think in popular culture of this this solution but as you said i don't think anyone has come up with the full narrative arc so far yeah yeah yeah well that's part of the that that part of what's coming over the hill let's say on storytelling you know it seems like it's a perfect story to tell so so basically that was the that is kind of what healed you but that also kind of that involved going back to church it involved getting married it like your whole life changed really yeah yeah yeah yeah i think as soon as soon as i worked out the let's see moral layer as soon as i could see that okay i have a metaphysics where it's starting to be possible to talk about good and evil then i started going back to church i i was brought up catholic i had done my sacraments when i was a child so i just came back and eventually like found a really good parish here there's sort of this blessing in disguise that we have here like in quebec the church collapsed so much that the people who are left are actually like really trying to do it for the right reasons and like it becomes really clear examples of what to follow so found a really great parish here pretty quickly got involved with different groups that really helped me found the woman that i married and now that i have a son with and yeah like like as you said this intellectual path really followed also a a concrete like embodied path in a in a community that i was lucky to find so yeah this big path of of transformation and no more zombie nightmares no more nihilism and so that has helped you in some ways because one of the things that i've been impressed by you is that the fact that you you really have studied philosophy quite a bit and you know you've talked a lot with john ri with several people that are in this in this sphere and so you've been able to talk about symbolism in a more technical way using more philosophical language and that is what the book is going to be and that in some ways is what the class is going to be to help people have more precise language even a langu that is closer to the ones that you'll hear in university and stuff because both mats and i mats developed really his own language which is very powerful and and beautiful but i also recognize that some people they when they try to explain it to their friends in school they struggle to find the the way to link it to to the to the and i have the same problem people accuse me of being imprecise of not using the right words and not knowing the right words and so i'm really happy to see this this as a possibility to help kind of bolster the case so maybe you can tell us a bit about what the thesis is and what it is you're hoping to accomplish with it yeah so i i'm trying to aim the book specifically for people who were sort of in my in the position where i was 10 years ago where you're in the course of a an education focused on science and you're developing this sort of materialism as a result and you wondering if there's another solution and for i think people of this kind of character the arguments as they're sometimes presented will be a bit too fast like phenomenology didn't work for me like i it it like either it wouldn't click or i would sort of understand what you were saying but i think it was going too fast and i it was going to make me drop some of the like value that i saw in physics and math like there's stuff that i just let's say loved too much still in that scientific worldview to be able to drop it too quickly with phenomenology i know that ultimately like you can recover physics from phenomenology but at first it does feel like you're abandoning something that you really love so as you said i'm glad you're doing that because i don't have i don't have like a specific love for physics myself so it's good that you that you're doing but and as you said what ended up happening is like okay so i had this love for for still the physical especially physical science that i was trying to like still use in my my studies i was talking with you to try to get more into the symbolic world view i was also talking with john riki about the cognitive science side and also in in general he was great on the the physics side and i was always trying to bridge mainly between you and john i would say and it took it took several years i would often like run arguments by you and by him and like try to see if i can make something most of our conversations you and i jonathan were in private on like for patreon chats with john all of my discussions are public on my channel or on his channel but basically as you said like through this i developed i think pretty carefully a path from materialism all the way to the symbolic world like and even up to the more let's say esoteric debates in symbolism like how is it exactly that the world exists in in christ and how is it that the world exists through human consciousness and like all of these more esoteric kind of questions you can get there pretty quickly with phenomenology but as i said this was too much for me so i go i went at it very slowly and i try to document it in in the book so the main thesis is that we're in in a meaning crisis because of materialistic reductionism i ed the zombie myth to talk about it and then i tried to the the way that i tried to do it to to go slowly as i said is i try to show like within science itself there's no good way anymore to be a reductionist this is like in 19th century view of science it doesn't work not only can you still have your science including your physics today by going toward non-reductive materialism non-reductive naturalism sorry you'll even have like a better science a better physics to love so i'm trying to really like give something to materialists so they don't have to drop anything they actually just have something better so that's the first part of the book where i try to take people from materialism to non-reductive naturalism which is really just classical metaphysics like if you if you read let's say like what classical metaphysicians wrote using aristotle or plato like in the last few centuries like you'll see something that hs really well modern non-reductionist naturalism and in the book i go through it carefully but there's arguments really coming from both like the top and the bottom like there's all kinds of arguments that popped up in philosophy and cognitive science about the impossibility of reducing the mind to matter and even like in general the idea that there are those emergent properties that you can't reduce to lower entities so it shows up in chemistry in in biology and the most obvious case is with consciousness like you won't find many people now in philosophy of mind or cognitive science who think that the mind is just a matter of particles or neurons let's say so this there's this like problem coming from the top but there are also problems coming from the bottom in physics where like things always get iffy when you talk about quantum stuff because people like can defend easily new age ideas about this i know i never talk about that stuff just because i know what the problem that it brings yeah but but but there's a real problem for people who want to be materialist there because like if you're materialist and you want to reduce things down to particles like you have to be able to talk about those particles but like you're going to enter into like new ag territory pretty fast because it doesn't look like what you see down there is stable particles like you can see like fields and you can mathematize them and there's interesting stuff to say but it's definitely not stable particles like at best it's probability fields that you can quantify but as you do that you're starting to like go towards stuff that is closer and closer to the prime matter that the classical metaphys metaphysicians talked about and another problem coming from physics is that and that's something coming from physicalists themselves is like there's no we don't know what physical entities are like even by nature physics doesn't tell you what its entities are it tells you how they behave like it only gives you equations and even if physicians tell you like the mass and charge of the electron is this or that all that means is that if you put such and such values in an equation you'll get this and this behavior but you actually never know what physical entities are in physics so like if you're trying to reduce things down to particles let's say and you're a materialist like you're in big trouble because it doesn't look like what you have at the bottom are stable particles and you don't even know like what is their nature you know how the waves behave let's say but you don't know why or what they are fundamentally so there's like these big problems if you want to be a modern naturalist of like there seems to be irreducible stuff at the top and there also seem to be something like tr matter at the bottom but like that's perfect if you just consider aristotle and plato and like the whole classical metaphysical tradition because in that world viiew what you have at the top are irreducible forms and what you have at the bottom is prime matter and the world exists in a hierarchy between them like the classical metaphysicians didn't quite use the words that john biki use uses for that but i think it's great like is terminology of emanation top down and emergence bottom up i think that's a great way of explaining it like from potentiality things emerge but if you just add this bottom up emergence like it would be impossible to explain why things coair so you also need this top down comination of forms these patterns that allow potential to cohere into actual entities so that's the first part of the book like how you can retrieve a classical worldview where you not you not only have this ontology of like matter and form in a hierarchy but you also have forms that have to do with vices and virtues like you can recover what i said earlier about perception the fact that okay you learn to perceive objects but also vices and virtues so you recover a sense of good and evil you're you're already starting to leave nihilism behind you're not quite up to christianity yet and a full solution to the zombie problem but at least like you're not a nihilistic materialist anymore and what i like about doing it this slowly is that there's nothing that the scientist loses at this stage like it's just positive like you basically take the entire science that the scientist had but you take his ontological hierarchy and you just make it a bit bigger so that what he has makes more sense but it doesn't have to drop anything so that's that's the first part of the book and then the second part of the book what i do is i try to go further by saying okay christianity is still the full solution like i can't justify christianity fully using arguments coming from naturalism or materialism i think like if you could fully justify christianity using something lower you would actually be reducing christianity to something lower i think the way that truth works in general is you have to rather like try to seduce people into something higher so what i try to do is a lot like what lewis did in his book miracles but i do it for modern naturalism now i say if you take the pattern of the incarnation now and you try to see the ontological hierarchy you try to see the natural world in the light of the incarnation the natural the natural world actually makes more sense and it's the same way that any new theory is advanced even in science like the way that newton for instance advanced his theory of relativity was exactly this like he came up with new aums that people thought were crazy by the way people thought newton was proposing something occult because he was proposing a force that acted as a distance whereas everyone back then was a mechanist like people thought that everything was just like basically bard bilard balls and like things pulling and pushing against one another so people thought there was like something like material explaining why were attracted to the earth but because newton said it was just a force acting at a distance people thought he was insane but because he was able to seduce them they actually ended up agreeing with him because he said okay just i know it doesn't make sense from your like standpoint but if you grant me what i'm proposing then you're going to have all that you have right now and more so he basically ended up like seducing people and now we think nothing of it like of course gravity of course for is acting at a distance but i'm trying to do do the same for the incarnation i'm trying to say okay like the incarnation seems crazy like it seems to be too much from a naturalistic standpoint even a non-reductive naturalist but actually i think that if you take the incarnation you'll be able to get all of what you had before and more again so i'm trying to seduce people into it and we talked i'm i'm making use of much of the stuff we discussed a few years ago related to miracles especially at the miracle of the incarnation i think like it it just makes so much sense of even the experience i had doing mathematics when i was a student because and it it just blows my mind any anytime i think about it let's say if i try to prove a theorem let's say even something basic like the pythagorean theorem i'm taking an abstract truth that exists outside of space and time like even if there was no physical universe the pythagorean theor would still be true and yet when i'm thinking about this like somehow all of my neurons like are assembling to ost this immaterial truth so there there's this crazy bridge that happens in human beings when we ponder eternal truths and i think the world makes more sense if it's made for this like if at its root like this this bridge is just an image of the bridge that happens in the incarnation where the creator of the forms and matter comes and embeds himself into that great hierarchy so that's just one example but you can find so many let's say aspects of nature aspect of this ontological hierarchy that you find in non-reductive naturalism that are better explained if you take the incarnation as the key that ultimately i think like people should be seduced into the story of the incarnation and mythologically also what this does is a solution to the zombie crisis i opened the book with like a solution to i opened the book with the zombie myth to explain our reductionistic materialistic standpoint but as i also said earlier ultimately is the eucharist it's self-sacrifice that is the full solution to the zombie problem and i want to invite people into that story i want to i want to seduce people into the story of the incarnation i think i provide a solution to the zombie problem and also in metaphysics i give people something that makes more sense than just non-reductive naturalism so that's the main thrust of the book like i try to take people from materialistic reductionism to classical metaphysics where they're not nihilists anymore where good and evil exist and then i try to take them all the way into the story of the incarnation where like all zombies are vanquished all the zombies are van i i i mean like i think it's exciting because it seems like it's also just the right moment for that to to come out because we have all these people all these surprising moments like ayan hery i who's says she's a christian she's liter i' i've heard that she's there's gonna there's a debate organized between her and dawkins like they're gonna actually debate that all of a sudden so the the all of these things happening you even have people like brett weinstein who are also kind of moving in a direction saying oh this isn't work anymore this is in some ways this is over like this world this kind of 19th century thinking is done and so it's a it's a wonderful time jordan peterson's next book is called we struggle with god and he's going through the bible and he's doing a similar thing to what you're doing which is he says says by the time people finish reading this they'll just be no room for atheism anymore so this is a perfect time for all this to come together so how do you see the course going through going with this like how do you see the class coming together yeah good question basically the more the the more advanced topics i decided to keep for the course i want the book to be more general public let's say so there's no need to go into some of the more niche symbolic world topics like i think it's important for people who are really interested to know like what distinguishes the symbolical metaphysics from let's say per peral metaphysics or universalist metaphysics i think it's important to try to see like more precisely interesting stuff like how it is that the world exists in in christ how it is that the world comes to exist through human consciousness but i don't think it's necessary to go into those topics for a general audience that is just trying to get out of nihilism so basically my approach was to take the course as an opportunity to dive deeper into more advanced topics that i think will be interested interesting to the symbolic world audience people who have some background in symbolism but i also cover everything that is in the book so if someone just wants to work through the arguments carefully like in a setting with other people and ask questions i think the course is going to be a great place to do so and for people who want more who want stuff that is not going to be in the book if people want to hear more about the more difficult aspects of symbolic world metaphysics the course is going to be a great place to delve into those topics so this is i mean to me it seems like an like an exciting thing i and i know because i can see that i mean i see it i see that people have questions let's say that i don't necessarily have and so they have issues because they they they're trying to connect kind of the symbolic thinking with other aspects that are not the ones that i either know or that are let's say in the forefront of my of my mind and so this is really important for people who have those kind of specific questions and people who are also you know we all have we all have our strength and our capacity to do certain things and and i'm really grateful that you're there to also provide some a little more technical specificity to how this works and trying to say you know try to work it out in a more detailed way it's useful for everybody especially people that are in the symbolic world kind of thinking and kind of roaming around that that way of seeing the world but they also are in university or they're in grad school and they or they even some some people like they even have positions in universities and you know they they're starting to think that way but they're struggling sometimes to justify to their peers and to be able to explain it to the people around them so this is a very useful thing you're doing yeah i think now is also a good time to do it because it's still close enough to me like i can tell that let's see as as christianity in the symbolic world you becomes more second nature to me like it it it takes more thought to put myself back back into the shoes of a reductionistic materialist so i can i can feel that it like it could slip like in 10 years it would be much harder for me to write the book than it it was now and i think the same thing is going to happen to a lot of people like ideally if the book can save time for people who are at the point where i was 10 years ago that's great and then they can forget about it and move on to just like sing the world symbolically but yeah as you said i think now is a is a good time to do it if there's lots of people going through through this transition if i can save them a lot of time i think this is great and it would be harder to do like at some point as more and more people see the world this way like it's going to be harder to document the transition exactly how it works yeah because i mean our prediction both my brother and i's prediction and i think d peterson told me he had a similar insight when he wrote math of meaning it he said you know in 25 years everybody's going to think this way and no one will know that they've change the way they think and so i think that for those of us that are at the outset of this and that are kind of helping to instigate the change it's useful for us to be clear on what's going on as we notice it kind of infuses the backgrounds of people's minds and change the world view slowly so wonderful stuff i'm i will be there in the class folks i'll be there not in every single episode but i'll be there at the beginning maybe a few times during it and i'll definitely be there at the at the last class to kind of to wrap it all up so i'm looking forward to seeing people there and to and to follow along and you know this year like how can i say this like everything now covid after co ended things are kind of starting to consolidate i feel you know we have the symbolic world press now we're going to start to publish not just my works but also works of people like john philip that are in the symbolic world and that are thinking about this and that have really worked out some aspects so both fiction and non-fiction so it's a it's a great time to to to jump in and to get involved we did the baywolf class it was massively successful and i think we'll see something similar with this class as well so people sign up the class is what did we say the first dat was it going to be we just the 24th yeah the 24th january 24th so january 24th is the first class sign up we'll put a link in
