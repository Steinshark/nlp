ladies and gentlemen it's currently may 6th 2024 and another massive cheating or anti-cheating story has hit the world of chess since september 4th of 2022 when hans neeman played magnus carlson at a tournament in st louis cheating has been all the rage and everything to discuss on the 64 squares and over the last couple of days an insane story broke of a grandmaster account that was banned for fair playay on ch.com i made a video about it some of you might have seen it if you haven't i'll put it in the description this is an update video because that account which belonged at the time to an anonymous grandmaster that anonymous grandmaster has come forward told us his identity gave us a massive life story and told us that he did not cheat i don't even know where to begin we're going to look at this reddit post then we're going to look at some games this is going to be a really really juicy story so this is the post it's me viso now who is viso this happened four days ago who is viso 3100 rated anonymous grandmaster who is sacrificing an exchange on move three every game and is currently beating daniel naroditsky in blitz this is viso an account that was created several years ago that actually had played naroditsky many many many times it had played this account had played nitzki hundreds of times and it played nitki in a very long blitz match on may 2nd in the early hours of the morning here in new york city time and ultimately was banned in the middle of a game nobody knew who it was and now we do we are going to read this and then we are going to go through some games some analysis some absolutely insane updates it's me hello people of reddit this is going to be a long comprehensive post so forgive me in advance but i think it's crucial i don't leave out any information so here it goes to catch everyone up to speed the other day i seem to have shaken up the chess world after defeating daniel naroditsky and other players by the way he beat other players in a long blitz match on chess.com with my anonymous chess.com account starting every game with a4 and rook a3 giving up an exchange on the second move of the game speculations about who it was started you know spinning is it magnus hearo young indian prodigy a brazilian grandmaster is it stockfish well it's me hi i'm the problem it's me swifties rejoice and please don't copyright strike me gm brandon jacobson but you can call me brandon i don't know what we would have called like did he expect us to call him his full name like gm brandon jacobson so it's this it's this guy this is brandon jacobson i know brandon jacobson i've played brandon jacobson many times over the board and his brother as well aaron and jacobson they grew up here on the east coast where i am in the united states when brandon was young i would beat him all the time and then he got older and he started beating me both physically and on the board and he has a very funny thing here that says vladimir karnick please notice me his last blizz games were played in february okay so wow what first of all there is no evidence this is actually branded i don't think he posted a picture i'm not trying to discredit this i'm just saying i read this and the first thing i thought of was couldn't anybody theoretically make this post but i'm assuming he submitted some sort of proof okay before i get into what happened i would like to share a little bit about myself part one who am i ever since learning the game at the age of five and wanting to imitate my older brother this is going to be a long read so buck alab who learned from an after school program you can put the phone down or just put me up on the smart tv maybe i'll read it in very dramatic narrator voice i've always been fascinated with chess being an extremely intuitive person and an overthinker combined with being extremely competitive i've always my purpose and comfort in chess coming from a family who didn't even know the rules as early as i can remember being around 8 years old i would compile notebooks upon notebooks of openings i would attempt to teach myself using my houdini program which i was enamored with playing at my local club every weekend was the highlight of my week nerd slowly i kept improving and improving and throughout the years i would be inspired time and time again by reading the classics for example my system oh my god what a nerdy 8-year-old child i would you can't even pay me money to read that book now during he needed this this is what brandon needed by by the way back in the day didn't exist modernized chess book right here during difficult times in my childhood chess would always be my escape me too high five for family trauma sometimes with endless room to learn and become better at i can vividly remember being 10 i'm skipping a little bit being 10 years old and i attended a us school camp graciously run by greg shahad giving talented american kids an opportunity for a few days of free trading i was by far the youngest and low rated players there were fms and ims and in the end he took an intuition test and he had the highest score of realizing what it took fast forward he was invited to the kaspar chess foundation program which gives american young talents an opportunity to meet and work with gary gaspara for gary to tell you that you're trash and convince you to go into politics and also this is where he met andrew hong andrew hong is an important member of the story he comes up later i lost to andrew hong and to brandon as they were trying to become grand masters by the way so fun fact about me i'm worse than both of them a chess but i recently beat andrew hong in a game so i'm actually better than him so kasparov noticed he had good understanding but he fooled around a lot he caused he caused problems and kasparov had talked to his mom telling her he was very talented but lazy he's going to have to start working hard brandon didn't take the advice he had fun as a teenager and he's unstoppable when he's in form but he tilts a lot as well he played a tournament once where he had an iv stuck in him the night before but he ended the tournament with a 2700 performance so he yeah he he's always been kind of a good and talented player i remember when brandon was was younger i would i mean i'm assuming this is brandon and not like some random person i would play him i was always pretty confident because i i had a feeling he would get into his head when playing me imagine that but now he's like much stronger now i get into my head playing him so he played a lot of online blitz it was a big confidence boost for him and finally this past fall he took the decision to take time off school give himself a fair shot at making it to the top during the time he played a lot of blitz online he's been 31 100 for multiple stretches but every time he ran into hikaro or nidi he would have awful results against them but then this paragraph is about having a nice tournament in 2013 he won a nice tournament in europe and he you know he wasn't happy because his losses are self-inflicted with nerve issues like me and he came home and he started you know getting his head together he played fully focused defeated pam makulu he had a decent match against hikaru so he made a lot of progress he claims as a chess player and yeah hikaro complimented him he faced some health issues which until now he hadn't opened up about publicly he had burnout and during this difficult time he continued to work hard but didn't play a lot okay so in the step to recovery he he met andrew hong again like they they met up him and his friend from earlier and andrew hong showed him this ridiculous opening that he was playing which is a4 rook a3 now what's funny is that this is the opening so apparently andrew hong who's got an anonymous account named pasta on twitch i am not revealing that he literally brings it up later his friend andrew hong did apparently a lot of analysis on this really idiotic opening a4 rook a3 which browser based stockfish thinks is minus 2.4 and stockfish at a higher depth thinks is basically completely lost so essentially his friend andrew hong did some you know ridiculous analysis on this opening and showed that it's bad that it's bad but it's not hopeless that's basically the story this is the story so his friend showed him this then he started playing games and then he played against the w because that's how i pronounce that name w f f whatever and there it is right here's a bunch of games that andrew hong plays where he gives up the rook he puts his queen in the corner he develops double fetto and you know black plays principal plays in the center and generally what will happen is black tries to overextend tries to win suddenly white is counterattacking and andrew hong now is not even not even worse despite giving up a rook on the second move which is kind of ridiculous and and then you know andrew just very calmly just beats a 2800 play player you can't take because i take your rook so you know basically the point of this post is to say his friend plays this completely ridiculous system he told me to play it and i you know this i was sort of recovering from burnout and all these different things and my friend showed me this really stupid system and wouldn't shut up about it and so they played a bunch of games against each other he wasn't able to beat him so he joined team rook odds it's not quite rook odds but it's you know it's it's bad right it's obviously it it's exchange odds okay here we go i created my anonymous account vu many years ago inspired by an inside joke i had with brazilian friends at the time as a way to fool around okay somebody told me that viso is like this is a meme we had brazilians in the comment section of the last video talking about why this username would be this username so his rating dropped a bunch of on the main account due to playing he was trying to keep his heart rate down and it was unsuccessful he was just trying to be more serious i decided to play a few games here and there avoid the pressure of potential cheating accusations due to the difference in level okay so he said his rating dropped on his main account so he said the rating dropped on his main account uh dropped much of my main account due to trying to play while mitigating some of my focus in an unsuccessful okay so the reality of modern chess is if you're not 2700 being accused by everyone to your face and behind your back every time a good result is achieved i've even had one prominent well-respected grandmaster write an entire article praising my talent as a teenager only to accuse me of cheating behind my back okay we will never know who that is finally he dove in on april 30th he played a bunch of warm-up games having zero expectations complete shock he was crushing people so it soon started to click that i was barely giving any odds at all he was winning games left and right with similar themes and tricks although playing totally unsound throughout the whole game according to stockfish having opponents eventually collapse under the pressure soon enough i get paired with daniel nitzki sure i gained confidence and was back to my peak form but how could i possibly get away with such utter stupidity against da yeah and so basically he says there was no pressure he was anonymous they played 70 games and with so many creative ideas from the both of us double exchange sacri later t to be plus seven for white but with outpost for my pces so he links this game which yeah i mean basically these are the kind of games that they were creating where you know da had two rooks versus bishop and knight his king was getting hunted into the center of the board and he was defending himself and you know it led to some completely insane battles it led to many mistakes and then ultimately daniel lost so this is kind of the thing that he's saying they had a lot of games and he also mentions me i analyzed one of the games so he won 40 to 29 and he was annoyed he says da was annoyed and flabbergasted and he won and then things started going viral on reddit so he could not believe what he was seeing next he was forced to resign by the live server he was kicked out of live chess and soon after he got he received the response that x day saying he was banned for a fair play violation with no explanation his jaw dropped he could not believe what was happening anxiety turned to anger quickly submitted an appeal which they haven't responded to had i really played so well the algorithm flagged me for cheating i got my ego in check when i went through the games the games were not all great they had mistakes and then frustration ensued is the only way someone could beat nski in a match 2750 plus you have to be a cheater he's one of the best bliss players in the world he car on his stream earlier said that it would have been wesley so but brandon ones beat wesley so nine games in a row on wesley's anonymous account at the time dogs of war it's now no longer right people speculated it could be an indian prodigy and he also said his friend beat hikaru as well he said that his friend andrew hong the next day they played an arena on ch.com and andrew hong also managed to beat hikaru look at this hikaru played very solidly and he you know played principal chess and then it got kind of complicated iaro was was doing very well for a while attacking white and then somehow like the game turned around and suddenly andrew hong was like no longer completely lost he was defending himself and this was the game and slowly but surely after a long fight like white was completely winning hearo blundered and white was winning and andrew hong went on to beat hikaru from this same system and basically the argument is well look andrew hong you know managed to beat hikaru and i beat naroditsky and yeah i mean this was complete domination from andrew hong he had a nice game hikaro tried to create some tricks but it wasn't enough and he lost and that is the point he's basically saying well you know my friend beat hikaru in the same way he then talks about other people getting you know accusations and the chess world is the only place where it's socially acceptable for growing men to continuously attack teenagers and attempt to ruin their careers by being upset over losing a game and nobody does anything about it i would assume chesc staff simply seen brandon jacobson beating d dan with rook gods no way and hit the ban button and then would expect radio silence or you know that would explain radio silence who knows guess we never will what's funny is da himself plays pet lines like bunch of different kings indians tired of it all tired of being blah blah blah blah for some final remarks if you don't believe a word i've written who would be stupid enough to cheat against nitzki and risk their reputation i would decide to stay anonymous forever had i truly been a cheater but i'm sharing my story publicly without care how this may damage my reputation the truth always prevails in the end not always not in this case i just mean in general like i don't think the truth always prevails i mean people go to jail for things they didn't do right but anyway it's a i mean it sounds nice in theory i apologize again for the length of this post and so on and so forth i actually commented on this and he responded to me and was like he he asked to be in this video maybe i'll invite him for a followup we'll see how long this story goes so long story short brandon jacobson is this account and was taught by this guy how to play this opening and apparently it's not as stupid as it looks and he beat da 40 to 29 in a match now what's crazy about mr brandon jacobson is he didn't just beat da he actually beat a lot of people he had a match where he played darus schz darius schz is one of the best grand masters in the united states right now originally from poland and here's a game it's very similar setup i mean white basically plays the same way like every single time look look at this hikaru game right like look at this same setup same setup pretty similar setup here's the game against wo wa wo w w same setup look the setup is you know i mean it's pretty consistent and yeah in this game like white was completely lost i mean he played this stupid opening darius was playing very well and then suddenly white got some sort of counterattack brewing and darush kind of closed the position and it got very tactical and suddenly there's a lot of threats and everything is hanging and then then all of a sudden you know darius's poten not any better anymore and it was a very complicated game it was a huge battle but darush lost on time like the game was close it was very tense right and suddenly darius just spent a bunch of time on like every single move and and white barely thought at all so like i mean white spent 4 seconds three six three three five you know and just completely outplayed the opponent and and and one and all of a sudden darius is down you know like this and he ended up losing a time and i think he beat darush 16 to4 using this system and then he played another guy even before that and he was doing the same thing and i mean with white or with black he was doing the exact same setup every single time and yeah he was just like it was a all these games were long battles and he was just outplaying his opponents in the long run like he was losing i mean brandon was losing in some of these games as you can see here but then his opponents would just blunder under the pressure somehow like white is completely winning and then you know he would like mate them out of nowhere right and and yeah he got lucky in a few games and some games he just totally outplayed people so oh my god where do i even begin so in cases like this right we all remember the hans nean report we remember in 2022 i just want to show this one last thing there was the hans demon report all right this was the month after the magnus hans thing and there was a wall street journal article and basically they published like a 70 page report about hans about cheating about how they think that he's done it more than they said that he said etc now here's the thing we have a case now where chess.com is saying brandon jacobson cheated now what they're not saying is that brandon jacobson cheated just hear me out for a second they never said publicly that brandon jacobson cheated this account was banned this account the anonymous one brandon himself is being brave let's say and and coming out and saying i did not cheat that's my anonymous account giving us this whole story and now here we are so this is crazy this is absolutely crazy to me the way i like to look at situations like this where i don't know i don't know what's going on i have no idea what's going on and i actually spoke to daniel nitzki i i called him kind of i tried to do my best journalist impression i'm not a journalist all right i'm a youtuber but i try to be unbiased i try to be fair to everybody i called him and i you know i i i i spoke to him he has no idea what the hell hit him i mean that's sort of like the summary he he he told me he was playing the match and he was like bewildered he had like no idea what was happening how he was losing these positions that he was getting like winning positions and he's like dude you're guess this as good as mine but what he did say and what he was very adamant about he was and and we if you watch dani you know he's a good guy and he's not a bser he he told me and he was okay with with me sharing like he had nothing to do with the band like nitzki can't lose blitz games to someone and go hey chess.com ban this person that's not how any of that works remember my whole thing with ind theja if you guys don't know the dewak keep us thing where i was basically accused of like being mad a guy beat me and then that's not what happens that doesn't that's not how it works what happened in this case is that the chess.com fairplay team were like there was cheating going on in those games the algorithm human review they would not ban on a whim it's a grandmaster like it's a grandmaster you know and it's a really big deal to ban a grandmaster but here comes brandon with this story all the backstory of his life and and and and and learning the system and now i'm just like what the heck what what is going on so the way i like to look at these situations this crazy you know post by brandon which i'm assuming is brandon i'm assuming it's brandon here's how i like to look at this i i enjoyed these little thought experiments i'm going to leave that i'm going to leave you with this and then i'm going to go about my merry way one of two realities is happening one of two realities same as with the han stuff right either there's cheating or going on or there's not same thing in this case either this entire post is 100% true 100% he didn't lie about anything he absolutely did not cheat and in that reality ch banned him unfairly right they were they're wrong they have they they're going to they're wrong on the other hand he cheated maybe not in every game maybe at certain moments but he cheated and they claim they have the statistical proof to back that up and he's lying in his post so both of these situations are kind of kind of nuts because as you can if you like that's it there's nothing there's nothing else there is literally no other reality where it's possible unless unless he's like account sharing but fair play doesn't fall under that like if he shared his like if if he said hey magnus go on my account and play da and right i i don't know like i don't know none of us really know what you get banned for but those are the two realities and both of them are kind of crazy because if chess.com is wrong like let's say in one of these two realities that's kind of nuts because then and they say themselves they have like a small small small false positive rate they they put out fair play reports and they talk about like they ban a million accounts like a month i mean it's it's kind of nuts the robust nature of all of this but there's also a lot of private conversations that happened behind the scenes between title players and chess.com and i'm not privy to them because i don't work at or for chess.com yeah that is the reality maybe i will talk to brandon maybe i will invite him assuming that he posted that but this is this is a wild this is a wild story absolutely wild story and the reason i showed you the hans neeman report is we are now living in a time where a person can get banned by chess.com for cheating high-profile title player and whether they cheated or not can go public and is chess.com going to publish a brandon jacobson report is ch.com going to publish no report are they just going to be like we stand by our actions and if brandon wants to investigate you know like what's going to happen that's the fascinating thing i don't think they're going to publish a brandon jacobson report like if they have one i i don't like i don't think that's what they're going to do i don't think they're going to publish all the statistical evidence that they used to make this b i just just don't think that's what they're going to do in which case people whether guilty or innocent can just make posts and say that was unfair and yeah that's we live in a wild time and and i i mean i don't know if there's an easy solution for cheating in online chess i really don't know or not or or the lack of or the suspicion it's you know what we got to do now you know i'm going to leave this food for thought da brandon jacobson inperson cash prize match brandon has to play that opening every since time how about that i'm already doing clash of claims in spain in june jose martinez versus vladimir karnick daniel nitki brandon jacobson let's do it in los angeles new york inperson match they got to play this opening we'll see what's what how about that anyway that's a big update and i'm going to go read more updates when they drop get out of here
