dude, but she won't do it. oh, wait, no, no, they didn't take any. they didn't freaking take any money. wait, wait, wait. she's come back to get it. i think they found our microphone, dude. well, i guess no free
money for you people today. they see us. hey, how are you doing? - hi - there's a tree here,
and it says "free money." and there is money on the tree. i don't really understand why. you want some? - what a weirdo.
