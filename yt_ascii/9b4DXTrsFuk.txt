one of the important aspects of the symbolism of the right and the left has to do with authority and power that is the two ways in which influence can be conducted on others on the world on society and so what i want to do is i'm going to continuing my last video on the symbolism of the left on the right hand i'm going to continue in this direction but we're going to look at how the symbolism of left and right applies to the very important aspect of authority and power in the world this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] it's one of the important aspects of symbolism as i've often said is that it is fractal that is the symbolism of the left and the right as i've talked about in my last video about the dasis of how it appears as the figures that are next to christ the mother of god sent john the foreigner saint peter saint paul but that symbolism is already included inside the icon of the panto krator the icon the panto crador is the image of christ as the returning christ or the christ as the ruler of all as the judge of all and so you have it a beautiful example here by the contemporary iconographer aiden hart and so in this image the image is separated left and right and on the right side of christ or on his right he is blessing with his hand and on his left side he is holding a book now already in this structure you will see that the basic symbolism of the left and the right is being maintained and even the crossover between the symbolism that i mentioned in the last video of how one seems to move into the other you can see something like that in this already in this structure and so christ is blessing with his right hand and this symbol that he does this this manner in which to hold his hands we we say that it is a blessing but the origin of this is actually the hand of a dress that is it is christ addressing us and of course we've come to interpret that as a blessing in the catholic church for example you will see priests that will bless with do it making this gesture you also sometimes see orthodox priests do that as well but it has so the notion of blessing and of address has come together but what's important to understand it is something like direct influence that is if i speak to you if i believe bless you if i address you then i am directly as a person influencing you right my my my relationship with you is direct but at the same time it is also flexible because orality has an impermanence to it in terms of its its manifestation right so i say something and then it vanishes right it only it only is retained in your memory it doesn't have physical instantiation so because of that it is also more flexible so it's direct and it's flexible and on the left hand he's holding a book now this book is interpreted in several ways some people sometimes say it's the book of the gospel but it's better to understand this book as the book of life that's described in revelation the book of books right it's you could say it's just a book or it it is a book in in you know it's the the book of books right is the best way to say that but what's important to understand the difference between of course the the right hand and the left hand or the address and the book is is that the influence of a book is indirect right so i don't have the person in front of me talking to me i've got something that they've said that is written on a piece of paper and now there's a distance between that what the person is saying and the book right so i've talked about how the right hand is a stand-in for the center the right hand hand is a moving towards the center in this case it's a straight direct influence and the left hand is moving away from the center and in this case it is this distance which appears in writing and but at the same time it is also fixed and so you could understand if you look at even at the last judgment you can understand that the direct address is a living it's a living breath it's a living influence that i'm having on you whereas the left hand and the book is more dead you could say right because it it can become dead letter right it's not just that but it can become something like dead letter where it's just a where the text has lost its spirit that's a possibility so you can understand now where why the the the right hand and the left hand is represented this way in this image now what's important to understand in the basic structure of the pantocrator is that this is based on a roman tradition it's based on ancient roman art and so i will show you this is a statue of the emperor titus and in the i the emperor is doing two things with his right hand he is addressing and with his left hand he is holding a scroll and so you can see the same structure in this image i could have shown you other images but this is this was the one that i had where you can see the roman emperor as as using that duality right addressing with his right hand and then holding the scroll in his left hand and this structure is understood by most art historians as also representing authority and power a toritas and protestas is the way that the the lad would have said it and the structure of authoritas and protestas is the basic structure to understand the manner in which roman society functioned and so the way that roman society function during the republic you had the senators now the senators they actually didn't have a they didn't have an explicit role in the managing of the nation they didn't have power in the immediate and executive power what they had was influence and their influence was based on who they were that is it was based on them these you know they were supposed to be wise men men that were recognized by all as as having as having authority in their person in their example in their lineage you know the fact that they were part of certain families and so it was really it has something to do with who they were which was giving them authority so you can see how this directness of a person's like i did i have done great deeds in the past and because of these great deeds i'm chosen to be on the senate or you know i come from this lineage that's been important in the city of rome and so because of that i am now in this influential position but the senators didn't have power to execute anything and that that that power to execute was what we call protestas which was magistrates and different people would receive a the power to do things so some of the power would be to enact certain laws the some of the power could be to do certain projects and then sometimes it would be to go to war and so the ultimate power would be something like imperium which would be the the the power that is granted to you to now go out and fight on behalf of rome and to accumulate other lands and and riches from other people in the name of rome and so you can see how those two are related now the patestas would would be would come from the senators to a certain extent that is the senators would give advice would would suggest would tell people what they should do but that telling had no legal had no legal weight it only had legal weight if it was enacted in in in other parts of their of their system toward the magistrates would then enact that law now what happened in the emperor is that those powers were brought together in one person and so that's why we see that the the emperor is addressing with his right hand like a senator but he's also holding that scroll and that scroll is seen as by by art historians as also a stand-in for potesta that is it's the law that's written down it's the edict that's written down it's like this is what we're gonna do it's the it's the you know it's the paper that makes it that that he can show to others to prove that he's allowed to do what he's doing okay and so one is direct and has that that that direct influence of authority and the other is indirect because it's written down and because it's it's it comes from above you could say and is implemented in the world and so this structure of authority and and power of attorneys and protestas became the the backdrop for the manner in which all of christianity both the the east and the west understood their their legal system okay and it comes in the in christianity that same kind of structure of these two direct in direct and indirect influence of a comes all the way down in a certain image which we call the traditions and traditional clavis which is a a western tradition especially but you see it in you see it in very early uh art and it gets developed in the middle ages where you see on the one hand christ giving to the one on his right saint peter he gives the keys and to the one on his left saint paul he gives the book and so the keys of course the keys are the same as as the addressing it's like the keys are a direct influence right with the keys i can open and close i can bind and i can unbind things i can you know i can make i can bring them together or i can let them loose and so this is a direct influence that christ gives to the apostles and it's represented as being given to saint peter and then of course there is the new law this more external aspect the new rules the book which is given to saint paul and so that makes sense with saint paul representing also the apostle to the gentiles the apostle to the outside herb himself being an outsider be being you know the the illegitimate apostle you could say and with saint peter holding the keys and being the stand-in the the stone on which christ built his church and so you can understand and it's super interesting to see how that relationship can sometimes be fruitful like in the case here where we represent them as the two pillars of the church this yakin and boaz that hold the church together but they can also sometimes become hostile and and it's interesting because in the way they can become hostile there's like a crossing over which happens and it would have to again with this crossing over of the of the of the the left and the right and you can see that with saint peter and saint paul on the question of circumcision which is interesting which is circumcision is the manner in which someone was marked in order to participate in the center but it's also a kind of external mark and so there's this interesting thing going on in saint paul challenges saint peter about circumcision and saying that you don't need this external mark in order to participate in the in the body of christ you have to be circumcised in your heart you know and so he brings it inside and so there's this interesting dynamic that is happening that that plays with this crossing over of the left and the right that i've talked about in the last video so you can meditate on that because it's sometimes hard to keep them in your mind but if you if you perceive it slowly you'll notice that there really is this duality but this duality that crosses over and of course this relationship will happen in many guises it will happen in the west in terms of the relationship between the the pope and the emperor between the pope and the king and so here the direct or higher or direct influence will now start to be seen as spiritual influence and the power the protestas the executive power will then be seen as the the secular courts the kings the emperors the secular authorities and so you can understand how this this now in some ways has been transformed a little bit but it but it also follows the same pattern and of course the two-headed byzantine eagle is a wonderful example of that to help you understand this relationship of this duality of the the two eagles one representing religious authority the other representing temporal power being held together by a common crown right you could say that this is the crown of christ or something like that there's a higher crown and then there that crown gets separated into two crowns one which is which is spiritual authority on the other is temporal power and in this particular version you hope you can see it you can see that it's very explicit that that's what at least this version is dealing with because the one talon of the ego is holding across and the other talon of the eagle is holding what's called a globus crusader which is a symbol of temporal power now this symbolism is fractal and so you could there can be different versions of that and so it's not always spiritual and temporal but it will always have this duality of direct and indirect or let's say masculine and feminine sometimes and so for example a good example would be like a king would hold in his hand a rod and and a globus and he's like he would he would have a scepter in his right hand and a globus in his right in his left hand and so you you have a straight and curved a straight and crooked thing a round thing and a straight thing and you can understand how the right one has to do with authority that is it's like you point at things and you say this right you point with your with your staff at things like a magician points at his staff at things and with his left hand it's the thing that he's holding he's holding the globe in his hand and so it's a kind of it's a it's a holding of land or a holding of power or a holding of this protestas and so you could have different versions of that so there are some versions of the do to headed ego where instead of having a cross and a globus the ego will have a sword and a globus or you know it could it could have i don't know if it exists but there could be one that has a a a staff and a globus you know and so it it doesn't always refer exactly to the same particulars but the structure is there that you can recognize being repeated over and over so you can understand in the manner in which it would happen there would be different ways that it would be played out in the world this relationship between between authority and power between the right hand and the left hand sometimes it would it could be fractal like even down at the you can notice how fractal it is if you look at the keys here for example and so again saint peter for example hold the keys but you can understand that one of those keys is on the right hand and one of those keys is on the left hand they kind of cross over because one is to bind and one is to unbind one is to tighten in the center and one is to loosen so you can understand that it's it happened fractally so even on the right you have it can be repeated at different levels where you have again the same symbolism which is repeated so that's important to understand because sometimes if you don't understand that it's fractal it can become confusing because you're like okay well then why so if left is something like unbinding pushing away like saint christ says about the goats and and right is something like binding or bringing in so then why does saint peter have the two keys went to a lock and went to unlock went to bind and went to unbind and so it has to do with that and so you could say that saint peter as a stand-in for the center has a left and a right hand himself and can manifest that at a lower level so that's just a little hint to understand that as well and so this can play out in different ways so for example in the the in the middle ages of course charlemagne for example was was crowned by the by the pope and and in the but there's always like a test if the if the two sides don't get along together the two sides can fight for the crown right the lion and the unicorn fighting for the crown you see that in the in that type of imagery where you have on the one hand the unicorn with its with its one horn with its with its staff with its representation of a stand-in for the central thing and then the line that is the powerful you know beast that will devour and that will that that is violent and so you can understand that the symbolism is everywhere if you if at some point you can see it so for example in the byzantine representation there'll be all kinds of play related to this so for example the the you know of course the patriarch would crown the emperor but then the emperor in church would come up to the the to the holy place and would usually bring the offering to the holy place it's like i am the the one in the world who is dealing with all this stuff and so i bring it to the holy place and then it's brought into the the holy place in order to be consecrated and so there are different ways in which this would play out but it's important to kind of understand these two aspects to understand them of course in the world but also to understand that they're related to to to the way we look at the christian art and so i want to look again at this transfiguration because the transfiguration and what's important about this the reason why i want to look at it is because in the in the last video i talked about the relationship between elijah and james and then between moses and saint peter and how there's this crossover but symbolism works on many levels at the same time and so there's also a manner in which in the bible this right and left hand is also related to the prophetic and the priestly and so you see that of course in in the in our tradition as well where you have the saints and then you have the the priest and the the official let's say the official structure of the church one is direct and flexible right the prophetic is direct and is if it's not not careful it can it can sometimes be a little too flexible you could say and then the other is indirect because it's a hierarchical structure you know that is functional but then it is also fixed it has a more fixed aspect so you can see that in the image of of of the transfiguration where elijah now in this case represents the the prophetic and this direct relationship to god and then moses is the one who receives the law and so also has this external part to him so it's fractal so christ is blessing with his right hand and he's holding a scroll in his left hand but then on his right he has elijah who is this direct this image of the prophet and the direct relationship and then moses who is the book and the indirect and so i know this can sound to some people like it's a contradiction between what i said in the last video but hopefully you'll start to be able to see how symbolism is not a system and and it has coherence and that coherence can manifest itself at different levels but it's not the type of coherence which can be reduced to assist to a system it's more it's coherent like a poem or coherent like a song and so it can function at different levels at the same time so hopefully this was useful for you to understand a little bit more about how important this relationship of the right and left is and maybe you can meditate a little bit about how if in the ancient world the right and the left were seen as authority and and potential and power how it is that right and left today are used in ways that are symbolically accurate to represent the basic divide in our political thinking and i think that if you start to think of the crossover of how some of these categories cross over it might help you understand the the the manner in which the right and the left because some people are surprised like some people are saying why is it that the left wants more government and it's like think about it think about it in the terms that i'm telling you about this crossover between that which is indirect and moving away in that which is also fixed whereas the other side is direct and and related on authority of the of the person but is also more flexible and so that's something that you can think about maybe go nuts in the comments and we'll see what happens so thanks everybody for your attention and i will talk to you very soon
