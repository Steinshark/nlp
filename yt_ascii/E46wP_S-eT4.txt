wait how many keyboards don't have here again ken and this when we actually cared about the content hello welcome so today we're taking a look at some of the cheapest amazon gaming keyboards which are all over the set now so we can build videos like this in the past where we took a look at some of the cheapest keyboards on amazon but today we're going into the cheapest gaming keyboard some are mechanical some are not some are mechanical feel like this amazonbasics option so let's see if you should waste your money or toss your keyboards across the room like ken does first of all we have the amazon basics mechanical field gaming keyboard and a whopping $34 okay that looks cheap so this does have rgb however it also uses amazon basics gaming software so we'll see how that goes mixed we have the impact k 10 water resistant gaming keyboard now it's interesting about this one is amazon also claimed that this was a mechanical feel keyboard but in a whopping $20 with a four dollar coupon bringing the grand total to 16 dollars shift it's not bad this is very generic looking although it does seem to have a few zones of rgb lighting and it's got a metal backplate hello thanks for choosing habit so this is actually the most expensive keyboard here and a whopping 42 dollars however however it comes with a little bit more than the other keyboards we have here a mouse so yes for 42 dollars you get natalie a supposedly mechanical keyboard but also a pretty click email sexually next up we have the re rk 100 or the real internet idea this is the cheapest keyboard here and a whopping $15 with a $2 coupon putting the grand total on this one at only 13 bucks i feel like we've actually taken a look at this keyboard before oh wait is this my programs broke keyboard oh yeah this is i use this i think in pro versus broke pair yourself for oral bliss what we have the alpha gaming viper fully mechanical gaming keyboard with fully mechanical blue switch keys and rgb lighting in case you're curious i feel like anyone who's actually into real mechanical keyboards it's just gonna be cringing at this video at this point [music] this one actually looks like it has a built-in wrist rest as well yes a little bit of a chunky guy but okay alright next we have the logitech g 2 1 3 prodigy rgb gaming keyboard with sixteen point eight million colors this actually looks to be nice i mean definitely the print quality on the keys looks pretty solid but alright we'll have to give that one a try next we have the stoker now this one actually has some of the best reviews of any of these keyboards supposedly as a mechanical and it's $38 it seems like a good deal however something i didn't realize when i ordered it let's take a look at the keys they're all round oh nevermind they're not round wait wait wait wait this side the box has round keys this side has square keys what can you see this is wrong this is round piece is square now i have a lot of keyboards to test today however i'm going to add one more the razor huntsman tournament no actually really like this keyboard so the standard version of the huntsman is the one that sits in my desk everyday and this is simply a well it's a much more expensive keyboard than the other ones we're taking a look at at 130 bucks what i want to do here is this is sort of the control this is what all the other keyboards will be compared to see exactly how much more or how much less you're getting we spend what a quarter of the price so to start off with i'm going to be doing a blind test of all eight keyboards to see exactly how much i can tell the difference between them and if maybe some of the cheap ones can surprise ken i heard you have a bracket by chance a bracket almost march madness style as if we're trying to shamelessly steal a great format to test keyboards interesting so this one has it feels like a membrane keyboard okay that one's not bad that one's not bad let me try this one so the thing i notice about this one is it's a little bit like the key comes up a little bit quicker it actually has a little bit more of a click but if this is mechanical keyboard it's really like soft switch i'm gonna have to say this is b yes i'm gonna go with b on this one okay okay this is actually a really tough one i'm pretty confident that these are both mechanical i'm going to give a very very slight edge to c i this could go either way though they're both pretty solid that was really quiet what this oh but that membrane wait but i feel like just thinking my head there haven't been this many membrane keyboards now i'm getting confused okay i feel like i'm getting a little bit more tactile response out of this one so i'm gonna go with e on this oh whew so what i like about this one it's not as clicky as like some of the blue mechanical switches but i do think these are mechanical but it's just the fact that like the key it feels so tight like there's not a lot of play like some of these cheaper keyboards you almost feel a little bit of play as you sort of start to type down but this i feel very confident with this one like it feels like though the key almost wobbles a little bit as i type down on it comparing these two this one feels significantly cheaper i'm pretty sure this is a razor and i'm definitely thinking definitely family alex so i have flicky boy number one knock with your boy number two i actually like this one in a vacuum i don't think it's mechanical it does actually feel pretty good though so there's a nice kind of springiness to it it sounds decent not amazing this one i think the responsiveness is great on this one the noise is obviously something which is up to you but i think that i have to go with what number is one letter is this i'm confused now okay okay so we've got keyboard number one and keyboard number two oh this one's not bad that was not bad this was better i think this is another mechanical feel it's got a little more cleanness to it but also just it sinks really deep like i feel like i'm really squishing i mean that's definitely membrane right there yeah i'm gonna go with this one for sure this one's fine but i definitely first one alright final time fine fine you know i know fine fine awesome alright not fine not funny not funny not something i'm deaf i asked which direction i'm facing right now i think okay this keyboard it's nice and clicky i like it and this keyboard so i like this one pretty consistently this is definitely the one with the really like it's the the nice sort of key feel and the very little wobble i guess i'm gonna take a guess this is a blue switch you know what i'm actually happy with the way the bracket is gone because i actually legitimately feel like these are the two best keyboards did i've used today this is actually a tougher choice than my five point as much as i like the kind of the very clicky sort of stuff this one just feels so much better it i think has a better sound i'm gonna go with this one is the final way they just picked the mechanical feel because if i did i'm gonna feel very embarrassed okay it's time for the reveal of which keyboards i have chosen ah right yeah oh the razor one yes okay ah i've been in the blindfold for too long so i feel really good about the razor coming at first place it means i'm not a complete [ __ ] the blue switches on this one we're legitimately the best i felt i'm surprised at the amazonbasics one made out of the first round for a non mechanical keyboard that's about as good as it gets this was let's begin it's not mechanical is it all this is a mechanical feel look at that wow so what's interesting is all the mechanical switches we have here are all blue i went she wouldn't be surprised if these three keyboards have the same switches if not very very similar ones look feel good when we actually go a little bit more in-depth i want to try the razor a little bit more definitely this one these are the best of the mechanicals and i want to spend some more time with this amazonbasics lord because this one actually legitimately impressed me it felt not quite mechanical but mechanical feel is actually not a wildly inaccurate way to describe that one so first off i'm going to try the amazonbasics keyboard so that i plug it in the rgb lighting actually looks pretty nice and we do have quite a few customizable keys but we also need to download the amazonbasics gaming software somewhere you hear that you're like battling this is okay i don't feel great about it honestly the blind test i felt a little bit better about the fact that it felt mildly like a mechanical switch but literally playing it for like three minutes it does not feel remotely like it that's spacebar is a killer man it's nice did you have all these like extra buttons and customizable features but the fact is i mean yes this is a fairly cheap keyboard but it feels cheap like this does not feel like a real mechanical keyboard at all next we have the habit now this one does actually have full perky rgb backlighting now you don't need software although i actually might consider that to be a benefit is all you need to do is just hold function you can cycle between the different modes well that was cool what i do how's that whoa i like disco mode alright we're gonna stick with disco mode is it oh that's rad all right all right i'm excited all right let's do it oh this feels so much better look my space key doesn't like rattle do this feels great i really like this keyboard thanks kermit the hyung nelly didn't have the best feelings switches out of all of these sort of alice a knockoff blue switches that are obviously not real cherry blue switches but they feel good and that's half of that you get the perky rgb backlighting you get the wrist rest and the mouse which you probably don't really want to use i mean realistically yes i still prefer to use the razor keyboard but it almost tripled the price in fact actually a little bit more than triple the price is it really worth it for most people i would argue no i feel like this is actually one of the best cheap mechanical keyboards i have ever tried not what i expected to say when i started this video anyway thank you very much for watching not only should you subscribe to the channel if you have not already you should also go over to our second channel this is where it really simply did a video all about some questionable items that we purchased on wish it gets a look it's weird you
