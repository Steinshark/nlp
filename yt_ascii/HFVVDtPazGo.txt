from 1965 to 1989 the soviet union detonated at least 122 nuclear bombs on its own lands the explosions were part of a program for the peaceful use of nuclear weapons in industry and economy some made craters for storing water some others were for clearing rocks for strip mining and yet others dug massive holes for canals the americans had a program of their own and it is well covered but evidence shows that the soviet peace nuke program was far far larger in this video we're going to take a look at some of the soviet union's peaceful nuclear explosions but first i want to remind you about the newsletter sign up for updates and new analysis the full scripts of selected popular videos and more the sign up link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show in 1949 the soviet union announced that they possessed the bomb or rather the power of the atom they didn't talk about nuclear weapons themselves in his address to the united nations the soviet foreign minister andre vishinsky said the soviet union did not use atomic energy for the purpose of accumulating stockpiles of atomic bombs it was using atomic energy for purposes of its own domestic economy blowing up mountains changing the course of rivers irrigating deserts charting new paths of life in regions untraded by human foot this was certainly propaganda but it does indicate that almost from the very beginning the soviet union thought about using nuclear explosives as a tool for development they weren't alone scientists had long considered the use of nuclear weapons for peaceful purposes even before the first bomb was finished the scientists otto frisch proposed using the bomb to source neutrons for experiments the first published article about the topic came out in 1950 it was written by the scientist fred raines who had worked on the manhattan project in it he admitted the serious issue of radiation he noted that detonating first generation fission bombs would leave a serious and perhaps even lethal dose of radiation in the detonation zone for at least several months setting aside this very minor issue he speculated on the potential to use nuclear explosions for construction projects like earth moving diverting rivers and smashing polar icebergs reigns later won the nobel prize for first detecting the neutrino and there is a building named after him on the university of california irvine campus seems like a good legacy to me the development of the hydrogen bomb in the 1950s helped tip the conversation towards what are called peaceful nuclear explosions the hydrogen bomb is an update on the first fission bombs it fires in two stages there is a fission reaction that heats up hydrogen isotopes to millions of degrees kicking off a second stage of fusion reactions this results in a far larger explosion oppenheimer long argued against the development of what he called the super because such a weapon can only be used for genocidal destruction yet such a bomb also made far more sense as a civilian device first they're cleaner quote-unquote you still need some radioactive materials for the fission trigger but far less of it so you don't get as huge a radioactivity released at first generation fission bombs had second there are also cheaper efficient bombs require uranium-238 or plutonium both of these are rare expensive and dangerous materials hydrogen bombs on the other hand primarily require the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium far more common than uranium the first detonation of the super happened in 1952 with ivy mike the bomb weighed 65 tons and detonated with a blast equivalent to 10 million tons of tnt the resulting crater was over a mile wide and 160 feet deep in 1957 the united states kicked off project plowshare the name is a reference to the bible isaiah 2 4 in which they talk about beating swords into plowshares project plowshare wanted to promote the idea of the once military atom as a quote-unquote friendly tool for human use at the start the american program sought to utilize nuclear explosions for three specific use cases the first was for large earth-moving projects there were proposals to use nuclear weapons to widen the panama canal or to cut a waterway through nicaragua or to make an artificial harbor in alaska the second use case is for exploiting natural resources like mining or oil drilling for instance a single nuclear device can replace tons and tons of conventional ones saving on both the cost of the explosives themselves as well as digging the initial chamber for them the third use case would be for science you can use them to study the structure of the earth's internals or use the insane conditions of a nuclear detonation to produce unique isotopes or elements the soviet union initially attacked the project plowshare program as a trick in september 1958 the chief soviet delegate to the second international conference on the peaceful uses of atomic energy in geneva called plowshare okonko cover to evade the suspension of nuclear bomb testing at the time the soviets wanted a comprehensive nuclear test ban which would have presumably covered these peaceful explosions back in march of that year they had announced a unilateral suspension on nuclear testing the soviet's goal with this was to put international pressure on the americans to suspend their tests the americans nevertheless plowed forward with project plowshare the soviet position on nuclear disarmament initially prevented them from starting their own peaceful nuclear explosives program but this of course changed the foundational work on this program started sometime in 1956 illustrating the benefits of using explosives or moving earth the soviets reported the use of three conventional explosions from july to december 1956 in china the blast ranged from 1 to over 9 000 tons of tnt and were to strip earth and rock from an underground ore deposit the results were encouraging and confirmed thoughts that nuclear blasting can be used for digging ditches and more in 1962 two soviet nuclear scientists yuri babaev and yuri trucknev wrote a report called on the need to launch work to study the possibilities of using atomic and thermonuclear explosions for technical and scientific purposes a title just slightly shorter than your average japanese light novel the report reached the deaths of ifam pavlovic slavsky minister of the medium machine building ministry it oversees the soviet nuclear weapons program upon his enthusiastic endorsement the country set up special divisions to arrange and handle program number seven nuclear explosions for national economy we should take a pause to discuss criteria for peaceful nuclear devices you don't just grab something out of the military backroom for the civilian detonations from the start these peaceful devices were custom designed to meet multiple criteria first their explosive yield and size must fit the task at hand not every situation calls for a 100 kiloton bomb most of the devices must be inserted down boreholes or the like so they have to be skinny this was challenging the original iv mike h-bomb was the size of a small room work had to be done to shrink the device last and most importantly they must detonate as cleanly as possible with the lowest possible fission yield a thermonuclear weapons total energy can come from either fission or thermonuclear reactions both involve radioactive materials but vision more so the more energy coming out of the vision process the more radioactive material tends to get dispersed so obviously we want that to be as low as possible the soviet union is undoubtedly the world leader in these quote-unquote clean detonations certain peaceful nuclear devices reached one to five percent fission yields to achieve this nuclear weapons designers placed a special casing around the weapon to reduce the release of radioactive materials and harmful neutrons meanwhile project plowshare was dealing with problems there were citizen concerns surrounding the somewhat relevant environment and safety issues associated with these detonations in july 1962 the united states detonated a 100 kiloton h-bomb in a test called storax sedan the intention was to observe the nuclear bomb crater for potential use in future construction or mining projects the bomb was buried down in a shaft nearly 200 meters deep the explosion moved 10 million tons of earth and created an earthquake rated 4.75 on the richter scale the crater it left behind was 1 300 feet wide and 320 feet deep later in the month the united states performed four more detonations as part of operation sunbeam these combined blasts created a massive radioactive dust cloud that scattered radioactive iodine 131 on several counties dick dust traveled as far away as 200 miles from the site and iodine was detected all the way in the east coast a few months later that year came the cuban missile crisis as the world teetered on the brink of all-out nuclear war american and international public opinion over the nuclear weapon substantially changed the crisis brought the two superpowers closer and on august 5th 1963 the united states and the soviet union signed the partial test ban treaty it prohibited nuclear test detonations in the open air but underground tests were still allowed since no radiation was presumably being released into the atmosphere and because of that authorities on both sides believe that plowshare and program seven could go on the first nuclear test under program number seven was for making water reservoirs the soviet union did their early nuclear tests at the semi-polantonous test site in what is now northeast kazakhstan the area gets good rainfall at certain times but during the dry seasons the rivers go empty the idea was to detonate a bomb to make a crater then cut a hole in that crater's side and wait for river water to fill it boom you got a reservoir thus on january 15 1965 the soviet union detonated its first quote-unquote peaceful nuclear explosion chagan or whole 1004 they dug a 178 meter deep hole in the dry bed of the shagun river and placed a 140 kiloton nuclear charge just to compare the original hiroshima bomb detonation released about 14 kilotons of energy so this was about 10 times bigger chagan was the most powerful nuclear weapon that the soviet union ever fired in peace whatever that means the bomb left the crater about 400 meters wide and 100 meters deep earth moving equipment then cut a channel in the side and let the river water pour in as planned minister slavsky of the media machine building ministry supposedly took the first swim in the lake the soviet daily newspaper hailed the land's total transformation and the lake's clear blue water about 20 percent of the fallout escaped into the atmosphere where it drifted into japan the us and japan both detected it and complained of a test ban treaty violation to which the soviets were alike nah the lake still exists today and it is still a little radioactive they call it atomic lake creative its water is used for irrigation and quenching sheep but strangely enough you cannot fish in it in october 1965 later that year the soviets carried out their second water reservoir test this second test site was also in kazakhstan the soviets incorporated several new learnings in this test called sade uzen first they used a smaller bomb about 1.1 kilotons and buried it closer to the surface about 50 meters the resulting crater was about 100 meters wide and 30 meters deep about a fourth as wide and a third as deep as chagan second they outfitted another round of conventional charges prior to the detonation two hours after the nuke went off they remotely triggered the charges to blow open a water intake channel in the crater walls this was so that nobody needed to enter the radioactive crater so soon after nuclear detonation presumably someone was concerned about that last time water quickly entered the reservoir but erosion rapidly shrank its total capacity presumably weakening its economic benefit in the following years the soviets carried out other cratering tests however they never tried to create any more water reservoir craters neither did a small dalliance with nuclear excavation for building dams pan out either considering how much the ussr needed these big water reservoirs the plan originally called for something like 50 of them i think that says something by the mid-1970s project plowshare had largely been shut down due to environmental concerns but even as the americans wound down plowshare the soviets pushed forward starting in 1969 they envisioned a construction project as big as anything they had ever done the patora kama canal project the patara river is a massive river that drains into pachora basin an area west of the ural mountains at 322 000 square kilometers the basin is about the size of germany it is mostly covered in tundra and taiga snow forests the kama river is a large tributary of the volga river which flows into the caspian sea it drains into the kama basin which at half a million square kilometers is larger than spain the idea of putting a canal between the two has been around since the'00s back then if you wanted to deliver goods between the two rivers you basically had to drag the stuff over 40 kilometers of very poor roads but there was a little point for that after the arrival of the railways in the 1960s the soviets diverted two rivers feeding into the aral sea once the world's fourth largest lake so that they can irrigate cotton this caused the water levels in both the arrow and caspian seas to steadily decline the soviets were aware of this after all they did it and in 1968 the soviet central committee asked for proposals to reverse this serious problem and bring new water into the area scientists noticed that many of their northern rivers were quote uselessly draining into the arctic ocean so work began to divert this water into the volga river whose levels were also starting to decline this water would then flow into the arrow and caspian seas replenishing them and a 1971 meeting of the international atomic energy agency in vienna the soviets disclosed their plan the canal would be somewhere from 65 to 112 kilometers long and be about 130 meters deep they proposed using an estimated 250 nuclear underground detonations that number depending on the bomb's size up to 20 of those would be detonated at the same time generating a total yield of three megatons 3 million tons of tnt this would save on cost by a factor of two to three for soviet engineers the most concerning part of the nuclear explosive plan involved a 30 kilometer stretch in the south the ground there is made up of sands and silt deposited by rivers and is quite wet there were worries about the stability of the slopes so the ministry of reclamation and water resources sponsored a practical nuclear test experiment labeled project tiger they found a forested area in the kama basin about 100 kilometers from the small city of kragenovicharik they cut down the trees in the area and planted three 15 kiloton nuclear explosions and about 127 meters deep and 165 meters apart on a dry and sunny day on february 23 1971 all three devices were fired at the same time one bystander recalls we were asked to leave our houses by noon and were warned something is being prepared in the vajukovo area it is dangerous to stay in the buildings we already knew that some major works were being carried out there the military had arrived of course we did not know what exactly was being done on that day everyone obediently went out onto the street at exactly noon we saw in the north in the vasukovo area which was 20 kilometers away a huge fiery ball it was impossible to look at it it hurt the eyes so much the day was clear sunny completely cloudless almost at the same time just a moment later a shock wave came we felt a strong ground oscillation as if a wave had passed through the earth then this ball began to stretch into a mushroom and a black column began to rise upwards to a very high altitude after that helicopters and planes appeared and flew towards the explosion the explosions could be seen from over 20 kilometers away and produced a trench about 700 meters long and 340 meters wide but only 15 meters deep vast improvements had been made from the chagon devices over a decade earlier it is estimated that the bombs only had about two to six percent fission yields by comparison the storax sedan explosion was estimated to have a fission yield of less than 30 percent eight days after the taiga explosion the radiation dose about eight kilometers away had fallen to just about twice the normal background levels so one can argue that tyga was a very clean detonation even so about 300 tons of radioactive material was released into the air the trench crater filled with water and a restricted area had to be set up about 300 meters from this new atomic lake scientists returned to the site many years later and can still detect a significant radiation anomaly there higher than the russian safety standards and 10 to 20 times stronger than background as i mentioned the trench was unexpectedly shallow just about 15 meters and a few of the sides collapsed due to the soft soils this implied that nuclear explosives were not suitable for excavating this section of the canal furthermore as implied by the eyewitness account the explosion threw up way more soil into the air than anticipated the nuclear fallout was detected all the way in sweden and the united states which lodged complaints the soviet union was accused of breaking international treaties the ministry did not continue further excavation work nevertheless the soviets restated their interest in continuing the project including attempts to renegotiate parts of the partial test ban treaty to accommodate these massive detonations in the end though the canal project never happened near the end of the decade internal resistance mounted from academics who were concerned about what might happen to the arctic sea if we cut off a constant flow of fresh water such a thing might affect rains change the polar winds and make the sea even saltier salt water freezes at a lower temperature than fresh water so the saltier water might cause the icebergs to melt even faster and thus ends the soviet union's most ambitious ever nuclear excavation project the soviet peace nuke program covered a broad variety of industrial and scientific use cases for nuclear explosions many of these use cases significant ones like water reservoirs or canal formation as well as less significant ones like dam building saw some benefits from the inclusion of nuclear explosives however it would be difficult to argue that those benefits sufficiently compensated for the radioactive downsides and the soviet program gave up most of these use cases except for one the economically vital oil and gas industry eagerly adopted the bomb to stimulate their fading petroleum deposits in other words nuclear fracking but let's save that story for another video in another time alright everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the
