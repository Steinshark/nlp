(speaker_00) when mark zuckerberg told us, (speaker_00) "the future is living in a one-bedroom apartment," (speaker_00) "experiencing the world through my plastic vr accessory," (speaker_00) understandably, we mocked him. (speaker_00) but then... (speaker_00) when tim apple did it, we were excited beyond all reason. (speaker_00) why? (speaker_00) what is it about the vision pro (speaker_00) that caused this sudden shift? (speaker_00) and can the world of spatial computing (speaker_00) be accessed by us pc folk? (speaker_00) it turns out the answer is yes. (speaker_00) so let's talk about why the vision pro (speaker_00) is the most exciting piece of technology (speaker_00) that i've used in years, (speaker_00) and why i can't wait to pack it up and put it away. (speaker_00) odoo, their all-in-one software will let you focus on running and improving your
business (speaker_00) rather than playing hot potato with a bunch of mismatching apps. (speaker_00) click the link below or watch till the end of this video to learn more. (speaker_00) first contact with the vision pro is something you won't soon forget. (speaker_00) the material choices and the build quality are exceptional to the point where i
would (speaker_00) say they are the best we have ever seen on a vr headset. from the aluminum
frame, (speaker_00) to the curved glass front, to the fabric headband, it is on a whole different
level, (speaker_00) which should result in a very comfortable headset. but there is one small
problem. (speaker_00) these hinges do not rotate. (speaker_00) the hinge where it attaches is no hinge at all. (speaker_00) it doesn't swivel, which from my experience means (speaker_00) choosing between either extra pressure on your forehead (speaker_00) or wearing it higher and having extra pressure (speaker_00) on your cheekbones, and in my case, (speaker_00) particularly the bridge of my nose. (speaker_00) now, apple acknowledges this (speaker_00) with the inclusion of their dual loop band, (speaker_00) but this has the exact same problem of inflexibility, (speaker_00) meaning that, say for example, (speaker_00) you like to wear a back ponytail, (speaker_00) you better learn to wear a top one or a low one, (speaker_00) and it makes mounting the device more annoying (speaker_00) and still resulted in subpar comfort for me. (speaker_00) the good news is that it's easy to forget, (speaker_00) at least for a while, the second the screen turns on. (speaker_00) believe (speaker_00) every single word you heard (speaker_00) from the apple evangelists in your life, (speaker_00) because holy balls, does this thing ever look incredible. (speaker_00) at just under 4k per eye, (speaker_00) with nearly three times the pixel count of the metaquest 3, (speaker_00) not to mention no discernible screen door effect whatsoever, (speaker_00) it is unlike anything that i have ever experienced. (speaker_00) the 12 cameras on the front and bottom of the device (speaker_00) create a three-dimensional live view (speaker_00) of the world around you that, again, (speaker_00) crushes mr. zuckerberg's best efforts. (speaker_00) and this is all thanks to apple's latest homegrown silicon, (speaker_00) the r1, which handles the video stitching and pass-through, (speaker_00) as well as eye tracking, hand tracking, and head movements (speaker_00) in a way that i just didn't think would be possible (speaker_00) for quite a long time. (speaker_00) now, one thing to be careful of (speaker_00) is getting fingerprints on the cameras, (speaker_00) as it's very easy to do accidentally (speaker_00) while putting the headset on, (speaker_00) and it will make things look a little fuzzy. (speaker_00) when it's working its best, though, (speaker_00) my goodness, is it ever incredible. (speaker_00) you look around, you resize, (speaker_00) you reposition objects in virtual space, (speaker_00) and it's shockingly smooth and natural. (speaker_00) as long as you don't wanna do something apple says (speaker_00) you're not allowed to do, like, oh, i don't know, (speaker_00) zoom something in more than you're allowed to. (speaker_00) another apple thing is that they tend to be selective (speaker_00) about publishing their specs, and they opted not to publish a field of view number for this headset. (speaker_00) now that could be because it varies (speaker_00) depending on your exact face shape and how you wear it. (speaker_00) the thicker cushion, for example, (speaker_00) will shrink it a little bit, (speaker_00) but the more likely reason is that it kind of sucks. (speaker_00) let's find out using what alex calls, oh, thank you, (speaker_00) the fov finder 5000. (speaker_00) for context, (speaker_00) the valve index is around 110 degrees, and the leading headset from pimax is
about 160, (speaker_00) with the original oculus rift being 88. i am going to go ahead and move this
until i can (speaker_00) no longer see the edges, which occurs...  (speaker_01) that's 79 degrees. (speaker_00) oh. (speaker_00) well, that's not very good, is it? (speaker_01) that test actually wasn't 100% accurate (speaker_01) because we measured the fov of the cameras, (speaker_01) not linus's actual fov, (speaker_01) which would be a little bit larger (speaker_01) because apple is distorting stuff. (speaker_01) so look, if i put this on right here (speaker_01) and look at this grid on the wall, (speaker_01) when i look at it straight on, (speaker_01) everything seems to be pretty straight in the middle (speaker_01) and then on the sides, it'll be curved. (speaker_01) but if i look at the corner, (speaker_01) it is actively compensating for those distortions in my eyes. (speaker_01) what's even more surprising is that if i go in here, take off the light guard,
and put it on like this,  (speaker_01) my expectation was that the camera's fov would stay the
same, but it actually gets much larger, so before i could only see about the
edges of this,  (speaker_01) now i can see all the way out to here, which is why you can get
between like 90 up all the way to 110 on this,  (speaker_01) and it's using the eye tracking to actively compensate for those differences. (speaker_00) of course, apple has made it abundantly clear that the vision pro is not a vr
headset, it is a spatial computing device for professional work,  (speaker_00) it's meant for serious things, so naturally, the first thing we wanted to do was game on it,
because on paper, it should be very good. (speaker_00) $7 for an apple arcade subscription later, and... (speaker_00) we're in. (speaker_00) the headliner game for the apple vision pro (speaker_00) appears to be super fruit ninja, (speaker_00) and i can't think of a better game (speaker_00) to illustrate both its incredible strengths (speaker_00) and its complete and utter failings. (speaker_00) so let's go ahead and fire it up. (speaker_00) look at this, you guys. (speaker_00) everything around me, (speaker_00) in spite of the high resolution of these displays, (speaker_00) is rendered in crystal clear image quality (speaker_00) with no discernible frame rate drops. (speaker_00) it is. (speaker_00) far and away the best that i have ever seen on a headset. (speaker_00) and that is thanks to the same m2 chip (speaker_00) as the current macbooks. (speaker_00) and this too, apple's environmental mapping (speaker_00) and the solidity of the placement of virtual objects (speaker_00) in the real world makes everything else i've ever seen (speaker_00) look like a cheap toy in comparison. (speaker_00) unfortunately, the whole thing falls apart (speaker_00) the second you try to interact with the game. (speaker_00) hey, remember when i said no frame rate drops? (speaker_00) in a traditional inside-out headset like the quest 3 or the psvr 2, not only are
there cameras (speaker_00) tracking where your hands are, there are gyros, thank you, and accelerometers
inside the controllers (speaker_00) that will handle quick movements, fine movements, or fill in the gaps during any
times when your (speaker_00) hands are not visible or the cameras temporarily lose tracking for some reason.
without that (speaker_00) accelerometer input, the vision pro simply doesn't have the tracking fidelity
for a game like fruit (speaker_00) ninja, with every single loss that i experienced on the device feeling like... (speaker_00) the apple vision pro was to blame, not my skills. (speaker_00) hey, hey, hey, hey! (speaker_00) and honestly, playing anything but the slowest pace (speaker_00) of ipad apps made me feel pretty much the same way. (speaker_00) i just immediately wanted my stupid slab of glass back. (speaker_00) of course, we went into this knowing (speaker_00) the vision pro isn't a vr gaming headset. (speaker_00) so why don't we move on to one of its greatest strengths? (speaker_00) putting an enormous (speaker_00) high fidelity display anywhere you want, (speaker_00) and then using that to play real games. (speaker_00) now, i went into this assuming (speaker_00) that getting windows working on this headset (speaker_00) would be a chore and a half, or at least 1.3 chores. (speaker_00) i mean, apple doesn't even let you buy the vision pro (speaker_00) if you don't already have a reasonably current iphone. (speaker_00) but as it turns out, the process is incredibly simple. (speaker_00) if you only wanna play games, (speaker_00) all you've gotta do is download the steam link ipad app (speaker_00) from the app store, (speaker_00) choose what computer you wanna stream from, (speaker_00) and it figures out the rest. (speaker_00) ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! (speaker_00) i mean, is that something or what? (speaker_00) what kind of absolute mad lad would have a tv this big? (speaker_00) wee! (speaker_00) it's a little laggy. (speaker_00) would i find it easier to play just looking (speaker_00) at the laptop screen with the 12 milliseconds (speaker_00) or so of pass-through? (speaker_00) dude, with all the just like compression blocking (speaker_00) and everything and the fact that this is only at 1080p, (speaker_00) the experience like this is pretty similar. (speaker_00) wee! (speaker_00) of course a key difference is that i can't put that display anywhere that i want
and (speaker_00) as much as i might complain about the latency. it's good enough for most gamers
in (speaker_00) most games for example in forza assuming you're a halfway decent driver (speaker_00) you'll probably find that frame pacing is more important than a little bit of
lag here or there (speaker_00) but if you were to play other games competitive games even driving ones like say
rocket league (speaker_00) the latency is too high to for example (speaker_00) counter a last-second fake out from your opponent. steam link also has some big
limitations (speaker_00) regardless of which headset you're using the highest resolution that you can
stream is 1080p and (speaker_00) you can only play games but that my friends is where sunshine and moonlight come
in (speaker_00) and no i'm not telling you to go outside sunshine available on the lizard bite
github (speaker_00) page allows you to easily convert your pc or laptop into a streaming server then
the moonlight (speaker_00) ipad app on your vision pro will give you full access to your windows machine at
up to 4k 120 (speaker_00) frames per second though it should be noted you're going to need one (speaker_00) heck of a wireless access point in order to hit that consistently 4k here we go
i'm not even going (speaker_00) to try 120 right now our wi-fi in this part of the office is not great. the
spatiality of the audio (speaker_00) is incredible. like that tv's behind me now, no question. unfortunately with our
wi-fi on the (speaker_00) sets not being as good as we'd like sunshine and moonlight didn't perform that
great in gaming (speaker_00) but the big killer app is not really games it's the ability to just use a
windows pc (speaker_00) with a virtual desktop in the vision pro and for that it works freaking great. (speaker_00) like look at this. honestly alex i gotta say the latency feels very very similar (speaker_00) to the native connection to the macbook.  (speaker_01) try it. (speaker_00) this is going to be the thing that finally
breaks apple and makes (speaker_00) them integrate touch into mac os the fact that people are going to be sitting
there in their (speaker_00) vision pro and just want to click on things and then they're going to introduce
it and everyone's (speaker_00) going to be like wow it's so obvious sometimes it's nice to be able to tap on
things and then (speaker_00) they're going to put touch screens on macs, this is it mark my words. and if it
doesn't happen then it (speaker_00) is only because of apple's complete and utter stubbornness there's no other
reason.  (speaker_00) wow it is struggling a lot more in this environment but over at the lab i did not have the
same problem (speaker_00) it was a little laggy, it was fine. yeah once again i've got serious latency
issues which underscores (speaker_00) that you are going to need a really nice modern access point for the best
possible experience on this. (speaker_00) i'll show you a little bit of contrasting footage here to give you some idea of
what this is supposed to look like, (speaker_00) yeah. unfortunately, that's not the kind we have here on the set so using
windows on a big old virtual spatial display? (speaker_00) incredible. the latency is very similar to using it on the macbook, which means (speaker_00) there is some, regardless of your access point, (speaker_00) but it's very, very usable (speaker_00) and worth the trade-off of the giant display. (speaker_00) the only thing that i'd say is different (speaker_00) is that it doesn't have that really cool (speaker_00) augmented reality connect thing (speaker_00) that is such a mwah, it just works moment. (speaker_00) now, if you do have some weirdness, (speaker_00) part of that comes down to the way (speaker_00) that apple made their wireless chip set (speaker_00) and apparently setting your router to use channel 149 (speaker_00) can help solve it. (speaker_00) bottom line, (speaker_00) incredible for non-competitive games. with a powerful gpu in the streaming
system,  (speaker_00) i'd say this is pretty much the definitive way to experience baldur's
gate 3 or something from the witcher series.  (speaker_00) but if you're a competitive gamer, you could get nearly the same field of view while 
having much lower latency for a lot less money. (speaker_00) so, gaming perspective aside then, let's take a look at the vision pro more in the
ways that apple intended, which is where the device starts to get in some ways
cooler, but in other ways (speaker_00) a bit more complicated. i've already stated that this is the best video pass-
through that i've (speaker_00) encountered by a metric mile, but pass-through has never been a core function of
a headset to quite (speaker_00) the same degree before. on a psvr or most pc headsets, it's a convenience
feature so you can (speaker_00) find your water bottle in between rounds, but on the vision pro, the expectation
is that you're (speaker_00) doing work. (speaker_00) probably in an office with other humans while in pass-through mode for extended
periods of time, which... (speaker_00) can get rather strange because it literally warps your perception of reality. (speaker_00) oh yeah, that's really disorientating. (speaker_00) they won't be seeing it in 3d, so they won't realize how this tree, like... (speaker_00) you see, the camera distorts your perception of objects, (speaker_00) particularly ones that are too close, and (speaker_00) while the pass-through is shockingly low latency, allowing you to easily dodge a
thrown object, (speaker_00) oh! (speaker_00) the perception of depth of really everything around you (speaker_00) is going to be a bit off. (speaker_00) the good news is that your brain (speaker_00) is really good at compensating for this. (speaker_00) so when you hear people say, (speaker_00) "yeah, the first 30 minutes was kind of weird, (speaker_00) but then it just clicked." (speaker_00) you can expect to have a pretty similar experience. (speaker_00) the weird one though, (speaker_00) is that your brain also clicks the other way. (speaker_00) so when you take the headset off, (speaker_00) it's typical to have a minute or two of, (speaker_00) "whoa, hold on a second," (speaker_00) before things click back into place. (speaker_00) speaking of things clicking into place, (speaker_00) a big pet peeve of mine with this product (speaker_00) is the complete inability to grab something (speaker_00) in the virtual world and pin it in your peripheral vision (speaker_00) while you go about the rest of your life. (speaker_00) in fairness to apple, (speaker_00) the accuracy of the way that it (speaker_00) takes an object and keeps it exactly where you left it (speaker_00) is incredible. (speaker_00) it's just that i don't always want to have to (speaker_00) carry things around with me (speaker_00) when i want to refer back to them, like this script. (speaker_00) another thing that bummed me out (speaker_00) anytime i spent an extended period and pass through (speaker_00) was the video fidelity. (speaker_00) and look, i don't want to take anything away (speaker_00) from what apple has achieved here, (speaker_00) but i could never forget that i was looking (speaker_00) at a video feed of the world through phone cameras. (speaker_00) compounding this issue is the fact that virtual content (speaker_00) rendered by the vision pro is so high fidelity (speaker_00) and so vibrant that the real world ends up looking (speaker_00) drab and dull by comparison. (speaker_00) here, i can demonstrate this. (speaker_00) that right there is a color checker classic (speaker_00) on what is a, by all accounts, (speaker_00) beautiful and color accurate screen. (speaker_00) this is a color checker classic in the real world. (speaker_00) see the difference? (speaker_00) another major issue is motion blur. (speaker_00) while the pixel response times of this micro oled display (speaker_00) allow objects to look extremely crisp even when in motion, (speaker_00) as you move your head, (speaker_00) it's normal for the whole world to end up looking (speaker_00) and feeling a little bit jello-y. (speaker_00) also, apple is regularly forced to use weird shutter angles (speaker_00) in order to compensate (speaker_00) for the flickering of lights around you, (speaker_00) which can in some cases cause them to have to crank the iso, (speaker_00) adding a bunch of noise to the image. (speaker_00) even in well-lit rooms. (speaker_00) while we spent a lot of time so far talking about things (speaker_00) you can do with the vision pro, (speaker_00) i actually spent most of my time with the device (speaker_00) doing what you are supposed to do, (speaker_00) which is professional work in my own virtual space. (speaker_00) and it can be really sweet. (speaker_00) i love being able to take private notes in a meeting (speaker_00) or work on sensitive material in a group setting. (speaker_00) but the problem is that (speaker_00) it cuts both ways. (speaker_00) one of the first things that i wanted to do (speaker_00) was share a document with someone and mark it up together. (speaker_00) and yeah. because there's no obvious way to mirror (speaker_00) my macbook's display, i had to use a bizarre workaround (speaker_00) that involved screen sharing from inside the vision pro (speaker_00) to a video conference with someone who was sitting there (speaker_00) on a laptop next to me in the same room. (speaker_00) also, even if all you want to do is work privately, (speaker_00) the whole setup can be a bit of a chore. (speaker_00) i mean, the vision pro sounds like having your own personal colin (speaker_00) holding a tv for you and then allowing it to be repositioned (speaker_00) and float effortlessly wherever you want. (speaker_00) but in practice... (speaker_00) i just don't really often need to do that. and neither do a lot of people. for
example, nicole. (speaker_00) here's a real person doing real work. for a fraction of the cost of a vision
pro, (speaker_00) she has multiple 4k displays all within her field of view at once. and this (speaker_00) is how much she has to move her head in order to look between them. wow. (speaker_00) again, i appreciate this thing for the technological marvel that it is. (speaker_00) a 4k display in a single square inch? (speaker_00) but for optimal text clarity, you need to use most of those pixels, (speaker_00) meaning that the virtual monitor needs to be absolutely massive for the vision
pro to really shine, (speaker_00) making your workspace feel less like this and more like this. (speaker_00) obviously this demo is meant to be illustrative more than literal. for one
thing, the vision pro (speaker_00) does not currently support more than one macbook display and we have five. also,
it's more like (speaker_00) having a much larger tv that is quite a bit farther away. and that is a good
thing in the (speaker_00) sense that you'll be focusing more than a few feet in front of you. but i still
found that in (speaker_00) spite of that, eyestrain was a big problem for me if i spent more than an hour
or so in spatial (speaker_00) computing land. (speaker_00) making this productivity problem worse is the fact that at this time, the vision
pro doesn't allow you to save your layouts. (speaker_00) so every time you want to get back into it, you've got to put it on, (speaker_00) authenticate, connect to your macbook, resize that display, open a safari
window, put that over there where you want it, (speaker_00) maybe your emails go over here. (speaker_00) it's a lot of friction that our editors (speaker_00) for example, don't go through every time they wanna sit down (speaker_00) and get a couple hours of work done (speaker_00) before their eyes and face hurt too much to continue. (speaker_00) but none of that was my biggest disappointment. (speaker_00) that actually came on day one. (speaker_00) when i took home my shiny vision pro, (speaker_00) super excited to play with what is arguably (speaker_00) the most revolutionary device to hit the market in years (speaker_00) and quickly realized there's nothing to do. (speaker_00) you can experience things, you can watch tv, look at 3d models, (speaker_00) you can play ipad apps with kind of janky controls, but... (speaker_00) i realized really quickly i wasn't having any fun. (speaker_00) i know, app support is going to expand rapidly and in the near future there will
almost certainly (speaker_00) be some really cool stuff to do. (speaker_00) but at the moment, what's available ranges from boring to outright dystopian. (speaker_00) so what is it good for? (speaker_00) if you don't need it for work, i'd say watching stuff in your own private movie
theater is (speaker_00) the killer app. (speaker_00) you can really appreciate the higher streaming quality of extras at
lmg.gg/floatplane and (speaker_00) watching 3d movies in this thing is second to none. (speaker_00) i think it's even safe to say that watching encanto on the vision pro in 3d (speaker_00) is the absolute best way to experience that movie. (speaker_00) by myself. (speaker_00) it's just that for the price of a vision pro, (speaker_00) i could get a flagship lg c3, (speaker_00) i could get a coffee table and a couch, (speaker_00) and then i could experience it with my friends. (speaker_00) i mean, sure, it might not be as immersive, (speaker_00) but i know which one i'd rather have. (speaker_00) i'll be back in a minute, guys. (speaker_00) first, i just gotta finish up this review. (speaker_00) honestly, i felt the same way (speaker_00) about spatial photos and videos. (speaker_00) reliving them? (speaker_00) absolutely amazing. (speaker_00) and it feels like you're there again. (speaker_00) so if you have a spatial capture capable iphone, (speaker_00) now is the time to start using that feature (speaker_00) so that when a vision pro that's worth buying appears, (speaker_00) you're gonna be ready to look back on those memories (speaker_00) with a level of depth that is unmatched, even if it is a little janky still. (speaker_00) so for all my criticisms, i don't hate the vision pro and i don't even think
that it's bad. (speaker_00) it's an incredible feat of engineering and it delivers on its promise of
enabling new ways of interacting with each other and with the world around us. (speaker_00) it's just not for me and not right now. (speaker_00) i just can't think of a single thing (speaker_00) that i would do with the vision pro (speaker_00) that i wouldn't rather do on a device that i already own. (speaker_00) and think about it. (speaker_00) for $3,500, almost four grand (speaker_00) with a decent amount of storage, (speaker_00) i could read on my kindle, work on my laptop, (speaker_00) watch shows on my tv, and game on my ps5. (speaker_00) and i can practically hear you guys saying, (speaker_00) "well, yeah, everything that you just said (speaker_00) is true of the smartphone as well. (speaker_00) this is your balmer moment, linus. (speaker_00) this is never gonna take off." (speaker_00) but guys, i'm not saying it's not gonna take off. (speaker_00) it will. (speaker_00) it's just that there's a major hurdle (speaker_00) that apple needs to overcome. (speaker_00) and that's convenience. (speaker_00) my smartphone, guess what, (speaker_00) is also a worse version of everything else (speaker_00) that i already own. (speaker_00) the difference is that it's already in my pocket. (speaker_00) the vision pro, on the other hand, (speaker_00) well, at least this version of it, (speaker_00) with its unwieldy shape and giant battery bank, (speaker_00) is very, very... (speaker_00) not in my pocket. (speaker_00) it's also not in this segue for our sponsor. (speaker_00) odoo. (speaker_00) imagine this, you're running a business, (speaker_00) but it's being held together by a bunch (speaker_00) of different software, kind of like electronic bandages. (speaker_00) it's not ideal. (speaker_00) and that's where odoo (speaker_00) and their business management suite comes in. (speaker_00) they take the essential elements of any business (speaker_00) and combine them into one unified operating system. (speaker_00) their crm and sales apps make lead generation and closing deals easier than
ever, (speaker_00) while their point of sale and inventory apps make selling and product tracking a
breeze. (speaker_00) also, their accounting app lets you auto create and send invoices, (speaker_00) and it integrates with 28,000 banks from all over the world. (speaker_00) but let's say you don't need absolutely all of that. (speaker_00) well, because odoo is so highly customizable, (speaker_00) you only have to choose the apps that your business will use. (speaker_00) and if you find yourself just needing a single app, (speaker_00) you can use it (speaker_00) for free. with all that being said, the best part is that it's super easy with a
user-friendly (speaker_00) interface, ai-powered features, and a support team that'll have your back. so
don't overwhelm (speaker_00) your business with a bunch of software. odoo! unify your processes by checking

you guys enjoyed this (speaker_00) video, why not go check out our review of the quest 3? okay, is it as good as
the vision pro? no. (speaker_00) but is it, um... (speaker_01) fun? (speaker_00) fun? yeah, actually.
