so a quick and impossibly deep question last question about mortality you spoken about death as an interesting topic do you think about your own mortality yeah every day it's really scary so what do you think is the meaning of life that mortality makes very explicit so why are you here on earth michael what's the point of this whole thing what you know what does mortality in in the context of the whole universe make you realize about yourself just you michael stevens well it makes me realize that i am destined to become an ocean i'm destined to become a memory and we can extend life i think there's really exciting things being done to extend life but we still don't know how to like you know protect you from some accident that could happen you know some unforeseen thing maybe we could like save my connectome and like recreate my consciousness digitally but even that is could it could be lost if it's stored on a physical medium or something so basically i just think that embracing and realizing how cool it is that like someday i will just be an idea and there won't be a michael anymore that can be like no that's not what i meant it'll just be what people like they have to guess what i meant and they'll remember me and how i live on and as that memory will will maybe not even be who i wanted to be but there's something powerful about that and there's something powerful about letting future people run the show themselves i think i i'm glad to get out of their way at some point and say all right it's your world now so you the physical entity michael has have ripple effects in the space of ideas that far out lives you yeah in ways you can't control but nevertheless fascinating to think i mean especially with you you can imagine an alien species when they finally arrive and destroy all of us would watch your videos to try to figure out what what were the questions but even if they didn't you know i still think that there will be ripples like when i say memory i don't specifically mean people remember my name and my birthdate and hat like there's a photo of me on wikipedia like all that can be lost but i still would hope that people ask questions and and and teach concepts in some of the ways that i have found useful and satisfying even they don't know that i was the one who tried to popularize it that's fine but if earth was completely destroyed like burnt to a crisp everything on it today what would the universe wouldn't care like jupiter's not gonna go oh no and that could happen because so we do however have the power to you know launch things into space to try to extend how long our memory exists and what i mean by that is you know we are recording things about the world and we're learning things and writing stories and all of this and and preserving that is truly what i think is the essence of being a human we are auto biographers of the universe and we're really good at it we're better than fossils we're better than light spectrum we're better than any of that we collect much more detailed memories of what's happening much better data and so that should be our legacy and i hope that that's that's kind of mine too in terms of people remembering something or having some kind of effect but even if i don't you can't not have an effect right that's saying this is not me feeling like i hope that i have this powerful legacy it's like no matter who you are you will but you also have to embrace the fact that that impact might look really small and that's okay one of my favorite quotes is from tess of the d'urbervilles and it's along the lines of the the measure of your life depends on not your external displacement but your subjective experience if i am happy and those that i love are happy can that be enough because if so excellent you
