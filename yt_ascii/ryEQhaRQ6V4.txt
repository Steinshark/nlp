how much does it cost to get an influencer to tweet about your doge elon stupid ponzi coin today we find out welcome to day four of a coffeezilla christmas i'm your host in the 10 million dollar studio now guys ever since soja boy cranked that twitter a little too hard and exposed that he had been paid 24 000 to promote cryptocurrencies aka safe mars we've known that influencers are making thousands the same way influencers promote vpns or g-field they've now moved on to crypto now i'm not going to waste time explaining the ethical and moral difference between advertising blue chew and sticks yes there is a difference but ultimately like it or not influencers aren't going to stop pitching the latest get rich quick schemes and with regulation five to ten years behind you guys are at risk falling for ads disguised as influencer posts so today i thought i would share with you guys all the secret lists i've found of crypto influencers prices the price is to post sponsored posts and many of them do not disclose that they are sponsored although some do now up first we have at nft on instagram now this one is near and dear to my heart because they are apparently a mark cuban company and leverage company you contact at jf for business and yes we will but just looking at some of their posts you can see what kind of stuff they do december 6 i'm dropping my first nft eighth in space we're going to the moon so don't miss it here we have another shill post another shell post and these do not say that they are ads okay they do not say that now of course i was curious how much they charged so i asked them how much do you charge for a post and they say what's good we charge 20 to 25 000 per post which is part of a campaign that includes a full feature blood blah blah blah the point is 20 to 25 000 for a undisclosed ad which i just think is awesome coming from a mark cuban company that's just that's beautiful you know you'd think that these are great projects that these people believe in but actually a bunch of it's paid now next up we have a guy you may have heard of at bitboy crypto he's the largest youtube crypto channel and i found this media kit thanks to zach on twitter who's always digging up really interesting crypto stories now here in this media kit we can see the demographics of bitboy's channel we can see that it it is mostly gonna be a male audience which not too surprising there but we can also see how much it costs for you know getting shouted out dedicated review five thousand dollars live stream just pay twenty thousand dollars you could be in a live stream mention youtube interview oh well that's gonna cost you forty thousand dollars telegram ama oh that's gonna be ten thousand dollars and a website article only twenty five hundred dollars guys just twenty five hundred dollars you can be written about by bitboy crypto now i reached out to him to confirm this is real he did confirm this is authentic pricing but when i asked if he ever does a sponsored post without disclosing he said absolutely not ben armstrong always discloses if it's a paid post but now we know how much he's been paid there it is forty thousand dollars you two can be interviewed by bitboy crypto so i think that's super exciting obviously now up next is another find this is from big step up marketing i'm just gonna call this list the music slash rapper slash has been actorless now we're gonna have to break this down because this is just it's amazing up top we have the beginner tier list this is if you're a baby project you know you're you're a you're a starter this is the starter cap project here you've got people ranging from i don't know eight thousand to ten thousand dollars right here and you have people like kyle massey aka corey in the house you've also got legends such as wide neck yes ladies and gentlemen you can get wide neck to shout out your crypto scheme and then then going down we have the mid tier so this is going to be 20 to 50 000 per post and as you can see this might get you a soja boy the shiggy show whoever that is that's if you're a little more serious and then at the bottom we've got the vip section this is a hundred thousand dollars or more here we go little pump starts at a hundred thousand dollars you've also got dj khaled over here for one million dollars okay and you've also got a post malone in the weekend coming in at the mid hundred thousand so if you ever want to buy these guys influence i guess that's that's that's the price now bear in mind this price list comes from the soul celebs project and the reason i'm saying that is because anyone can put together just some list of a bunch of famous people with prices next their name right but in this case the same project got sponsored posts from some of these influencers and that obviously lends credibility to this list's authenticity because if they're saying they can get these posts and then they got some of them seems like maybe it's real for example they got a cory in the house to post about him they also got soja boy aka big draco to post about him they also got the shiggy show to post about them i think he's since deleted that post they just saw archive stuff on instagram but i think it's important to say whether they can get you know rick ross or post malone i don't actually know right sometimes these marketing teams pad out their influencer lists with really famous people to seem like more credible than they are so just take this list for what it's worth while it seems that definitely some of these are authenticated some of them may not be we don't know i think the real takeaway here is just how cheap soja boy is only 25 000 and you can crank that okay just so you guys know in case you're wondering how much does it cost to crank that hey it's 25k now last but not least guys we have a price list also dug up by zack on twitter go follow him okay get some good stuff this is a set of twitter and youtube influencer prices here's twitter here from such legends as crypto tony crypto liz liver coin girl gone crypto you've also got youtubers like journey chico crypto bit boy okay and then you got their prices over here now obviously some of them are more expensive than others and this tells you what your package includes some people give you the full dedicated review some people give you a sponsor segment but either way you're gonna be signing checks okay and this is just a beautiful look behind the curtain of how these operations work these educators of crypto work now bear in mind this this all comes this leak it comes from these guys luna pr they call themselves a global fintech pr agency focusing on crypto now these guys actually addressed this database leak they said in a statement lunapr would like to take a moment to address the situation regarding our influencer database which has been leaked this document has been tampered with and included false information we have never worked with some of the influencers on this list including ivan on tech so bear in mind they did say that now i we gotta unpack this a little bit because it's interesting on the one hand they're verifying their list did get leaked so we know at least some of that's very real and then they say some of it got tampered with which we can't verify i will say it does seem like they have incentive to save face for their clients who might be embarrassed by appearing on such a list with their prices on the other hand i could also see lunapr including a bunch of people they have pricing for but no connection to or maybe they're just flat out wrong and they just made some of it up i mean maybe ivan on tech sent a few lawyers their way we have no idea again we have to go back to the conundrum that marketers often exaggerate and lie and most of this info is coming from marketers so that's really important context here my point here is not even to throw any individual influencer under the bus right because some of this could absolutely be wrong but just assuming that even 50 of this is correct because we know at least part of this list is confirmed we just don't know how much so even if 50 is correct what this shows is that most of these influencers make what a lot of people make in a year they make it in a single post about crypto so my goal in this video again not to call anybody specifically out because how bad they are really ranges right some people say they're sponsored some people don't some people promote super unethical projects some people don't so that's not the point instead the lesson is this we should have all been crypto influencers oh my gosh we made mistakes no no i'm not actually i'm actually kidding the actual lesson is this guys when you see crypto advice online when you see it coming from an influencer maybe a rapper this is what you might be seeing right there's stuff going on behind the curtains and there's a very real possibility that it's bought and paid for and while we could hope that these people would always do the right thing and disclose that they got paid we know that that isn't the case always so just be safe out there it's really easy to be greedy with everybody talking about how they got rich from crypto but bear in mind that a lot of the people talking about it are actually getting rich from promoting crypto not actually investing in it thanks for watching see you next time what a shame what a shame you're a fraud are you the same as sure you're saying no you're not
