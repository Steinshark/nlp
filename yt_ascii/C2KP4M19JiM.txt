here in my 10 million dollar studio got the flying lamborghini here but you know what i like more than flying lamborghinis tick tock investors traders people who are teaching me look tick tock's my new bloomberg terminal forget about it for gen z dude this is how they learn about finance and maybe we can learn about gen z through fin talk guys let's let's let's take a look at what their new analysts are saying the next warren buffett if you will up first we have a dogecoin guys we're gonna be hearing a lot about this it's one of tick tocks favorite investments they call it some would call it gambling but who am i right i don't have a million followers on tick tock it's time to listen to the real pros if you think dogecoin hitting 60 cents today is crazy wait till you hear this many analysts including myself believe that doge has the potential to be equal with ethereum first of all who are these other analysts and who are you i looked this guy up on tick tock and he says he's 16 years old the 16 year old analyst sorry go ahead how rude of me to interrupt you that think it sounds crazy because of doge's market cap wait till you hear this both doge and ethereum have essentially the same endless market cap and if you keep digging all aspects of both coins are virtually the same i used to say i'd give it a year to hit the price of ethereum but with the way doge is going right now we could see this in less than a few months oh it hurts so much this is what happens when you're raised on a diet of pizza rolls and other tick tock analysts okay the first rule of crypto by the way i've learned just now you have to be an absolute idiot and project stupid impossible numbers just for the record guys if dogecoin goes up to three thousand dollars first of all it's gonna be worth several times ethereum because dogecoin just has more coins than ethereum does so if it matched the price gonna be worth way more but also it's gonna be worth more than apple netflix microsoft all combined guys just a 300 trillion dollar market cap no big deal both doge and ethereum have essentially the same endless market cap by the way doge and ethereum are nothing alike and don't let anyone tell you otherwise doge is a meme it's a literal joke aetherium is a decentralized computer you know what i'm an idiot for trying to make sense of this guys i'm talking to an astros analyst here many analysts including myself believe that i honestly do think this is a brilliant video though because you can start anything with that many analysts including myself think that this guy's an idiot because i think what we can take away from that last video is that no one should be investing in dogecoin so you took'0 000 right correct this was your life savings you sold stocks you borrowed money on margin you maxed out your credit cards and you just yellowed all that money into dogecoin correct yeah what an idiot why though because there's those robin hood okay portfolio i want to see how much your dogecoin is worth right now right this second here you go jesus it is worth 1.25 million dollars okay i take it all back guys i'm investing my life savings into doge and i'm an idiot for not trusting see this is what i mean you got to trust the financial analyst of tick tock there we go second mortgage on my house and bye dogecoin is where i'm putting all my money now i'm sorry for ever doubting you guys now what can i expect from my new investment dogecoin is blowing up it's at 33 cents right now and it's stabilizing around the 30 cent area but i think dogecoin is about to do something even greater it's going to substantially multiply that's actually a new financial investment word phrase it's substantially multiplying we don't talk about any kind of ratios we don't talk about math we talk about substantially multiplying your eyebrows have to be like this guys a doge is 30 cents but i think it's going to substantially multiply eventually multiply on april 20th 4 20 really dude aka 420. i have a feeling elon musk is going to put out a tweet dude that's the new financial analyst like think it's like it's not like a strong earnings call it's yo i think elon musk is about to tweet hey guys that's most of cr crypto now hey dude i think the tokenomics are strong with this one really what does this crypto do i think elon musk's about to tweet about it that's what they do it's 4 20 and elon musk is about to tweet and use some of his money to invest in doge driving the price up if this goes as planned and everybody including mr musk go ahead and just pour money into doge on april 20th all at once those will reach prices that originally were not even conceptual not even originally conceptual this guy's analysis is basically if all of us throw our entire bank accounts at this coin price go up when we all throw money at the same thing i don't think he's ever anyway i'm not not even trying to hate on this guy this is just the level we're at it's a this is what you get with a 16 year old analyst and honestly am i the right one here because i'm the one who missed out on millions of dollars apparently and when doge hits a thousand dollars i will be the one crying but i don't want to give you guys the impression that everything's just about crypto on tick tock there's all sorts of financial investments and there are a lot of rich people too tell me that you're extremely wealthy without telling me that you're stupid [music] what what is this i have nothing to say this guy's a chat he's richer than all of us he could probably buy nikola with the price of this wood being what it is right now in fact i think this is the new investment i mean wood's going to match the price of ethereum very quickly at one flank of wood going to 3 000 guys what's next the real estate market dude i actually like this one this is actually true this is tick tock at its best right here i think bidding starts at five dollars feeling pretty confident there huh i mean ten dollars he said starting at five fifteen is this a new apple yeah just listed i'm pre-qualified i'll pay cash i get cash 20. no just make it 45. is it even worth that 50. i don't know please this is the eighth apple i've tried to buy i at least see it up close nope it's an apple you know what it is you either want it or you don't i'll take it for 100. what i'm from california it's the cheapest apple i've ever seen yeah it's basically the market right now in texas at least it's because of all you californians once again ruining everything they're all coming to texas joe rogan announces his move and all of a sudden it's just everybody's coming in and they're selling their million dollar houses and they're just driving the price way up i mean if you're going to buy a house basically anywhere in the south right now you better be willing to sell your firstborn both your legs because that's the only way you're going to get into even a hut at this point it's ridiculous now up next we have everyone who recently sold a house a couple weeks i haven't had any time to take for myself so i figured tonight i'm just gonna go chill on my yacht and take it easy yeah you sell one house you're like i'm rich now oh do you guys not have a yacht it's cause you're poor this is also anyone who just got a stimulus check that's how everyone felt when they got their stimulus checked am i rich now it's like that meme is this wealth i could literally purchase every goddamn one of you and sell you at a garage sale [laughter] oh dude this is some weird mix of a frat guy with cocaine with yeah stimulus checks i think what i admire most about tic toc is just the raw level of energy it's completely unmatched and what they lack in expertise they make up for in screaming do you know why i got this boat i sold stocks and i made money you guys are probably like wait where's the catch is he trying to sell us a course or something no i'm here to call you poor and me rich money money money yeah well that you fit in well my friend you fit in very well i'm pretty sure he did try to sell us a course with the forex thing but we'll let that pass let's go to the next one oh man i remember this guy speaking of cocaine let's start getting weak we got a nice little double top going across the board right here oh nice little double top looking for a crack and let's see 161's right now now again we're getting there let's get that 161 crack let's go let's go let's see the 160 crack let's see it start going on down baby c160 go we got last trade right here

stroke what's crazy dude like this level of energy it's like a casino you see this at the crab team like let's go let's go oh man it's like jordan belfort levels wolf of wall street levels of just like psycho beating yourself in the head with money i'm pretty sure that's what all the famous investors did that's like i'm pretty sure jack bogle and peter lynch do that too oh this one's kind of interesting okay because look okay the glass is dead giveaway we're talking to an analyst here good morning everybody i took up a little bit of a new hobby and i'm kind of interested in day trading so last week i it's like saying hey guys took up a new hobby i'm kind of interested in particle physics on the side guys i think that's going to be my new like side hustle i bought some stock in amc i bought it at about 15 a share i've been waiting for the dip and this morning we're down to 11 51 so i snatched up some more over the weekend theaters opened in california and they have been selling out all show times people on youtube are saying that this could be the next game stop and they're predicting that shares could go for two thousand oh the only thing worse than tick tock advice is probably youtube advice this is the next gamestop guys this is the next big bull run guys let's all yolo into amc look let me just tell you guys this right now there's an old saying that if your cabbie is telling you about you know stocks you need to sell we need a new say if a brand new trader is telling you about things like to the moon what i heard from you know youtubers stuff like this it's time to sell baby the hype is over but what do i know guys i'm not a tick tock investor here and besides the market doesn't make any sense anyway [applause] so i did something oh i started a crypto token called dude i guarantee this is worth a million dollars oh i'm dumb it says right there okay well see i low bought it with it but it's been maybe like 10 hours and almost 3 000 people hold this coin now it's worth we're not in a bubble guys get this not in a bubble a 5.4 8 million market cap dude i mean like honestly this is amateur numbers these are rookie numbers we talked to somebody billion dollar market cap in like 30 minutes so i don't know what you're doing i love our like five million dollars not impressive honestly weak sheesh doesn't have those tokenomics baby doesn't have the pump of mentals let's get let's get out of here this guy's broke i don't have time for for millionaires okay i need billionaires who's this guy oh i know this guy matt lauren we've seen him in other videos here ron must tweeted if there's ever a scandal about me please call it elon hold on guys elon musk tweeted stop the presses financial markets are moving literally right after that tweet was made there was a new cryptocurrency release that's about to skyrocket immediately i went and bought seven trillion elongate why they just invaded it because of an elon musk tweet and you bought seven trillion coins what did that cost five dollars dude these coins are so stupid i say this was just released i'm talking about literally today is the best part whenever elon musk tweets about dogecoin it goes absolutely crazy just to give you some perspective this is elon gate right now hey guys we're all waiting for elon musk to tweet about it guys it's going to be huge is that what he's going to say about a month after its release now imagine elon musk he tweets about oh my gosh dude you have to laugh or you're going to cry that this is the state of financial analysis on tick-tock on all of these platforms we've truly left all synths behind and i for one am looking forward to the crash and burn you know honestly it's a big question like what do you do in these crazy markets do you just give in to the insanity or do you like kind of wait and be like you're gonna get it eventually you kids and then they're like hey i made three thousand percent yesterday and you're like like that guy with doge it's like doge is a joke guy makes a million dollars with it i don't know i stick with the fundamentals but i know a lot of people who are giving in to the yellow baby they're like hey why not buy 7 trillion elongate who knows i guess this is our last one what is this the other day i promoted a cryptocurrency named mando which the developers pretty much scammed everyone including me and this is why you go with fundamentals guys this is the same guy permeating promoting elon gate or whatever seven trillion he would have scammed you if you had invested with mando of course busted into mando and also myself i had ten thousand dollars invested which all of it is gone now look dude at some point if you're looking for like three thousand percent gains you're gonna get rug pull honestly this is just what happens you're not gonna get into a three it's like penny stocks all over again and i don't think a lot of people have recognized that going into all these all coins it's like buying pink sheets i mean it's like it's the same thing all over again just people haven't learned their lesson yet i don't know we'll see but you know what guys why am i hating we've been through a journey together and it's time to respect the pump right we've got dogecoin is it going to three thousand dollars we've learned lessons about investing maybe some people are making millions of dollars oh wait there's still a lot of idiots out there we've got you know wood investors we've got just objectively rich people who could buy you and sell you in a garage sale we even have real estate investors all in all i would say that the analysis on tick-tock it's booming right now guys and millions are listening whether or not they should be what do you think do you think that we're in in a new time where memeonomics tokenomics are taking over fundamentals don't matter or do you think we're headed towards the cliff and about to fall off i don't know i'll leave it for you guys on tick tock to decide i'm just your humble commentator your humble guide through these things i feel like that guy on marvel the avengers like i lead others to a treasure that i cannot possess okay so you guys let me know what's gonna happen next thanks for watching i appreciate you and i'll see you in the next episode of tick tock idiots sorry investors see you later nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me
