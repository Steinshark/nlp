three four $5,000 gaming laptops have generally speaking been more expensive than their non-gaming counterparts for a long time but why does the upper end of the market feature models that cost this much you could easily build a higher spec gaming desktop for less money and based on what we've seen over the past few years there isn't much to make us think that gaming laptops will get significantly cheaper anytime soon so what gives you might already know that part of the reason these laptops tend to be so expensive is that it takes a significant amount of engineering to take high performance gpus and cpus and fit them into the power and thermal envelope of a laptop unlike with a desktop you see laptops only have so much room for cooling and power delivery and developing solutions to make it all fit cost money but can we dive a little deeper than just it's hard to make things small of course we can otherwise we wouldn't have made this video as time has gone on and we demand ever faster speeds and ever higher performance it's become more and more more difficult to guarantee signal integrity over the tiny traces that move data between different parts of your computer instead of say a circuit board or pcb built from four or six layers and 1 oun of copper you might have an eight layer pcb with 2 ounces of copper in order to prevent too much signal loss and not only is this more difficult to design and manufacture some of the raw materials have also gotten more expensive the price of copper for example spiked during the pandemic and hasn't got gotten close to returning to pre-pandemic levels and there was also a well publicized chip shortage and it's not like the gpu companies just lowered prices out of the goodness of their hearts after the supply situation improved this also applies to power delivery newer hardware demands more power phases and different more expensive controllers the per unit cost difference might only be around a dollar but when you think about how many components inside of a laptop need upgraded infrastructure that adds up quickly guess who gets to pay for all those extra inerts but these general concepts could also apply equally to desktops so while they are important for understanding why gaming laptops are so pricey we'll tell you about some of the factors that are a bit more laptop specific right after we thank secret lab while many ergonomic chairs are designed to support the quote perfect posture secret lab believes that each individual person has their own needs in terms of their ideal sitting position that's why they've designed their titan evo and titan evo light chairs to be easily adjustable keeping you supported no matter what your next position may be and they're patent pending cold cure foam according to their research edges out traditional mesh in terms of pressure distribution and relief you deserve a chair that will have your back figuratively and literally so check out secret lab at the link below obviously we've needed more powerful cpus and gpus as games have gotten more demanding but it isn't just higher-end chips and the necessary supporting hardware that have driven up gaming laptop price increases over the past decade or so as more and more users and tech media have given feedback to laptop manufacturers about what they want the general consensus has been nicer stuff and what we mean by that is enhancements like metal instead of cheap plastic for the various parts of the chassis usb power delivery ports instead of barrel connectors and nicer displays with higher refresh rates and resolutions better viewing angles in contrast and hdr support simply put expectations not just for raw performance but also integrated peripherals and fit and finish have gone up not down and these expectations touch many parts of the laptop which result in a significantly higher final price one good way to think of this is that even cheap commodity items like ethernet switches have large price differences between models that support gigabit speeds which have been around a long time and the newer 2.5 gb standard so if this is the case think about how the price differences between something like a standard lcd and an oled display would translate to the price you end up paying for a gaming laptop and of course because a laptop is a highly integrated product if you put in one piece of higher-end hardware there's a good chance you'll need another piece of higher-end hardware to support it which means higher costs again which isn't necessarily the case with desktop pcs where you can pick and choose which parts you're okay with skimping on to save money obviously mid-range gaming laptops are still plentiful but you might end up compromising on something you may not want to and given the way the market is it doesn't look like we'll be in for much price relief at the higher end in the coming years and if we've completely put you off splurging on a top tier gaming laptop remember that any home gaming rig can be portable if you've got a large enough hand truck thanks for watching guys if you like this video you might like
