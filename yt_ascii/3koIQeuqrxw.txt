hello everyone and welcome it is finally happening we are driving the brand new toyota supra so i actually just got off the track and my initial impression from driving on the track is that the performance for the money is a hundred percent there and that's what i'm actually really excited about because i'm wondering you know it is an expensive car fifty thousand dollars it's got a three liter turbocharged engine 335 horsepower isn't going to be able to perform at a 50 000 level and it definitely does and has quite a bit of torque and it feels really good so i'm excited about this thing and we're going to get into you know some of the more details details about how the car works that kind of thing details about you know the partnership with bmw and the things that i don't like about it but overall just initial impressions after coming right off of the track is that i'm impressed with it so let's start up front work our way through the different systems the engine this is a b58 inline six cylinder three liter twin scroll turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine in which they partnered with bmw on so it is a bmw platform underneath all of this so it looks like a supra on the outside very similar to a bmw z4 hardware wise on the inside and so looking at that engine very good engine you know three liter 335 horsepower at 5000 to 6500 rpm and peak torque 365 pound-feet coming on at just 1600 rpm so very early with that twin scroll turbo charger 1600 rpm all the way to 4 500 rpm you've got that flat peak 365 torque curve so as a result you know you shift down into a lower gear put your foot down yeah the power is there now i asked toyota about this engine you know why did you choose the b58 why did you partner with bmw and they said well we don't make any inline six cylinders we want it to be an inline six cylinder to you know keep the heritage of the super alive to maintain that inline six philosophy and who makes the best inline six cylinder out there and they say bmw and i wouldn't disagree with that i think the b-58 is an amazing engine and you know an amazing engine for the amount that it costs so it does seem smart now i think the natural concern is you know toyota puts a lot of effort into durability and reliability so are you going to get that same toyota you know durability and reliability that you get with their other vehicles and they haven't done a performance vehicle quite like this in some time so i asked the lead engineer about that he said you know what we took that engine we took the b-58 we brought it in house we stripped it apart we you know noted all of our concerns we did all of our internal testing to make sure will it pass our requirements for reliability and they said that it did pass all of their internal requirements and so they expect this to be a very reliable engine i think you know another part of it is if you look at the us market z4 which is running basically the same engine it's got about 50 more horsepower you know perhaps a bit of why they were conservative with the overall output of this engine is to keep that reliability standard that toyota is known for and wants to maintain so a little interesting that you know they're partnering on an engine platform with bmw but they're saying that they can maintain their own internal standards of durability and reliability so from the engine we pass to the transmission and sadly there is only one option there is no manual option but fortunately it is a very good automatic transmission so it's the zf 8 speed that i've you know bragged about endlessly in any video which i've driven a car in it i love this zf 8-speed automatic it's exceptional the shift times are crazy good the shift smoothness is there when you're in sport mode it actually does have a little punchiness to it so it's not that just like effortlessly smooth transmission style which you can feel and a lot of different vehicles that use this transmission you know you don't actually feel the shift when you put it here in sport mode you can actually get a little bit of a jolt there and i think that's kind of an intentional tuning thing and then if you put it into the normal mode i mean this transmission you just don't feel a thing it is just incredibly well engineered i love this transmission i hate to say that it's the only option because i do wish they offered a manual but the good news is it is a good automatic transmission that's in it from the transmission we are sending that power to the rear wheel so there's an electronic limited slip differential it can lock up that rear differential from zero to a hundred percent so zero basically being like an open differential and a hundred percent basically being like a locked differential and toyota claims that they actually tune this so that throughout that turn it's varying that pressure for what is ideal so you know when you come into the corner versus when you're halfway through hitting the apex and then powering out you know making sure that that they have the perfect amount of pressure applied to that differential to optimize that experience going around that corner and to be able to put the power down and you know not have just one tire lighting up obviously send the power where it needs to go and where grip is available so from the differential we go out to the wheels and these are 19 inch wheels nine inches up front wide 10 inches in the back really wide tires on this michelin pilot sport tires super sport tires so not the ps4s and i've heard a couple different reasons as to why are these not the ps4s they claimed that these are better in the dry and they wanted really good dry grip i've heard different from michelin but these are bespoke tires for this car so it was a joint project with you know toyota and bmw to develop the tire for this car with michelin and so it was developed specifically for this the other thing there is that you know the ps4s is a very new tire and development for this car started in 2012. so another portion of the story which i've heard is that the reason why they're using pilot super sport is because the ps4s wasn't out when they were starting development for the tire for this car that to me makes sense because why wouldn't you go with the latest and greatest so i think part of it is just when development started but it does have a very sticky i mean i was driving on the track they are exceptionally good tires in the dry so very good dry tire nothing to worry about there the wheels are forged aluminum and so the weight of this car is actually just under 3 400 pounds now that's for the base version there's also a premium version they haven't released a difference in weight and what those may be so i'm assuming this 3400 is for the base version of the car but not a terrible curb weight considering you know the torque curve on this thing is really good it does put down the power really well and so you know i don't think 3 400 pounds you know heavy by you know 90 standards for a sports car i feel like but by today's standards everything seems to be getting a bit bloated a bit heavier and so it's actually not a terrible weight for the car up front 13.7 inch rotors and those are paired with four piston brembo brakes in the rear depending on which trim you get if you get the base version you've got 13 inch ventilated rear brakes with single piston calipers and then if you go for the premium version of the car or the launch edition then you are getting 13.6 inch so very big brakes and that's one of the things they're pretty proud of with this thing is that the braking capacity is there you can run this thing on the track all day and in fact that's what we're doing we're running it you know five hours or so all day this thing's gonna be out on the track taking a beating and so these brakes are large enough for that it's designed to have the cooling to be able to just run it all day long and so i think that is very cool they didn't actually have to up the brake size for the front rotors to either one you get the one thing they said is they noticed some brake fade if you stay out there for a long time with the premium version the non-premium version with the smaller rear brakes they did say they started to notice some brake fade on the rears only and so as a result if you do opt for the premium package that's why they give you those slightly larger brakes in the rear to make sure it can just stay out there all day and you don't have to worry about braking so as far as the suspension it does have adaptive dampers so you know you can be in comfort sport mode different modes there as far as your ride comfort and the quality how much body roll you're gonna get when i first went out on the track my first thought was this car feels a little high and that's weird to me like this actually has a lower center of gravity than the toyota 86 so even though that has that flat boxer engine and this has the taller inline engine it does have a lower center of gravity than the 86 now it's also ground clearance wise about half an inch lower so this has 4.5 inches of ground clearance versus 4.9 and the 86 so part of it is that they've lowered the car itself but it does have a very low center of gravity and my thought about it feeling tall initially was irrational the more i drove it out there on the track it does feel you know very tight well-behaved car as far as it's it's ride height and it's ride quality and it's handling capability now it has electronic power steering and it has a really high ratio for the steering 15 to one and so toyota seemed a little curious to hear our thoughts on the steering the first thing i thought was what that's crazy high it's higher than the 86 so it's not quite as tight of a turn in not as immediate of a turn in like the 86 and honestly the steering effort is extremely light it doesn't require much now once you get on the track it increases a bit so it increases with speed at very low speeds it's very effortless and there's obviously a lot of assist going in there and then as you get to higher speeds you start to feel it more and of course there's a differentiation between being in sport mode which i am now and comfort regular mode but i mean honestly like no matter where it is the effort is very low and the you know it doesn't turn all that much with a little bit of turning so the steering ratio is very high that part is a little you know i'm not i'm not super sold on the steering i think once you're on the track you're not thinking about as much and actually does exactly what you wanted to i think out on the road it feels a little light and you know a little it could be a bit more a sharper steering ratio to allow for a quicker turn in you know there's a little there's a little more hesitation than you expect in in turning left and right then you know i kind of wanted it to have so it doesn't feel like the 86 in that sense where it's that very dirty steering feel it's a bit more you know gt a bit more tour feeling to the steering so i recently drove the bmw m3 and it has i believe the s58 so you know a twin turbo charged version of the engine in this vehicle and honestly i feel like the turbo lag is less noticeable in this car and perhaps that's the fact that it's paired with an automatic transmission but i do not really notice the lag of the engine it actually feels really good when you put your foot down you get that power i mean you wait for that shift but it doesn't feel like you're waiting for a turbocharger to spool up so i like that about it they've it seems you know to be a fairly small turbo that's very quick to react and you get that peak torque really quickly so performance wise the engine actually feels wonderful from a visibility standpoint there is a very narrow window up front i don't think it's necessarily a problem but it's certainly it's it's a car that's taking style over visibility and so looking out the front it's fine you can see where you're going you can adjust as needed these side windows are plenty large gives you plenty of space to look out you know check your blind spot look back that kind of thing i don't think the visibility is necessarily bad but it is kind of limited as far as its vertical height so overall before i get into my three major complaints with this thing is that i am impressed i think from a performance standpoint 50 grand this thing makes total sense it is a great package for the money you can get the premium package for four grand more and i think that's well spent upgrade you know you get better audio quality better rear brakes improvements in the interior as far as the seats that kind of thing so there's quite a bit of changes for the premium that i do believe make it worth it also i don't know if you've heard but the exhaust is just constantly crackling i mean constantly anytime you let up and that's fun that's super fun i mean yeah they're just dumping fuel and retarding the timing and just forcing it to do it it's an inefficient thing and it's for silly children like myself that enjoy it but i love it i think that's awesome so let's get into the complaints and i have three of them and the internet has voiced all three of these and i actually am in agreement with the internet for a lot of it so the first one of course being the partnership with bmw the fact that you know the hardware in this car if you look underneath the hood if you look at the drivetrain the platform of this vehicle it's a bmw z4 and it was developed with bmw but but bmw really did you know the the the legwork as far as the development of the engine the powertrain that kind of thing and i think that's disappointing from the perspective of if you are a huge supra enthusiast and you know you want to be driving the supra and you're passionate about it you're passionate about something that wasn't fully toyota it wasn't only toyota doing it and i think that's kind of sad like with the new nsx you have a developed in-house it is a honda car like honda developed that vehicle and it's truly an nsx whether or not you like it and it's crazy expensive both of those i think you know i think the nsx is amazing but the price is insane so one of the reasons toyota is able to do this and make a car that they don't need to make they do not need to make this vehicle you know it's not they're not doing this for the profit of it solely like they they have the rav4 for that it's a car they wanted to make and as a result you know i get their side where the super needs to be cool and it needs to be you know it has to make sense from a marketing standpoint if it's not both of those things it doesn't happen and so that's where the the partnership with bmw makes sense because they can severely reduce the development costs in order to make it they don't have an inline six so what are they going to do make an inline six and then perhaps they could use it in the lexus lineup i think that'd be cool i think that's i think an in-house developed inline six would have been awesome i understand financially why they did what they did so i think there's a little bit there of just like you're super passionate about it you love it you think the super is great cool but throw a little credit at bmw because they did a lot of the legwork in developing this car now that said all the suspension tuning the engine tuning itself for this vehicle the transmission tuning that is all toyota specific they did that in-house so they did take you know they took the hardware package and said we want to make this our own you know they weren't developed side by side for suspension engine tuning that got that kind of thing so there is their own in-house toyota feel to it and i haven't driven the z4 but i have heard they are actually quite different to drive and you know they they put their own touch on this they have certainly put their own time into development making sure the reliability is there making sure it feels and handles like they wanted the supra too so i think that aspect of it is cool a little unfortunate i think that they didn't do an in-house engine the second thing there is no manual transmission i think that's a real shame i think they need to bring it i think if enough customers tell them toyota we need this we want this we're not buying it unless we get six you know six-speed transmission and three pedals or whatever it may be perhaps more than six but either way i think they need to offer a manual transmission i would truly consider buying this car if there were a manual transmission and i don't think as is i want it i really love manual transmissions i love this zf 8 speed but i really wish i had a third pedal i think it would add a little bit to the joy the playfulness that this car provides this thing really has some fun performance on back roads you can actually kind of wring it out have some good fun with it and i think that'd be more enjoyable with a six-speed you know manual shifter rather than the zf8 and it's not to knock on the zf8 it's incredible as an automatic for what it is i just think it's the supra give it the inline six give it a manual transmission that's what the people want so there's my second complaint and my third complaint has to do with form over function and that's with the aerodynamics so if you looked at the ft1 has really cool awesome ducts and inlets and you know holes all over the place for different various purposes and it takes a lot of those styling cues here on the supra and it's like cool they brought all that over but the reality is they're all plastic vents that are completely sealed they are not actual vents and so this is a case of you know they're doing it for the aesthetics and it is not there for function and you know there's been those claims about oh it's done for if you want to race it you can pop these things out and it's like give me a break this is a road car this is a road car sold on the street if you wanted to have functional events put functional vents on it if you don't don't put any vents on it that's my opinion i think you know in the in the early 2000s we had to live with so many fake hood scoops and scoops all over the place and it seemed like we were finally going away from all of the fake just scoops and air intakes and ducks and this thing's just covered in it and i think that's disappointing i really wish everything looking at it was aesthetically not only pleasing and i think it does actually look really good driving around the track i thought it looked awesome seeing a line of these things but it's just really unfortunate to me that those aesthetic touches are not functional it takes away from them it's like oh that looks really cool why do they do that oh they did it purely for style the end and and that to me is a bit of a disappointment so those are my three complaints but truthfully i think this thing is awesome i think it is worth the money and i think the performance is there it is a joy to drive the steering's a little meh and i wish there was a manual but engine is phenomenal the rear i mean the the tires are great putting down the power is great the ride quality is there i like that i think it's a really really strong package so i'm very impressed by it thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
