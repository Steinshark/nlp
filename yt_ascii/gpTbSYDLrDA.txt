- hey guys, this is austin. and i have switched to
the razer blade stealth. see, i didn't need to keep
you in click bait suspense. so when intel reached out and
wanted to sponsor a video, it felt like the perfect
time to talk about why i personally have switched
over to the stealth. so i'm lucky enough to take a look at a lot of different laptops, and usually i do spend at least
a few days, if not a week, using it as my main machine. but you know what i keep coming back to? this blade stealth. when we first took a look at it last year, mind you it was a prototype, but i absolutely fell in love. so as ken always likes to point out, even though i like to do
videos on gaming laptops, i actually don't spend a lot
of time gaming myself anymore. and that's for one simple reason, i spend all that time in emails and writing up video
scripts and doing research instead of playing that
next game of fortnite. now there's nothing wrong
with a 15-inch gaming laptop. honestly, that is where
you're going to get the most performance in
a portable form factor, but for me, i would much
rather go to something that's smaller, lighter, and
importantly will fit in areas that i actually use the laptop, like, you know, the back of a car or an airline seat or
wherever the case is, i know that i can always
use this razer blade stealth to get done whatever i need to get done. i mean, if i'm going
to be completely real, the only reason i
stopped using this laptop in the first place is because razer sent over a prototype of their blade stealth which they very sort of
nicely asked for back after i tried to keep
it for a little while because i didn't want to give it up. but (chuckles) i know. i tried a few other laptops. i did a lot of other videos. and yet, i end up with the
blade stealth yet again, and this one is all mine. inside, i'm really not
giving up performance. now sure, in 15-inch laptops
such as a macbook pro or the larger razer blade
will give you more core, more graphics, all that kind of stuff, but as far as what i need to do, this can do absolutely
everything besides for editing, which of course i do have
a dedicated system for. 95% of what i do every day is done on this razer blade stealth. a big part of that is the eighth generation intel
core i7 processor inside. and yes, intel is sponsoring this video, but i have tried a lot
of different laptops and a lot of different laptop processors, and this really is a sweet spot between performance and
battery life right now. the i7 8565u is a processor that's found on a lot of premium notebooks
and for good reason. it has a 15 watt tdp,
which is especially suited for something like this
13-inch form factor. and importantly, it does
have a full quad-core design that can boost over four
gigahertz which is really nice, considering that in the
razer blade stealth, it has plenty of cooling
to actually handle that. now it's not a razer
product if it can't game, and the razer blade stealth
is surprisingly powerful given its small form factor. so there is an optional nvidia mx150 gpu, but the real way to game on this guy is to take advantage of thunderbolt. now we have talked about
thunderbolt before, but what i really like about it is it turns a thin and light laptop which is great for travel,
great for portability, into a full gaming powerhouse. so with that single thunderbolt cable, we have power going to the laptop, so you don't need to charge
it or anything like that. and we also have usb with a mouse as well as an external ssd. but the real kicker is the
extra graphics horsepower we get with the rtx 2070. now there are a wide range of
different external gpu options that you can go with. i like this one because it's super tiny. and of course, it has the
power to drive a full 5k ultrawide monitor like this. the nice thing is you
don't have to deal with any of the downsides of a
big, heavy gaming laptop. i have all the power i need when i want it and the portability
when i actually need it, which is like 90% of the time. also, shout-out to these speakers, man. they are actually properly loud. i don't even feel like i
need to use another set of normal desktop speakers. it might seem like a smaller point, but something i do like
about the blade stealth is its port selection. so in addition to the thunderbolt 3, we also have usb-c as
well as a pair of usb-a. and both the usb-c and thunderbolts can also charge the laptop. so as long as you have something like this to be able to plug it in, you can pretty much game
for as long as you like. the nice part about this
is that i'm playing on a 5k ultrawide right now with
full maxed out settings, and the razer blade has no
problem with it whatsoever. even if you do opt for the internal gpu, you just don't have this kind of power. all it takes is literally
that one thunderbolt cable, and as long as you have a decent gpu, which honestly most of the time you're going to have something that's at least somewhat decent as
far as the external side goes, you're going to have a
lot of power to play with. battery life is a big part
of any laptop that i use as my daily. so inside the blade stealth is a decent sized 53 watt-hour battery, but what really pushes it over the edge is the display which in
theory can give you up to 13 hours of battery life on a charge. i talked a little bit about
this in my previous video, but this is using a 13.3-inch 1080p panel. now there is a 4k touchscreen option, but battery life is
absolutely the reason why this is my main choice. so first of all, it is a solid panel. 1080p, in my opinion,
is really the sweet spot for a laptop of this size, and the major advantage
here is that you get some seriously improved battery life thanks to the fact that
it is a one watt panel. i actually got to chat with
the team who put this together and it is pretty cool. so the display is almost always one of the biggest power draws when you're using a phone, laptop. specifically with a
laptop that's this size, it can pull a lot of power. on average, a 1080p panel
might pull two watts and a 4k panel can pull double that. however, this display has
been heavily optimized, not only on the hardware side but also on the driver
and the software side, bringing that down to around one watt, which absolutely equals more battery life without really any downside. it's still a really nice screen. it still looks great. it just takes up less
power, which directly means that the laptop is going to
last longer without a charge or with a charge. it will have a charge for longer. now, all this being said, 13 hours is a little bit of an optimistic estimate. that makes sense if
you're just sitting around watching video all day. when i'm doing stuff
like keeping slack open, listening to spotify, watching videos with tons of chrome tabs open, i'm averaging around eight
hours or so on a charge, which is really not too bad considering that a lot
of laptops with my load, especially these ultrabooks, can only last about five to six hours. so they're doing a lot here, and a lot of it i do think is
due to that one watt panel. the stealth also has intel's
gigabit wifi built in. you may have caught a couple
videos we did recently where we talked about upgrading
the wifi here at our studio. so let's see what we can actually get over just purely a wireless network. so in theory, we do have
a gigabit connection, and so, 400, 500, almost
600 megabits a second. and that is actually without
even upgrading our wifi router to something which is
technically gigabit capable. maybe it's time to go for wifi six. regardless though, these are
incredibly impressive speeds and the nice thing is
is that this is capable of gigabit wifi no matter where you are. so i'm traveling, if i find
some super fast airport wifi, sometimes the airport wifi
actually is pretty good, i can take full advantage of
it with the razer blade stealth especially when it comes to
stuff like uploading videos when you're at a trade show
and things are very, very slow. the real downside with the blade stealth is that it is on the pricey side. there are certainly other laptops which can give you a similar level of spec for a whole lot less money, but the main reason why i really like this and i continue to use it is because it is such a killer blend of power, portability, build
quality, and battery life, which is, as far as i'm concerned, just can't be beat by any other laptop that i've tried this year. thank you very much for watching. so i'm actually here in
taiwan for computex right now where i'll be taking a lot
at some of the other stuff that intel's releasing at the show. simply be sure to stay tuned. and of course if you're interested in anything i talked about in this video, the links will be in the description. now, if you'll excuse me,
i'm going to go to sleep.
