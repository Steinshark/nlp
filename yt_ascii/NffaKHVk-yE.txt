is that camera yeah that's incredible yeah look at it is that better than your phone yeah it's an incredible quality yeah here with joe rogan at the weigh-ins oh hi you get nervous before these things no i get excited though how do you prepare for all the names you have to read off get them written out banana when you look at these guys you see excitement you see fear what do you usually see the fighters yeah when they stay us you never see fear i mean you saw fear like when anderson silva was in pro in his prime he saw some fear it was like when the guys reach this like unstoppable level you see some fear but you don't generally you just see anxiety and tension and you know you see guys getting fired up for a fight intensely intensity for sure who's the most intense guy you've seen at the weigh-ins ever connor gets pretty fucking intense but so this could be it all depends on whether or not they have like real animosity towards each other nate diaz is probably somebody that gets pretty intense oh yeah he's gonna get intense that's gonna be a good one just i don't know how they're going to separate him from hamza and him from everyone else because everything's gonna get crazy today it could get crazy yeah and what are you gonna do are you gonna be all right i'm gonna get the fuck out of there if shit gets wild i'm not getting into scrap you gotta watch me look like a coward also here with shane gillis you're going to step up if she goes down i'll get in there all right i might have to get in and get knocked out by a 120 pounder you ever lose your voice for these things no no i yell all the time you know because of doing comedy my voice is pretty strong this is like such a surreal moment in human history the the for combat like more innovation is happening combat in the past 20 years then yeah every question for history however and you're at the center of it yeah when you did that hit you at which point does that hit you before big fights before big fights it's always like goosebumps it starts wheeling up yeah yeah like before leon edwards and kamara usmano was like here we go you know you just like your whole body just tingles like all your skin tingles and then the shock might happen like you did in that fight oh yeah yeah yeah yeah just like when something crazy happens your whole body just jolts it's so it's so wild you know like you see people standing up and screaming oh my god behind you and then you become a meme yeah i become i'm a meme often but the last one when leon edwards knocked out camaro you see me and dc freaking out behind us tony oh my god that was amazing it was amazing all right brother thank you for giving us a behind my pleasure [music] [applause] versus kevin holidays [applause] official 178 8.5 [applause] ferguson [applause] and his opponent named diaz [applause] you all for coming out we'll see you all tomorrow night how do you feel after that that was exciting that's very intense it was it's gonna be one of those cards where it's like no one prepared for that opponent so you have three fights that have been completely reworked and so these guys have to adjust and you know there's very different opponents okay well what happened was hamzajimaya didn't make weight and he missed weight by eight and a half pounds which is so crazy that they wouldn't let them fight each other so they had to move that so now you have li jing leon versus daniel rodriguez rodriguez was supposed to be fighting kevin holland that's right and then hamza was supposed to be fighting nate diaz this way by a ton but honestly tony ferguson versus nate diaz is a much better fight much more competitive fight and hamza versus kevin holland is a real test for homs on him kevin holland is a big guy he fought at'5 pounds before he was very successful knocked people out including joaquin buckley at'5. i think that's a real chance it's a it's chaos surprise it's a totally different kind of fight he's a chaos kind of guy though yeah i mean i think it's an exciting fight i'm excited well i don't like the facts the best way that's a lot to miswave by so there's like two things could happen he miswade because he didn't prepare properly which usually indicates either he was sick or injured or he didn't want to make the way you know maybe he was like so worked up by all this nate dia stuff that he didn't want to get in the sauna he didn't want to cut the weight who knows what's going on we don't know yeah we really don't know you'd have to get friends with him where he could confide in you and you tell you the truth it was amazing to see you do this in person and amazing to see the fighters in person man thank you tomorrow's going to be even crazier foreign [music] so like this shot right here this is a perfect example this seems like an easy shot but you know it's not an easy shot it's getting to that ball i'm down there yeah so that ball when the ball's down there like that like kind of in the middle but not in front of that hole there's only two places to be on that door you have to be on the right side of the ball or the left side of the ball now when you have something like this that's right for the whole it seems like well that's an easy shot but you have to make sure that you have the right speeds here and then it's got to go like this all the way down to here oh so two walls has got a bounce on this one that one and all right basically three rails maybe three rails and that a little like a tap on the other one wow that's strong that's strong yeah yeah so it looks like that's easy but that's not easy at all that that's like one of the harder shots to get yourself well you're in a perfect position to make the next block how'd you get into opening anthony i was in bands with my brother and i would write song parries about everything that was happening in the news and the oj thing you might heard of that happened and i wrote a song tired about it i hope he played it on his show wbab on long island and people loved it so he goes hey can you come in and do it live and me and my brother are like yeah came in did it live and i thought this was my shot i just poured everything out i started doing impressions i was commenting on the news and opie goes dude that was really good why don't you come in next week again and it just snowballed from there we got an offer to go to boston and i never looked back i threw my sheep at all worker tools out on 95 on my way up to boston all about knowing like the cue ball speed and knowing powerball is gonna come off the ball when it contacts it at an angle and it's you get completely obsessive because it's so hard to predict and then the more you do it the more you get like muscle memory and the more you kind of understand where the ball is going so you're not even thinking too much using intuition there's a lot of thinking things that happen at the same time it's super complicated it's fascinating foreign
