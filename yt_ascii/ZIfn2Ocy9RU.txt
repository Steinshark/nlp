we talked about the lro camera and that's a well-known consumer plan optic or lightfield camera how much if somebody wanted one of these how much are these off ebay i think i don't know if i should say off ebay you can say that yeah i sold them for1 on ebay i was very tempted actually because i'm not allowed to take this one home so these aren't the only other cameras though are they so there's another company called ratx who are pretty prominent in lightfield they're more focused on industrial cameras what sort of uses would an industry have for this sort of thing to answer that question i should probably tell you a little bit about how the ratx differs from this so first of all a ratx camera is much higher resolution it's it's more expensive but it's much higher resolution okay you can you can obtain 11 megapixel images with all this other array information okay but also the approach of rri is slightly more pragmatic so they don't necessarily model all the rays going into the camera and worry about the mathematics of of how you would reconstruct focus and things like this what they're really interested in doing is very quickly obtaining a depth map of a scene so people familiar with microsoft connect we know that depth sensors are quite big at the moment so instead of just taking a normal picture you take a picture and you also get a a value for every pixel of how far away it is now the problem with connect is it runs on ir so it can't be used outside and it's fairly low resolution what oh inf fored right infared sorry yeah i mean it's very good for skeletal tracking and and gameplay but if you want to use it to reconstruct a rice plant it that's not what it was designed for you can give it a go but it's not what it's designed for so the ratx is a hardware based appro that tries to reconstruct depth and high resolution images really really quickly so this lro camera will take a picture and my computer will chug away for a minute or two and i'll have a really nice picture at the end the ratx using a gpu machine will do this in fractions of a second okay because it's designed that way so rri camas are subtly different but pretty similar they still have a main lens and a ccd and they still have micro lenses in front okay ratx have a hexagonal micr lens array so there's slightly less less wasted space but it's it's minor okay rays come in on a on a ratx but instead of being focused on to each micr lens they're focused behind okay so they just come in like this and hit a bunch of micr lenses and then some of these micr lenses will focus into focus and some will focus nearly in focus and they have different focuses so three different focuses and ratx approach this problem very much as a each microl lens views for scene from a different angle what can we do with that and what they can do is process called stereo correspondence or stereo matching which is a topic for another video but essentially what feature points can we find in one micr lens but also in our neighboring micr lenses to give us an idea of what the depth of the scene is because if you close one eye and then you open the other eye you can see your view shift and we use that to sort of triangulate how far away things are and that's what they're doing here and they do it very very fast using graphics cards so what a ror camera will do is produce a depth map of the scene so how far away is there and a color image and it will do it at you know multiple frames per second so you can stream video in it or you can do sort of quick tasks of image processing so a few examples that they show we we'll put a link to their website in the in the comments so that you can see the kind of stuff they do but they'll do things like industrial component testing so they'll look at a very small industrial component and because they've got a depth map they can make sure it's been manufactured to the right tolerances okay this camera's all been cali at so they know what the depth map is in in real world millimeters in terms of sort of plant sciences where i am you can imagine that a depth map of a plant will give you a good idea of what shape that plant is and that's useful for all kinds of modeling applications or or plant phenotyping which is the idea of extracting traits from plants and working out which is better than another plant and you know maybe trying to create more drought resistant crops or something like that those are just a couple examples loads more things you could use it for if anyone wants to buy me one you know i i'll put to good use this costs you know l100 now a few hundred essentially a rous cam will be in tens of thousands of euros but it's a very different problem being solved so something for everyone for example here's the table here's the floor where which bits of the floor and which bits of the table can i see you don't really care about focusing this doesn't have a focus knob on it or any kind of autofocus
