ladies and gentlemen brian rose just ended his career in an interview with some kids as part of a show called politics relaxed this is a show done by teenagers and i think brian thought it would be an easy way for him to get some nice publicity but little did he know these young little journalists are aspiring to hold politicians accountable and they put brian over the fire you've deleted comments of your channel that even vaguely even vaguely against what you're doing like we have a we have a social media team which is the one thing as my publisher said i've actually got a commitment as he said 20 minutes he didn't do well and now he's censoring them he's deleted their video from their channel it's their content he has copyright strike that video taken it down so he can't be criticized by children let me remind you that this is the man who says that he's pro free speech he's the man who said he's the free speech guy you can say anything right this is the guy who was censoring children who took him to task on his inherent contradiction and lies we're going to talk about it today and i'm going to signal boost it because these poor kids need someone to fight for them you know they have a small youtube channel they can't get the word out and it's up to us to put a stop to this because look brian rose can censor me he can be a hypocrite all he wants with other adults look i can take it but you can't do this to kids who are entering politics and bully them around you coward and fraud i'm gonna call you out ladies and gentlemen let's go to the board welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and today yes we're talking about brian again the hypocrisy the lies this is it i'm telling you guys i really believe this is going to be the interview that really destroys this man's whole career any last shred of credibility he had which hardly was any is gone after this debate any last remnant of his former reputation from london real and all the interviews they did there is gone after today now let me remind you that brian rose he's right now running for mayor of london and one of his big policies is free speech as you know he ran the freedom platform which we've covered in many videos but he also says this extends this right to free speech extends to even his critics let's take a listen real quick to set up this clip because you guys aren't going to believe this we don't have people hating us then we're doing something wrong so i actually welcome it i think it's fascinating but also i'm a big believer in free speech so there you go guys he doesn't mind it that's what he's been saying but as you and i both know this has not been true he's been censoring all my videos where i talk about him anytime i show his clips he tries to get those videos removed but then this interview with these kids happened where brian rose i guess thought he was going to get a softball interview but he does this and he takes down these kids video challenging him on some of the most important issues and contradictions of his campaign let's take a listen to this because these kids demolish brian i want to ask you after doing a bit of research when you said you wanted to be held accountable so i'm going to do that but do you stand for freedom of speech since you delete you delete comments we clearly stand for freedom of speech i mean that's why we created that platform so in the in the freedom of speech you've deleted comments that are that are saying things against you against some of your work but yet you're happy to give a platform to somebody who denies the holocaust what is the deal i can't confirm or deny that it is so unbelievable to me that these kids it's taken kids to hold brian to account all the other interviews no one has been this hard on brian so just imagine the irony brian thought this is going to be his easiest interview of the entire day and these kids are ripping him to shreds and i talked to the kid after he said look i just want to know are you consistent with your own values he's doing a journalist's job you want him to be consistent that's your point about holding him accountable 100 and if he wants to talk about free speech and if that's what he really wants to push that's fine as long as he's actually like committing to these actions but what we've seen over the last weeks and months of this campaign is he cannot do that he's deleting comments and he's now stopping our video from being released dude imagine having such a fragile ego that you get destroyed in a debate by a kid and then you censor their video i mean honestly i think they should be getting jobs at the bbc to be honest like news organizations should pay attention this is the kind of journalism that we need with politicians by the way but watch as brian tries to redirect out of this these hard questions that monitors that again we don't believe in hate speech and we don't believe in anything that insides violence so but actually what what what i really like to talk about is knife crime putting police on the streets i completely know what you're talking about you were talking about your speech which is 20 minutes so we're just after the hour so howard's just giving me a shake here this is brian running away he apparently said before the interview he's going to stay for like 30 to 45 minutes he's running early from the interview because he has to he he's getting crushed he left early so we are on schedule for 30 minutes he only came off 15 and the reason he left was because we were challenging on him deleting comments which like goes exactly against what he's talking about free speech so look we can pick this up at another time but i really i really appreciate the time guys and we can pick this up next time we talk all right thank you very much there we go that is brian rose the mayoral candidate who is avoiding scrutiny these kids are everything right with journalism they're doing the real journalism that brian rose says isn't happening they're really holding politicians to account and their channel is being censored right now and quite frankly i don't think any of us should stand for it get a hold of youtube we need to fight for these kids to have their video reinstated and brian rose to be held account for the fact that he is bullying kids into silence while at the same time complaining about youtube bullying him what does it say about you when you're bullying as a 2 million subscriber channel a channel with a few thousand subscribers i think it's absolutely deplorable i think these kids are doing everything right and guys please go subscribe to their channel and give them some love this is the future of journalism right here and i really believe that this interview more than any other demonstrates the hypocrisy the lies of brian rose the con man and is going to destroy his career because you can't stand up for free speech when you are censoring children kids from talking politics with you absolutely disgusting i hope this stops wanted to give a big shout out to these kids for doing everything right thank you for watching guys and quick emergency broadcast i'll see you guys in the next one i know what you need this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
