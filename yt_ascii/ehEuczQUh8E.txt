- what's up, guys, mr. cop here. and today we're gonna
be pulling over people- ah, hey. hey, watch it deputy. you trying to lose your job? - no, i'm just training. - i'm gonna need you to
train a little harder there. - people are out here breaking the laws. there's lives that depend on us. all right, squad up, and let's go. - all right, one, two, three. - police. - hi, my name is . how may i help you? - hey, do you buy any
chance sell any drugs here, or anything illegal? - no. - okay, good, just checking. i'll just take a taco then. - hello. just on duty, patrolling. - any sauce for your taco? - no, thank you.
- okay. - we need to analyze the evidence. pull around deputy, right here. just what i thought. what is this green stuff? - that looks like-
- sniff it. - that looks like the marijuana. - i can't believe they're selling this right under our noses. look how much this is. - that's like at least $10,000
worth of the devil's lettuce. we should call 911. - i think it's on us
to put an end to this. honestly, chris, i can't believe they just sell
this stuff in plain sight. - it's unacceptable. i'm actually kinda worried
that there might be other fast food chains selling drugs. - god, say it's not so. ethan, you won't believe this. we need your help. we need an undercover cop. apparently fast foods, they've
been selling the good, good. the green stuff. so we're gonna need you to go in. it's a sting operation. you get the good, good,
we'll bust down the door. whatever you do, do not
let 'em know you're a cop. - copy that, sergeant. - no, not copy that. roger. - chris, i need to have
a conversation with you, away from the deputy.
- all right. - this is his first assignment. you sure he can do this? - he's probably gonna die.
- yeah. all right, sergeant, move in, godspeed. - welcome to mcdonald's, would you like to try our tenders? - um, no thank you. do you by chance have that green stuff? - i'm sorry, what was that? - that good, good, green stuff. - what . - chris.
- yeah? - you'll always be my brother. - deputy, what'd you get? hand that here.
- that green stuff. - there is no way, no way. do you see this? - i see it. despicable. - oh yeah, it is. it looks pretty good. - it's actually really, really good. - wow, that's really good. but that doesn't just- they should, look! how can they just sell this stuff? head office, we're gonna pursue this green stuff a little further. if you don't hear back from me, they obviously would've caught onto us. - nope. - so when i got that report
about the green, green, i also got a report about the white stuff. - the whites? no. - yeah, i know, dude. this place is crazy. hey, fed. we're gonna be positioned
five feet to the right, you're gonna go in. you see the white stuff,
you give us the signal, we tear this place down. let's go. - be like-
- breach, breach, breach. - yeah.
- breach. - just doing our job, nothing to see here. - yeah. - could i have a vanilla milkshake please? could i have that with some
extra, the white stuff, please? the white stuff.
- the white stuff? - thank you, ma'am. got that white stuff, guys. we got the white stuff. someone run the sample, chris. - i'll run the sample. that's the white stuff. that's the white stuff. - come on, that can't be the white stuff. i need you to run a sample. run a sample, officer. - yeah, that's definitely it. that's definitely it. - lemme try it one more time.
- how? - no doubt. - that's the white stuff. - i just- how can they just- how have none of the other officers ever caught onto this stuff? - we've got some dirty cops on our hands. - i think we do too. what do we do, boys? we're just a three man team. obviously, we can't trust
everyone else, they're dirty. - at least we can trust ourselves, right? - hey. - definitely still white stuff. - before he started working for me, he worked at chick-fil-a. now he's busting them
for their white stuff. what a cool world we live. - they've changed so much.
- i know. - dude were you aware of that when you worked for them?
- i was not. - wait, are you wiping
your white stuff off with more white stuff? - there's white stuff
all over this restaurant. - it's a hard day out on patrol, isn't it? oh, he's got a segway? oh, man, our department
doesn't give us segways. - i'm trained, man.
- we're trained, man. see this hat right here? - yeah, i went through
all the classifications and everything. - i don't recall seeing you. - you were there. me, you and john, right? well, we appreciate your service. - thank you, sir.
- thank you. - we were gonna give him
a couple hundred bucks, but then i was like, "wait a minute, i think that's illegal." as you guys know, i've
been a cop my whole life. these are my two trainees. he's really new. and i'm gonna show them
the way of the law. dangle, bulge. i think i see some illegals
sitting on the bench, we gotta take care of.
- let's go get 'em. - all right, officers roll out. - how's it going fellas? got a citation for that coat there. - it's for the illegal bench sitting. they've been here for over three minutes. - i think $20 a piece
is a good, a good fine. it's either the cuffs, or the cash. which ones it gonna be? - if you put the cuffs on, are you gonna be mad if i break 'em? - i mean, these are my only cuffs, man. - i think that's some sarcasm, cuff 'em up right now. - you break my cuffs, and we're adding another five bucks to it. - they're not gonna fit.
- they don't fit. - it's time to pay up your fine, man. - whoa, i dropped it. the fine was just five bucks. there you go, you can keep the rest. all right, officers, let's roll out. head office says this is an illegal road, apprehend anyone who crosses. set up a point, right here.
- all right. - no one shall cross. - you were texting and walking? that's against the law.
- wee woo, wee woo, wee woo. - that's gonna be like a, what? how much of a fine? - how much do you think, officer? - $50, yeah. - is it $50? okay. - that's pretty serious,
people die like that all the time.
- sorry. - i'm writing your ticket, slow down. - i hope that was an important text. - $60.
- it was my mom. - all right, $50. - i'll go sell this book, and maybe i'll get back to you guys. no, it's okay.
- where did that come from? - there you go.
- no, yeah. - here you go.
- no, guys. - move along, ma'am. - citizen, you get the money. you're great, you're great. - we made a $20 profit.
- no. - ma'am, you move along. - do you have a permit to sit in that grass right there? sign right over there that
says keep off the grass. it's a pretty serious offense. officer bulge, write her a ticket. - i'm a broke college student. i don't have that kind of money. - well, see, here's the thing. you know, it's either jail, or the ticket. so, you gotta pick one. - oh, jail wasn't fun the first time, i'll go for the ticket. - alright, here we go. oh, i ripped your ticket in half. so you're gonna get two tickets, and now it's $40. - well, that doesn't seem fair. - well, life isn't fair, ma'am. if you don't have the money to pay for it, you can just- - oh, there, she has it. - all right. - we just need that. all right. - that should cover it. all right, officers. - all right, let's head out. - wait, i wanna see him. - wait a minute, wait a minute. - we've gotta get a fine too. who are you? - fine right now. - you're laying on
grass, which is illegal. - yeah, you're you're inside the computer. - this is now your ticket. here's your fine, there. - no more illegal sitting, please. i'd hate to fine you again. all right, let's let this
thing in gear, let's go. - so, how much have we given away? i'd say like-
- probably about a thousand. - -like a thousand dollars. how much have we made? oh, wow. really? that much on one apprehension?
- yeah. - we're negative a thousand so far. wow, that's pretty good. - yeah, we're doing pretty good. - i would say it's pretty good. - actually, no, we did have
$5, but then we bought donuts. - welcome to krispy kreme, where we start with fresh
donuts, how may i help you? - can i get one glazed donut? cops get free donuts, right? - yeah, they sure don't.
- aw, man. - yeah, they sure don't. - here, water boy.
- water boy. you got flamed.
- i'm out. - taxpayers will pay for it, so it's fine. - well guess what?
- what? - all right, officers. i think, just like the
ice cream, remember? you know how last week we
were ice cream salesman? mr. ice cream man here,
except i don't have ice cream. i just have a lot of money. yeah, i think, remember how we realized, like we just had to give away more money? - yeah.
- to make money? - i think we just pull
our shorts up higher, and just give away more money. i think we're good, man. alright, dongle, bulge. i think i see an illegal
bench sitter over there. - i'll go apprehend her. i'll call you if i need back up. - want me to punch her? - excuse me, ma'am.
- hi. - you having a good day? - i am, how are you?
- i'm doing great. you know why i pulled you over? - no. - this is a non-reading park,
there's no reading here. cell phones only, and that is a book. that's old technology there. i don't know if i can let
this keep on happening. well, i see you got the cell phone, but you got the book, too. i'm gonna, come on over. i'm gonna need some backup
here, she's kind of resisting. our back up's a little slow, so just bear with me for a second here. all right, so officer beast,
i pulled this lady over. she's reading a book in public. - i know. - that's old technology. - i could see from all the way over there. - this is a only cell
phone campus right here. - say no more, what do you wanna fine her? - i think she's got a
$30 fine coming her way. - here you go, officer. - all right. all right, how you gonna be
paying this today, ma'am? - with sarcasm. - ah, we don't accept sarcasm,
but we do accept cash, the next best thing. whoa, look, there's
something in your book there. all right, so i'll take that for the fine. - all right. - all right, so now here,
i'll take the state's cut. and there's your change,
there's a nice bookmark for you. - honestly, most people
can't pay their fines. i'm surprised you had it on you. - actually you gave this to me, right? - yeah.
- yeah. - are you trying to bribe an officer? that's that's that's another fine. there you go. all right, let's head on out. ma'am you have a great day. - i've noticed a lot of people
not wearing mr. beast merch. hey, fashion police. i'm gonna need your help. all right, officer. there's a lot of people not
wearing this sexy merch, here you go. i'm gonna need you to citation anyone without mr. beast mech. all right, man? - fashion police reporting for duty. - if you're not wearing
merch from shopmrbeast.com the fashion police will come for you. - what is this shirt i see? oh, it's a-
- it's not a mr. beast shirt. - yeah, so we're gonna have
to give you a ticket for that, because that definitely goes against the school's code of conduct. - yeah.
- not a fire shirt. - that's unacceptable. why would you not wear merch like this? shopmrbeast.com - how's it going, ma'am? you having a great day? this sidewalk here, you're
not supposed to walk on it. you know that, right?
- no. - i might have to fine you. are you resistant arrest? - he's new, he's just a deputy. - officer, i'd rip your badge off, but this merchant is sexy. i'm gonna have to ask
you to get outta the car. you let her get away. you're fired. - turn your badge in.
- right now. put your badge in the car.
- it's fine. i get it. - hey, you got a license? hey, pull back around, come back around. - i think i saw no license in your car. - and also, do you have
a license for that? is that a prostitute? - it smells like he's had a dog in here. let me see your dog identification. it's a $40 ticket. hey, eric, i forgot to pay you last week. here you go.

god's work here, guys. - how's the county doing? - we just pulled over two suspects, but i think our total gross
money actually went down. i don't think we made any money. - well, see, here's the thing about being an officer of the law. you're not trying to make money, you're trying to save lives. and we just prevented two
people who were breaking the law from continuing. - yeah, but my superiors told me just to pull people over and make money. - well, i'm a dirty cop, and
i don't care about superiors. - you're darn right. we don't care about money, right, deputy? - oh yeah. we care about it at all. - pull over, wee woo wee woo. hey, sir.
- yeah? - do you know why i
pulled you over young man? - no, i'm not sure. - one, it's 'cause my
flashlight wasn't working. two, it's because i
needed a good thumb down. i'm gonna have to take you downtown. i might have to use you for
click bait some other day. hands. - all right.
- all right. - go on your way, man, and drive home. - all right, man, thanks, i appreciate it. - tell them to like and subscribe. actually i don't care if you
like the video, just subscribe. - subscribe to mr. beast. - say if they don't subscribe, they're gonna end up like you. i'm gonna take you downtown. - if you don't subscribe, you get pulled over and taken to jail. - and in case you're
wondering what this is, i just dropped a new shirt. i did it all for the cookie. shopmrbeast.com you can buy this shirt. i'll tell you more about
this shirt later this week. for now, make sure you obey the law. - can you take these off? i need to drive home. - do they want three dozen donuts? - i'll probably end up
