- i just bought that private island. (indistinct) i honestly cannot believe
you can just buy an island. look at it! this looks like a screensaver. and this is our first time stepping foot on our brand new island. - it's sandy. - now i know some of you might not believe that i bought this private island which is why i brought this document, which proves i bought the island. no joke, i own this. do you have everything you need? - yeah, we got it all set.
- i think so. - i guess.
- you can leave. - don't leave.
- stop. - wait! what do we do now? - we are now stranded
on this private island for the next 24 hours. and to celebrate, let's
go explore the new island because i have no idea what i bought. i paid $730,000 for this island and i don't know what's on it. - this island is huge. what the heck? - [jimmy] the first thing i wanna explore is the secret tunnel over here. - [karl] yeah, we're in the jungle now. i thought we were on the beach. - this will take us all
throughout the island. this island has a beach. it has a jungle. it has a cave.
- a cave? - i'm just glad there's no huge spiders. (suspenseful music) - that was just a branch.
- okay. - that was a branch. oh, there's two paths here. boys, do we go left or do we go right? - [boys] left. - okay, i guess we're going left. bye cameraman. - this is the good path i was
told by the native animals. - oh, my god!
- what? - what is that? all right, go, go, go. to it, go, go. (whistling) - [chandler] we are in
pursuit of real pigs. - [chris] hi piggy, piggy. - are there pigs in this island? - if there are pigs on my
island, do i own the pigs? - yeah.
- is that how this works? wait, chandler, what if we
find an ostrich on here? - i'll take it home. - this is the craziest
thing i've ever experienced. i've never seen live pig,
like, wild pigs like that. - i don't know, man. i didn't even know you could
buy an island a month ago. and this is the other side of the island. that path cuts right through the middle. this is the other coast - bro, it never ends. how much more island is there, jimmy? this is ridiculous. - when i bought this island,
i had no idea it's this big. like look at it. we couldn't explore this
whole thing if we wanted to. it's so big. - [karl] this is the most
beautiful place i've ever been. - the water there goes on forever. we are literally stranded
in the middle of the ocean. - does this have to only be 24 hours? - i'm actually kind of okay with it. this is really cool. - and tomorrow's when
we grab all the people from the lottery ticket
video, put 'em on this island and have them compete for it. underneath this rock, it's the cave i was telling you about. - [karl] bro, it's freaking cool. holy cow. - we should probably
wait till the tide gets a little lower, but come back. - chandler, what's the name? five, four, three, - jeff! - the island name is jeff. - it's name is jeff. - my name is jeff. - and now we're gonna head back on the other path on the island. - [chris] yo, this is gonna be a long walk 'cause the island's so big. - tyler, is that what you've
been doing this whole time? is this for the boys?
- [tyler] i'll test it out. - it looks amazing though. - [tyler] i feel like i could do better. - this is actually, really cool. - it's perfect for cuddling. - the view from here is insane. all right, nap time. (voices gasping) whatever you do, don't send this to maddy. - [chris] having a girlfriend doesn't mean you can't cuddle with the boys. - it's time we get to business. - yeah, business. - jeff needs to be
suitable for human life. chris you're in charge of the fire, food and building structures. - go.
- that's a lot, okay. - well you're good at everything. karl, you're in charge
of mapping the island. that includes figuring
out what animals are here, figure out what fish are around
it and just drawing a map. - okay, that's easy.
- go. tyler, you're in charge
of writing the laws. - laws. - if we're all gonna live
on this private island, we need to be on the same page. chandler, you have the most
important responsibility. - of course. - you are in charge of waste management. i don't want pee here and pee there, and poop there, and pee there. - centralize location for waste. i got it.
- yes, you got it. - i'm gonna dig a hole
so we can poop and pee. then, i'm gonna cut a
hole inside of a chair. and then, we're gonna sit on the chair and poop through the hole,
into the hole that i dug. - chandler, how's the poop hole coming? - it's coming good. - why is it when it comes to
the pooping, you're this smart. - i don't know man. i just got a good thing for poop. - for all. law number three, chris cooks food for all of us on the island. - tyler, what's another law you worked on? - chandler isn't allowed to leave. - not until we all leave?
- yeah. - that's actually a really good law. - yeah.
- keep it up. pooping is only allowed
in chandler's toilet. that's a good law. team trees. no cutting down trees, agreed. sharks are always allowed on the island. yeah, these laws are definitely pointless. tyler must help chris, sign. - i just need you to grab sticks for me. - here you go.
- oh, is that a stick you got me?
- yeah. - oh man, i appreciate it. (twig cracks) - jimmy put me in charge
of mapping out this island. so, by the end of this,
i'm gonna know it as well as i know the back of my hand. (soothing accordion music) i'm personally amazed. (jimmy screams) - did you pee your pants? - i heard like a rock and then i was like there's
a monster behind me. i don't know what's on this island. it's too big to tell. - all right, have fun with the map. - thank you. i feel like i already have
a really well drawn out map. so, i'm gonna spend the rest
of the time finding wildlife. - honestly, things on jeff
are going pretty well. at this rate, jeff will
be a modern society in under 2000 years. that was funny. - i have a flare.
- why? - so, people will get me off this island. (chandler screams) get off the road. (flare gun pops) - oh, chandler, is that a flare gun? - i'm getting off the island. (flare gun pops) - [karl] oh, my god! - hey, arrest him right now. - [chris] yo, to jail. - chandler, come back.
- no. - chandler, don't run away. don't run away. if he wants to run away, he can. we can survive without him. we have the toilet. we just lost one of our own boys. he can't leave. we're literally in the
middle of the ocean. he can't go away.
- he'll find a way. - no, he can't.
- he'll find a way. - let's go do productive things. i guarantee you when we make
dinner, he'll come back. - can this be the new chandler? it's already more helpful. - yes, actually. we'll just have to proceed
like chandler's dead. - wait, what? (upbeat synth music) - just kidding. but we will
have to proceed without him. - okay.
- okay. - anyone else wants some wieners? - i do. - i know you do. chris, can you build a fire? - i can. - jimmy, you go find little sticks. you, medium sticks. you, rocks. - chris, where do you want your sticks? - [chris] just put 'em beside the hut. - if there was an explosion, i'm mad. that's an ugly rock. chris will hate that. (rock explodes) - i'm turning this into
a bunch of medium sticks. - all right, let's go spy on jimmy. let's steal their stuff. - [cameraman] okay. - i can hear them, i'm approaching. but they don't know i'm very close. i'm going for the cameras. this is war. - [jimmy] hey, wait! - oh, that's fun. they're coming. - [jimmy] they're just taking our camera? - [chandler] i've got a
$12,000 camera in my hand. - [jimmy] hey, please
keep that camera safe. - what you gonna do?
- please keep that camera safe. - you gotta go.
- you gotta go. - [chris] oh, fancy meeting you here bud. - why? why? why did you run away? - well, you told them to
arrest me. so, i left. if i got caught with this camera, i was gonna come back. - welcome back to jeff. - all right.
- all right. - i'm a free man. time to eat some weenies. (acoustic guitar music) - guys, i'd say we had a pretty good day. i know you guys have all been wondering, what did i pack for food? i brought hot dogs. - [both] yeah! - i brought more hot dogs - [both] yeah! - and bananas. - banana! - why hot dogs and bananas? - later that same evening. - before we go to the cave, we
must light our tiki torches. - touch tips. - [jimmy] to the cave. (boys chanting) this is so much scarier at night. tyler, what do you think of the cave? - it looks terrifying. i'm going in. - [jimmy] well, don't
light your hat on fire - [karl] bro, oh. - that was just water. - [chris] all right, tyler. stay ahead. - hey, get out. - [jimmy] hold up, we're exploring. it goes farther. - [chris] oh, my god! (screams) - [chandler] what're you doing? - [tyler] bro, the whole gang can fit. - [karl] please let me out.
- [chris] come on. - it's midnight on a deserted island and we're just exploring a deep cave that none of us even
knows what it goes to. - that was the scariest
experience of my life. - did you guys enjoy that? - [group] yeah. - you wanna go to another cave? - [group] yeah. - [jimmy] you guys are probably wondering where's the next cave. - yeah.
- well, it's right below us. and this cave is 10 times
larger than the other one. - [karl] we sized it. - we are now at the entrance of the cave. this is going to be epic. let's do it. guys, let's continue. - [chris] all right, let's go. - [karl] hurry. - anyone else afraid? - oh, my gosh. it just goes back there. - what? - [karl] yo, it wraps all the way around. - no, this can't keep going. - we can't get out.
- i just can't keep going. - what are the rules
about peeing in the cave? - [boy] don't. - [karl] you're so close to the exit. - i just saw something
move way down the tunnel. i don't know what it was. - back out, back out, back out. (group screaming) - we're done with the caves for tonight. let's head back. - let's go. is the island bigger or something? don't recognize any of this guys. - are we lost?
- guys? - oh, wait. you heard that? you heard that though? okay.
- i did too. hold up. hey, carl, carl, carl, carl, you man the left wing. thank you.
- what? - stay there. well, we can't go that way. we heard a wildlife. that's where we came from. - we heard a wildlife. straight.
- all right. lead the way, i guess.
- straight. - does anybody wanna switch spots? - oh, i know where we are. - [chandler] the wrong side of the island? - yeah, we're on the north side. our camp's on the south side. all right, everyone. follow me, chris. wait, where's chris? chris?
- chris? - [group] chris? - [karl] we're just gonna stay silent. - oh, i found him. - why didn't you let me scare somebody? i was gonna scare karl. you suck. (chris booing) - all right. we're back. - yeah.
- thank god. we made it. i'm never following you guys again. - it's still on my bed.
- hey, i got us out of here. chris is the one who got us lost. - jimmy told me to keep going straight. - here's the thing chris built. that's the thing tyler built. we're good. all right, boys. i say we end the night with
some night time swimming. - night swim.
- night swim. - the boys are now in the ocean. - at night.
- at night. - not joking, i didn't touch you. that's not a bit right now. is there actually something? - something just grabbed my foot. - are we canceling night swimming? - no.
- night swimming cancelled. - yo, let's sleep here. - lights. (karl screams) - [cameraman] okay,
something's in the water. - i think that the head
of the jellyfish hit me. 'cause that's what i felt. night swimming. night swimming. - [tyler] i was next
to him the whole time. i didn't get stung. - yo, it left like a line where it hit me. you see that? like, indention in my skin. - [chris] that's gotta hurt. - [cameraman] it's all good. - it's wrapped all the way around. are you telling me we can't
go back out right now? night swimming's canceled. - first off, tyler. thank you for building this. - yes, thank you. - second, i'm tired. goodnight. - all right, we're probably
gonna go to bed. wait, karl. (karl farts) - it's a little fart. - goodnight guys. - goodnight. (bright guitar music) - good morning. i slept for maybe an hour or two. i got eaten alive all night by mosquitoes. - and i'm fine. - yeah, how them jellyfish wounds doing? - good morning
