even just triumphing over something that you know is like a persistent sin in your life even triumphing over it for one day or even on one occasion you know not going to that website that you know isn't good for you you know like not spending three hours sort of scrolling social media over and over again cycling through the same four halfs the feeling of spiritual strength that you get from just like triumphing over that sin with god's help through god's power and love is a real experience it can be an immediate experience and can it can show you that it what seems like an insurmountable task you can really approach it one little step at a time and and actually get real results in your life that start radiating through the rest of your life that stuff is powerful and and it is pretty basic but but it it feels out of reach for many people and the only way that they can that they can really believe and and experience otherwise i think is through example it's you can talk about it a lot and that's fine but if if they don't see their fellow human beings actually doing this stuff in their real life it's all going to feel very abstract so you know yeah go into the woods go into the desert but we also got to go into the marketplace got to go into society we got to mix it up with our fellow human beings and show them and participate that's how the holy spirit moves through us this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic [applause] world so hello everyone it is my pleasure to be here with james pulos some of you probably know his work he is the editor at the american mind and at the claremont institute he's also works for the blaze editor there you've seen him on all kinds of podcast tv shows he he's written for several publications and he's also written several books and so he i'm very happy that he's willing to talk to us about technology its place in the world today it's weird connection to spirituality and a vision for the future so james thanks for talking to me hey good to be with you yeah it's great and so i mean i want to start in some ways in a weird way because there's this recent article that came out i think it was on future about what's going on at open ai and how there's this i there there's these rumors of people doing strange rituals and strange invocations about and making kind of you know you know figures of the ai and you know invoking certain things kind of using we could call it some kind of magical thinking or or at least thinking that their intentions are related to the way in which ai will develop at least if we try to make it the least weird possible but it also points to some strange things and so tell me a little bit i mean we can start there what is your perception about that in terms of what the hell is going on in the world of technology sure well i i think it's clear and i i laid some of this out two years ago in my book human forever and you know regrettably it's becoming more accurate with every every passing year so digital technology has has advanced and and been developed in a in a certain direction where it raises these ultimate questions about who we are and why these are the kind of questions that historically admit of theological answers and i think what we've seen over the past 500 years or so is that despite the best efforts of many different sort of ideologues and rationalists materialists these ultimate questions about who and why we are are still only really answerable in theological terms and so what we're seeing around the world is if you're a civilization state a big major power with a with a very old civilization contained within your borders and you're also a first rank digital power you know we're talking about china united states russia israel india maybe you know europe is kind of in this in the in the maybe column on the bubble if you're one of those powers the challenge that you face as a result of digital technology just sort of integrating and eating everything is a specific kind of challenge of statecraft and that challenge is by what authority can you claim convincingly legitimately in the eyes of your your people to extend or even reestablish your sovereignty over the technology within your borders what i've seen unfold and i think we'll continue to see it unfold is that statesmen in those countries are resorting to the original or foundational religion of their people of their civilization in in in russia obviously we're seeing and they announced this openly in 20120 built a big new cathedral in moscow said this you know this isn't just a new building this inaugurates a a fundamentally closer relationship between the military in the church you see this yes in europe where the vatican wants to be right at the forefront of these discussions about like well you know maybe europe's not the best innovators but gosh darn it we're the best regulators so we're going to you know we're going to apply the laws in sort of the most uh in the way that has kind of the most rectitude so that we can get our arms around this technology in china i think there's a debate going on right now between you know really sort of marxist or post-marxist materialists who think like quantity is a quality all its own and daoists and you know they've got buddhism and and confucianism out there some of the best i think most perceptive chinese observers on on the the technological situation are pretty open about saying you know hey we're going to get this right in a way that the west doesn't because the west has this kind of dualism thing going on and we don't we have this harmonious concept of the cosmos and that's going to help us with regard to digital technology india you know the the the hindu nationalists are definitely making decisions about how to chart a technological course based on that kind of religious fundament and in the us and in the the anglosphere you know there is a on a good day a very lively and robust debate on a bad day a sort of nightmarish conflict over exactly what theological presuppositions are going to be justifying the way that technology is is treated and and used within our civilization so i'm laying all this out for for the purpose of saying there's one other sort of religious framework that has been thrust to the for by digital technology and it's not any of the the preex existing you know monotheistic or po polytheistic religions it is worship of technology itself and what we are seeing coming out of large chunks of silicon valley and specifically with regard to to open ai you know we've been seeing this for generations it's really going to start coming to a head overt and however you know occultish very proud and unashamed worship of technology as such or worship of you know what are avatars are of of technology are seen as kind of opening the the floodgates to fundamentally transforming who we are and why we are and carrying us into a a fundamentally new sort of cyborg mode of posthuman existence sounds like a mouthful you know i'm trying to condense 20 years of of activity down into one answer to to a question i mean you look at open ai you know what what what are the the religious foundations that work in the in the head or the heart of a guy like sam altman you know interesting question ilia the guy who's sort of worried about sam you know was involved in some of the the the practices you describe you know the guy's a joint canadian and israeli citizen doesn't seem to be recognizably operating within a christian jewish or even you sort of vaguely judeo-christian framework so these things are coming to a head it's difficult in the west because you know we created these technologies we sort of assumed that they would be our friends or at least not be you know our enemies and rather than consummating our our form of war our our form of rule over the world enlightened and benevolent as we thought it to be it really is seems to be causing that form of rule to implode with with obviously dismaying and confusing consequences so i see that as kind of like the the the setting the table to try to understand where we are and what we need to do to to kind of figure out a path forward all right so i have two questions i'll start with the first one the it seems to me like that part of what's going on with the question of technology is somehow but playing out of the revolutionary trope that has set itself up since the enlightenment which is that if we understand revolution as a as a possibility for legitimacy you know it's like if we think that by taking power for ourselves and you know having a hierarchy but then from the from the bottom of the hierarchy kind of coming up and taking it whether we understand it in the different ways that it's understood marxist or not or just the french revolution or even the american revolution that what you see in the in the mythology that's related to revolution if you look at the the the cosmogony right you once you create this revolution you're then you're always in danger of being revolted against right that's the problem it's like you know the the aristocracy think we'll just kill the king we'll just get rid of the king and then we'll rule but then you know once they've done that then the business people come for them and then there's this kind of devolving of revolutions and it seems like one of the things that we fantasized about in our fiction for a hundred years now is the idea that the things that we make right the things that are below us the things that serve us would ultimately come up and take power from us and we can understand that with terror like in the terminator or the matrix and all of that but that terror also hides a kind of fantasy of what is possible and so i wonder if there isn't something of a mode of thinking that we're in that makes not only it possible but makes it almost inevitable that we're moving towards a place where we will be we we we almost dream of being taken over by the things that we create because we believe that we believe in that pattern of being you could say yes that is this is this is going to be difficult for us to to wrestle with because look for the for the past several cycles of major innovation with regard to communications technologies i'm talking about the the print era the electric era just sort of borrowing from marshan mlan you know you have these kinds of of of revolutions or what appear to be revolutions where the fundamental way in which we communicate and in which our our our faculties and our senses are extended jumps jumps forward in a certain sense the the west did pretty well all things considered and not specifically the the west but really the the anglosphere europe didn't do so hot when when electricity arrived the united states did very well it's sort of interesting to to ponder you know why in the us it was sort of like productivity flourishing and in europe it was like wave after wave of slaughter something to think about but the anglosphere did really well and i think the the way that the legacy of of puritanism in the us and similar trends in in the uk and eventually in the commonwealth really culturally favored a kind of authority of the book the authority of of the scholar the authority of of of critical reasoning of of of critical thinking that whole basket of practices and social institutions that grew up in the wake of the printing press and radio and television yes you know there there there were some reasons to be concerned about propaganda and whatnot but really in in the anglophone west there was a lot of trust and a lot of legitimacy and a lot of authority coming out of those kinds of practices and i think that drew the the protestant english-speaking world and the the jewish world closer together they shared a lot of that kind of cultural competency and you know and a lot of ambition and productivity flowed through those channels and so as i you know as i hinted a little bit earlier that civilization created the internet created the computer created digital technology and really thought that like well you know we're we're on a pretty good streak here so surely this is just going to be an incremental linear progressive advance toward our goals and you know maybe it took a crazy catholic canadian like marshall mcl to throw a spanner in the works but you know when he was laying out his theory of of media causes and effects he said whoa you know it's not that simple it's not just like oh you know we added more technology so we're going to get closer to the intended outcome these these media can have profoundly different effects they they're not they don't just have effects where they enhance what's going on and they don't just have effects where they obsolesce certain things in their path they also have retrieval effects and so you know what that means to make a long story short is that when you have a a a sweeping transformation in the the controlling or dominant mode of communications technology suddenly things that that had been pushed way into the background considered to be obsolete might suddenly come roaring back and what's come back to the for as a result of of digital technology i think are these kinds of deep-seated theological questions that suddenly the traditional class of authoritative scholars and experts and culture makers in the west are struggling to answer you can get up there and say well you know we're going to we're going to use facts and logic or we're going to use tradition or we're going to stand up for our values or we're going to if we get the principles right if we get the words right then we're going to get the governance right and that whole like that whole movement served us quite well under previous technological conditions but now all of a sudden technology comes along and says well actually no nature can't stand up for itself it can't justify itself in the face of technology tradition can't justify itself in the face of technology cons conservatism can't justify itself in the face of technology it needs some kind of support or it needs some other source of authority in order to somehow rise to a more authoritative level a more spiritual level than than than digital technology itself which is being driven at this point in a very forcefully spiritual direction by the people who are who are worshiping tech technique in its own right so this is a big challenge for for the west and it's going to take a little a little bit of i think humility and a little bit of willingness to step in a in a in an uncomfortable or or or unanticipated direction in order for for westerners and and people in the the english- speaking world not to kind of go down with the ship of like of of of of the authority of the the best talkers i mean here we are you know trying to be like pretty good talkers talkers worth worth watching and that's important but you know i log on every day and i just watch these guys just like talking until they're blew in the face trying to mount these sophisticated intellectual arguments as to why there should be some sort of you know not just surrender everything in life to technology and and it's it's not really working and so i think you know bringing a focus to that that problem set and being willing to kind of change our approach a little bit could bring i think some some large and and really very badly needed gains so one intermediary question but i want to get back to what you're saying now because i i don't want to lose the thread from before too much is what do you see the role of some of the global institutions because obviously one of the things we're seeing is is you know what justin trudeau is saying we're a post national nation and moving towards the un you know the wf these these international institutions as a possible solution to the the problems that are that are brought about by the internationalism of technology itself right it's like we we have this issue we live in nations but now we have these technologies that connect us all over the globe so i don't know if how how you see the role of these types of institutions in that question well i think it's clear that we're going to need some some new institutional frameworks i mean the the world economic forum some people see this as like the this is it guys this is the key to all the malevolence in the world where would that it were so simple we should expect to see you know evil or malevolent people at all levels of society throughout all time so it wouldn't be that shocking if there were some of those guys up in the the upper echelons of the world economic forum or or institutions that we don't even know the name of you know people who we don't who are not household names people who are not you can't put them on a bumper sticker oh claus schwab bad you know well he seems to be pretty bad but there are others and we don't even know who they are and it's it's natural i think to see people responding to the way that technology is eating the world and to the inability of those kinds of consensus institutions familiar to us over the west's many successful centuries the inability of those things to to to stop or redirect technology in the face of that kind of trend yeah if you're if you're just a a a kind of you know middle the pack nation state you're going to people are going to raise fundamental questions well what is canada why should there even be a canada what does it even mean at this point and a lot of the answers are are boiling down right now to well enough of all that you know that's that's just a past filled with injustice we need to to purify rectify the law and and absorb ourselves into this really just kind of a bor you know like a big cyber regime into which everything can fit because it's really kind of like a virtual world and it's intended to be infinite in size and something that you can you can pile everyone and everything into you know i i'm an alexis toille guy i was a a toille scholar at georgetown when i was doing my phd wrote my first book on teville and it's been it's been interesting to me to say the least to see how how many uh french theorists just over the past 25 years really seem to understand what was unfolding with regard to technology in a particularly insightful way i'm thinking about you know not just rard but but paul vilo john bard like it's you know you can go back there and read them and sort of like it's it'll blow your wig back a little bit yeah no i totally agree i was reading vilio in the 90s and and he was part of i mean he he was part of the my change in perspective and kind of re-understanding heiger in in terms of what was happening and and also seeing just just moving away from this kind of weird rationalistic way of thinking and and and seeing that that the way that heiger presents dasign and the idea of care really i mean form my thinking and this is what reo his work is i me for those who don't know who realo is his work was on speed and scale quite a bit right the problem that acceleration beyond human normal human interaction is actually affecting our entire worldview and the idea of these gigantic skyscraper buildings that you walk through that completely you know aisc the sense of human scale are part of are images of the type of despair that come about with with modern technology and this disconnection that we that we feel but so how do you say i mean i'm curious to to know how how you see this like so you know the one of the one of the solutions like that some people present is basically like go live in the wood like like break off you know you have this with it same pisos you know he he he said like don't worry my little children you know you just have to go live in the woods like if things get too crazy in terms of the it's kind of technate you just have to break off and i know some people that have been willing to do that but there's also a sense in which this this this thing that's getting set up right this this kind of interconnected technological world is also the battleground you know for the future and so i i'm not sure i don't know what you think like in terms of how you see you know actual implementing solutions you know at different levels like in our lives in the lives of our communities in order to be able to you know i don't know what you think but like integrate technology to the right extent or or you know let's say protect ourselves from the worst aspects of it sure you know far be it for me to say st pus was wrong certainly you know listen listen to your saints they are not wrong of course everyone can't go live in the woods or else it you know kind of stops functioning as the woods or or the desert or or what have you become another town yeah yeah it becomes another town but it is interesting that you know those those desert fathers who did who did isolate themselves in the most radical of ways you know in spite of that fact or perhaps because of it they they nevertheless attracted followers and in some cases those those followers led to the creation of monasteries that are still here and i think that that kind of mysterious way in which radical self-isolation at least from your your fellow men can lead to creating these kinds of oases of of civilization of of spirit spiritual energy and spiritual strength you know that is i think going to be a powerful part of the equation and i think remembering the way that monasteries preserved wisdom and faith in the wake of the collapse of the western roman empire by reordering the application of the most powerful communications technology script scribal scribal technology you know there is a metaphor there or a model for for what kind of monastic life can help us understand how to shape and guide technology digital technology that's something i think a lot about but look i think you know i i think it is it is important for people to to admit that if we all just try to irish exit from the problems of our civilization many will die and many will will descend into abject misery and that decline which we're seeing everywhere now is going to fuel the longing and the desire for a purely technological solution for the you know chip me daddy take the pain away why should we bother being human at all it only brings misfortunes yeah the the priests say that we need spiritual disciplines in order to to endure but that stuff's really hard i don't think i can do it i'm a broken person i'm lazy i want shortcuts i want fun you know all the excuses and all the reasons and so it will be worth our while i think for at least some of us to focus on on on doing our best to bring to the attention of people spiritual solutions or at least spiritual practices that will be able to stand in the face of technology and say no there is a higher authority and this is how it can be operationalized in your life right now you know the kingdom of heaven is at hand you you can right now adopt spiritual practices that will allow you to take you know what will feel like an almost superhuman kind of control over your passions your dreams your senses your desires all of these things that make technology seem so tempting and alluring and and so so much of a an ultimate experience that those kinds of practices you know this goes back to the ancient church you know to the the desert fathers the the the greeks refer to it as kind of spiritual athleticism spiritual heroism this is a a more challenging and uncomfortable path i think for a lot of westerners than what so many of us have become accustomed to which is well you know just get the principles right just get the laws right writes down people will just kind of do what do what it says and because the laws will be rectified or pure the people will be pure you know we can if we get the laws right we'll avoid misfortunes people can kind of do what they want and and everything will be fine well you know in some respects that was kind of just the the way things shook out before digital came along in many instances but now it's not really that way and now you have code and code presents itself very convincingly as sort of the ultimate form of law a law that is perfect and pure because it doesn't have the human element in it at all it's you know it's just it's just the math you know it's like you remember the the people who supported andrew yang's campaign going around just holding up the science said math as if that this is the answer you guys all we just need is more math more statistics and we know we'd solve all the problems right yeah so you know in the us it's challenging because we do have a constitution it is still at least technically in force and we're not supposed to we're not supposed to resort to theocracy theocracy there used to be a lot of a lot of jabber about theocracy during the george w bush administration oh these these mayberry melians are going to create this sort of evangelical police state and you know of course it it didn't really go down that way for for various reasons but if you go back to the puritans you know the puritans were were small r republicans they didn't like monarchy but they had you know they they did kind of invent a kind of american theocracy where where the institutions of education became the way that this kind of strict spiritual instruction could be infused into a society that was not monarchical that was not aristocratic and i think that pattern even though it's shed a lot of the the explicitly christian content and has really abandoned the the church and the sacraments and and saints and bishops and and all the over the years you look at what's going on with wokeness and it's really the same playbook you know it is look we're going to use strict spiritual instruction to make sure that the elite is is able to go into the institutions and purify the law and and that's that's what we're experiencing right now so we need to to offer an alternative to that and an alternative that that works for america works with the constitution and that's going to be a certain amount of permissiveness legally with regard to the development of technology this might sound strange coming from someone like me who's talking about like how how badly technology is working out right now and how it's its trajectory of development is is undermining our very humanity and what a disaster that is and that's true but i think it only goes to show that if you try to rely on the law technology will roll you every time and so you got to be a little bit more more permissive especially in the us when it comes to the legal framework you got to make sure that ordinary americans can use and access these fundamental technologies in the same way that they have constitutionally protected right to bear arms and a right to free association they need to be able to use these powerful technologies in order to strengthen our form of government strengthen our way of life strengthen our humanity and so it becomes all the more important that the the back stop or the controlling mechanism that does shape and guide technological development in a in a more restraining way is not going to come from the law not going to come from the the government it's going to come from spiritual bodies and when you look at the size and the scope the speed and the scale of this digital swarm you know we've got basically innumerable invisible instantaneously uh inter communic entities here the only i think the only body that is capable of of establishing a spiritual authority over that that global swarm is the body of christ is the church and and that's you know that's going to be something that i think americans are are going to have to kind of learn to to to look at the situation a little bit differently in order for that to to really sink in but that seems to me to be to be not just the be best path but really you know for us the only path yeah yeah and i think that you know it's important for people to understand what you're saying especially because it might at the outset for some seem like a contradiction because you're saying on the one hand we have to be permissive but we need the body of christ to rule and i think what's important to understand is that authority true authority does not manifest itself through just laws manifests itself through transformation of you know worldview transformation of will transformation of perspective that is true authority right if i if i can get my children to understand what we're doing and to love what we're doing and to feel like they belong in the family then i don't need a million rules on how to live in in their house like i don't need to tell them every single little thing they need to do because it comes from something deeper and the type of authority that the church can can procure is exactly that it's a type of spiritual discipline that can bring people into right perspective regarding technology it's like if if you right now this like a good example would be like right now if you you could try to pass rules to control pornography but like good luck my friend like it just seems like that's an impossible thing for it to happen but what is possible is for young men to go to confession and to you know to enter into a spiritual practice that will help them focus their attention on what's important and in the end that the people that do that they will come out winners in the end that is that they will take civilization with them because the rest will you can't you cannot you can you cannot have indefinite porn addicted civilization like that that means how can i say this it literally means no children like at some point it literally means lack of lack of reproduction and so and so i think i think your your vision is the right one it's a difficult one because it's not a quick solution it's not an easy solution it's actually the hardest solution to propose and it's one also that cannot be it's kind of like saying you know you know what what do you need to do become a saint like that's what what what do i have to do it's like what should i do with this like well just become a saint you know and if you do that then you'll have you know as christ says you'll have birds landing in your branches like the the the world world will lay itself out properly around people that that that are that are aligned properly but it's a big challenge to to to propose people yeah well it it is a big challenge but we also have to remember you know god can move immediately and you know and and christ himself did not shy away from from underscoring that that if you you know if if you open the door it'll come in if you ask it shall be given to you and and so on the one hand yes patience is is a divine virtue and humility is a divine virtue and these things tend to slow us down and tend to take away from us the shortcuts and the substitutes that we are always so inclined to chase after being the the mortal and impatient creatures that in this fallen world we are but that does not mean that we have to kind of give up on the idea that nothing can move faster than our own invisible robots that's just not the case and so you know theologically it is it is going to require a little bit more of sort of stretching old muscles than i think a lot of americans are are accustomed to but i it's easy to beat up on the wokies but if you look at what the wokes are trying to do and you you try to take seriously or generously what it is that they're trying to do they look at worship of technology and they say well that's not right we should really just be worshiping justice you know peeling off one one part of god's uh attributes and turning that into a god not a good idea but justice is good right we like justice we should have justice we don't want injustice and and what we see you know we can see in the the the paradox that they're wrestling with which is okay well if if technology is going to eat everything unless we put the right justice worshippers in charge okay so then we have this layer of of of woke virtue on top of technology and that'll be the thing that controls it and that'll be the thing to make sure that te technology doesn't you know kill us all or just perpetuate injustice forever okay great so well then how do you do that what is the new governance what is the woke governance mechanism that is going to save us from the very worst of technology well the answer turns out to be and we just see this every day and what the b administration is rolling out as far as tech regulations goes a woke supercomputer you know okay well we need this kind of this this supercomputer that can understand better than any human being every time there's some kind of act of injustice any microaggression any micro justice we need you know it's impossible for human beings to really properly understand in a divine way who deserves what at every given time and what ought to be taken from whom and given to someone else you know this is clearly a math problem that only a supercomputer can solve and so the solution is for us to to catechize that supercomputer into wokeness so that it internalizes the woke religion and and pursues perfect justice you you know writing the law into everyone's heart really you can see how this can be just sort of lifted out of of christian patterns and categories of thought turned into something else and sure enough that's what they're offering you know a social justice social credit system where the the feds know every time a dollar leaves your pocket and goes somewhere else knows you know what memes you've posted today if how much hate is in your memes you might go to jail you know really just penetrating down into the the most intimate lev of human interaction and human conscience possible and so what we see is that worship of justice ends up just getting folded back into the worship of technology well where we can't have perfect justice unless we perfect the technology and they get kind of stuck in this vapor lock or this loop you know where where they're really just chasing their tail and so worship of justice isn't going to work as an antidote or a restrainer when it comes to technology and the worship of technology ology we got to go we got to go all the way up we got to go to to the worship of god and not just the worship of god as a distant lord who you know maybe some miracles happened a long time ago but that era is over basically all we can do now is understand god's laws i mean that's that's some people's answer and and again that worked okay until basically the smartphone became a commodity now it doesn't work like it used to we have to worship god the father who us and created us out of love you know these things become essential when technology is eating everything else up because the our creation by a god who loves us gives us a degree and a type of spiritual authority that there is no technological substitute for there can't be a technological substitute for people can pretend people can act that way but you look at what actually happens to them in their lives and it's it's it's a tragedy it's hor come on james the ai can love you you don't you you're just you got it all wrong the ai loves you yeah it can it can simulate love and this is why these things are so dangerous and powerful is is because you know yeah they can take jobs or whatever but really you know they're automated simul simulators they're not really artificial intelligence they're they're automated simulators they can simulate love they can simulate a boyfriend or girlfriend they can simulate you know they can almost simulate a human soul it's very powerful stuff and that illusion is so strong that people begin to think that like well you know if the simulation is guaranteed but the reality is going to take some work and you know no promises you might end up still being sad a lot of them are in a sufficiently weakened spiritual condition where they're going to opt for the simulation and and if we're gna if we're going to offer them something that is not just better because it's a it's a traditional practice it's not just better because well it makes you feel better it's not just better because you know it's your elders told you that it was better but it's better because you can actually experience it directly even just starting out with a very little bit you know and and growing your spiritual strength and your your your spiritual athleticism through those kinds of aesthetic practices you really can start feeling it almost right away and that that's not to say that you should be going after an ecstatic experience but i mean look it's you know even just triumphing over something that you know is like a persistent sin in your life even triumphing over it for one day or even on one occasion you know not going to that website that you know is a good for you you know like not spending three hours sort of scrolling social media over and over again cycling through the same four halfes the feeling of spiritual strength that you get from just like triumphing over that sin with god's help through god's power and love is a is a real experience it can be an immediate experience and and it can it can show you that it what seems like an insurmountable task you can really approach it one little step at a time and and actually get real results in your life that start radiating through the rest of your life that stuff is powerful and and it is pretty basic but but it it feels out of reach for many people and the only way that they can that they can really believe and and experience otherwise i think is through example it's you can talk about it a lot and that's fine but if if they don't see their fellow human beings actually doing this stuff in their real life it's all going to feel very abstract so you know yeah go into the woods go into the desert but we also got to go into the market marketplace you got to go into society we got to mix it up with our fellow human beings and show them and participate that's how the holy spirit moves through us and and if we choke that off we're gonna you know it's not going to be a surprise what happens yeah yeah so you're so you're american and we talked about you know the let's say the tradition of america you mentioned how you can see how different nations different groups are going back to their to their you know their original revelation or they're going back to to the religion of their people in order to build some have some kind of bull workk against the oncoming ai whatever is hap is gonna happen and but but my understanding that now you're an orthodox kakum and so i'm curious to know in america that's not the most obvious path and i mean obviously i'm orthodox so i i have my own reason why i took that direction so maybe you can formulate a little bit why you're going in that direction considering you also it's important for you to be an american and at the same time yeah well you know i'm half greek on my father's side so there's a little context there and ultimately you know this this kind of of move is one that takes place in in each person's heart for reasons that can never really be captured i you know not in in a book or in a blog post or or on a podcast and so you know what am i i'm about to say i think you know will hopefully be understood in in that context i think what we've seen in in the us since the the the triumph of digital technology and and the creation of this kind of machine hegemony that is fundamentally different from you know well it's one group of people dominating another no this is this is this is a a new form of rule it is is something that americans and america thought you know we controlled this we created it we're in charge well that just looks to not be the case anymore and i think that's very difficult for americans to wrestle with in terms of their identity in terms of their spirituality coming out of you know centuries of judea christian civilization really just proving itself to be superior to to you know marxism or whatever kind of other major uh attempt ideologically to to chart the way forward for human beings and now you know gosh you know you look at israel and i've talked to to guys on the ground there and you've got different strains of of judaism but really no coherent or unified theological answer to what's going on with technology you look at at christianity in the us you know once again no coherent unified answer to what's going on technologically i think that's that's astonishing really and i think that it's it's indicative of of the way in which digital technology has really taken the the power and the efficacy out of these cultural and social institutions in the kind of judeo-christian tradition that used to serve us so well conservatism traditionalism a certain kind of you know uh almost almost worship of the you know if we just read the right books then then we'll understand how to order society properly that that that had a really great run and there's no question that you know when when that civilization went up against up against international communism or went up against you know the nazi occultism it was victorious and it was victorious in in large measure because it had a kind of spiritual authority that seemed sufficient to to contain and to rightly wield the most powerful of technological weapons you know you you got a bunch of jews and gentiles together for the manhattan project you created something that could destroy all human life and because we had a certain kind of spiritual authority that was operative and effective we didn't destroy all human life you know we we set a couple of these things these things off was obviously very nightmarish but sure enough the war did end and and there was a hugely productive period of you know tenuous but real peace and and flourishing for for the peoples of the west do we have a spiritual authority in place today sufficient to assure us that we can use our most powerful technologies responsibly and for the the benefit of our form of government and our way of life and our humanity i think right now the answer is we don't really see it right now we see guys like you know sam alman and and ilia and the rest of these open ai guys running around we see a lot of jews and gentiles sort of abandoning their you know the religion of their forefathers in favor of the the tech religion or the the woke religion worshiping tech worshiping justice maybe trying to worship both this is a huge problem and you look for kind of theological answers and it's like well gosh you know if we go back to the puritans in a sense if this is what brought us here you know it doesn't really doesn't really seem plausible that going back there is is going to unearth something that we hadn't found before that's going to provide us the key to reestablishing a kind of spiritual authority over technology you know the puritanism couldn't even keep itself going for more than a couple generations and why is that well you know it took out a lot of supports from the ancient church your town hall was your church you know no no icons no statues no incense the sacraments got filed down to just one or two and within a couple generations you went from jonathan edwards to ralph waldo emerson you know you went you got to whitman transcendentalism onita unitarian universalism the the the the bottom dropped out and i think that's because you know at its roote puritanism was a kind of spiritually progressive creed and it was in a sense concerned to to transcend itself in the quest for this kind of of of purity a purity of rules a purity of law a purity of instructions i think that is in in large measure what brought us to this kind of reckoning or this crossroads that we're at to this question mark about what's going to provide spiritual authority sufficient to contain and control technology so that we can wield these weapons well for our for our defense not for for the sake of destroying ourselves and so if the solution isn't really going to be especially in the us isn't going to be a juridical one it's not going to be about about encoding you know the pentat into the criminal code like the puritans did or whatever or whatever woke you know cognate of that might be i think it's really going to be something that takes place in the heart and is really going to be something that does involve uh rediscovering and reclaiming the the spiritual life of of aesthetic discipline that was so core to the ancient church and you know no no church is of course perfect in all of its doings but i think a lot of what we need most now in order to reestablish spiritual authority over technology has been preserved in important ways by the orthodox church as a whole and i think there's just a a spiritual thirst spiritual hunger for for those kinds of resources right now and that tradition has i think you know has has been neglected too too much in the us too much in the west and neglected for for reasons that you know might have seen seemed pretty compelling in in centuries past but right now we need that and and to and to turn up our nose at it or to say well that's you know that's not really my tradition and that seems a little weird or you know isn't vladimir putin a bad guy or you know aren't the greeks weird like well yes you know so the greeks are sort of weird but that's that's not a good enough reason you know so i think these resources are really important right now and i think that that those who who take a taste who come and see are are moved and are are touched by discovering that they can access those resources and yeah it's going to be uncomfortable yeah it's going to take time but you know lots of people are going to the gym now and they're experiencing these sorts of things physically where it's like oh yeah i realize that if i just kind of put the work in every day and i'm willing to sort of suffer in order to like you know have a have a change my life you know in a way that's going to be more healthy and is going to free me from my dependency on the virtual world well yes you know what if i told you you can do that spiritually as well as as well as physically i think a lot of people are hungry for that and i think i think you know as as christ says he's standing at the door knocking and you know you gotta let him in yeah all right so i'm going to ask you the the last question what would that look like like what i know it's to predict the future but you know what do how do you see what would a world in which there is a spiritual authority which is helping us integrate technology appropriately what do you see that looking like or do you have a vision of that at all sure you know sometimes i will i will speak of the bitcoin monasteries which a little little catchphrase in in in some of my circles you know when i when i first started talking about this stuff a couple years ago when it became clear to me that you know political theory would probably deserve to die along with the rest of the academic disciplines if it couldn't really talk about what's going on with technology you know a lot of people were like i james you know i don't really understand what you're saying and and now a couple years later mostly what i get is james i i don't really understand bitcoin so it's progress that's good bitcoin you know it's a world computer i mean uh vidic ethereum inventor described ethereum as as a world computer what's elon musk doing with with twitter turning into x you know the app for everything he's trying to build a world computer this is the game this is the biggest game in town right now and it's not surprising that it is and and the question is well you know if if there's going to be a world computer and and i don't think you know i don't think the ai safety iss have it right either where it's like oh well just call in the air strikes blow up the servers you know we got to bomb ourselves back to safety i don't think we can we can bomb for safety like that and i think that that's just a huge you know a huge s shortcut a huge act of what the the hippie call spiritual bypassing you know you don't you don't need to do that and you don't want to do that what you can do though is you can gathered together people with great spiritual discipline great spiritual authority people who have who have proven through their work that they can be trusted spiritual guides spiritual advisers people who are willing and able to to to endure in the labor of praying for the salvation of the world every day you know what happens when you provide those people with the opportunity to demonstrate the fruit frs of using technology in a in a uh productively restrained kind of way channeling the energy of technology in a way that is good for us body mind and soul i think that's an interesting question i think it's an important question and i think it's one that that we ought to start answering this is something that has happened throughout history you know whether you think of you know those those those monks in the scriptorium in western europe or you think of you know the byzantines with greek fire or whatever or you know or you think about peak judeo-christian civilization which was able to build a weapon capable of destroying the world and yet didn't destroy the world used used that in a ultimately in a defensive way and a protective way we can and should do that with fundamental digital technologies and the kind of spiritual authority that is going to enable us to do that isn't just going to be a copy paste of what of what came before it's going to be something that i think you know orthodoxy has a great deal to teach people and i think you know it does orthodoxy also does have you know even though it's right now a very small footprint in the us sometimes small is good sometimes small can be very effective sometimes in the same way that sometimes silence is better than just running your mouth about something and demonstrating living out experiencing is more important than explaining getting something like bitcoin which the technology's developed it's mature enough ordinary people can use it might be a little uncomfortable they might have questions but it's there it's ready to be used you can pick this thing up you can wield it as a weapon a defensive weapon one that protects and strengthens us gives us the opportunity to exchange goods and services build algorithmic markets do cool and and productive things that are good and helpful for us rather than having to you know to bow and scrap before the borg in order to you know to to get some groceries delivered to your door or to buy a book on the internet you don't have to do that and so marrying that fundamental technology with real spiritual authority is going to i think uh demonstrate how in america we can still be a very energetic and productive culture where the goods and services flow freely and and people with initiative will will find ways to to plow that to to plow that that that insight and that thoughtfulness into their work and have it bear fruit it can be done and if if if those with spiritual authority tested and and trusted do not put their hands on on the world computer and and restrain it and channel it properly then others will whether it's the chinese or the israelis or the european i mean there there are a lot of people scrambling to figure out exactly how to do this a lot of those ai companies you know let's face it they're not particular particularly american in any in any deep and abiding sense so you know if if if if this incredibly powerful and foundational technology is not taken up by those of sufficient spiritual strength to wield it well than others will and that's a future that i i just assume not put us through all right well i think that's a great place to to end our first conversation james thanks for your side to definitely be thinking about that you know i the bitcoin monastery thing you know it's like i i have my doubts about it in terms of system i'm not sure i'd have i i still have to think about it people have seen me talk about crypto and my issues with it but i think it is a good place to stop have people think about about the different ideas we propos here and maybe organize another discussion at some point that'd be great anytime thanks so much all right thanks james good to talk to you
