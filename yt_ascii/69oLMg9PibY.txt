hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by hyundai we are talking about whether front wheel drive cards can make for good sports cars and i think this is a great example one of the best modern examples that illustrates yes they absolutely can so we're going to be talking about you know what does make for a good sports car ultimately something that has a purpose for you know driving enjoyment it exists to be enjoyable to drive and there's a level of performance associated with it you know handling performance and just overall has that joy to drive and so i want to talk about kind of the challenges associated with front wheel drive and why it is challenging to make a good front-wheel drive sports car but also you know how it can be done in some of the engineering solutions in vehicles like this veloster n that make that possible so perhaps the biggest challenge for a front-wheel drive vehicle is acceleration because what happens when you start accelerating is you transfer load from the front of the vehicle to the back of the vehicle and of course only those front tires are what you can accelerate with and so as you increase your acceleration you remove load from the wheels that are actually doing the accelerating so you can accelerate less and so you'll often hear for example that 5050 is like the ideal weight balance for a vehicle but for a front-wheel drive vehicle that can be a challenge because that means once you start accelerating most of your weight is on the back and thus you're not going to have good acceleration numbers so actually having that engine up front having that front front layout is helpful for front wheel drive vehicles when the engine is up there because you have that weight over them and thus you can accelerate better with more of the weight front centered and so for example this veloster n is capable of accelerating at 0.6 gs which is a very good number for a front-wheel drive vehicle now the other big challenge with front wheel drive is of course that the front tires are doing almost all of the work so it's of course responsible for your steering it's the only axle with steering in this case and so it has to do all the turning for the vehicle it also has to do the accelerating for the vehicle as its front wheel drive and you know of course during braking most of the weight is on that front axle so in all you know forms of performance accelerating braking cornering that front axle is extremely important and so it's doing all the work and putting all that work onto one axle can be challenging so one of the ways to alleviate that challenge is by using a limited slip differential and in this case hyundai uses an electronic limited slip differential so as you're accelerating out of a corner if you're cornering well you have load transfer to the outside tire so that tire has more of the load on it and thus can use more of that grip to accelerate so if you were to have an open differential well you can only split your torque evenly between the front axles so if you're cornering really hard then you're limited how much torque you can put down by that inside tire which doesn't have that much load on it and thus doesn't allow you to accelerate very hard so when you start to lock up and force both tires to rotate at a similar speed well that allows you to transfer torque to the outside tire and thus put down more acceleration now in the case of an electronic limited slip differential what that means is you can choose how much you want that lock up to be so you can allow for more torque transfer depending on the scenario to that outside wheel or you can allow for less of it if you want it to have you know a bit more rotation difference between the two wheels ultimately though what it means by having that electronic limited slip differential is coming out of a hard corner you can actually accelerate faster just by using the differential and it's like your grip hasn't really changed you have the same tires same setup but because you're forcing more of the acceleration to go to the tire that has the load on it you actually get to accelerate better with it so it's a very clever solution and using the electronic style where you can differ how much lockup you have between the two wheels means you can have the different modes you know sport mode normal mode eco mode and mode where you vary how much actually you lock up between the two wheels now another unique challenge to front wheel drive vehicles is torque steer so torque steer is where when you press your foot down on the throttle pedal you actually turn that forces the steering wheel to turn the car actually wants to maneuver just from the torque going to the wheels and of course with a rear wheel drive vehicle you would never have that because the rear wheels don't actually steer for you so it's a unique problem for front wheel drive vehicles and hyundai actually believes a little bit is a good thing so they actually allow for it to happen because they consider this to be part of a feedback you know between the throttle and the driver it's kind of giving you information so as long as you can maintain that steering response and still have that you know feedback in the steering wheel they want you to still be able to feel you know a little bit of that torque steer a little bit of that power coming through the steering now personally i don't feel it all that much when i put my foot down so i think they've done a pretty good job of eliminating it but they say that they do want to allow for a little bit of it in order for there to be that feedback to the driver now another important part of a sports car is having response you want things to happen when you ask for them not have this delay and so whether that's the throttle or the steering or the brakes you want that response and one of the clever things they've done with the brakes is if you're on the accelerator pedal hard and then you release they immediately pre-fill the brakes so that the second you tap on that brake pedal you have good brake pressure there's no delay in waiting for it to start filling because it pre-fills that cylinder now another challenge to sports cars really all cars but particularly sports cars is cost i mean you have to pay for performance right and personally i get more excited by these vehicles that are much more attainable than the you know further end of the spectrum where you're into supercars and hyper cars where you know for most people it's not actually an attainable vehicle versus this is you know a much more attainable price tag and going with a front engine front wheel drive layout also simply helps with cost i mean there's less components overall versus rear wheel drive or all-wheel drive and you can help on cost by having just front-wheel drive front engine and i think you know making a car that's enjoyable to drive for the mass market rather than you know this tiny market that can afford you know exotic materials and and all the extraordinary engineering that goes into you know these super high-end performance cars something that's genuinely fun for everybody to drive i think is a way cooler achievement because it's difficult to do it is a huge engineering challenge to make something very fun on a smaller budget and that's something i respect so much about this vehicle because i feel like they've done it really well i mean it's an affordable price tag and yet they've packed in all kinds of cool features with this thing you know electronic adjustable damping electronic adjustable limited slip differential you know turbo charge you've got good power and so you know it's got a nice power to weight ratio the vehicle overall about 3 100 pounds so you get good acceleration from it and yet all within this affordable price package and i think that's fantastic i think that's a much more respectable goal than just going after these huge ridiculous crazy numbers but you know most people won't actually be able to get in and have fun with now i think another interesting point about front wheel drive cars it's often overlooked is if you have the engine up front you know front wheel drive versus rear wheel drive in bad weather conditions you're able to extract more performance out of a front-wheel drive vehicle simply because you've got more weight over those driven wheels so whether it's rain or snow or whatever it is if you have more weight over your driven wheels you're able to extract more performance out of it you're able to accelerate more so you know sure in the snow your front wheel drive is going to be spinning those tires but that said you know front wheel drive versus rear wheel drive if the engine's up front and you're in a rear wheel drive vehicle well you have even less grip to put down because of that weight distribution so front wheel drive you know regardless of the condition it allows you to push it a bit more which is fun now none of this is to say that there's anything wrong with rear wheel drive rear wheel drive cars are fantastic and there is a joy associated with them but i think a lot of elements of driving don't actually relate to what are the driven wheels you know sound is certainly a part of it one of the cool things they've done with this is when you shift they have a way where they the ignition timing and so as a result you have that pressure build up in the exhaust and you get these nice crackles that come out of the exhaust you know when you let off the throttle and it has that ignition timing change so you have that combustion occur and it builds pressure within your exhaust and that can actually be useful as a sort of anti-lag measure to keep your turbo charger speeding up so you know the way that a vehicle sounds ultimately the amount of grip that a vehicle has it's not super dependent on the you know front wheel drive rear wheel drive all-wheel drive layout cornering grip is you know going to come much more from the suspension setup from the tires that are used that sort of thing rather than what are the driven wheels so how do the shifts feel what's the engine response like what's the aerodynamics of the vehicle these sorts of things aren't dependent on you know the drivetrain layout and overall what i think hyundai really nails with this vehicle is this sort of old-school fun driving feel where it has all these modern you know electronics and features and things but the driving experience itself is this very raw you know old school fun feeling it's not this super buttoned up super refined experience it's playful and it wants you to toss it around and that's what makes it fun and enjoyable to drive you know you've got good power you've got a good weight to it and you combine that with this playful nature and it makes it super fun my first car was actually a sporty little front wheel drive hatchback and i loved it you know you combine the low weight with decent power and you can have a ton of fun in these things and they pack it with you know the features it's got rev matching it's got those exhaust crackles it's got plenty of torque electronic limited slip differential overall the package is very fun and you know i love that vehicles like this in the affordable price range exist that gives you the option and whether it's front-wheel drive or wheel drive it's just an enjoyable experience so a big thank you to hyundai for sponsoring this video thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave
