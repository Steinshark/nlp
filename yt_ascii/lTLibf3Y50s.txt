ladies and gentlemen i would like to welcome you to one of the most fun chess events that exists you may know about it you may not because i don't think it happens every year just like all other world cups this is the chess world cup it is a knockout tournament featuring 128 players and then it becomes 64 in the next round and that's where i picked it up because the first round was qualifiers it's 64 players and the top two finishers the people that make it to the knockout stage at the very very end the final stage i should say qualify to the candidates tournament so getting into the finals of this tournament is a massive accomplishment it is such a massive accomplishment that even magnus carlson himself has never managed to do it magnus carlson has like three world cups and he has never won and i don't think he's come close i think at most he made a quarterfinal but i actually think he's been eliminated in the round of 16. this is the only tournament that magnus carlson has not won and mag is playing hikaru is playing fabiano caruana is playing all the top names are playing it is going to be a great time it's going to be a great month of chess i'm gonna i'm gonna show you five games today all of these games are great the last game of this video is going to absolutely blow your mind every game in this video is is a banger game there's incredible storylines and i'm also going to be yelling at chess.com because people from chess.com will watch this and hopefully they will change something so hikaru is playing a 25-65 rated grandmaster from india in the first round and actually karthik van katarman is so new to top level chess he doesn't have a photo on chess.com chess.com what are you doing get this man a photo he is the national champion of india he's gained 100 points in like eight months and he's like 24 years old so here we go hikaru starts with the white pieces plays e4 his opponent plays e5 and this is top level chess this is classical chess so the games are slow knight to f3 knight to c6 and we have a mainline spanish bishop a4 knight f6 all seen before now black could play the open spanish which is taking this or black can play the close spanish which is b5 you know bishop e7 or black can play b5 bishop c5 this is this is a this is called the neo archangels variation but basically putting the bishop outside of the pawn chain opens up various pinning possibilities the bishop frequently is getting hit with the center pawns but uh the bishop frequently will go back like this so we have d3 hikaru chooses one of the many setups against this the other setup is to play pawn to c3 and try to play this and this is like a technically it's called the neo arhanjilsk just call it the archangel archangel it's a it's a cool name d6 h6 right so black prevents white from playing bishop g5 and now castles and this is the position and and the structure of the spanish and the peace positioning of the spanish will determine the middle game so white will either try to expand on the in the center or on the queen side very rarely white will also try to expand with pawns on the king side but frequently white will try to create an attack on the king side with knight h4 the f5 square in these e4 e5 positions is very important and the bishop is going to play a more active role rather than the more traditional kind of close classical one on e7 so rook 2 e1 rook 2 e8 shikaru rotates the knight to the king side we already talked about this knight a5 he does not want to trade the bishop karthik takes some space in the center with c5 and now we see h3 and knight to h4 karthik is basically just doing what you're supposed to do he's taking as much central space as possible the bishop again traditionally is over there so this is kind of the interesting point maybe he will expand on this side of the board we're gonna see who's gonna push the pace king to h7 useful move taking a little bit of kind of control of the light squares maybe he's going to create an attack of his own hikaru plays knight to f5 and now karthik offers a trade of knights which is a very logical decision hikaru takes the knight knight queen takes another bishop goes to e3 and the bishop is basically arguing i am better than that bishop okay i am better than that bishop and white is going to try to maybe play d4 maybe play f4 maybe play queen f3 and bring the rook maybe still a4 b4 is a possibility king to g8 is played here by karthik which is a logical move now here i really like queen f3 a4 is another plan but hikaru plays f4 f4 is a very interesting decision it is yet another way forward all of those ways forward could have led to three or four other ways forward within those ways forward and now we are talking about the massive endless tree branch of chess and we do know that there are more possible chest positions than atoms in the universe so that that's kind of why right hikaru plays f4 now black can take which is not a great move accepting that white gets the f-file and also white gets a bit of the center this is nothing because of this this brick wall will march forward so black doesn't want to take but black doesn't have to take black can actually play rook b8 defending this and preparing this black can play queen c7 black can play d5 black can just advance on the queen side and black does in fact open up the center with the move d5 that is an insane move that is a cold-blooded move that is a sign of a young man who is confident in his chest he is completely unafraid of playing hikaru he blows up the center he takes d5 he takes f4 bishop takes he trades everything off and it looks like hikaru is in good shape here because he plays rookie a check and bishop to d6 and he is completely winning except for one move the reason why hikaru is winning here is because he has various threats if black plays bishop b7 then he is going to trade play d4 with a discovered attack and after pawn to g6 he's going to win a pawn and this is just a completely winning end game that is the major idea here with bishop to d6 is to play d4 the problem is blackchus does this first and even though hikaru has very active pieces and black has not even moved two pieces white is running straight into a brick wall white has a ferrari and there is a brick wall at the end of the road and he's going too fast all of this is moving forward as fast as possible but black plays c4 check and plays bishop c bishop b7 and hikaru has run into the brick wall now he has to trade the pieces pawn takes we've traded the pressure is still there the bishop goes back to f1 but now karthik brings his king he brings his bishop and he's just defending everything he is just a nightmare defensive presence hikaru gets into a rook and knight end game but it's just not good enough the rook took 39 moves this man played hikaru down a rook he did not use his rook for 39 moves do you understand how impressive that is he finally activates it and a couple moves later pawns are flying off the board knight takes pawn was played because if pawn takes he would have taken and then he would have taken on a3 so knight takes c3 is ridiculous and and and the idea was effectively if something like king f2 this is just a draw this is just a drawn end game because h4 and and you're not gonna win this so i mean this this kid basically this this 20 year old young man hikaru marches him down trying to beat him in a rook and knight end game a rook end game and it takes 60 moves but he defends exceptionally well and hikaru tries hikaru tries but he can't and ultimately it's a draw hikaru played this game at 99 accuracy and so did his opponent chess.com put some respect on his damn name and get him i want the next recap he better have a chess.com forward slash players karthik venkataraman better have a photo and you know what chess.com if he doesn't have a photo i'm just gonna assume because nobody has ever taken a photo of him ever so hikaru draws a young man from india 2565 he was 2470 just about a year ago and he i don't even think he was a grand master so incredible stuff can't cover a world cup without this man this is his fourth world cup and i will once again hammer home the fact that i've made so many videos i have made so many videos hyping up magnus carlson but this entire event i'm going to hype up the fact that he has never won this tournament so will this be his messy year will he win the world cup finally knight f3 he's playing levon panzulia who's a strong georgian grandmaster not like from atlanta i'm talking bilisi and georgia has a very strong chess culture and a lot of their players are actually very good blitz players like panzulia is is really good at blitz and rapid so is kuparadze they have a strong list of players this is the opening and black in this position is you know magnus is in one of these spots that he he played an offbeat opening he played this which is fine but nothing special and then here he he decided to play c5 he took like this and and this is going to be his way of creating an imbalance white doesn't have a d-pawn black doesn't have a b pawn right so rook d1 rook to d8 queen to d2 okay one more thing i should have probably pointed out in the introduction so a handful of people would have not even made it this far because they have bad attention spans but you are going to get rewarded the way you get knocked out of the world cup is you play a game with white in a game with black that's how it goes you play two classical chess games and if it's tied one to one because you either beat each other or there was two draws you play rapid so you play fast rapid blitz they make you punch each other in the face the last round of breaking the tie is just is just you you strip down you just wrestle just make just make you wrestle each other like in the mud not actually 98 well actually i don't know maybe they updated the rules bishop h6 knight c6 and pencilia trades off the dark squared bishops and now magnus basically has to win this position it's a completely dead equal position and you know magnus is the rating favorite of some 260 points 270 points so he has to win right this is his attempt place d5 accepting the fact that advancing in the center could cause him some problems e3 and now we have the following clarification this is now a set of isolated pawns for both players take take and now we trade the bishops let's rook two knights queen six pawns per side exactly the same pawn structure when i say exactly the same that is not an exaggeration c4 c5 these are on their home squares these are on their home squares and this and this and the kings are castle on the exact same side and the position according to the computer is very very very very slightly better for black why because he's going to try to remove the knight from the defense of the pawn on c4 so you're gonna play this consulia goes here so you can't take the knight with black because the rook takes and after this knight takes now the queen defends the knight position looks equal but this is the best move it is the only move to try to get an advantage literally the only way to try to get an advantage here is to attack this knight and to make it difficult for white to defend why because the knight cannot be guarded by the queen because you will go here right so knight f3 queen takes queen takes it's now a pure queen and night end game but magnus is winning a pawn and pansolia tries to check bait magnus but magnus wasn't born yesterday so he defends mate on slide plus h4 magnus kicks out his knight goes here and gets to take yet another pawn but punzelia plays pawn takes g6 and brings his queen back and magnus once again the only move to try to win this game giving up the h6 pawn completely because he wants to probably centralize his queen move his knight out of the way with something like you know first maybe something like this and push his c pawn we have queen b8 plus li goes for this pawn and the only way for magnus carlson to win this game with his pawn hanging and potentially having to retreat backwards and play defense he sacrifices his night and absolutely brutal lightning strike if the king tries to avoid taking the knight there's various checkmates like on f1 and if you take the idea is not to take this the idea is to play this that move prized the king away from the knight and it also splits white's pawns when you sacrifice the knight white now has a or cluster and he takes and that's it because in this position he is not going to take on e3 and win this end game he is going queen h1 and he is going to pry the king out of his castle by playing queen e4 marching forward he could have won with something like f5 but he does it this way queen c2 queen a4 and punsulia just doesn't even play on he doesn't even play on resigns in this position in magnus carlsen making it look easy was there a maid in this position i don't think so necessarily because something like king like he can't play f5 right away but if something like king g6 you can you can't take on c5 because there is f5 and then queen f1 and queen e4 is actually no no queen e4 is made queen f1 there is king e5 it's the sunglasses can't see anything queen e4 is mate so that was the idea magnus wins his first game with the black pieces making it look real smooth real real smooth and he gets a win but we got some massive story lines we have a new member of the top ten we have fabiano caruana playing one of the most disgusting preparation lines i've ever seen in my life and we have prague who for some reason his game got sped up some moves frog prog detonated a grenade in the playing hall today like the players had to evacuate after this game was played let's go oh chess.com please hello young player azerbaijan no one's ever taken a photo of this man or maybe nobody's uploaded a photo of this man can we please get a photo of all the players in the event that don't have a photo god bless e4 now one quick thing about kukash kukesh is the youngest player to hit 27.50 i think he broke the record 27.50 not 2700 but good cash is on pace to be the number one ranked indian player number one surpassing the record said by vishi anand there was one like day or a couple of days where vichy wasn't number one technically like hare krishna was number one it was in the middle of a tournament if i'm not mistaken some years ago but this is it if gukesh has a good world cup he will probably permanently overtake vichy anand the legend words cannot describe how important vichy is for chess in india and frankly for chess anywhere and this is the true passing of a torch so gukesh is playing a young player from azerbaijan we have the exact same opening as in the hikaru game but you will remember in the hikaru game the bishop went here so now we have a totally different right totally totally different opening there should be three castles d3 d6 also hikaru played like this a lot of the structures are actually very similar except like i said the bishop was there right so not to beat a beat a dead horse is that the saying what was it look knight c6 right and how does this position look just a couple of slight differences right the knight rotated over here h3 right and black out of bush one b6 played h6 didn't play it in this game h3 right a4 there's knight f1 so lucas plays for the a4 plan he does not play for knight g3 knight h4 knight f5 there you go black does play h6 i mean this position this position just looks incredibly similar right it's the incredible thing about the spanish takes takes and gukesh plays d4 so in the hikaru game he played knight h4 knight f5 f4 gukash plays a4 d4 just different things right they all lead to different walks of life pawn takes d4 pawn takes d4 pawn takes d4 knight takes d4 knight takes d4 queen takes d4 big trade leading us with this backwards pawn on d6 upon that has no neighbors in the square in front of it is kind of well controlled same pawns on the b file but the position is still equal because in this i mean the spanish is a very very resilient opening you cannot just get a slightest advantage against it and you know expect to win very quickly bishop to e6 bishop to f4 rook to c8 bishop queen here and now this right deflecting the queen a little bit queen comes back and gukesh is basically arguing this move doesn't help black and so if you try to undo the move i'm now going to target the pawn and if you go here thinking you're out of the woods now i'm gonna go knight g3 and then i'm gonna go here and just try to very slowly outplay you right black plays d5 black decides i'm locking in the bishop and if you play b3 i'm gonna take your knight so i'm gonna take your knight and i'm gonna be completely fine so d5 lukash plays e5 the knight comes in and the queen goes out to g4 so now bishop takes f1 opens up an attack on the bishop and that's exactly what happens and if you take that i'm gonna play i'm gonna play bishop takes e4 otherwise i'm i'm simply going to lose material right so takes d takes now i can take this but here i have something called the sweet shinsuke i can take on a h6 okay this is called an in-between move in between taking this right there is i'm creating a thread excuse me in between taking this i'm going to create a thread on that rookie five this is the position gukesh has to try to win four pawns each queen two rooks and it's like an extremely boring position rook d1 queen e8 he brings the bishop back the rook moves now the rook comes up maybe he's going this way maybe he's going to double maybe he's going to attack on the seventh rank black plays rook c5 to try to trade gukash brings back the rook does not want to rook trade now undevelops this queen hits the rook takes the file but he still doesn't really have much to play for he decides to go to the seventh rank right he's poking just decides to go to the eighth rank decides to go to the eighth rank maybe he's gonna he's gonna double up like this black plays king h7 and severely underestimates that plan black must have thought he was in serious trouble already but he actually wasn't he could have maybe for example played queen f6 hitting the rook and if white did something like this rook d8 rook d8 position looks good but rook d6 nice move and now you have to trade you could play rook f8 king f8 maybe bishop c5 and king e7 and i don't know you can you can try to apply some pressure from this position and maybe it'll work but the position doesn't look too too dire but rook c8 and and the way he does it like this where the king just jumps out of a window and then like throws everything out it just doesn't work and i mean gucci just brings all his heavy pieces down and it was a long grinding fight but he wins on move 41 because this bishop can't be defended if you take there's queen here and gukesh wins and is now just one rating point away from overtaking vichy anand as the number one ranked indian chess player and he will enter the top 10 in the world he's one rating point away if he wins one more game in this world cup he is officially the number one ranked player from india and he is' years of age i think 17. he's either 2005 or 2000 i think he's born in 2006. that's crazy that is he's 16 17 years of age that is and if you thought that was craig watch what fabiano caruana did in this game fabiano core one is playing mikhail i don't know how to pronounce his last name i'm not gonna i'm looking at it and i'm in sunglasses and even if i wasn't that would be tough is it is that how you would say that if there's a georgian watching do let me know something like that but it's mikhail and he's also one of these strong georgian players that's also very good at rapid and blitz in this game fabiano caruana showed how to permanently destroy the london system typical london white playing going for the pyramid and there is a line here this is a new modern line where white takes on d4 black takes white sorry black takes on d4 white takes back and then white wants to go here castle but black plays knight h5 black plays this very provocative night move breaking the principles of chess multiple moves in the opening with the same piece from night out on the edge and bishop here and then in this position normally historically people have been defending with g6 but fabiano plays the knight back to f6 and then he attacks the pawn on b2 and his next move is so stupid fabiano creates winning chances against the dry boring soul-sucking lazy london system by playing knight to g8 fabiano has a lot of fans okay his fans just watched him play knight f6 on move one knight to h5 six moves later knight back to f6 knight back to g8 he has played 11 moves and four of them are with the knight and the knight is on the home square and i got news for you he just moved it again this dude went here here here here here here in the opening this is like even a five on five basketball game one of your teammates was spinning in circles in the corner i mean i'm sure there's grand masters that think that's how basketball works they probably don't know much about anything else okay let alone how to tie their own shoes but the position is still equal sloppy has played five out of 12 of his first moves with the knight and it's standing on the edge of the board the idea is to play f6 and the idea is to fight for the light squares from a different angle and i got news for you after this trade that's exactly what he does and then he develops and a couple moves later we have castling that night is gonna get active but look in the meantime look at fabi securing c4 for his knight rerouting is light squared bishop to e8 playing b6 ugly doubled pawns that cannot make any forward progress but fabi defends them both treats them very well and covers any infiltration spots on the queen side was the bishop on f7 princess row 28 here comes that night that night moves five times in the first 12 moves and then one time in the next 12 moves bishop goes back to f8 bishop and now it's now it's gone now it's gone and the double pawns are here the double pawns are here this is an isolated upon the position looks absolutely stupid but fabi plays g5 plays bishop h5 gets in on the light squares his opponent tries to do this it doesn't do him any good bishop to eat look at this what a what a move bishop to e2 is when you are on top of a an opponent you are fighting and you put your hand on their face and just keep them there and there is nothing they can do white has a dark squared bishop and white has one two three four five six seven dark squared pawns this ain't no bishop this is a glorified pawn it's a pawn that grew too much all right and grew too much in with all right it needs to go to the gym the the bishop on f2 is the dumbest piece i have ever seen that bishop has no future and it it white black could even play g4 by the way and that bishop has no future puppy doesn't care he just takes like this where's the bishop going here and then what fabiano just puts his king on f7 and comes in with h5 fabi moved every single pawn he had in this game he moved every single piece he plays h4 takes on f4 bishop d3 his opponent just resigns he's just not even gonna play on in this position because what fabi is going to do is slowly infiltrate in this area his opponent did not make a single forward move on this side of the board the last forward move that was played in this game into fabi's position on the queen side was this oops was this he took his queen and then he literally and when i say literally i am not exaggerating not a single forward move was made into white's position on that side of the board this doesn't count because it was on white side black side of the board excuse me look at this black never crossed this line in fact i don't think i don't think he crossed the line at all he just never made it look at that he never made it out of his side of the position how is that possible white did not make a single move on his opponent's side of the board that is cr that is sick oh my god after his opponent played queen b6 for the next 26 moves there was not a single move played that challenged fabiano and if you're still here i told you they had to evacuate the playing hall after this game was played that's not an exaggeration maxime lagarde but from wish.com not sponsored i always crack up at how similar their names sound but maxime is is playing prague and prague is yet another very strong indian there was three indians featured in this video that's how you know the future of india is very bright bishop b5 and now we have 97 it's called the kozio this is one of the ways to play against the spanish it's not usually played because it's not considered very good like you could play the other lines this is considered slightly inaccurate but totally decent opening white plays d4 black takes takes takes takes kicks out the bishop and then offers an exchange of queens one of the ways to play here is to back up with the queen to d3 and then try to play f4 maybe try to castle black plays bishop e7 and now historically in this position white has needed the castle like basically every time white is needed the castle f4 is definitely a possibility but the problem with the move f4 is now you cannot castle because it's illegal you also cannot go here to hit the queen because queen b2 unless that's what white wants so black castles and now we have h4 right so legard is thinking a lot right f4 is not prep okay you could tell from his time spend on all of these different moves right even even on knight e7 he spent eight minutes right so that he was not expecting this he's trying to make things up kind of as he's going and then all of this he's down to 43 minutes down 22 minutes on the clock now the best way to strike when your opponent throws a punch at you is to duck and smash them straight in the mouth or the liver but but prague's not a fighter so instead of doing that he sees a pawn coming at him on the edge of the board and he strikes back in the center which is the most principled way to play because if you just play h5 now black strikes in the center right black hits the queen and forces a response out of white and white goes queen g3 white did not take because knight h4 is coming and i'm not really sure what you're doing here because after something like king f1 i'll play bishop f5 i'll bring both my rooks to the center and you're in serious trouble queen g3 is played the pawn has been sacrificed knight to h4 anyway and prague prague causes some problems here or should i say prague causes some problems here i will never speak again rook takes h4 those of you keenly watching i told you that the move f4 was dangerous because the king was weak yeah you can't castle but what if it wasn't even a matter of castling what if the queen walks into your territory now lagarde did not miss this okay he did not miss this what he missed was this move he missed e3 is brutal the idea of e3 is as follows queen f2 check take pawn takes and then bishop takes h4 so if white plays king e2 so that this is not a check i have this this bishop g4 sacrificing queen f2 king d3 and queen f1 foreign if you play something else if you like move the rook back to h2 then i will play bishop to c5 and you just can't move you don't have a move you play knight e4 trying to attack my bishop i play e2 and if you take i play rookie 8 and you're just gonna you're gonna die king g3 bishop f5 it's just game over queen d4 so rookie 8 is played in the game because in the game knight d1 is played here comes rookie 8 and he just never takes the rook i will remind you white took a knight black just never takes it please rookie eight it should be six i just rook d she doesn't white's got a king on e2 a queen on g3 a rook and h4 and four pieces that are just dead he even gets the pawn back but black's position is just too strong bishop to f5 queen f2 now he if queen takes this is mate check can't take because of pin can't go back or here because of the bishop can't move on to the d file because of the rook it's like sudoku yeah what bishop h4 to flex the queen out now he takes on c2 the rook has to move but if the rook moves then bishop d3 back so in this position lagarde just gives up his queen and does this here's the problem black's not done black's gonna keep attacking king f3 queen d4 white has no moves and the king in this game is mercilessly hunted and beaten around like a pinata as he marches to the center of the board and promptly gets checkmated with ponte f5 because if you take its check and mate and if you don't take and if you go up it's queen g6 and mate and if you take with the king it's queen g6 and mate the king ends the game on e4 it was a crazy first round of the world cup magnus getting it done we're gonna track him and see if he gets to win his first ever world cup the only tournament he hasn't won we're gonna keep our eye on hikaru see if he maintains world number two status and if he can challenge for the for the title we're gonna keep our eye on gukesh to see if he breaks into the top eight top seven in this event keep our eye on karawana because he's like half a point away from being number two in the world and he's always a beast and prague just casually murdering people and these are not the only players i hope you enjoyed recap number one clearly i am not at home because it's not what it looks like at home tomorrow i will try my best to upload it will be a late upload so europeans you might have to stay up until two or three in the morning or just go to sleep and then catch you later that's all get out of here
