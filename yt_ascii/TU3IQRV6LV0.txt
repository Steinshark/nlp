how do we connect snowflakes fractals the brain computes what where where's this all-star, so we're gonna. have a look at fractals we first of all have to define what the heck is a fractal. that's the first thing we need to do i'll show you some examples in nature, and then i want to try and connect that to pretty recent research that's been going on in terms of what are called neuromorphic structures trying to have devices trying to have computing architectures which are much more aligned with how our brain computes and the perhaps? more correctly much more in line with how our brain is wired and the ability for our brain to make new connections to be plastic to make different connections. there's a whole burgeoning whole really developing area of research, which is incredibly exciting in terms of trying to take that type of process and that type of dynamic and embed it in sort of inorganic systems we said in the last video what does a computer do well it takes in information and does something to that information and outputs other? information sort of what we do we take in a huge range of sensory inputs we do something to them which results in some output. we do something we feel something etc so it's a question about how that information is processed and of course we don't have cmos up here we don't have incredibly regimented and well-organized top-down sculpted pieces of silicon and do all the processing up here were a mess particularly i'm particularly a mess, but if you look at the structure of the brain. it's incredibly branched and incredibly dendritic lots of different pathways if you look at a nerve cell you look at a neuron very fingery and very branched etcetera almost random it looks like certainly not like a very rigid grid like type structure as we have with cmos so the question then is you know what's happening in terms of the just how the brain processes information and of course you know you have incredibly good incredibly powerful pieces of silicon technology that can you know i perform us in so many ways but then you ask it to distinguish between a chihuahua and a blueberry muffin, and it gets completely screwed so where we went out, so what is it about how we process information? i'd love to say we're going to address that question we're not quite but we're going to certainly look at the role of sort of fractal and dendritic structures so basically what is a fractal? what is a dendritic structure and why are they important in information processing? first-year student here in physics of nottingham noah, hardwicke come in give me a christmas card which was very very nice of him but what i did not first realize is that this is a computer-generated? christmas card all the code is in here and moreover. it's unique there was no other christmas card like this you'll have much the same structure another christmas cards but it would be very slightly different because all of these features the snowflakes the ferns the trees are fractal in nature, and he's generated them with a piece of code and every time it'll be slightly different so it is truly a unique christmas card so it's very happy to get that not least because sean and i had been planning this video is a very timely christmas card to get snowflakes are incredibly interesting. there's a hole. this is a paper from 30 years ago from i believe yeah 1987 from 30 years ago there's still a huge amount of debate as to how snowflakes form what is the underlying structure? but what's important in this paper and in number of subsequent papers is that they've used a very simple? relatively simple computer simulation to model just how snowflakes grow and running in the background. here is a simulation called a diffusion limited aggregation simulation i didn't write it it's actually written by one of the first-year students here again guy called jimmy mayer i do a lecture just at the start of first semester when the first years arrive and on chaos and various different aspects of chaos and one of those is related to fractals, which we are getting to slowly and jamie but i mentioned in the in the lecture well if you really want to understand something coded and that's exactly what jamie did and he's developed this simulation whereby what you have is lots and lots of little particles they could be water molecules or ice particles from for example. they're moving around and we have a really simple rule a really simple rule basically it moves around it follows a random walk which just means it's it's equal probability of going north south east it's not right no east-west and so it follows that around it's also called a drunkards walk because you're just stumbling around all over the place and if it hits another particle it sticks, and it doesn't disconnect and then what happens is that sticks and then the next particle moves around that sticks and that sticks and that sticks and gnostics and it becomes? very higgledy-piggledy, but what's interesting is it becomes very higgledy-piggledy, but with a very specific type of structure it's random each time we run it, but the overall characteristics, and the statistics are the same time and time again and it's called a fractal structure if you look at it you see this branching and if you look for these patterns in nature you find them everywhere obviously ferns trees riverbeds a great deal of it stems from the work of mandelbrot and many of you will have heard of the mandelbrot set the important thing in yours is why is it called a fractal so fractal is actually short for fractional dimension so what does a fractional dimension mean so? we got a line okay, you can move in that direction back and forth it's one-dimensional if you got an area square it's two-dimensional if you've got a cube three-dimensional the problem is what about this it's not a close-packed structure it's not a line, but then it's also not a closed enclosed volume or a closed area it's somewhere in between the two and actually if we work it through we find that it's it can be defined in terms of having a fractional dimension somewhere between one day or 2d or in other cases between 2d and 3d i'm looking at and saying to me it looks like it's a 2d structure that so it's it's a 2d structure but how do we actually define this dimension is a special type of dimension is a very good question so what we need to do is think about just how we break this structure down or just how we would form a structure like this or any other structure? from building blocks, so let's take a line and i've run out of room. let me start again you may need to cut an awful lot of this out. you'll see he'll ruler, thank you without wanting to cut to the punch line, but is this gonna be about how many blocks it takes actly so this is all about scalability, and it's all about a concept which is basically self similarity, and that's very important when comes to fractals so here we've got a line, and we can break that line up into well as many pieces as we like but let's just keep three for simplicity so each one of those is exactly the same shape it's not only self-similar it's identical apart from a scaling size, so how many pieces are we got there? we've got three, and we've got one dimension similarly here now we've got two dimensions, but we're going to divide this up into into a series of blocks i've got 1 2 3 in that direction 1 2 3 in that direction, so we've got 9, and that's two dimensions here. we've got 27 and that's three dimensions now we can see a pattern here three this fairly straightforward is equal to 3 to the power of 1 9 is equal to 3 to the power of 2/3 or dimension 1 dimension 2 dimensions 27 is equal to 3 to the power of 3, so there's our dimension okay, so that's fine. those are usual objects were very familiar with those how do we do what what what is that? how would we write down its dimensionality? what's the what's the self similar bit so we could start without, but let's let's not want one thing we could do is we could measure the ratio or the perimeter to the area? that's certainly one way to knit those objects are pretty well-defined and boring incredibly boring. we're gonna look at something called a koch's snowflake i'm not gonna try and measure this out because it'll just take too long so just bear with me. i'm gonna use a pencil in case i make a mistake so you start off with an equilateral triangle, and then what you do is you again divide this up into three and you put another triangle in there? with that's now your side length, so these are all equilateral triangles, and then you put another one over here just losing the lines yes we're just losing the lines so largely because what we want is to have a continuous line so now haven't got rid of those there's our first generations snowflake then you do the same thing again divide this up into three put you in equilateral triangle in there and then similarly here and here and here and here repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat and what you end up with is something? that is pretty well drawn on the wiki page so of a triangle do that break it up break it up again break it up again break it up again. what's remarkable? is that now if you follow this process through? and keep going this the the the line length here never converges so what you'll end up with is an infinitely long line in a finite area which is a fairly compared to these very boring objects which are finite? finite finite finite both in in length and area here we have something which is when you stand it out and you kept going with our process you'd have an infinitely long line in a finite area the important thing is that the perimeter length doesn't converge? so it really is if you follow this to its natural limit, or your honda earned or whether something that's infinitely long but it's in a finite area so looking at that. you're saying that it's constrained in an hour is that because it kind of like the angles work so that it just keeps working back on itself exactly, so it's it's confined it's not diverging over that area. it's constrained with enough that within that area just due to exactly due to the geometry and i we could work this through if we just take this so if we look at that relationship what we have is that the number of pieces n is equal to the scale factor s because what we've done is we've taken this and broken it down into three to the power of the dimension so the number of pieces in this case 27 is the scale factor because we broke it down into three in all three dimensions to the power of three for this one n would be equal to 27 this is going to be a long video short home geez s is going to be equal to three that's our scale factor, and d is our dimensionality is going to be equal to three now we're gonna have to do some maths or math depending on which side of the pond you you livin what we have here is n is equal to s to the power d now if we take logs some of you might remember logs what we'll find is log n and one of the wonderful properties of logs is that raising to a power becomes a multiplication? in log land is equal to d times log s so i make sense you say log ya log at the number of blocks is equal to the dimension times the log of the scale factor okay, they say it's going somewhere. let's put that up here right so that's fine for these and when you work that through you find out that or let's actually go the next step just a 1 one more line of maths to work out what d is let's divide both sides by log s so log n divided by log s divided here by log s. we obviously and what you find is if you work this process through and i? encourage you to do so then you find that you will get an integer value for the dimension what happens if we do it to the snowflake so we'll start off with a line now? we're going to divide it up into 3 and then remember we take our equilateral triangle and if i can draw that correctly we put that equilateral triangle there and then we get rid of that but the important thing is we've taken a line, and we divide it in three didn't matter it. that's made that line longer in it does and you're not sure well you are jumping the gun but you're jumping the gun in an exceptionally good way because that's exactly where i'm going so we're divided in three but we've actually got four units now so one two three four remember. this is an equilateral triangle, so we've got it we divided it in three, but we've got four units make sense so now our n is equal to four but our s is equal to three not good. you know i like so that means that d is equal to log four over log three we've decided that what we're going to do in terms of how we're going to make this pattern is we're going to have a scale factor of three so each each individual line is a third of the original length but we're just gonna set up our geometry so we need four of those lines okay, and if you work out then what the dimension is you'll find that that's something like 1.2. it's not an integer it's a fractional dimension, so that's fractals that's where it comes from it's it's we probably had to do too much maths, but we've done a little bit but as you can see the beauty of maths the beauty and power of math is you get so much out of it so if we went then to the next level we would obviously put a triangle in the middle of here but we're doing the same process again and would that increase it no, so it's the same process time and time again so you only have to do it at this level because you're asking yourself at each level and the important thing is itself similar so you can you can look at it in a growth scale and then you can zoom in and zoom in? overall you're gonna see the same structure, so now we've connected the snowflake wonderful festive snowflake to the mathematics and a computing let's explore that in a little bit more detail because when you look for these fractal things. they're right across nature in fact a physicist what we tend to look for is very ordered, and i'm a physicist i'm sort of interloping here in computerphile, but i'm definitely a physicist we tend to look for very ordered things very structured things crystals we spend so much of our life thinking about crystals, and how atoms are incredibly well-ordered etc but in fact if you look across the answer that's not what it's like at all we you know those incredibly crystalline structures? you know were not crystalline if we were crystalline would be incredibly boring if we were crystalline then you wouldn't have the randomness that you need for evolution you wouldn't have the randomness that you need for information transfer, etc so crystalline and very ordered structures are the exception rather than the rule which makes these type of structures fascinating so fractals can contain more and more and more i'm trying not to use the word data but i'm going to use the word data data in one same contained area is this something we can use for memory so that's a fascinating question, thank you for that sure that brings me to this wonderful structure some of you might be familiar with this it's called the mandelbrot set i hope some of you from any of that if you're not familiar with the mandelbrot set just stop listening to me drone on go and look it up go and spend a few hours so i'm not gonna go into the details of the algorithm wiki is actually again. pretty good in terms of the mandelbrot set and you if you google, mandelbrot set you will find beautiful image upon beautiful image upon beautiful image this is what it looks like and it's actually a process that happens on the complex plane involving imaginary numbers but we don't need all that detail important thing is that you have a grid and in each point in that grid you do a particular algorithm it's a particular. you can even see you set it up in a while loop. you keep that running and you basically let that run until it reaches a certain limit and what you find is when you do that process you get this incredible structure you get all this complexity coming out of an algorithm which involves nothing more than squaring a number and an addition that's all it involves and yet you get all this incredible complex details so complexity from something very straightforward that would be good enough. you look at this, and it's you know. it's it's incredible you can see the sort of almost snowflake dendritic structure again the branching it's a mathematical landscape, and then if you zoom in to this particular region i've just taken out at random you start to see this little bit more like the snowflake structure by the way this is a piece of code. i wrote using something called labview a number of years ago in fact i rolled it so long ago i couldn't find the original code and it also gives you an idea of just how disorganized i am but we zoom in again and looked snowflakes everywhere we see the same type of fractal structure, and we can keep going and we can keep going and we can keep going on we can keep going forever forever it never stops as long as you've got enough computing power you can do this till the end of the end of time, and it would never stop yet. you can code it in five lines if you're a better program than me probably three lines it's it's remarkable so when you think about that in terms of information if we were to take every individual pixel here and try and cold it and store it we need just no vast amounts of memory but we can capture that in five lines or less it's it's mind-blowing when you think about so finally how does that all connect back to the brain? which is where we came in back in physics world in march you can see coding and computing it were finally starting to get computer scientists and physicists to talk together a heck of a lot more than they used to do there's a great article in here a number of great articles, but there's some jessamyn fairfield he used to work in john bolin's group in trinity college in dublin is now in galway see the articles called smarter machines and she talks about the work that she was involved in in in bolin's group and dublin of work - she drove so usually when we think about nano electronics when we think about trying to get faster capacities and more computing power we think about being very regimented and very controlled in terms of how we we have ordered structure in the surface and we'll use lithography and billion-dollar plants to really do this very very fine machining what they do is they sort of chuck a load of nano wires so they take a solution not that different from this? put it on a surface. let it dry and you get a higgledy-piggledy net or mesh of wires all connecting against each other and again. it's an open structure it's not an incredibly close packed lots and lots of different connections that can form and that gives rise doing really fascinating properties including the ability for the network to rewire itself and that's something our brain does our brain is incredibly plastic in terms of forming connections and it also has a multitude of connections that branch off much like the sort of fractal structures we've been looking like this the question of whether the brain is fractal is again something that's been debated at length time and time again but it certainly has that large range of different connections that we don't have in the type of technology silicon technology that underpins we have so much of our world our brains are sort of more along these lines and they call this neuromorphic a neuromorphic device because it's mimicking the type of or hoping to mimic the type of process that happens in our brains look into that picture and the way you've just described it they're creating wires in some sense, but without any purpose not any purpose, but they're just a bunch of wires and they don't know what they do precisely yes, so instead of is it's like my wiring curbs, which is full of old faux no leads and things and if i just put some power in it. hopefully it might start thinking perhaps i wouldn't be that extreme if your way when corporate become sentient you're on the way to a nobel prize let's put it that way just keep quiet about it but don't let it get to sentient that wouldn't be good this is like a ground-up way of exactly using something rather than being an architect and saying this is where the foundations will be here's what i've got i will work with that that's exactly it so instead of being constrained by i need to put this here and this here and i need to have this interconnect here and i've got to worry about leakage and i've got a how will that fit with the particular blueprint, i have let's throw away the blueprint just throw some stuff down and let's say well what function does it give me and if it doesn't give me a function well let's move on to the next one throw some more stuff down and that's a refreshing way to think it's not an engineering where to think it's more by a biological way to think it's hard to understand that this would ever work at all it does some remarkable things in terms of they can train not just this group or a number of groups across the world you can train these things to to recognize certain pulse sequences for example just in terms of what they're being fed in terms of signals, so it's yeah it's it's very much in its infancy in fact as although it's very much in his infancy. there's a massive project which is created and generated a huge amount of controversy called the human brain project which is an eu-funded projects over 1 billion euros we have interviewed professor stephen ferber the human brain project is wonderful, so let's put a link down there yeah, and using a million arm chips it was the thinking then i don't know where that's gone. we haven't yeah yeah, we were to check them, but i know they were thinking about a range of different strategies and possibilities and i think as far as i understand that one of those was a little bit more along the lines of this neuromorphic approach i could be wrong. i'm sure i would be corrected at length and repeatedly in the comments section if i am wrong, and i look forward to that very much this is a bit ong. let's not critique me too much, and so yeah be very different, ooh the originals and the important thing is that we don't know what went into here, right we know g but we don't know a and we can't find the motion which is comparable to the type of effects we have to consider when we're thinking about black holes
