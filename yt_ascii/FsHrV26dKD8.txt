it's been 10 years android and i had a healthy happy relationship we whined we dined we we did everything together but six months ago we agreed to start seeing other people too yeah i switched to an iphone and i feel like it's finally time to to pop the big question do i regret it and i must have thanks to surfsharkvpn for making this possible so at the time when i switched i was moving from a samsung galaxy s20 ultra to an iphone 11 pro max and so my very very first thoughts were one the cameras are kind of boring having come from samsung and huawei phones which have astrophotography modes and 108 megapixel sensors and 100 times zoom cameras i noticed immediately that yes the iphone was good but it was also just a little sterile in comparison i really missed having a 120hz refresh rate the iphone just didn't feel as snappy or as immediate by comparison and three i specifically remember the moment i'd finished setting up the home screen of my iphone and i was taking a look at it thinking well i guess that's kind of it then there's no eye compacts or deep customization to experiment with this was probably going to be my setup for as long as i used an iphone bit of a bummer now six months have passed since then i've had time to properly test abs we've had the new ios 14 we've had a model upgrade from the 11 pro max to the 12 pro max and whilst i would say that at its core none of these three things have been fixed my opinion about them has changed for example i still wish we had more camera features here but at the same time i am starting to appreciate that what you do get is super reliable i used to actually have a bit of a force of habit where when i was taking a portrait mode shot i would take like six or seven photos just to make sure i have a good one i stopped doing that now i take one maybe two because i trust it or fun fact these iphone 12s are the first time that we've ever used iphones to film parts of these videos nobody's noticed i mean sure it might become obvious if i told you exactly which shots but the point is it might not if i didn't and subtle point this one picks up voices better than any other phone i've tried it sounds good right and the other thing is that depending on which cameras you're recording on the microphones on this phone change how they pick up the audio like when you're shooting something in front of you it'll use this microphone here and then when you switch to the front camera it'll change to the front microphone plus even when you're just taking photos this is far from the most exciting spec sheet it's just three 12 megapixel cameras but i've taken some awesome shots on it day or night or ultrawide or zoom this is solid all-round if you did see my full camera comparison recently you'll have seen how within two years apple's gone from bottom of the pack at night mode photos to pretty much the best you can get the only times it's let me down is in those awkward middle indoor lighting situations like when i'm taking night mode shots i'm usually capturing static things like buildings or roads but in those indoor settings trying to take photos of people and cats it doesn't capture quite as fast as my old huawei for example so motion can be blurred okay hardware i still miss 120 hours displays i feel like that's one thing that a 2020 flagship phone should have but apart from that almost every other part of the hardware of this iphone and even the last iphone are top shelf like i still don't think these iphone 12 phones are particularly nice to hold thanks to these sharp edges but wow were they durable this is actually the first phone that i've ever used without a case i've actually dropped it twice and both times i kind of froze on the spot nearly had a heart attack slowly kind of crept forward and picked it up but it was fine i haven't got a single scratch on this iphone 12 pro max yet or we've got speakers i was already perfectly satisfied with the sound quality i was getting on my samsung but the iphone 12 pro max is probably the second best sounding phone i've ever heard second only to the asus rog phone 3 and that thing's just a monster but i think the biggest hardware change moving from android to iphone is that when you're on an iphone you kind of stop thinking about the hardware and that doesn't mean that this is the best spec phone on the planet it's not this doesn't have the biggest battery this doesn't have the highest resolution display it definitely doesn't have the most ram but the software is so optimized that it runs well regardless even actually on last year's iphone i couldn't find a single app on the app store that didn't work or wasn't compatible i didn't find a single game that my phone wouldn't play at the highest possible frame rate and that kind of polish that also carried through to what i produced with those apps like the quality of my voice notes from whatsapp that jumped from here to here moving from samsung to iphone the video call quality that the other person sees that improved too and probably the best example of this is snapchat and instagram stories without fail since jumping every time i've posted an instagram story somebody has asked me what phone has that taken on because it looked so good i very rarely had that before except a couple of times when i was using one of those old huawei phones and i'm doing a really good job of controlling the bright areas people were genuinely concerned about my microphone quality i've only had one weird bug with whatsapp just every now and again while i was typing it would randomly force close which was pretty annoying but i've reinstalled it and it seems to be okay now touchwood and if you're enjoying this video the sub to the channel would be tasty what about customization though because you remember that when i first set this iphone up the lack of customization is one of those things that immediately hit me well it's not great but it hasn't bothered me as much as i thought it would have like if i think back to when i was on android i would rarely fiddle with the really advanced settings things like changing the grid size of the home screen or making my own widgets so i'm not too bothered by those things not being here i've kind of developed a sort of muscle memory for where every app is on my home screen i'm okay with it but what i would change is how apple handles icons because on android icon packs are one of the quickest ways to completely change the feel of your phone without messing up where everything is on iphone you have to create a shortcut for each and every app you have to download every icon individually and then apply the new icons to the new shortcuts one by one i did find a couple of other methods but they've all got their own caveats and it just feels like the iphone is sitting in a pointless middle ground like if apple is going to let users change the way their icons look anyways they might as well make that process easy and fun like what if apple made a first party app with all apple approved themes on it and you could just hit one button and it would apply instantly that would be amazing also what is up with the way that apple handles wallpapers how is it that the wage change wallpaper is still to find settings to scroll down to hit wallpaper to hit choose new wallpaper to pick a category pick a wallpaper click set and then click set both it's more complicated than my relationship status and while you do technically get some inbuilt dynamic moving wallpapers as far as i can see unless you jailbreak your phone there's no way of getting any more the only live wallpapers that you can download are actually just static wallpapers that can move but only if you hold down whilst being on your lock screen but i just don't understand in what situation anyone would ever do that so it's not perfect but it is better than it used to be ios 14 means you can now add a bit of personality to your home screen and the fact that they allow widgets from third-party apps is a solid step forward plus it's kind of novel to me that every iphone user gets the same update on the same day it's not like when you're on a samsung where you see oh android 11 has some awesome features i can't wait to try it like next year or something when i actually get the update no it almost felt like a community day on twitter when everyone got ios 14 at the same time and it felt like the whole world was showcasing all the new setups they'd made using it also just on the note of customization i've also realized that while yes the internal customization you can do on the iphone is much worse than android the external customization you can do is greater you know i have that smartphone gadget series right where i showcase all those weird but wonderful accessories well of the 150 or so gadgets i've shown in that series probably only five of them don't support iphones whether it's cases whether it's camera lenses or gaming controllers i think most companies build for iphone first and it makes sense even though samsung usually sells more phones overall apple sells far more phones on average per model and so if your company can only build let's say a case design for 10 different phones you're gonna make sure that the iphones are part of that plus you've also just got the fact that iphone users have a higher propensity to spend on accessories so no this is not my dream experience but at the same time for each one of those issues that i had to start with with ios and iphones the somewhat uninteresting cameras the lacking hardware the poor customization they've not disappeared but they have become less of a problem one more thing though apple is definitely a company who operates on a if it ain't broke don't fix it philosophy and so i would say of all brands of phones with apple you probably have the least actual change between generations like if you look at samsung's phones last year versus this year huge change if you look at xiaomi's phones huge change again but it's not really the case here when apple makes changes it's usually because they're planning on keeping them they have a formula that works and they want to make careful incremental improvements to it whereas when a lot of android phone makers add features they've got no intention of keeping them it's more a case of we've got this new phone how do we make something cool for this model that people are going to talk about so you'll quite often have samsung or huawei or xiaomi announced something amazing let's say that their next phone is going to have a hundred times camera zoom and then on the following model after that they decide well most people actually didn't need that let's just make it 50 times now and so for apple i think this slower strategic build it's both a bad thing and a good thing i've been using an iphone now long enough to experience what it's like upgrading from one to the next and it was one of those cases where i was so excited i ripped open the packaging i transferred all my stuff but then there was a little moment of okay everything's transferred and everything looks the same i guess i'll just carry on doing what i was doing everything from the software to the hardware feels so similar that it is possible to sometimes forget you've actually swapped phones i had less of that initial oh i can't wait to try the new 100x zoom camera more of a okay this is going to be great from now on my photos will be brighter and my downloads will be faster it's less drastic but more deliberate evolution okay so to conclusively answer the question do i regret switching to iphone huh no there are things i miss but for the purposes of what i want from my phone it was a good decision besides the fact that i already used a mac for work has brought up some interesting opportunities like you might know this already but if you use an iphone and a macbook your macbook can take calls which might sound a lot like one of those features that's really cool to have but you'll never use but i use it every day i'm someone who's very productivity focused so when i'm working at my computer i purposefully tried to stay away from my phone but when i used to do this on my old android some part of me was a little bit uncomfortable like what if there's a delivery driver who's trying to call me what if there's an emergency what if there's some sort of work meeting that i completely forgot to schedule i don't have to worry about it now i can do my work i can keep instagram and twitter away and i can be rest assured that if someone needs to reach me they still can airdrop is good enough that even though i transfer a lot of photos between phone and computer i haven't had to plug my phone in once to do that transfer when you're trying to find a wi-fi to connect to on the go you can always just connect straight to your iphone's internet from your laptop it's a great feature and i don't use this one much but if you're browsing the internet on your phone it's pretty slick that with one tap on your computer you can carry on exactly where you were so the takeaway of all of this is that if you're on an android right now and you look at iphones and think well that sucks that sucks it's missing this you're probably in the right place there's a lot to like about android but if you're in the position that i was in where you're kind of on the fence you're using an android phone but you're looking at ios like damn that integration looks amazing then i don't think it's a decision you'd regret it's worth at least trying it okay you've probably heard me talk about surfsharkvpn for a while now and there's a reason for that see there's a lot of companies who want to work with tech youtube channels i've had other vpns i've had shaving companies i've had makeup brands but you probably noticed this i say no to almost all of them but surf shark is something that i genuinely think is just good value while a lot of epns charge like 30 a person per month this costs just over two dollars a month for everyone and you're still getting the same anonymous secure internet browsing and that ability to access sites that are usually restricted to other parts of the world like the us version of netflix also i mostly use this on my mac so it's cool that with one tap on the bar at the top i can quick connect to the last server i was connected to when people ask me which vpn i recommend even in person i tell them it's this one so check the link in description and there is a code boss which will give you 83 off and an extra three months for free thanks a lot for watching my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one
