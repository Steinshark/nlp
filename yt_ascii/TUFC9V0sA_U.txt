- so, what's the wave function? you said it's an interesting detail but in any interpretation, what is the wave function in quantum mechanics? - well, you know, we had this idea from rutherford that atoms look like little solar systems,
but people very quickly realized that can't possibly be right because if an electron
is orbiting in a circle it will give off light, all the light that we have in this room comes from electrons zooming up and down, wiggling and that's what electromagnetic waves are and you can calculate
how long would it take for the electron just to
spiral into the nucleus and the answer is 10 to
the -11 seconds, okay? a hundred billionth of a second. so that's not right, meanwhile people had realized that light which we understood from
the'00s was a wave had properties that were
similar to that of particles. this is einstein and
plonk and stuff like that. so, if something that we agree was a wave had particle-like properties then maybe something
we think is a particle the electron has wave-like
properties, right? and so a bunch of people eventually came to the conclusion don't think about the electron as a little point particle orbiting like a solar system, think of it as a wave that is spread out, and they cleverly gave this the
name the wave function which is the dopiest name in the world for one of the most profound things in the universe, there's
literally a number at every point in space,
which is the value of the electron's wave
function at that point. - and there's only, there's
only one wave function. - yeah, they eventually figured that out. that took longer, but when you have two electrons, you do not have a wave function for electron one and a wave function for electron two. you have one combined wave function for both of them, and indeed, as you say. there's only one wave function for the entire universe at once.
