bubble tea has long been a part of asian american youth culture today it is more popular than ever before did you see the google doodle recently most people know that bubble tea came to america from taiwan but its origins within taiwan are infamously murky in this long long delayed video we're going to talk about bubble tea and where it comes from but first i want to remind you about the newsletter i do try to keep it up to date with new things that i have been hearing the full write-up for videos you haven't seen before and so on the sign up link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show what is bubble tea bubble tea is okay is this really actually necessary do you really need me to define bubble tea to you fine whatever in its purest form bubble tea is made from a combination of black tea milk sugar and tapioca pearls stir it together you then drink it and chew the pearls and it all tastes nice okay the taiwanese have a name for the pearl's gummy bouncy chewiness q or qq bubble tea pearls are not the only foods with the q taiwanese can describe sesame donuts glutinous rice balls and even fish balls as being cute on the whole it is a desired trait in taiwanese cuisine why call it q the new york times suggests that it comes from the taiwanese hokian word kill meaning wavy curvy bendy which is as good a guess as any your standard boba drink just has the pearls and plenty of people enjoyed that way but today's drink shops offer many variants and spins on the original formula there's cheese tea where the tea is topped with a layer of creamy cheesy milk foam quite popular in hong kong brown sugar milk tea where you swirl in caramelized brown sugar syrup into the drink there's a popular store here in taiwan making this called tiger sugar i saw a huge line for it when i was visiting in the philippines taro milk tea which blends in taro powder or chunks of taro itself taro is a starchy root vegetable often used in taiwanese cuisine taro milk tea has some nice texture to it and so on i can go on forever the tapioca pearls are the eponymous boba bubbles or just balls i will use the various terms interchangeably throughout this video though i should note that in taiwan the word boba is slang for big breasts coined as such by a savvy tea house owner i don't recommend saying out loud there the primary ingredient in these chewy tapioca pearls is cassava starch sometimes also known as tapioca flour it makes up about 74 percent of the final product with most of the rest being water secondary ingredients include corn starch we can also add sweeteners like honey for extra flavor and coloring black colored balls have black sugar added to them the cassava starch for the balls is extracted from the roots of the cassava plant cassava sometimes is also referred to as manioc or yucca is a short shrubby plant about 1 to 1.5 meters tall the plant is well known for its sturdiness it is quite tolerant of drought it can grow in all types of soils this has made cassava a major crop for hard times though its lack of protein means that you should not eat it exclusively you do not have to do much with the plant to get some cassava root but like with all things in life you will get much more out of it if you put more into it the roots are ready for harvesting after about 10 to 12 months you harvest it by cutting the stem about 40 to 60 centimeters above the ground and then pulling the thing out of the dirt one plant gives you about three to ten roots please do not eat the cassava root right out of the ground because first the roots have a lot of dirt and rocks on them yuck and also the roots have hydrogen cyanide inside them which makes them only slightly less toxic than twitter or the youtube comments section the minimum lethal dose for humans is about 0.5 to 3.5 milligrams poisoning cases after big cassava meals have been reported in the nigerian press and even non-lethal doses can result in irreversible paraparesis otherwise known as the partial paralysis of the legs there are sweet cassava variants that have been bred to have almost an eighth of the cyanide content but for the most part we need to process the raw cassava plant before we can eat it the plant originates from latin america genetic histories have traced its ancestry to wild populations in the southern border of the amazon basin it was probably domesticated there with no traces of cross-breeding detected indigenous populations have been growing and eating it for at least four thousand years they were the ones who first discovered how to remove the plant's toxicity and make it edible the conquistadors and traders of the old world stumbled across it and recognized it to be a useful food crop in the 16th century they took it to africa where it grew in popularity throughout the 19th century today africa grows over half of the world's supply nigeria is the world's leading producer with 21 share from africa cassava then made its way to asia where it became a cash crop farmers discovered that it grew well in southern india the philippines and the island of java in indonesia roots are highly perishable and so they are left in the ground until ready they're sent to the factory about 24 hours after harvest where we clean off the dirt and rocks on the roots after that we peel and slice them into one to two centimeter chunks we then use a sawtooth rasper to turn the cassava chunks into a wet and pulpy slurry this slurry is then fed through a series of filters and extractors to pull out fibrous pulp sand and other unclean materials the goal is to be left with the purest starch possible once all that is done the slurry is now a semi-moist starch cake we push that through a dewatering filter at high pressure to remove as much water as possible in order to create a dry starch powder not all the starch is used for making boba you can use it to make a wide variety of things from animal feed to ethanol to organic acids to msg to alcohol did i say alcohol twice whoops but let us go back to producing the pearls this process is largely automated first machines blend and evenly mix together the starch powder and its other ingredients next is a step called forming or rounding a forming machine rolls the mixed and blended powders into balls you can also do this by hand too if you wish after that many industrial manufacturers run their balls through screens to separate them by size certain shops sell drinks with mini pearls which have their own fandom as well then finally we vacuum seal the cassava starch balls into packages we prepare the pearls for consumption by soaking and then boiling them in water until the water has largely evaporated they can be used for about six months after their production date there's a story told that the kili bay bubble tea cultural park it claims that the taiwanese prefectual government first produced tapioca pearls in the qing dynasty era to celebrate the birthday of the empress dowager to see the government produced traditional chinese glutinous rice ball desserts but with tapioca flour the concoction was presented to to see who apparently liked and praised it i have seen a similar variant of this story which changes the celebratory event from tennessee's birthday to the traditional chinese lantern festival seems fairly plausible however i would note that populations in southeast asia have long been enjoying jelly desserts made from native starches like saco palm sago pearls for instance these are naturally white jelly treats made from wet sago they are often colored pink for aesthetic purposes and have a similar taste to tapioca pearls well they both taste like nothing it seems more plausible to me that taiwan's tapioca pearls arrived to taiwan from southeast asia as sago pearls rather than as a variant of chinese glutinous rice balls two researchers at academia cynica in their book on the history of taiwanese cuisine then note that in the 1700s taiwanese found it too expensive to import sago for sago pearls so they switched to using the starcho sweet potatoes which were first introduced to taiwan sometime in the 1500s to produce the pearls adding tapioca starch to keep them from sticking together these white colored pearls were larger than today's tapioca pearls but nevertheless were popular for a long time often enjoyed in sweet iced water as a traditional dessert the taiwanese japanese dictionary produced during the japanese colonial period includes the word feng yuen has powder balls you enjoy for dessert then at some point in the 1960s new variants of sweet potato starch gave their starch balls a cheerier texture and an attractive brownish color thus eventually coming to the boba that we enjoyed today the chinese invented tea and have been drinking it for thousands of years however they did not invent milk tea as we know it today certain nomadic populations like the mongols in china's northwest area did add milk and fat to their tea but that stuff is salty the sweet milk tea that we now associate with bubble tea comes from the british who were the first to popularize the adding of milk and sugar to their breakfast tea i read that this practice comes in one part from long-standing british tradition centered on dairy products like milk and cheese and in another part from the shodiness of british porcelains adding boiling tea to such porcelain would cause it to break so the british added milk to prevent damage to the cup not sure how credible that story is milk tea quickly became popular across europe driving the colonialization of sugarcane areas like the west indies to fuel it and from there it entered taiwan in hong kong it makes up a particularly big part of the hong kong cuisine with the lower classes adopting hong kong style milk tea has a way to emulate the higher classes so throughout this video we have traced back the histories of the bubble and the tea now it is time for our two protagonists to meet we got to put the bubbles into the tea but who first came up with this idea two tea houses in taiwan claim to have been the original inventor of the bubble tea drink both of their origin stories have significant inconsistencies the first and most widely accepted origin story comes out of chun a chain of tea houses headquartered in taizong the shop's founder the ohan ji visited japan where he saw coffee being served cold he decided that the taiwanese might like it too thus in 1983 he opened up a tea house in taizong serving chinese tea in a similar fashion cold this was different from that of traditional chinese tea houses which served their tea warm or hot anyway the story goes that one day in the late 1980s the shop's manager lin show hui then in her 20s brought some black colored starch balls the aforementioned dessert fungien to a boring business meeting during the meeting she threw a few balls into her iced smt ovarian black tea grown in india the result was quite good sparring the company to start selling it it outsold their other iced teas at the time and the rest is history the alternate bubble tea creation story comes from han lin tea house in tainan hanlon's founder was tu tongha after leaving the taiwanese army he became a street painter and sold paintings for a living so in 1986 he founded han lin tea house borrowing money from a friend to set up a store back then it was very small just' square meters large and mostly sold hot pot but two was obsessed with tea particularly taiwan's high mountain tea in 1987 two visited the yamu liao vegetable market in tainan there he bought pearl sago the smaller white colored pearls made from sago starch from a vendor finding them unpleasant by themselves he mixed these balls into a glass of milk tea on a whim and found the result to look and taste quite good thus he started selling it the product sold very well far beyond the pearl sago vendor's ability to supply them so to switch to the black cover cassava based tapioca pearls hanlon still sells drinks with both the white and black colored pearls they call it the panda bubble tea and it's great and han lin tea house have long been at odds over who created bubble tea there are holes in both stories hanlon has pointed out before that in tunswetang's first story it wasn't the business manager lin who first threw the balls into the tee at the meeting but rather found her the ohanje second is not exactly clear when the famous business meeting exactly happened cnn says it happened in 1988 but there are other variants of the story citing 1986 or even 1987. linton for her part clarifies that she had been adding dessert fengren to iced tea for a long time before that fateful business meeting she purchased fangren in 1984 when she worked as the tea house's procurement manager in 1985 she started adding fengen to her teeth for whatever reason and enjoyed it as her secret drink when she became manager in 1986 she added it to the menu as bubble tea i personally feel that the meeting probably never actually happened the concept is not difficult to copy and thus many copied it the ohan jeff or his part decided not to patent it feeling that it would be better if everyone promoted the drink together lynn further points out that leo and hunling founder two were friends as i mentioned handin started off as a hot pot shop shortly after bubble tea's introduction they all invited to over to taizong to try out this new drink you get what she is implying anyway the two companies actually battled it out in the courts over who deserves credit for the drink presenting various legal or historical documents to support their side of the case the legal back and forth lasted for years finally the taiwan courts ruled that bubble tea is a product that cannot be patented since anyone can make or store it therefore its true inventor is not worth arguing about in other words they said to get over it have long since moved on and then tea house for their part agrees that the true venter does not matter both companies continue to market themselves as the inventor of bubble tea to dongha recently passed away in 2022 due to covid complications rest in peace to a legend i have to note that most local taiwanese do not go to either chun soi tang or han lin for their daily bubble tea fix these tea houses are higher end premium locales for drinking and dining also big tourist traps bubble tea quickly spread out of taiwan taiwanese immigrants then brought it to the united states and canada featuring it in their tea houses and restaurants the first mention of it i can dig up in american newspapers was october 1996 calling bubble iced tea a frosty thirst quencher in 1999 a vancouver paper quotes an anonymous taiwanese canadian who says she first came across bubble tea three to four years ago back in taipei it was then a popular drink for teenagers shortly thereafter in 2000 media mentions of the drink and people's craze for it rapidly began increasing these bubble teas had the tapioca pearls freshly brewed assam or black tea as well as some fruit juice i don't think this variant gained a lot of traction at first up until 2005 the most common bobo shop was probably either quickly's or lolly cup which prepared their teas using flavored powders but since then you've had additional store brands like gongta and boba guys many of these shops are founded by americans rather than immigrants and use other types of ingredients some of these larger chains like sharetea my mom's favorite and kung fu tea are far larger in the united states than in taiwan kung fu tea has over 250 locations and i've only seen one in taipei bubble tea is one of taiwan's most significant food exports bloomberg recently did a fantastic article on the bubble tea trend in it they mentioned one of the biggest companies producing the bubbles sang tao food they have an english language subsidiary called kily bay founded in 1979 but tun josh sun the company started out as a coffee importer over time they latched onto the bubble tea trend and have factories in both taiwan and mainland china they not only provide the raw goods but also offer a complete business model delivery as in they will teach you how to run a bubble tea shop of your own i'm told that they provide a majority of the starch balls for the american bubble tea industry i haven't quite found any information to confirm that but they do seem to be a very significant supplier they reported daily average tapioca pearl production is 300 tons each day this video has gotten long you can drink a whole lot of bubble teas throughout the whole thing to conclude the concept of bubble tea is quite simple but its ingredients have a long history the whole thing is a fascinating mix of western southeast asian and chinese cultures they all had to come together in a single place in order to make magic happen and it is indeed magic now i'm gonna go get a boba all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign
