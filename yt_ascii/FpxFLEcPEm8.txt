ladies and gentlemen the only way to quantify your skill level in chess is a number called elope elo is different if you play live in different countries of different elos and obviously there's an online elo and depending on what website you play it's quantified differently we're going to shorten all of that and in this video i'm going to play three of my subscribers with chess.com elos of 500 1300 and 1900. we will show you i will show you the differences in the openings the differences in the middle games and the end games and where the worst mistakes occur that is the goal of today's video i have series where i play against subscribers i'm thinking to make this more of a long-term thing i was thinking to call it chess levels or something along those lines so do let me know if you like the concept and we will analyze each game a little bit deeply for the first game i'm playing a 500 now i will be playing like a 500 and obviously the game is blitz because if it was rapid this would be potentially a much longer video so for a 500 i am just going to follow basic opening principles and i will try to play at the level but slightly higher of my opponent so i can you know ensure victory i'm not gonna play a four move checkmate i'm gonna try to show you all like i said i mean where the basic principles disappear if you're an intermediate player you might play the italian you might play the ponziani or the scotch i'm 500 so i'm just playing four nights i'm at the level where i don't yet know how to challenge my opponents so much in the opening so you know i i i'm when you're 500 you're not really like for example this is an inaccurate move because you have knight takes pawn knight takes pawn in the center fork trick which is considered slightly better for white but a 500 and no galaxy knows that and i'm just gonna play d3 which is an inaccurate move i really should not be blocking my bishop like there was again but i'm i'm 500 but let's just say i'm a little bit higher than 516. all right now my opponent of course should just yes develop very good now i'm gonna play bishop e3 okay so far you know not nothing special has occurred my opponent goes back that's a completely reasonable move when the bishops face each other you don't always have to take your opponent's bishop you can slide back and if they take you you open up i'm gonna play bishop to e2 developing not really developing but okay at least i've moved the bishop off the home square pawn to d6 is a good move and i'm gonna play queen d2 so i'm just kind of getting every piece off of its home square one piece at a time i i don't have any sort of advantage or or disadvantage yet and i'm gonna i'm gonna castle on i'm gonna castle on the same side write it like you could castle opposite sides opposite side casting leads to aggressive positions this is a very closed and very tense position we haven't traded any pieces so it's still about development potential pawn breaks my opponent opts to trade the bishops i already for a long time was able to take with the pawn but in recent moves i've been able to take with the queen so i'm gonna do that now the queen's safe here the move knight g4 is just an attack it doesn't win the queen okay bishop g4 and i'm very curious is my opponent going to take the night when i go you know when when or are they gonna keep the bishop on the board because it's not a good idea to trade bishops for knights okay wow very good move now i'm 500 so i'm gonna i'm gonna chase the bishop down which is not great and i'm gonna keep chasing which again is it this is this is bad play you should not be marching upon that far up the board now my opponent also knows they're playing me so you know and i'm still going up the board but but this is this is terrible let's see how my opponent reacts so there it is a mistake has been made why is that a mistake because they forgot i have backup they they were kind of reacting to me over here and now i'm gonna get my queen in now the game is not over but oftentimes especially toward the lower elo bounds games end very quickly and very drastically let's see if my opponent can bounce back they they did make a mistake it was a very it was a very straightforward kind of counting mistake but you had to see the queen from far away and also my opponent was reacting to my attack and also my opponent is playing me so there's a little bit of you know psychology a good idea here would be to trade my queen off let's see if they find queen f6 okay very good do they understand why they're playing queen f6 though right so let's say i i if i go knight g5 there's queen g7 knight d5 is a good move but i'm 500 you know i have tunnel vision so i'm just pushing that looks like i win a queen but i don't because the queen is defended so this is the only move but they might think they're losing a queen hopefully they come to the realization that they are not and bishop h7 has to be played it's a relatively straightforward tactic they might just decide to chuck the bishop and finish this plan because right now you know my opponent's probably already like i'm you know i'm losing the queen now they have to realize they're not which would yeah which let's see if they okay very good it took them it took them some time but but but they did it i'm gonna go knight g5 now will they hang this because that was definitely hanging a moment ago but now the bishop defense judging from the time spent no this person is wow that is a fantastic move taking advantage of this i'm gonna bring my bishop back to d1 so far this 500 has played exceptionally well i mean they're a pawn down after 20 moves i really i can't say much right like this is really great stuff the only thing that has happened is that my opponent has spent a lot of time on these moves and in blitz chess you have to play good moves but you have to play them efficiently rookie eight so let's let's go here do they see the backwards night move 20 seconds on the clock are they scared that gotham might have blundered something wow they had to build up the courage i think but this is this is incredible this person is is really really good the i think the only chance i have of beating this person is just because of the time now granted i saw that but like still this is you know and you don't have to do this let's see if they react to the knight under attack the right way like maybe king or they could move the knight but then of course i'm gonna take i also feel like they're terrified which again when you play me like that's definitely part of it but the 500 finding knight takes b5 oh my goodness a counter attack danger levels that's crazy so if rook f6 there's rook g5 wow now i'm not playing the best moves i'm sort of rewarding the efforts of my opponent i mean this person has played a like way above their level i mean like 1500 level chess here really really impressive stuff i'm i'm gonna disallow the night re-entry i mean there's two seconds on the clock okay my opponent loses on time i mean that was really really good if like i if i game reviewed that i feel like they easily played in the four digits that was so impressive that person played at an 80 accuracy and had an estimated rating of'00. wow amazing i mean honestly really really impressive like i said i mean i why my opponent was able to play that well in this game is because they followed basic principles and i think what also was to their advantage is they didn't just trade belligerently they followed principles all up until here right bishop takes here is not okay the most accurate but it's still a completely normal move what allowed my opponent to get such a high accuracy is the closed position and the symmetry so the position wasn't open and complicated and crazy and and all this and that allows especially as a beginner for you to play just kind of straightforward moves and here i got way over aggressive this is just not a good move i mentioned that now h6 is a is a very big mistake but to immediately bounce back with queen f6 you know and then h5 is obviously not not the best move i can you know i should have went here which i mentioned that's also apparently not the top engine move it is but i also have king here and and putting my rook i mean this was this was a great great game the reason my opponent lost was because of time just purely playing good moves but just slightly too slowly i mean of course i played knight b5 i said well they find this move and they found it i mean wow so wow i mean sometimes you try to make these videos and you hope the 500s just play like terribly so you know you but no i mean that was really really exceptional stuff okay so for the next game i i'm playing a 1300 right now i have black now okay i imagine my opponent's gonna play a london so which you know whoa okay this is going to be a very different type of game this is going to be the blackmore redeemer i think are they going f3 okay so i i accept it again i'm i'm very forcing stuff okay wow blackmart dimmer now if i allow this i i can if i know what i'm doing but let's just say you're caught off guard right because that's that's the big thing so already we see that at the intermediate level people play something that they've studied right like my opponent probably knows the in you know the the the tricks of this opening so let's accept the gambit and we're not gonna play in let's say the best way like i'm playing too passively i should have developed my bishop right so i'm playing e6 i play bishop g5 okay let's play you know let's block the pin we're being very solid maybe we're preparing castles okay now let's see if the opponent kind of like knows how to step on the gas okay queen to d2 probably long castle is coming you know i'm 1300 i'm following the principles i'm just castling my king they also castle and you know now this is the position i think i should finish my development right that that seems to be probably what i should do is go for a queen trade because then i won't get checkmated but i've definitely negated my own development here i did not do a good job so i'm just sort of absent-mindedly putting pieces in the center let's see if my 1300 opponent like pounces on the attacking opportunity bishop d3 does work because if i take this pawn and my queen lands there he has a discovered attack on d4 okay so bishop to d3 hitting this and okay now as the 1300 i might not know this but after h6 i'm a little bit worried about sacrifices near my king so i'm gonna play the move a6 because i'm trying to play b5 this is very slow very slow and i and i and i feel like if my opponent plays this the right way you know they they should they should have some success here but we're already seeing a very different type of game it's not a closed position you're you're very much in the attacking stage planning stage based on the opening that you just played like my opponent did this deliberately right we're castled on opposite sides we're in a big fight now now what bishop d3 has been played is there a threat is there a threat i don't think so it doesn't look like there's a threat so let me continue with the move b5 again i don't really know what i'm doing i mean as a all right okay beef a3 is played which is very much a 1300 level move you kind of play a move because you're like i don't want him to go here but i will i mean i i will do that a3 is a is is definitely a reactionary move like oh my god he's coming at me i have to did i have a threat no but by by pushing a pawn in front of your king you've now created a hook the same way over here i would have had a hook you now not only have a knight targeted i'm also targeting your pawn and i'm guaranteeing entry into your position and not just entry i'm guaranteeing an opening of the b file plus a trade benefits me because i'm up a pawn right so my opponent made a strategic mistake they did not make a blunder so far my opponent has made no blunders okay they've made no blunders i'm playing a5 this is also not the best move it's very slow i should have definitely immediately gone here but no blunders okay king b1 is again just sort of like a a little bit of a reactionary move i mean nothing crazy let's you know let's play bishop b7 total misstep not right not the right move i should be attacking i should be playing rook b8 this is a complete you know this is a complete reverse like what am i doing right i i don't need the bishop there it's not a bad move but i i mean my point was to attack i was trying to attack now i'm very interested to see if my opponent is going to continue their attack right because they haven't made any blunders yet they have not made any mistakes they've made maybe one bad strategic decision with pawn to a3 but for the 1300 level it's like pretty minor okay h5 is very very reasonable right there there is there is nothing really wrong with this move i really want to go here and just see how my opponent reacts okay like sacking would be excellent this would be excellent positional understanding it's not the top computer move probably because when you sacrifice a bishop it's like it's like going all in in poker oh they don't do it they don't do it they don't sense that maybe they don't do it because they realize it doesn't work but now you know i'm defending and and i'm gonna i'm gonna trade some pieces off because again that alleviates the pressure right so they they play a very aggressive opening but but a little bit of a lack of killer instinct again probably compounded by playing me i understand this is kind of a non-move like i'm more than happy to make this trade and you know i'm gonna play knight here so i'm more than happy to make that trade the more pieces i trade the much lower my chances of getting mated okay bishop takes is good to continue attacking queen takes his good what's not good is pawn takes that is a terrible move because i i negate the activity of two of my pieces and we will check afterward but i'm 1300 excellent move very very good move trying to recreate the glory days of the attack i'm lining up the rook to the queen just kind of okay excellent well spotted i have bishop a6 but you know i think we're getting into a fight here so let's see what happens g5 and again there's two seconds of bonus but so far my opponent has not really made any blunders bishop a6 is kind of a sneaky one you know a little bit for this level i'm not sure it would have been that you know spotted that quickly i think they're gonna respect my attack though rook g1 now i'm playing a3 so i have struck first i have arrived first but g5 is craziness absolute pandemonium you know and and this game will just come down to a couple of strategic decisions okay knight e5 is there a threat i'm gonna take if i push they get to create what's called an umbrella pawn so it's better to open it's better to open up the position to try to get the pieces in let's see i'm gonna bring my queen i'm trying to bring my queen over here are they gonna fight back okay not unreasonable but of course with low time you're much more likely to blunder so it it's like understandable again it it does come down a little bit to the clock management here okay they ran out of time they're losing but they're losing because my attack broke through faster i would have won this game by playing something like rook b8 bishop a6 and again it's just the fact that i opened up whites king way before my king got opened i managed to kind of blockade but my opponent lost that game with no blunders i mean literally not a single blunder was made the move a3 is definitely bad right now it's equal let's see what the evaluation is after a3 yeah it's it's it's minus point seven point five point six right and after they go here it's minus one so it's a strategic mistake taking a step backwards also allowing entry onto your queen side that was the one mistake in 20 moves that my opponent made there were others but they were not blunders right here again probably taking is the best plan of action and you are threatening just nasty various things potentially so a very common defensive technique here is knight to h7 which reopens your bishop and if my opponent is slow i can play bishop g5 i can also play this this and then bishop g5 and actually the queen is trapped that would have been very good like a while back so for example in this position if i played h6 it would have been a very different story look at the evaluation here it's like equal if anybody's better it's white and and that's because rook d3 rook g3 knight e5 bishop d3 knight g5 like white's attack can develop here so quickly because my knight is stuck guarding h7 if i don't move there and then i'm just gonna lose knight e4 and then this and queen h7 so the opening was good and we see that at the intermediate level people play you know people play what they play and they played h4 and and then and then they just kind of overreacted to me and what they should have realized is you just gotta go for it like take take queen f4 there is nothing scary about the pawn coming here it if anything it just helps transfer the knight there is something scary when you do this because now you help me open up the position and the game literally ended because of the b file all of what i did bishop b7 was not a good move we can analyze it okay ironically according to stockfish this is the top engine move in the position remember how i said it wasn't a good move for this level this is not a good move because again if i played a4a3 i might even win faster because my opponent would react to my attack it's funny bishop b7 i said was not the best move it's the top computer move because i guess i'm activating the bishop and i thought here i played pretty straightforward trading the knights and then here i said that this is not the best move it's not but i still have an advantage because the attack is too slow right the attack is just too slow now for the last game i'm actually playing against my one of my moderators and long time gotham supporter aka reigns i'm gonna play i think i'm gonna play like a queen's gambit this game we're gonna see how they play at 1900 now reigns plays a lot of offbeat openings but okay he's playing slav defense and we're gonna see the opening the middle game and and all that good stuff so let's see how the opening knowledge is i'm gonna play e3 this is the slow slav this is the main line but you can also go here i'm playing the quiet slav so in the okay play semi-slav okay now i'm gonna just develop my knight we're in a semi-slav defense we're gonna see how how much our opponent knows about okay okay very good and b5 yes now my opening knowledge of the semi-slav is not that high but i think they play a6 and knight bd7 okay so we see already at at 1900 level they're like very very well versed right at some point we are going to leave known territory i don't exactly know when that's going to be so i'm gonna push in the center this might come it seems like my opponent is thinking i okay they play h6 i i what i want to do now is i want to play queen e2 move my bishop and and connect my rooks that's my plan okay i have absolutely no idea of what i'm doing is right but it's definitely not wrong okay it's definitely not wrong and now we're gonna see how well you know 1900 level chess flows into into the middle game okay knight to b6 fighting for those squares also queen is opened up that's not a threat and that might be an issue pawn to b4 so what i'm going to do is i'm going to anticipate that i'm going to play a3 last game the move a3 was bad it was bad because there was castling there already there's no castling in this position let's develop our bishop actively and let's put our rooks on d1 and c1 very tough to understand where do you put your rooks i think the e-file is not gonna open so i'm not gonna put my rook on e1 i'm gonna put my rook here and here because i think this is the area of the board that's going to open up okay that's a relatively normal move but at the 1900 level just a random night jump like this might not really work because if anything the knight is just a target now like my opponent might actually just go back which happens pretty frequently at this level you just sort of like poke the night out and you go yeah but see now i can use that knight's positioning to activate my pieces and my move is not an over commitment this move was an over commitment of the night it did not do any long-term benefits and now by moving my knight i'm creating a same side attack so i have very powerful center and i can play f5 i think f5 is rushed but i'm gonna play i'm gonna play it it's i don't think it's the best move but this happens sometimes i say it's not the best move it turns out to be the best move but we're gonna see so they took their i take back okay now they're attacking my pawn now i i do have a feeling i have a very powerful attack but let's guard our pawn first so let's play bishop f4 again i'm not crazy about this i think i've definitely misplayed let's see if my opponent can you know start fighting back a little bit with knight c5 okay i can defend my bishop but i'm 1900 i was taught bishops are better than knights but now queen d4 check could be a little annoying for me and then i have to decide okay pawn takes i'm gonna take back this does look very strong i mean my my center puns do look very very good knight d5 wow okay so hits this hits this i can take i can ignore i can move my bishop would i rather than i take my knight or my bishop i think i would rather lose my knight and keep my bishop right so i think i'm gonna keep my bishop because i want to support my center i don't mind if you take my knight but we're gonna see maybe and i didn't want to activate this but then maybe i could have played here so it's still very complicated right now at the 1900 level we're comparing the quality of the pieces right now i have much more central space i have a much safer king mostly because of all of this like knocking on the door and the quality of my pieces is higher f6 i slide in here and i think this wedge is gonna win me the game i think my opponent had to take a moment there and and breathe okay my pawn is hanging i can defend it with my queen and that counter attacks the knight and now i think this is just simply a matter of you know peace quality i i just think i'm i'm dominant here you don't really want to trade bishop for night but i think at the 1900 level you kind of understand the concept of superseding like yes bishop for knight is not usually a good trade but i think in this instance given my long-term advantage with the wedge i should be in decent shape however nothing is guaranteed like really nothing is guaranteed let's go rook f4 hitting the queen and utilizing its awkward position and then we're gonna start an attack on the king and by start i mean it's very much already in progress and we're able to do this because we have more space which is restricting the black position and this bishop is just kind of out of commission so right now we we have a very very very clear plan which is attacking the king so clear in fact i'm gonna go here will my opponent find wow in one second they find the queen trade amazing that is amazing stuff like we're really seeing the levels here that is expertly done expertly done i have to say and i might have to work overtime for this game wow okay i don't want to trade because it'll help them open up the position so i think i'm gonna like defend my queen and keep the tension they might play c5 like they might i can take and then maybe bishop c7 but this is hardly clear i mean this was excellent stuff by my opponent this might blunder hope they don't blunder that that would be tragic this is great i mean the the 1900 fighting back from the worst position by trading the queens they were just moments away from defeat bishop h6 was was lights out excellent bit of counter play wow in fact how do i even defend my pawn wow this is incredible rook to d5 okay so i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to create my own counter play they're gonna get this pawn amazing i mean honestly just amazing stuff really just showing the the levels i have to invest in my dark squared pawn i'm gonna i'm gonna boot that rook down there so we're in an end game now i mean we are we are past the middle game i can take this and still put the the bishop in the rook like down there so i'm just building behind the one remaining pawn that i have and the way you have to win this is you have to you have to win the end game there's no other way you have to boot the rook like this and i think we're gonna trade off the other rook and we're just gonna leave black with a with a very very very bad rook that's what's gonna happen so we had a good position for a very long time but that doesn't always guarantee victory like i i i'm utilizing literally all of my life force to win this game i'm gonna get this pawn and then i'm gonna promote but i'm only gonna win because i'm completely controlling the the opposition which is which is crazy and of course at some point he will probably sacrifice but that will be a that is a loss so if you lose the rook you're gonna lose i'm now attacking this pawn and ultimately this game is simply going to come down to the fact that my pieces were of just a of a higher quality oh i could have queened that was that was my bad that was very embarrassing let's go rook b8 and set up a discovered attack backwards which that's a little maybe maybe he'll see that actually yeah it was it was tough now with this i the second time i will not make that mistake okay that was funny and now i sh i mean i should have a mate let me check let me win the rook check and and opponent resigns my friends i actually think that after something like queen b6 yeah i mean he was equal he found rook d5 this shows you the levels to this game my friends i mean of course i i like i am allowing opportunities in in this video right but it's up to my opponents to claim them black is dead lost in this position if not for the move queen b6 and you know when my opponent played this they could have gone into my territory but instead my opponent deliberately played queen to b6 nerfing my attack here and rook d8 keeping the tension you know how many intermediate players would have just taken the queen because they're like if i don't take the queen right now i'm gonna lose rook d8 rook g3 what a move understanding that i i am too powerful here and winning the pawn and here i had to fight back i had to find this maneuver to boot the rook at the end of the board but it's equal it is an equal end game with best play i mean this just shows you how hard it is to put away a 2000 rated player and the only reason my opponent lost is because they allowed my rook into their position that's it when i played rook d1 they could have just played king e6 and i am never getting in one movement lost this game for my opponent and it was g5 g5 move 41 lost the game because i got in with my rook i won the pawn and now this is a loss because you cannot stop this you just can't stop it because my rook and bishop and pawn and are just too powerful what an instructive game what an instructive game what an instructive video i could have queen but i was on autopilot and the opening was was yes it was slightly better for me because my opponent played it a little bit passively like here i was i was definitely much better like point six point seven then the attack cultivated like this and i did mention i didn't play the most accurate way i think f5 was rushed and i was right i said i don't like f5 i should have been more patient right i should have played rook d1 rook here look at my opponent creating counter play like this position is is better for white it's plus one but i mean it's it's hardly winning but my friends i did tell you f5 was a rushed move and it did lose me a major chunk of my advantage and it's just very cool to see my you know my opponent fighting back like i could have gone here they could have taken and and yeah i mean resilience to the max like this was probably my biggest advantage in the game something like point you know 1.3 1.4 but the comeback was just incredible queen a5 queen b6 rook d5 excellent stuff and we saw in this video several things we saw the beginner massively over perform the beginner game was crazy my opponent over performed in that game primarily due to the nature of the position i would say that because they played very good principal chess and it was a closed position not a lot of blunders were possible they played really really really well the intermediate played a good game i would say they played like right around their level but just kind of a fundamental misunderstanding of how to handle their opening a little bit too respectful of my counter play one or two strategic decisions and missed opportunities the 1900 2000 player played sensational just like fighting on until deep into the 40 50 move only reason i was able to to win this game is is because i found the one winning idea which is what a 22 2300 would find which is booting the rook down there and if you've never seen this you'll never find that you'll never find that trading off the other rook and infiltrating with mine so i had to squeeze maximum opportunity out of this position to win it which i'm not sure a fellow 2000 would have been able to do so that was fun let me know if you enjoyed the video i'll see in the next one get out of here
