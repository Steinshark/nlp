this construction project taking place in a small 
town just outside munich in germany is going to   take 1,200 years to complete the only problem 
is there's a math mistake in the plan and it's   already too late to fix [music] it this is an 
art installation it's called the zeitpyramide   which translates literally from the german as time 
pyramid and it was put in to celebrate the 1,200   year anniversary of the town right there called 
wemding and i got to say as an installation i   absolutely love this i think it's very clever cu 
the idea was how on earth can humans appreciate   1,200 years when our lifespan is so much shorter 
than that and so what the artist manfred laber   decided to do was start an installation that's 
going to take 1,200 years to finish so they they   designed a pyramid made from 120 of these giant 
concrete blocks and they put in one more block   every decade the first layer of the pyramid 
is an 8x8 grid of cuboids meaning there are   64 blocks that will go in on the ground level 
and once they're done the pyramid is over half   finished the next layer would not be a 7x7 grid 
this is only using the square numbers there will   be a 6x6 grid put in for 36 more blocks resting 
on top of the first layer and they will line up   perfectly so instead of bridging between the 
blocks each one sits perfectly on top of the   block below future generations can work out how 
that works structurally we then carry on the even   square numbers so a 4x4 grid for 16 and finally a 
2x two for the top four making a total of20 blocks   now that's a blocky pyramid the first recorder 
mentioned of wemding was in the year 793 which is   why in 1993 it was the 1,200 year anniversary 
and the first block went in as well as the   concrete pad for the rest of the pyramid 10 years 
later this one went in in the year 2003 this one   went in in 2013 and the next one will go in in the 
year 2023 which is this year in fact it's going in   tomorrow that's why we're here i want to see the 
fourth ever block go in i want to see it increment   up by one block and for me that's why this is such 
a genius bit of art because this i can appreciate   like this this is the scale of my lifetime i was 
12 when this went in i was 22 when this went in i   was 32 when this went in i'm currently 42 when 
that one's going to go in and i'll see you all   here in the year 2033 when i'm 52 oh my goodness 
for the next one up so as a human i can appreciate   this scale even though it's incredibly slow but i 
look at the whole thing i'm like like there's no   way that that's going to take forever well it's 
not if they' started building this when wemding   was first founded it'll be done by now like it 
is an achievable amount of time it's just more   than we can imagine but we can appreciate it by 
watching if every you know each new generation   in wemding we'll see a few more of these go in 
and they'll get a sense of the passing of time   and then 2,400 years after vending was originally 
founded the time pyramid will be finished except   it won't that's the mistake they made here is 
a fence with four bits of fence and most people   would say that there are therefore four fence post 
but there aren't there's the one at the front over   here if we get rid of it now there's as many 
posts as fences but we put it in there's one   more this is called the fence post problem it's 
a one of a whole category of problems that often   happen in programming caught off by one errors 
in this case everyone forgets there's always   one more post than there are fences this can be 
annoying because it's very counterintuitive for   example if you were a cleaner who worked from 800 
in the morning until 12:00 and you had to clean a   building from the eighth floor to the 12th floor 
that looks fine but 8 to 12 that's 4 hours but   the eighth floor to the 12th floor is five floors 
because the time the hours we're counting the es   but the floors are the posts it's so easy to be 
off by one and in this case yes if you have 120   decades and you start counting from 1993 you will 
stop in the year 3,193 the 2,400 year anniversary   of wemding however while there are 12 decades 
if you count all of these individual celebration   years there are 121 celebration years because of 
the extra fence posts so if you have 120 cuboids   in your pyramid you put the first one in in 1993 
you will then put the last one in in 3183 10 years   too early because you're not putting them in 
on the decades you're putting them in on the   in between years and look at it each year has a 
decade after it so we're going to stop and then   have a decade after it they made a classic off 
by one era era or no era the big day was here   and people had gathered from all across germany 
and the world to see this block been put in i   traveled a long way as well as me my mathematical 
friend ayliean macdonald had joined me to see the   momentous cuboid lowering moment they had a 
special wooden jig to make sure they could   perfectly space it away from the other blocks 
and of course there was a massive crane yeah   it little feet came down so it can support the 
6.5 tons of concrete and then even on the the   mortar bit there's four much less substantial 
feet to kind of support going to rest on those   yeah so you're thinking that there's going to be 
a sandwich situation i think a sandwich situation   where they they kind of spread down some concrete 
and then lower it into that and those little feet   just keep a bit of a separation there someone gets 
the job of like wiping around the edge yeah yeah   and a little while ago they rigged up the crane so 
they managed to get these chains down there were   two bits of rebar on the top of the block and they 
kind of clip them onto that and so i guess in a   moment we wait lifts it up puts it in place we're 
excited everyone's excited look at the thronging crowd while we waited for the grand lowering i 
thought i would find out if anyone cared about   this off by one era and while the artist has 
very sadly passed away i was able to talk to   their daughter barbara the one off problem 
it's a famous problem is it yeah yeah it's   quite interesting i i don't know but i'm 
quite i i haven't been that much in touch   with the whole trust and everything before this 
event it's only developed after my dad died   so i don't know what conversations they l part 
i i i'm quite sure that they considered that   problem even though i'm quite sure that they 
didn't know it's my. ayliean was also on the   case and she managed to find someone involved 
in the project who admitted that with only 1,00   blocks you either have a very boring start or a 
very boring finish of course the yeah what to do   really when it is finished right so do you put 
the extra stone are you just celebrating somehow   yeah but also starting without an event is is 
tough right so i think it it is an abstract con   concept in the first place then at last it was 
time for the fourth block to be lowered in and   given how hot a summer day this was we were all 
very very ready but of course before that bit of   a ceremony an old guy played a bunch of tunes on a 
clarinet that all somehow related to the word time there was a bunch of speeches from local 
politicians and then it happened the crane   lifted the cuboid up into the air swung it across 
the site and gently lowered it down into the   waiting jig and mortar sandwich i did not envy 
the construction people having to low in a very   heavy concrete block while hundreds of people were 
staring at them with anticipation that person's   watching so closely i'm amazed they didn't bring 
their own spirit level finally the fourth block   was in and everyone celebrated the atmosphere 
was fantastic i however managed to hunt down   a software developer someone who worked on the 
augmented reality version of the zeitpyramide in   one last attempt to find someone who cared about 
the off by one era we're here mainly because of   the the off by one era do you know what the 
plan is like i know it's a long time away yeah   is there a plan to the fact it's going to finish 
10 years early the the date of 3,183 and 3,193   it's the last zone is going to be set on 83 
yep but to finish up the art projects we have   last decade like it's going to be finished on 
93 so you'll have 10 years of celebrations yeah   yeah last 10 years just to realize now it's 
finally done yeah and then the big and then on   the big anniversary the 2,400 year anniversary 
yeah we're going to celebrate it really big if   you're there but nope lucas didn't seem that 
worried either but that was it the day was   over we all went home the sun set ready for the 
first dawn of a new evolution of the zzeitpyramide [music] yep those are blocks four of them you 
know they really didn't care that they're going   to have a problem in 1,170 years i mean what's 
the future's problem i i have an idea to fix   it oh really yeah do you yeah may yeah okay so my 
idea i want to make clear is not a pyramid scheme   right it is a pyramids scheme all right let's 
see it right pyramids what are you thinking so   i have an exciting opportunity for the people 
of 20 years time right because once we have six   blocks so two more over here yeah we could then 
start creating a pyramid which does include   the odd square numbers of bas yeah so some of 
the the second layer will touch four of 36 so   we do we get to six yep mh then we extend out into 
the 6x6 yep 36 6x6 5x5 25 16 yep nine oh y okay so   that should total 91 right and then we start on 
the second pyramid now this one is a little bit   smaller yep still using the odd square numbers 
but it starts at 4x4 no there is a little bit   of an issue because either we'll have to extend 
the the the kind of base foundation cuz you got   a 6x6 and a 4x4 yes so you really need a 10x 10 
mhm this is 8 by8 or or and i'm leaving this to   the future people in what the theme 900 years 
time 910 years time once the first larger   pyramid is complete we could create an upside 
down pyramid funnel on top going the other way   mhm yep oh that's really nice and they'll have 
the structural blah blah blah by then yeah it's   a thousand years from now mhm that's really nice 
so i thought triangle numbers not laying out a   triangle but like going up in a triangle mh and i 
was like well 120 121 we're not talking triangle   numbers but 55 is a triangle number that's the 
first 10 numbers summed 1 through 10 55 if you   double that you get 110 11 to go and 11 is the 
next number after oh so what you can do is do   1 one and then 2 two and then 3 three 44 all the 
way up to 10 and then 10 and then 11 121 that's   21 numbers in total which is itself a triangle 
number oh it's the sixth triangle number so we   do a triangle spiral so we do we do six so same 
as you we we don't have to decide who plan for   another 30 years 10 years from now boom 20 years 
we're up to six i then suggest we take a right   angle so we do six and then we do five this way 
and then after you done five this way you then   turn and you do four this way and four this way 
will line you up with that one here okay y then   you do three this way which will get you one short 
of there yeah then you do two this way which will   get you back to here and then you do one this 
way right in the middle this will be 11 right in   the middle so so it'll go up as a triangle number 
slope uhhuh bit like low res and then it'll spiral   around to have the pillar in the middle so it's 
a triangle slope in a triangle spiral face least   so you're actually going to lose less space than 
this foundation p you're going to have an excess   yeah well the same is if we do your double upside 
down pyramid it's all going to be a 6x6 footprint   which means you've got like a place to sit and 
view we put some seats in it'll be lovely it's   going be great yeah yeah one of those de we've got 
a while to decide in the comments below if you've   got a better idea put it in the comments we will 
read them this time i promise so you can give us   another suggestion for 121 but you have to start 
these are you're not allowed to move these or you   can vote which one of ours the the double pyramid 
ridiculous spiral i actually might vote for yours   i think it's nice a now i want to vote for yours 
i'm of the opinion now that the mistake is part   of the artwork because if we open the door to 
changing it as we go then we're probably not   going to end up with the finished product that 
matches manfred's original vision and for me that   is the artwork one person had a plan it's being 
executed over tens of generations of humans and i   think that's pretty amazing and i think we'll do 
it i know people are going to be very skeptical   i think it's possible i believe once we get past 
the first row so 40 years from now we're putting   in the last block over there i'll be 82 if the 
next block goes in and actually i don't know if   they're going to zigzag or spiral around or left 
to right or whatever but once we're on to the next   row that's escape velocity and i feel like then 
people like 10 years is such a perfect amount   of time because it's within very recent memory of 
the previous one and no one wants to be the first   generation that breaks it after a mere 10 years 
so i think once we get past the first row it will   carry on even if it stops going i mean the temple 
of zeus in athens ancient greeks started that they   stopped it's that they untouched for hundreds 
of years there was one attempt to restart it and   then the romans show up centuries later i mean 
only they had the ego to roll in and hadrian's   like you know what i'm going to finish it and 
they picked up the project and finally finish   it so i think even if this does grow to a halt i 
suspect a century or two later it'll start back   up again and the concrete will last i mean we've 
got roman buildings made of concrete from well   over 1200 years ago so i think the material will 
stand i think the technology will advance i think   the only significant change will be i suspect it 
won't always be concrete i suspect it'll be the   same shaped cuboid but what it is will change 
like maybe there'll be some granite ones maybe   towards the end they'll be 3d printed in place i 
don't know who knows what's going to happen with   technology and materials but i believe the shape 
will happen and yeah i suspect in 1,160 years from   right now the 120th block will go in and then 
there'll be 10 years of dwelling on their math   mistake there you have it thanks for watching the 
video and we'll see you all here literally exactly   here in the year 2033 put it in your diaries right 
now it's going to be very exciting i can't wait to   see the next installation but now that we're all 
done this time we were chatting about we've   seen a lot of interesting responses and i feel 
like there's kind of three different responses   people have to this ridiculous artwork you can 
either hate it it's not for you some people really   don't like it i can already feel the comments it's 
okay it's okay not to like it it's up that's the   point you can love it that's me so you know 
i i finally put my finger on it i cuz i love   going to old ruins from previous civilizations 
because of that sense of time and this for me is   the same sensation but in reverse like i'm still 
looking at just a few rocks but i'm looking at the   beginning of something that would be here for 
millennia as opposed to looking back i i think   it's great i really really like it you could be 
terrified by i mean time is a terrifying concept   and starting something that takes this long it 
takes a lot of courage it's yeah it's quite   daunting but in a in a beautiful way a beautiful 
kind of terrifying because there's a lot of hope   in that i think so yeah it's making us think long 
term lucie hates it my wife lucie she get it's   like the the agoraphobic version of time and the 
fact that like she's like but it just stresses her   about the effort and the time required so it's 
fine you it's art it's producing emotions it's   definitely it's definitely art yeah if you want to 
see more of the outside of this ayliean is doing a   you're doing a a video on tik tok yes it'll be 
vertical that's the one if you're sick of this   horizontal ratio we'll link the tik tok below and 
thank you so much for coming along this has been   a huge amount of fun i was so worried cuz i got 
co 11 days before the flight like that's when the   symptoms started i was like i should be okay but 
i don't know and you've been an excellent replace   m thank you for coming along and filling in well 
i mean the people of the third block had no idea   that that could even be an issue who yeah there 
would have been a pic between the third block and   the who knows by the time ah wow stay tuned i mean 
don't do other stuff but in 10 years come back
