ladies and gentlemen it is my pleasure to welcome you to the highest stakes chess tournament of the entire calendar year this is the grand swiss the grand swiss is a tournament which is exactly in its name it's not a tall person from switzerland it is a tournament where chess players are paired against each other based on the amount of points that they have and the average strength of this field is completely ridiculous it's probably something like 2600 elo and the prize for winning it or getting second place is a trip to the candidates tournament the candidates tournament is an eight-player tournament the winner of the candidates place for the world chess championship so two people from the grand swiss are going to make it to the candidates this is round number one we've got hikaro playing we have fabiano caruana playing and at the same time as this tournament we have the women's grand swiss so we're going to be seeing an incredible batch of players over the next next 10 days or so with some rest days included this first recap is spectacular we have hikaro we have fabiano we have hans neeman playing in the event we have an amazing game and this game at the end features three queens so you can't really ask for a better recap than this let's just jump right into the action and magnus is not participating because he doesn't want to because he doesn't want to participate in the world chess championship c i'm not sure magnus is going to play in the candidates at all so that's that's why there's no magnus cuz he's not qualified by anything other than rating i'm pretty sure also i would just like to say a major thank you to all of you that have gotten the book the book came out yesterday on october the 24th and there was a live in-person event in brooklyn new york which sold out there are a couple more events november the 4th and 14th link will be in the description for all of you fourth is almost sold out as well free ice cream and a book signing and if those do well i will travel a little bit more around the us and maybe like london and europe to do some more of those thank you all for coming out it was an amazing time and talked to 250 people took some photos signed some books signed everybody's book i think hikaru begins his campaign against rasos swan who's a german grandmas young guy hikaro goes for an italian an american a german playing italian in the aisle of man kn f6 bishop c5 black plays this setup with h6 h3 and the game opens up on move 14 when after a bunch of maneuvering that neither you nor i understand so therefore i will skip it there are other youtube channels that will probably spend 20 minutes on each of these moves in the history i'm not going to waste your time with that you don't care i don't care nobody cares d5 on move 14 hikaru's transferring his knight in an e45 position to the g3 square and rosmos plays d5 now there's about to be an explosion in the center of the board white can take on e5 he can also take on d5 he can also do nothing if he does nothing black is probably going to take a couple of times and then take and then get the bishop out so very high chance everything gets traded very quickly and the game ends in a draw but hikaro takes on d5 and allows black to plant this pawn here and do this okay so clearly this move by hikaru is prep i don't think he's winging this but the computer likes black's position here like if you look look at hikaru's clock you know he played knight f1 he took six minutes on that move and then i'm assuming he decided to go for this entire sequence relatively quickly and play f3 trying to get rid of this either it's prep or he's just making things up we have a trade and queen f3 and black just went queen c6 and rasos just had a nice position he's just going to develop his bishop and his rook and hikaru is not really getting off the ground here you know he's it's taking him a little while to kind of get back into the game black transfers the bishop back and around here you'll notice stockfish is loving black's position like right here the two bishops staring down at white's position apparently here rosmus could have just gone for it now obviously hikaro had something in the he was not just going to like lose of the move h5 happen but the computer was loving black's position here thought that black had very very good activity knight f4 knight e4 opportunities but rosmus takes and does this and hikaru trades and just re routes the knight a couple of times to the f3 square and he's just a moment away from consolidating and he trades the knights takes the pawn back and now it's a dead draw it's a dead draw there is still a little bit of life here with you know enough pieces but at the end of the day it has to do with the bishops because the bishops are on an opposite color and both sides have the exact same pieces like queen rook and five pawns very likely that the game will end in a draw and the players do secure a position in an end game where despite black being a pawn up opposite colored bishops are virtually unwinable and we get this position where by a miracle of god black does not hang checkmate in one and the players make a draw rosmos plays queen f5 and does not play on in this end game because this is a draw opposite colored bishops black cannot really make any progress despite being upon up so probably not like the start hikaro would have dreamed of starting in this tournament but he didn't lose and he was never really in any danger of losing on a human level but on a computer level the computer was just was ready to start slaughtering i don't know what hikaru's idea after h5 was but i would imagine you know black would have went here and hikaro would have taken the knight for example bishop d2 here here he would have taken maybe rook e4 rook f1 i don't know but computer is loving the position here fiano carana started with the black pieces versus ivan shadic shadic is a croatian grandmaster very good player formerly 2700 and fabiano came to fight i mean he said i saw a photo online that said fabiano lost his suitcase well he didn't lose it but the airline did which is like sort of an amenity of flying now if you fly in the year 2023 you should just be ready not to have a suitcase when you land that's why i always bring my stuff on the plane okay knight f3 d6 fabiano plays the most confrontational sicilian there is the nidorf that is just a silent indication that you want to fight it's like in hockey and if you watch hockey two guys look at each other nod their heads puck drops gloves off we don't even like non-negotiable bishop d3 this is a pretty big sideline there are no less than 15 moves against the nter of sicilian and bishop d3 is actually one of them and now black plays g6 so kind of you know if in this position black went g6 it would be a dragon sicilian white would play here here here and long castle but now that white committed to this move black says you know what i'm going to play g it's kind of like a dragon df dragon df variation and black immediately plays b5 so from fabiano's prep you can tell that he probably spent a bit of time here 10 minutes i mean he was probably remembering some analysis he was probably or maybe he was trying to deviate from his own analysis maybe like knight c5 or whatever and shage played a4 which is a principled move b4 and now this move d5 striking in the center of the board and a very tense moment black breaks chess principles moves multiple things two times in the opening before castling or anything like that but tough position for white because if you take you allow this if you allow this then you're just much worse because black just gets very powerful dark screw bishop if you don't take i'm going to take you i'm going to open up the center so here shot thinks plays bishop h6 spends 25 minutes on that move now there's a rule in chess especially in classical chess if you spend 15 minutes on a move it's going to be a bad move if you spend 25 minutes on a move move is going to be terrible like you are definitely going to regret it there's a lot of moves in this position also there's a hanging pawn which is probably just like a slightly misd detail but black will get rook b8 queen c7 knight e5 and very quick attacks on this queen side here which i guess white did not want to bring together so fabiano takes and despite fabiano not being castled he takes and now shage does something weird i mean i would have taken here with the pawn but i'm also not playing at the grand swiz we have take take take and queen c7 another very tense moment which way will white castle will white castle at all will black castle at all right because black can't castle this way and i'm i'm assuming black's not going to go that way either shage castle short and fiano here can play bishop b7 bringing out his bishop if queen g7 hitting the rook there's always rook f8 he can play knight f6 can play queen c5 pinning and threatening the moveie e5 he could play e5 right away but it's a very committal pawn move you kind of might you know bonk the queen the knight into your own attack goes here and here shage must have watched one too many gotham videos because in this position he sacrificed his rook and i'm not yelling it because it did not have the intended effect rook takes f6 is a very interesting move because now the queen slides in and he wins this pawn and shage must have thought knight f4 knight d5 queen e7 mate and if black plays queen e7 i'll play queen c6 check and i'll win his rook so rook takes f6 but when you play rook takes f6 like going all in he's got an hour on the clock i mean the other guy's going to figure it out rook f6 might work in a blitz game i'm not saying it was a bad move i'm not saying that i'm just saying you got to be damn sure when you give away a rook for a knight that's it you're playing one of the best calculators on the planet his middle name is literally stockfish did you know that fabiano his middle name is stockfish his parents named him fabiano stockfish carana i'm not even sure stockfish existed when he was born in 1992 or whenever he was born queen g7 queen f6 and faby just goes here so again shage gave away the rook like he knew what was going to happen and then he spends 3 minutes plays 9 of four again shot's idea quite simply like let's say black plays rook d8 is to go knight d5 if bishop takes pawn takes and then rook takes d5 there is rook e1 so knight f4 queen d8 what does white do now how are you going to attack me check i block you run to the side i bring my rook in this position the only move for white is apparently g be six and the idea is like let's say queen c5 queen b7 queen d4 check black's king is stuck in the center shage misses that he doesn't go queen b6 he plays knight d3 and now f5 and now queen b6 is too a little too late because the black rook is plugged in the black rook is plugged into to the attack or defense knight f4 f takes fabiano cleans up completely defends himself swarms back and just avoids getting checkmated queen f2 this is coming rook c2 is on the way queen f5 back if i ever want to play defense queen f7 if i want to play defense and shage resigns a very very nice game very very nice game fabiano starts the grand swiss with a win with black you literally can't ask for anything better fabiano fans stand up he is definitely making the candidates and and fabiano is now after that game fabiano caruana is 2798 he is now 30 points away from magnus carlson the last time somebody was 30 points away from magnus carls was a very long time ago i think it was 2018 so he is back and he is he is the number two in he's the number two in the world and it ain't close i got more games for you i got hans smokey neeman versus elham amar if you don't know who elham omar is by the way elham amar is actually elham abdul that was i think he adopted the last name i guess it would be of one of his parents cuz i don't think you can just choose a last name out of th air i've had that i've had situations like that before i know folks that like just take a take on a different last name from from one of their parents or the other but he's a very strong young player from norway and he has talked trash to me like no less than 20 times over blitz games on chess.com of which he wins most and he's a i mean he's been a good player for for as long as i've been streaming so this is a very exciting match up cuz they're both very strong players this one not a knorf but a classical sicilian bishop to g5 this is the rouser variation queen to d2 a6 and hans just makes a bunch of preparation moves he develops everything plays this bishop g5 it's all all typical sicilian stuff now it's elham who actually takes the knight queen takes and queen c7 also hans is spending a lot of time in the opening like bishop g5 queen d2 i don't really know what he was thinking about i mean i don't know why he needed six minutes to play queen d like what else could he have i don't even know f3 king b1 etc and now queen goes back to d2 so black is up 30 minutes on the clock then he plays b5 he's still not thinking hans plays h4 black plays h6 he's still not thinking h5 he's still not thinking alham has played every move instantly bishop g5 hans is now down 37 minutes on the clock b4 he's still not thinking knight to e2 a5 he's still not thinking this is apparently all prep c4 played by hans black spence 40 what black 54 minutes what bro played 16 moves memorized memorized he he memorized the moves from his opening course and in this position white can take on p white can take the pawn both moves are bad i guess e5 and then bishop f6 and queen d7 ideas black can also play like queen b7 bishop a4 pawn to a4 black could castle castling is bad because it allows white to play pawn to e5 but oh my god he spent how much time on this move and then on his next move he spends another five minutes and now he's back right he he gets the setup that he's looking for meanwhile hans just puts a knight on f5 right that move that you just spent an hour making it just gave hans an idea knight knight here and knight here right so he's trying to put the knight on f5 and that's exactly what he does now alham strikes back in this another 20 minutes now he's down to 20 minutes d was up 40 minutes on the clock right oh my goodness so now oh my god my friends there is a dog behind me and he just farted so badly oh god oh my god i'm not even exact i wish you could smell this y'all got i mean oh dear lord i couldn't even hold it together i was like you know there's that meme that's me right now oh wow i i'm going to take him out after this is over he's just napping he just farted in his sleep disgusting bishop takes and pawn takes d5 okay so the reason why alham play that was nasty the reason why alham played this move d5 he knew he was going to lose the pawn but desperate times call for desperate measures right and if he was not spending so much time he might have played queen c5 he might have prepared it a little bit but he decides to force this position where he's a pawn down but he feels like he's going to be all right yeah no hans just goes d6 and g4 and yeah black tries to create counterplay hans takes black tries to create counterplay hans attacks black tries to sacrifice a bishop to create counterplay 30 seconds on the clock for elham and yeah it does not go very well well rook g7 rook g5 hitting the queen i think there might be a followup king d2 and and he just gets out he just walks his king and very nice game from hans demon rook h5 nice little tactic after king h5 there is queen h7 what a that was easy i mean that that came easily for hans i mean he spent a lot of time but he played a lot of good principled moves controlled the bishop there and then this one move just like really just def fuddled black who went for a certain setup that allowed white to get the knight to f5 and i think there was just a lot of self-doubt at this point black forc the position where he was upon down nice little removing the guard tactic just a very nice game from hans now i told you i would end today's recap with a very very very fun game this is another very fun game this is max vardon versus leevon aronian and this game i want to show you something this is a four nights english where black in instead of taking this knight and getting hit with a center pawn fork and then bishop b4 and then d e5 and then knight e4 and then queen d4 and then knight c3 bc3 bishop e7 there's this line instead of going for all that levon plays queen e7 and let me tell you something right now my friends the pawn structure you see on the board resembles the one and only eric rosen's stafford gambit e4 e5 knight f3 knight f6 knight e5 knight c6 knight takes and pawn takes and now basically what happens in the actual game itself ends up resembling that position very closely because if you look at this position this is exactly what happens in the game look except white has a pawn on c4 so white got an extra move but is that pawn on c4 good or bad look at black's position look at black's activity this is amazing stuff queen c2 black goes knight g4 and levon just fires with f5 the position's equal but he sacrifices a bishop to open up the center look at this look at this look at this look at this an avalanche down the ednf files white has to defend himself he gives away the bishop and he castles long but he loses the g pawn material balance has been restored now we're in an end game queens and rooks b6 h5 levon playing quickly and confidently g5 it's a completely equal position black is a touch better black has a little bit more activity and this is a backwards pawn backwards pawn is a pawn that cannot move forward the opponent completely controls the square in front of it and it's also stuck behind pawns if it had a pawn here it would help rook g4 levon taking space away and he's playing look at levon just every move very f rook c i mean rook c4 is a nice little tactic and you see rook c4 was not possible a move ago so black went g4 setting up probably rook c4 white could have maybe played rook e5 but rook c4 is just smooth and if takes rook takes and queen e3 and maybe in this position max thought he had this move but he gets hit with rook c2 and the point is that after take take rook h5 black's rook is more active and levon plants the rooks on the second rank this is a master class in how to play rook end games rook d2 he wins the pawn and wins that pawn he's going to win that pawn as well in the moment two pawns and and this is four on two and he's going to march down he is going to take all the space b3 check and in this position badam just resigns he can keep the king close but after something like rook g3 king c4 you can try to run i'm going to put put my rook here you're going to come back and i'm going to pry away your defenses what a game and what an opening what an opening from levon this super topical line in the english knight takes e5 i've never seen to move queen e7 in my life but now i'm going to start thinking more about it it's just a gambit it's an aggressive gambit line look at that you just you just developed his pieces and he won a great game you know who else won a won a great game one of these guys guys if you had the patience i'm about to blow your mind with this game all right yan kristof started with an english but we didn't have what we had last time black plays h6 this is some new kind of like modern way to play the queen's gambit declined you prevent bishop g5 there's another thing that folks have been doing which is playing like in a in a catalan style they do this and then they play h6 and they prevent bishop g5 then they play bishop d6 and then they play knight c6 this is what they're doing nowadays they're they're putting the knight in front of the c pawn if c5 they just go back and they prevent bishop from coming to g5 so this is kind of like a similar edgy approach with an early h6 bishop d6 and black will play will not play knight c6 in the setup because yan krish just takes a bunch of space right lot of lot of pawns all right terrific black plays a6 black is going to stop this because he's going to chop chop excellent white castles okay knight bd7 white plays a4 black plays e5 outstanding black advancing in the center of the board white can take or ignore and he ignores black takes more space white und develops the knight to d2 black plays knight h7 you will notice neither guy is thinking b5 f5 both guys are playing as if the other does not exist knight b3 trying to go cause some trouble over there black plays a5 trying to seal the position a big mistake here would actually be to rush this move b6 be rushing this move you don't want to rush this move just yet duda plays queen d2 his idea is to put pressure on the pawn on a5 you'll notice black's been a lot of time on that move queen d2 now puya idani plays g5 g5 is all in g5 is if white goes g3 doesn't even matter black's playing f4 after that opens black's going to put the queen here put the knight here put the kn there put the black's going for mate black's going for mate against this king white is going for i don't know what i don't know how white is going to win the game by getting over here ooh knight a5 now if you don't take right if you just don't take when you play f4 i take this then i take this then i take this so your attack is going to fall apart very fast so if you take now i reveal the secret threat right and then if you defend your your rook i will take and then i'm going to play knight to e7 deflecting your queen away so we have knight d5 cd5 queen a5 now my friends in case it's not obvious white is going for this and black is going for this now i'm going to turn off the eval bar and i'm going to show you how absolutely horrifying this attack looks for white f4 a5 f3 many of us would poop our pants then we would start thinking about the position pwn to f3 attacks a lot if you get out of the way i take and i hit your rook you got to do something you play king g2 i'm going to get in here with my queen i'm not going to trade queens a queen trade benefits white look at these monster pawns so instead white took black didn't take back bishop h3 if the queen gets on the g file it's a wrap and and you can't take because that helps the queen get to the g file so bishop h3 guess what he just plays a6 what how is that possible pawn takes f3 now he has to take he he can't he can't avoid this he takes now black responds and pawn takes why pawn takes cuz this is you got to get a queen you got to get a queen cuz a queen is going to hit a rook but who cares about the rook look at g4 oh what a move now again black could have played other things knight to e4 trying to hit the bishop then i would have went a7 black would have taken you're but then i got a queen and it's check you come back i take on d5 i i'm too fast i'm too powerful you're not mating me b takes a6 pawn to g4 and he plays queen b7 trying to make sure a queen trade happens and then rook a8 is played and the pawn is promoted black says queen e6 because i'm going to take and i'm going to go queen g4 white gets the bishop out of the way black plays knight to g5 it's that's it i mean it's it's knight f3 check it's queen g4 a7 on the bo board we are one square away from queening but knight f3 check has arrived white now has to take and then take it's over because queen g4 and a lot of you would say but what about king h1 queen g4 anyway rook g1 bishop g2 oh my god you get smothered in the corner of the board this is insane it's over black has a right he's going to win the game it's not about the queen it's not about the queen it's about the protection of the other queen queen b8 not only does this move win it also prevents checkmate i guess i should have said that backwards not only does it stop checkmate it actually also wins the game now with queen g4 i just do this and my queen is the savior if bishop takes f1 i just make a new queen and when the the dust settles i will make a new queen i will take with a check and then i will grab the bishop and then i will make a new queen so queen to b8 an absolutely ridiculous move black still has some checkmate threats with queen h3 but now white plays the very cool common collected pawn to a8 that pawn secured the promotion which allowed white to make the buzzer beater defensive comeback the second queen is secured and this game hung in a knife's edge but it is y kristof dudo who emerges because after take take check i would just take the bishop i could even go here and run my king to the center but it's all winning what an absolutely ridiculous game of chess which i mean it was black completely all in and losing at the very last moment and throughout the event i will be covering games from both sections from the women's side and also from the open side so keep me posted i will try checking the comments if like it's round one recap and there's amazing games going on in round two post them on the recap the previous recap i will try to check and we will see who wins this tournament we will see what the race for the ratings is like who is at what fabiano number two hikaro number four ali resa number three who is making the candidates who is going to be contending for the next world chess championship feder grand swiss round number one in the books get out of here and keep getting the book it got up to like number 25 on amazon that is absolutely insane you're all incredible bye
