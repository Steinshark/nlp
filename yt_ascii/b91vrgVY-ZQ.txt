- this is the impossible maze. - i'm making it rain on you! logan paul, logan paul, logan paul. - me and my crew spent days designing and building a maze that would be nearly
impossible to complete. the reason the maze is so hard to complete is because you have to
recreate some of my old videos in order to pass certain parts. like at one part, you have to say "logan paul"
1,000 times to proceed. - logan paul, logan paul, logan paul. logan paul, logan paul,
logan paul, logan paul. - another part, you have to ram a lego car into a wall. you see, the whole maze is
modeled around all my old videos, and in order to complete this maze, you basically have to
recreate all my videos. one last thing, you guys know i just hit
7 million subscribers, so the person competing in this maze is my 7 millionth subscriber, i flew him down, and he has 2 hours to complete this maze. if he does not finish this
maze in under 2 hours, he does not get 7 million underscore,
underscore, underscore. if he finishes this entire
maze in under two hours, he gets 7 million underscore, underscore, so make sure watch to the end because if he does finish, it's gonna be really cool what he gets. and, boom, your 2 hours
has officially started. - all right, good.
- so, first thing's first, "buy a car with pennies." give us the pennies, man. - how many pennies? - you have a wheelbarrow.
- all, the whole wheelbarrow. come on, man. you have 2 hours that's dwindling down. - all these pennies is mine? - now you have a car. i think you should try to go through that wall
of duct tape over there with your car. see if 1,000 rolls of
duct tape can stop a car. - i have a different strategy. oh. - keep going. stronger than me. there we go. - oh, shoot.
- oh, wait. - all right, next, as you see on the sign, read the sign out loud. - "donate to attractive twitch streamers." - here you go. i've got
some money for you, man. - aw, nice. - oh.
- i'm making it rain on you. - tyler, thank you so much for donating.
- oh, yeah. sure. - all right, keep going. - "complete minecraft maze." - right here. open up the laptop.
- oh, shoot. - wait, what does that sign say?
- do 10 pushups. yep.
- yep. - dude, you gotta do it.
- one , one. two... eleven!
- let's go, let's go, let's go!
- all right. okay, you win. that's right. - all right, you want to keep going through the maze? - yeah.
- all right. - oh, well.
- aw, man. - it says, "say logan paul 1,000 times." - logan paul, logan paul, logan paul, logan paul, logan paul,
logan paul, logan paul, logan paul, logan paul...
- all right, guys. you guys want to go get some
food while he does that? - yeah, we'll be right back.
- logan paul, logan paul... - he'll be a while or so.
- logan paul, logan paul... logan paul, logan paul, logan paul, logan paul, logan paul... - hey, i'll help him out. logan paul, logan paul,
- logan paul, logan paul, - logan paul, logan paul,
- logan paul, logan paul, - logan paul, logan paul,
- logan paul, logan paul, - logan paul, logan paul,
- logan paul, logan paul, - logan paul, logan paul.
- logan paul, logan paul. let's keep going. - need it to your exit.
- it's all about the ligma research, by the way. - you need it to exit the maze. - okay. "tie your shoe?" - yeah, 'cause we tied
our shoe in every country, or state, something like that. - state. - yes.
- all right. - all right, keep going. - good?
- yep, yes. that's a tied shoe. - "build lego car." will it work? - yeah, you gotta... it says, "build a lego
car." you gotta build it. - you gotta put every lego back on it. - uh, okay. - dude, this was a banger video, man. make sure you build it
right so it goes off. - did you get arrested? - uh, i almost did. didn't you watch the video? - hmm.
- fake fan. - it's almost like he
subscribed at 7 million. - yeah, i'm sweating a little bit here. i'm not gonna lie.
- well, maybe it's 'cause you're wearing
a suit and it's 100 degrees. i think you should ram
that car into that llama, and, if you die, please don't sue me. oh, boy. - you guys, that hurt. - are you still, are you good? - i'm alive. - are you hurt or anything? - i'm good. sorry about the setup, gentlemen. - look at that car. we're about to do a replay. replay! this thing, like, nailed you on the head. you sure you're good?
- no, i'm fine. i promise.
- all right, keep going. - this one, right here.
- ooh. - were you trying to float in the air using these?
- yeah, i... remember how i flew with the
balloons and leaf blowers? you gotta do it.
- okay. i didn't wear a long sleeve
shirt just for this occasion. - wow.
- it's superman over here. - take it off, take it off. - is this going to get you demonetized? - i mean, we can blur it. - aah, got 'em.
- ooh! - honestly, i think one balloon and one leaf blower is enough for flying. whoa! he's flying. - all right, go.
- guys, i can't believe he flew like that. that was insane. - go straight through here. - if we're being honest, we couldn't get the drone to work, so just knock the money off. - hey! - that's exactly how we did in the video. - that's it?
- yep. - wix. - aren't they amazing?
- yeah. - it's a great company that may be sponsoring this video. - yeah.

pretty solid fort. continue. just hit it, just hit it. see that timer up there?

- hey. - do you think this map is helpful? - not really. i kinda see pac-man. up here, we started right
here. this the end point. not a map. seriously
though, it's just a joke. - i'm just saying this maze is... look at the roof. this maze is way bigger than you think. - maybe it's just a prank. - oh, what does this say right here? - "break 4,000 plates?"
- yeah. well, we don't have 4,000. it's only four, like we did in the past. throw it at that wall. - geez. hope you like it. - and more.

more sponsors than us. - all right, this is a game. "pin the arrow on the clickbait." all right, put your hands over your face. so here's the clickbait. - oh, man. not the pleasure. - do you moisturize that?
