i got covered i'm better now mostly but i was stranded in a hotel for two weeks with absolutely nothing to do but watch youtube and stick cotton swabs up my nose at least that's what i would say if not for this this unassuming little box let me connect back to my test bench at the office and do actual work from the comfort of my hotel room i can do crazy things like use my smartphone over 5g to power on this completely ordinary computer without wake on land it's not even plugged into the network and it's not just power i can also see the screen interact not only with windows but even the bios as if i were sitting right in front of the computer right i could even overclock this pc completely remotely how does it work i'm glad you asked and i'm glad you asked about our sponsor g skill their trident z5 neo ddr5 memory is built for amd ryzen 7000 series processors and one click memory overclocking learn more at the link below [music] meet pi kvm v3 is it open source hat for raspberry pi that launched as a kickstarter and started shipping about a year ago let's try it on a laptop plugged in via ethernet the delay actually isn't too bad like the cursor is skipping around a little bit but as good as it kind of is with their claim of 100 milliseconds at best like for a device like this that's amazing that's before you consider your network latency you're not going to want a game on it at all plus 1080p 60 is the absolute most you're going to get now if you're tied on bandwidth you can actually limit the frame rate by yourself in the system menu here and set the bit rate you'd like to use for h.264 encoding which i can switch to right there of course none of this requires anything special from the host pc here because it's completely out of the loop all we have is hdmi and usb plugged into the motherboard here for control and that's it with an inexpensive hdmi splitter you'd never know it was there oh and that reminds me the usb connection here that's for more than just the keyboard and mouse you can use it as a network bridge you could use it for a serial port and even this one is really cool as a usb drive for connecting up disk images i could install an entire operating system without ever needing to physically touch this pc just upload the iso to pi kvm choose the mode you want to use click connect and you're done it can even download images from the internet if you give it an address for you family it gurus out there that means you could remotely diagnose and repair just about any problem you're less savvy relatives might have without having to guide them through the scary outside of windows stuff that they've never seen before and i can't tell you how many times i've had to do that especially as a geek squad guy like trying to talk to somebody on the phone who had no idea what anything was i i didn't know who they were and yeah of course that might bring up some privacy concerns so maybe you could have them leave it disconnected until they need you to make a house call you can always configure it with tailscale vpn's free personal plan so you can access it as soon as it connects without having to worry about networking shenanigans like static ip addresses or port forwarding but okay we've seen what it can do how does it work inside this unassuming little box is a raspberry pi 4 and a specialized hat that provides not only a usb connection and hdmi output but also three total rj45 network jacks the one on the pi itself is to connect to your local network via ethernet as you'd expect and wi-fi is also available though the steel chassis you have here is a little bad for signal strength but the other ethernet ports on the hat are special the one directly above the pies can connect to a serial port with a converter cable if for example you wanted to be able to directly control the pi kvm from the machine it's connected to or communicate with a battery backed ups or other serial control device the port on the other side this is meant for this optional breakout board called the atx adapter as you can probably tell by the lack of electronics on the adapter itself it's not truly ethernet but instead it's breaking up the wires in an ethernet cable to directly hook up to the motherboard's front panel connectors so you've got your power your reset and the power in hdd lids this secondary board has two sets of pins one set goes to the front panel header itself as you see here and the other goes to the cables from your case so you don't lose out on any functionality depending on how neat you want it to be there's enough length on these cables that you can actually use a 3d printed pci bracket to mount the atx adapter directly inside your case or you can just let it dangle and fish the ethernet cable through a suitable opening like a pci slot though some bhb tape will probably go a long way to both insulating the bare contacts on this thing and keeping it safely in place but all this is wired up you've got a perfectly functional normal pc that can be controlled anywhere or at least we're part way there if you bought the whole kit like this then you're already good to go but if you just have your pie in a hat you'll need to do some setup first flashing the memory card is a simple matter of downloading the image using our pi imager or your favorite imaging tool inserting the sd card and hitting right pop the sd card into the pie attach the hat if you haven't already plug it into your network and power it up once it's booted you'll see well not much while you might be able to get away with connecting your web browser to pi kvm.local you'll probably have to find out what ip address the pi kvm grabbed the easiest way to do that is if you've got the whole kit or picked up the oled display it'll save right on it but the next best thing is to take a look at your router's dhcp assignments if you don't have access to that or you're not sure how you can instead use this command to output a list of devices on your network look for one with a mac address containing these patterns and you'll find the ip address next to it punch it into your browser and you're off to the races you'll definitely want to change these default admin passwords before you go any further though and you can do that by going to the web terminal and entering these commands now comes the real magic from the main menu click on kvm and you'll be whisked away to a streamlined interface that might make it admins think of ipmi which is fitting because that's basically what we got here if you click on the atx menu here you can see that you have power and reset buttons as if you were right next to the pc i can turn it off just like this and that it goes if you've connected everything right and you hit that button while it's all off you'll see the boot sequence right in your web browser it's pretty cool but what did it cost if you don't care for fancy things like a case but you also want everything all in one you can get just the custom hat for your pie for 160 us buckaroons but if you do want the whole package you can get them pre-assembled like this with the case cooler oled display 2gig raspberry pi 4 and a 32 gig pre-imaged sd card for an extra 90 bucks for a total of 250 dollars is that a good price kind of feels like it to me commercial options from the big boys run between 500 and a thousand dollars us the only obvious comparison is the also open source tiny pilot voyager 2. a similar pi powered concept wrapped in a more polished commercial package with some extra features that sells for 360 dollars for the it manager looking for something for their server racks the commercial tiny pilot claims to have a superior support system and while i haven't used either support system i degree in principle discord servers are great for building communities but bad for searchability and you can fight me on that the best part about all of this though you're not shy about getting your hands dirty you can build your very own pi kvm or tiny pilot and if you don't care about bells and whistles like ethernet support or the atx power control you can actually build it with a raspberry pi zero two w with no soldering for around fifty dollars unfortunately raspberry pi's are still tough to find right now and the diy route is significantly less polished than either of the other options which are still available so if you're not looking to diy the full pi kvm package here for my money anyway strikes an excellent middle ground it takes nearly every box just like our sponsor squarespace if you want to build a brand online you need a website but learners i just learned how to turn on the little flashlight on my phone how am i going to build a whole website with
