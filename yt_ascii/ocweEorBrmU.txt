hey guys so today we're going to be building in python and instagram bot that will actually show you who does not follow you back this is going to be really quick and really easy to get on your resume and it's also going to be you know something that all of your friends are going to want to try so what you're gonna need is python3 and that's it as long as you install python 3 we will do the rest together and before we continue don't forget to like and subscribe this whole channel is dedicated to helping you get your next internship and building projects is definitely a part of that so what we're going to do is we're going to start writing the code and as we need packages as we need things we're going to install them as we go but right now we shouldn't need anything all we're going to do is say username equals empty password equals empty then we're going to write a main function now if you've ever used python before you know it executes line by line this main function just tells is basically lets us start exactly where we want to start kind of like you would in c or c plus plus and let's print good goodbye world just to mix it up a little bit i'm kind of sick of hello world all right let's go ahead and run that function i'm running python3 i should stop and say if you don't have python installed if you don't have python's three installed go download it i don't have a video here to do it but it's like because it's covered everywhere by everyone like literally pause this video download python3 and come back here it'll take you two minutes it's really not that difficult so python three get follower discrepancies goodbye world there we go now we're on our way to writing selenium code to find the instagram followers so first thing first what we want to do is create the browser window it's called driver so we're going to say driver equals webdriver.chrome webdriver.chrome and then we're going to do chrome what is it chrome webdriver chrome driver manager dot install if you don't know what this code does you don't need to this is one of those things that kind of stays the exact same for me every single time but this web driver if you try to run it it does not exist what we're going to do is from selenium import webdriver now this might be going pretty fast for you but this is like really boilerplate stuff it's gonna there's nothing special to it all this does is create a window and what you'll see is if we run this it'll actually create a chrome window you know let's just run it it'll take two seconds to show you oh of course chrome driver manager this is also not installed let's go ahead and install that if you try to run this right now on your computer it'll say selenium doesn't exist just go ahead and do a pip install do a pip install webdriver manager that that'll get us the chrome driver manager and then do a pip install selenium also there you go you got the dependencies you need from driver manager there pops up dot chrome we want to import chrome driver manager there you go and now we run it oop a wrong one run this one thing that i did wrong here is i actually have to initialize that i have to create i believe this creates an object instance of chrome driver there it's a class i had to initially initialize it so this is kind of calling the constructor if you don't know what that means also not a big deal you can learn it on the side now look at this you might have saw that really quickly it popped up a window if we want to see it for longer what we do is we're just going to import the time function the time class i should say that allows us to do this thing time dot sleep sleep is just going to put the thread to sleep it's a fancy way of saying it's going to pause and we're going to be able to see it there you go this will stay up for 10 seconds before it goes away and what you'll see is once we start writing code it'll start clicking buttons and interacting with this okay so the very first thing we've got a chrome window coming up we need to head to the correct address we need to go to the instagram address so if you do a driver.get this is the function that you need to call just to go to to surf to any url and the url we need to surf to is an instagram one which i have preloaded here you'll be able to find that of course in the git repo now how do i know it's this exact url well i think you just search there and then you just copy it out of the url yeah you just follow go to instagram and take it out of the url also is another option there's no magic there all right now we are going to write the function that's actually going to log us into instagram so one thing i'm going to run this and show you exactly how we're going to start using selenium and this is going to become a pattern we do is look for the element we want to click we go to the inspect tab that's just right click inspect this brings up the html code and we can see specific things about the html look name equals username this is an attribute that's unique to this box so when we can use selenium to specify this box by using this unique attribute same thing for password it's going to say name equals password and that's going to allow us to tell selenium exactly what box we want it to click exactly what box we want it to type things into so you can just say very easily driver dot find element by name right the name was username nothing fancy there look name equals password that's all we're doing we're using that attribute selector that they have pre-installed find element by name we're using the user name now once we have it we're going to do this function called send keys which is a pretty cool function that allows you to actually type things in and we are going to use this username up here so let's try tech in turn and the password we're going to say i don't know is hunter 2 that's not the actual password but you're welcome to try it username driver.find element by name
