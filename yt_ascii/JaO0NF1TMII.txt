ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the channel look you know we we talk about con men of all time con women of all time quite frankly equal opportunity for everybody and today you guys are gonna absolutely die about this i'm late to the story to be honest but it's so good that i decided i'd cover it anyways basically youtube won a free speech award sponsored by youtube what what is this world cup to let's go to the board i gotta show you guys this welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee coffeezilla and yes we're talking about youtube today listen i love youtube they do a lot of great things you can say a lot of positive things about them freedom of speech just ain't one of them right like giving people a platform you know for entertainment making silly goofy videos like this right it's like saying look what's facebook good for it's good for grandma right connecting with grandma it has things that it does but if you gave mark zuckerberg a privacy award you'd be an idiot because every time you log in like 20 russians get sold your information everybody knows it right it's like giving edward snowden you know a secret keeping award it's just not what he does so when you give youtube a freedom of speech award everyone was like what what are you talking about this freedom of expression award that they won from this freedom foundation or something like that and then you go and you find out they sponsored the whole thing they're the signature sponsor so susan's here like saying like i'm honored i'm you know all this you paid for it so what is this award it's called the free expression awards they've been doing it for a while but listen to their own description of what their reward is the free expression awards recognize those who exhibit passion and dedication to free expression including those who have taken personal or professional risks in sharing information with the public are censored or punished by authorities or groups for sharing their work or show courage by pushing boundaries in artistic and media expression ladies and gentlemen youtube has done none of these things so the whole point of these awards is what you think like it's like people who take risks you know one of the winners is julia k brown the person who exposed like the epstein thing right one of the big team reporters she deserves the win soojin wojcicki this lady is like one of the people cracking down on people i mean i think you'd win an award from fighting you know with youtube about censorship or something like that not from being the corporate behemoth that censors a bunch of people and yes i am biting the hand that feeds me and it is probably a mistake i mean you cannot make this stuff up it's too funny not to cover look at that look in the video which is supposed to be celebrating free speech right but the first thing they talk about is the fact that they're removing content and that's the reason they're getting this award check this out it's amazing dude it's incredible and that has been my number one priority we're removing content that violates our policies the number one priority is removing stuff and that's who you gave the free speech award to look the dislikes in this thing are brutal i mean look you can't even see the like to dislike ratio but don't worry you won't be able to see the dislikes soon so don't worry about this youtube so yeah they make this video first thing they talk about is removing and then they don't stop if i summoned into these four different r's the first one would be remove which is that we're always updating our policies and when content is violative of of any of the policies unfortunately we need to remove it so we removed nine million videos last quarter and almost all of them over ninety percent we were removed with machines nine million videos and this is what you choose to talk about during your free speech award acceptance you're like look look how many we got rid of and they're all machines we've created a machine state we're removing videos automatically how could this possibly be something you talk about at least hide it have the decency like let's say you give bp oil you know a green a climate award you wouldn't expect them to talk about their biggest oil spill during the acceptance of that award like at least have the tact to understand where you are and be like look hey we would never like just lie right just lie instead it's like first thing up on our plan remove it's like giving ggp a a humanitarian award and the first thing he says is like the way i've created peace in my society is with the four eyes the first eye being internment camp and you're like okay wait back up this is so weird man it's such a bizarre thing to be watching it's mostly like right wingers that have been covering this but it's everybody that's being affected which is why i'm talking about it because this show is not political but everyone is affected by this not just a guy on one side of the political spectrum or the other you guys need to understand that you should care about this issue of free speech like real free speech regardless of where you sit on the fence she talks about something called borderline content it's borderline and so for that content we'll just reduce meaning we're not going to recommend it to our users it's still on the platform but it's content that is not necessarily recommended by our platform i love this dude this is actually my favorite part of the whole thing and i think she deserves some kind of kind of an award for this performance how can you say with a straight face look it's on our platform we just don't recommend it when your whole platform is a recommendation algorithm it's like netflix being like yeah it's in our catalog we just never show it to anybody it's like wait this this makes those this is why you guys should care though look left right sitter whatever apolitical you should care about this issue of borderline content and youtube producing it because this is one of the most frustrating things of the creator is we can't talk about anything dude i make stories all the time i say i can't run it nobody's going to see it it's not it's going to be demonetized even there's this new thing they don't even recommend the content to the people who want to see it look so a few examples of people who are not on the right talking about this because i feel like it's only people on the right talking about it i don't want to just go from that perspective so here's david pakman talking about borderline content for a second now the terms we have to interpret are borderline content and what it means that youtube claims that they are succeeding that their policy is working to stifle borderline content because when they talk about borderline content it's not just white nationalist stuff it's not just hate speech it's all the independent news content like our channel that gets wrapped up with the hate content and not recommended and it crushes us when youtube now says that this is working what they mean is the algorithm changes they've made are correctly recommending corporate content over hours and it's a disaster that's absolutely right like content just gets tagged borderline you have no way of knowing that and you have no way of correcting or appealing that and then you don't get recommended to anyone and look philip defranco says the same thing check it out but suppressing the flow of news coverage suppressing the flow of information isn't the answer this isn't a you cracking down on misinformation story or situation this is you looking at news coverage of going that's too mature for everybody but that's the world out there right now that's how you scare people away from trying to keep those in power accountable if people know you're going to kill their video and you're killing videos because they're talking about serious accusations how can you hold people accountable people are just not going to bring to light serious stories that's right look this is youtube's golden boy dude there's no one youtube's a bigger fan of than philip defranco and he's out here saying look even my show isn't corporate enough for youtube even my show i can't even do my show because about certain topics because i know youtube's not gonna run with it this is like the most non-controversial creator ever saying i have to censor myself so the irony of youtube coming on and being like look guys hey free speech award and the first thing they talk about is removing content censoring content it's like how does this ever get aired because again you can say a lot of positive things about the way they've led their company it's become very monetarily successful right people do very well with you know running ads all that running entire media corporations like linus tech tips or a philip defranco show or you know all these big like almost corporate shows now that's great but you can't say they're a free speech platform i would say that this is one of the dumbest things i've ever seen and i just wanted to call a little bit of attention to it because i love youtube as a platform but i wish they would do more for free speech instead of this whole game where they're trying to you know i guess project giving themselves an award and hoping all of us believe it but yeah i just wanted to talk about this i hope this issue matters to you guys it matters to me i mean i'm just waiting for the day that they cracked out on my channel it's inevitable the kind of stuff we talk about but it is really sad that youtube can just pay for an award like that this you would think that you would have to earn it but yeah i don't know let me know what you guys think do you think they deserve this award back to the regular kind of content tomorrow we talk about fakers of all kind though not just the people lying to you about a harvard speech but the people lying to you about a free speech award but that's basically it thanks for watching see you next time wake up and smell the coffee
