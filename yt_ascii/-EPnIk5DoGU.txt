the day before was an even bigger disaster than you thought devs reportedly made to pay fines for bad work learned it was an mmo from the trailers and no one's sure where the bosses are imagine if you had to pay fines for for bugs like we're all devs here that's crazy i would i would get paid negative dollars it don't matter about how much fang money you got i get negative dollars all right anyways all right a new documentary from a german game site game two in gamestar has shed some more light on the disastrous development of the day before and boy howdy it's worse than you thought game two says it spoke to 16 former fantastic employees and one of its former volunteers and seven staff the day before publisher mont montana monton the picture they paint is staggering do we get a percentage of the company revenue if we pay for bugs that's a great question i think that's a i you know what i think that's a good proposal i will pay for my bugs if i get a percentage of your revenue i think that's perfectly fair because that means i've taken on risk right we make devs pay for bugs they don't get any billable work until they fix the bugs in their work wait what i'm not going to lie to you i don't think that's good at all they also get paid more if they get more done i don't know if i i don't i don't think i like that the reason being is the reason why i don't like that is that the reality is is that we have small perspectives and how things are used in production versus when they're used here i just don't i i i i don't i mean you're saying it's been done for eight years i don't think it makes that better right there's plenty of things that have been done for a long time that doesn't make it good or bad duration of things being done right i you know the lindy effect right they love it no turnover doubt i'm doubting hard doubting right now okay anyways speaking anonymously game 2's source alleges that working at fantastic the day before now defunct development study was pier megal medical megalo maniacal chaos as they tell it the gamees developer was development was constantly buffeted by the changing whims of the go got gov brothers the studio's founders and the scope and style of the game would change whenever one of them got their hands on whatever the big game of the month was that's like this is like software development 101 you got to like come up with what you want to build and build the thing like i mean i understand pivots are important and there are times you want to pivot but man every time you pivot you should just consider that the likelihood of your project being successful just like got cut in half agile do so agile do say so i mean this sounds very agile right they're they're planning they were planning two weeks at a time you know what i mean imagine the abstractions dude it would get crazy it'd get crazy it would get crazy sounds like the development of js yeah coming to work on a shooter one day the next day a mobile game all of a sudden next day it's an mmo boys we got mmo elden rig i want dodge mechanics sources alleged that the game's character creator had to be overhauled multiple times to keep up with gta online then hogwarts legacy then balers gate 3 while the game settings a smoky oppressive city had to be dramatically altered to become brighter and friendlier after one of the brothers played spider-man 2 imagine just for a second everybody imagine you're just sweating and you're designing for just weeks and months and crunch time and just getting after it and [ __ ] toby maguire spider-man comes rolling into your office and they're just like we got to change everything we got to change everything because this just ain't qu dude i don't know if you know this i don't know if you know about my boy toby over here i know toby mcguire's not in spider-man anymore but it's just funny it's just funny to think toby okay oh my goodness it's just too funny this is just it's crazy one former dev said they only learned the game was supposed to be an mmo when they saw a trailer for it i mean that's a genre like how do you not even know what the genre is but that pales in comparison to the reports about how the game staff were treated a fantastic has already drawn criticism for its use of volunteer workers on its project what how do you get someone to volunteer but some of the details alleged by former staff are mindboggling fantastic is said to have made use of a great deal of young inexperienced labor drawn from its home base of yakutsk as well as other countries in the former ussr very ussr behavior right here going on like kazakhstan and uh armenia workers in other words with no other options dang sources says there was a great deal of voluntary unpaid overtime and months of crunch one says they found myself begging for a few hours break just to find time for a shower or a meal i mean the game industry has historically been known as being one of the hardest you know industries to really be a part of but i'm a little bit surprised or i guess i i shouldn't be surprised that former ussr somehow made it worse this is actually wild that i can't imagine being in a situation where i'm v and told to do things and like i have no options especially if they had to move like cities or countries to get somewhere and they're like stuck in a place in which they don't maybe they don't even speak the native language of the place that they're in you know like this is a effectively technical slavery of some sort i mean i don't like to toss out such foul accusations easily but i don't see how any other ways to do this that's crazy never work for a rusi never work for a ruski man one claim backed up by several game 2 sources says that the employees were made to pay fines to the company for turning in sub substandard work with some reportedly forced to pay $1,900 for poor quality poor quality voice recordings others were kept on their toes by a company policy of spontaneous termination one what spontaneous termination is that a medical disease what what is spontan a spontaneously terminated one of the day's five testers was apparently fired from the company just before release after one of the gotv encountered a bug i feel like the go-to brothers considered harmful of course you know there's some there's something magical about the fact that they have the word goto in their name and they also being a disaster but it sounds like i feel like the only just punishment is that they have to learn to program and do it voluntarily and then have to get fined and they have to do it and they have to beg for showers i feel like like how are these people held accountable for anything because let's just say all this is true right do they like are these people in some sort of are they actually going to get in some sort of trouble i don't know i don't know the story of of of the the founders but this is just wild like imagine that you actually you have to kind of think about this that i i think everybody's capable of of quite a bit of evil right you know and i always worry about like the people that i really really look up to and what what happens when what they're doing gets exposed like right now like the doc right he's building a a game studio right now the thing that i just don't want to hear and i'm i'm just hoping it never happens is that the doc comes out and it turns out he's like just a horrifying boss and he and he runs a terrible studio right like that's honestly i know that sounds crazy but i think about that kind of stuff like because i i want him to be awesome i want not the doc man i know i i i i just want to believe he pe sitting down okay that's rude that's rude let's not just make unabashed claims like that never meet your heroes kids i know but you just have to think about like what does it take for somebody to get into this position right what does it take for you to become this person because you had to you had to think that these people didn't start off like this right like and what do you do that is leading you down this path does that make sense because how many people how many people as they you know as you start rising you start doing all these things your expectations of people kind of rise with your ability you know i think i think it's very easy to look at somebody and just see the evil in them and to pretend like you got none of it yourself you know what i mean i don't know as for the the goto themselves it seems no one quite knows where they've ended up in the aftermath of fantastics closure the pair went awall around the game's launch a fact that several staff attribute to for knowledge that the game was in a dire state the only and only reappeared to shudder the studio via microsoft teams several of game 2 sources believe that the pair has started from scratch a new new studio making mobile games but it remains unclear which one if that's even the case dang the day before was one of the last year's most utterly chaotic launches managing as it did to build anticipation and get a huge number of pre-orders on the back of the footage and promises that we know we now know we're hiding the true state of the game you know like i remember you know before i went to netflix i worked at a place called web filings that's now known as where ke and the team i was on it was fairly chaotic i was doing like 70 hours every single week flying out to arizona monthly doing code jams right and it was hard and it was like not a like it was not like i look back on it still fondly in the sense that it was one of the times that i grew the most as a as as a developer and it really enabled me to be more successful but i still at the exact same time think about that as like how do i want to say this because these people got forced into a situation whereas i got to opt into it now if you get to opt into something you get paid well enough you get paid to a price that you agree to and you have to do some hard work for a little bit i will say that it's one of the most beneficial things i've ever done for me personally in my career you know i agreed to the work i did the work and when i was tired of doing it i did find a different job and and and and moved on with my life but it was extremely beneficial for me but 70 hours that's 14 hours a day hours a weekday yeah well i worked on the weekends too but it didn't suck that much right yeah it didn't suck that much the thing is is that i had you know it was also a pleasant you know there's a lot of things that were pleasant about it i definitely wasn't paid that well for sure for the work i was doing i definitely wasn't paid that well but at the end of the day you know it it really made me the developer i am so when i hear you know when i hear people being allergic to having to work really hard you know i think that you also miss out on some things that just can only come with experience and it's really hard to get experience if you're just not putting in entirely too many hours right you work a weekend for netflix no i don't i mean i there there's been times i have right but these people's situations obviously eff up i mean volunt volunt holding somebody and effectively what sounds like some form of weird like slavery of being in a city they may not speak even the language of and being forced to do things that i mean that's crazy do 70 hours a week on building site that's that's hard work it is it it's hard work before the launch the game faced severe delays after baffling argument with a calendar app and didn't do much to assage anyone's fears when it first when its first gameplay demo looked almost determinedly generic when it launched it met predictable mockery and scorn only for fantastic to close its doors 4 days later the game itself has now been extricated or ex extracted from existence the remains of the studios's management have since blamed its poor performance on hate campaign aign by bloggers classic really it's really the blogger fault that it's it's that that's really what caused the problem if if that sounds astonishing you haven't heard half of it it's worth going and checking out the game 2's full documentary on youtube it's in german but has english subtitles to get the full picture of just how messy and chaotic last year's messiest most chaotic game really was i knew game dev has a lot of problems but that's wild i've never heard of anything like this what game the day before it was depressing i just have a hard like i i i have the problem i have is i just have a hard time i just have like a hard time of putting my m like my my head in this mindset where you'd want to do that to anybody or where you would see that's the only way to progress forward in something i mean it just sounds like i mean i feel bad for anybody that has you know like in some sense a lot of people experience some very extremely mild version of this if you've ever worked for any product manager compan that constantly changes which direction you're going i mean that alone is just so difficult i don't know if you've ever been in in a scope change scope change place but it's really really hard and it's not and it's not just hard because like the problem isn't that you're just working on new stuff it's just that you can never actually build anything right everything's just like rebuilding constantly without actually ever getting anywhere i hate having to wait for corporations to write games and software because the little guy won't get out of bed what i don't i don't there must be some sort of joke that i'm missing on the other end of this one play something saxman hey that's why we're agile you need to finish something or else you'll feel like dooo yeah constant refactors are a grind yeah dude i am not a fan of refactoring like generally i try to stay away from it if i can just because it is it is really hard i think indie games doing better is a sign people don't want expensive sightseing interactive movies they just want simple fun ones yeah i think i mean that's probably true the little guys are too busy racing neovim to make games i think the other problem is is that people are also the problem with aaa games is that there's an ever larger and growing desire right for more and more fantastic whereas with indie games that same expect is just not there you know like when you play an indie game when i download a when i download a simple game i just don't i don't have nearly the same expectations that i do of a aaa game like if i'm going to go play another like rpg like kind of like an offline rpg like i'm coming in there with with elden ring expectations like i'm gonna need a finished ass game that's absolutely incredible and if it's not incredible i'm just going to be like ah this game this doesn't even feel cool at all right like even if like go play even like even some of the older halos don't feel as good bowlers gate 3 was incredible but i just you know like when i go play turo turro was a aaa game of the most amazing game category and now it feels feel like clunky like h you know what i mean yeah but if like even this even halo 1 go play through the halo 1 campaign and it starts to get kind of like really repetitive you know and that's perfect dark perfect dark was so dang much fun i played thousands of multiplayers of perfect arc and that was one of the biggest games out there and yet that you know like that's the problem about triaa games is that they they age differently you know they just they do truly just age differently and maybe it's just the 3d nature of the whole thing i don't know perfect dark was just a reskin of gold ey too it was a reskin of gold ey but it was more there was a lot more to it games made by id still hold up yeah id's really good i don't know if i don't know if triaa games aren't games anymore they're still very much so games it's just that now the requirement to be able to tell a story has grown so much i mean but at the end of the day games are no games or story or no story the day before was the greatest fumble of all time people want a zombie rpg shooter dark city feel like that would be fun that would be a lot of fun to play i think a lot of people would enjoy such an experience but man it just i mean this also just goes to show how much does management like f these things if you don't have a clear vision of what you're building because i know a lot of you are trying to start do startups and all that i know a lot of you want to be able to build your own company and all that this should be the greatest and most clearest indicator of come up with a direction make sure you think the directions the right direction and like commit to it long enough to see something through you know because if you're if if you're inspiration changes by the wind of every new product that's coming out you're not you're never going to be successful now you may never turn into this you may do this to yourself in some sort of sense where you're just programming non-stop to try to keep on you know keep on pushing through everything but at the end of the day you're never going to be successful you just can't do that i don't want a company i want to write code well at some point you got to do something with your code you know what i mean you still got to do something with your code i'm working on a sass yeah all right anyways i thought this was really interesting i feel really bad for all the developers involved in this and everybody involved with this and i sure hope that the that the the go-to brothers that i i i surely hope that they somehow find themselves in a good oldfashioned prison for for such things and it also just really goes to show that i think a lot of us you know america has obviously really great software and dev culture if you will and i know you know the pay is very good and then as you go to other places around the world the pay is not as good but still it's it's it's it's fine i guess but man it can get really bad you know even the things that we enjoy the the hobbies we get to enjoy the programming programming is literally a hobby that we get get to get paid for it can be terrible so if you if you're not in this you know just remember you know i know that remember somebody else has it worse is always like not a really great way to be motivated but it is i mean for me it's it it kind of puts a sobriety in my head that there is that when i'm not feeling thankful i got to remember just how good i do have it and try to like recount the things that i think are actually really good and be happy about it you know what i mean and even though it's it's not easy to do there's a lot of some good stuff out there and you got to you know it's good to it's good it's good to be able to remember the blessings you have and to count them because i mean you could be someone that's in a a country you're not from not being able to speak the language you're speaking and begging just to have enough time to eat and take a shower that's effed up a jen
