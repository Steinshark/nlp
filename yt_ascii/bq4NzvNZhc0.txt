so what we have here cam ch 2019.65 so in our collection this is the 65th thing we've taken in of 2019 we're not that far into it but if we open the box what we have here is the very birth of the sinclair spectrum so this is the prototype of the sinclair spectrum and actually quite a few people bandy around the word prototype and it might be a pre-production prototype but where it basically looks like the machine but it's like an issue a rather than issue one or whatever that kind of stuff but this really really is as early as it gets if we remove it from the bag there so if anybody knows the sinclair spectrum it kind of has a little bit of a feel of it when we was up in the the loft of where this came from so it come from a company called nine tiles when we opened the box in the in the loft where this thing was and we knew there was some good going to be some good stuff there because we knew the history of the company that we were taking it from but yeah you open the box and you see this thing and it's got all these little signs that it's a spectrum and it is a prototype and it was like one of those indiana jones moments where you find treasure right real treasure well this is to us anyway it is in two parts so we have the keyboard and we have the main board there and you've got some little bits there that give you clues the little speaker there is very spectrum-like so that's the same one as they use in the actual production model uhf modulator over here voltage regulator 7805 there on a big old heatsink and then you've got some other circuitry here to produce the negative voltages that the ram uses ram chips down here ula but with no actual writing on it well apart from handwritten stuff and then the z80 cpu which is the same one that they were putting into these x81 at the time that's the zx81 so this is the predecessor to the sinclair zx spectrum this one personally for me has got lots of fun memories this is a machine that sort of cut my teeth on this x81 had a grand total of one kilobyte of memory you could expand it you could have a ram pack on the back but give it another 16k but it tended to wobble so every time you started typing your code the ram pack would move and you'd lose it all anyway so that was pointless but the sinclair spectrum had 16k of memory built in as standard but then they quickly released the 48k version as well so that was taken into an era now where you can actually start to write some good games obviously this thing was black and white no sound nothing like that whereas the spectrum had its beeps and what have you and colour so made it a much more salable machine when it comes to the games so this is a production version of the sinclair spectrum so this is what that ended up being so no longer if we got the full travel keys that was on the prototype got this little rubber they feel a little bit like you're pressing dead flesh i don't know who worked that out but anyway but it was you know obviously all into that little case and a great engineering job to get all of that into there there's a finished product so there you go the prototype and its production release version if you look underneath you can see it's all been hand wire wrapped the wire wrapping was a really nice way of prototyping boards so you didn't need to get pcbs made or anything you'd have a little tool and this blue wire here is a single core wire with an outer sheath on it and that would wrap around these long legs that you can see and make a connection so you take a pin here if you want to join that pin to say over the processor you'd run it along run it down over here use your tool to make a wire out connection there and away you go so it's quite a rapid way of doing things and of course here you can see that there's some other soldered wires on as well these are on the power lines so this is joining the power buses together for each of the rows because you tend to have a positive and a negative or zero and five volt for each of these rows here that would have taken quite a while to do so you know quite a painstaking thing but obviously you know this was an exciting time this is coming up with a new product we do actually have as well another kind of it's pre this even yeah we haven't sort of done too much work with it yet but it is as x81 that's been butchered to have a bigger rom capacity on it the separate board so you can see they were taking the x81 as the absolute starting point that was the product that was out at the time and thought right how are we going to add more memory to this how we can add all these features so start with that and kind of hack it get some more rom space on it so i think there's about eight small rom sockets on there using smaller bombs and this one was using and so that's kind of the beginning but then that didn't seem to go that far i think by that time they realized now we're gonna need to make a you know an actual version ourselves using variable here so the keyboard is not particularly like a spectrum somebody pointed out actually it's interesting that the z and the x things are missing but i don't think that's anything other than pure coincidence oh because it's a zx zx spectrum yeah they were never on there we've never seen them i can't imagine anybody nicking them to stick on their fridge so i think that's just because they've come off it's unfortunate but obviously not very spectrum-like spectrum had its own rubber keyboard so this uses rs key switches so this is a standard keyboard bezel that you could buy a little metal frame there and you could just push these rs keys which is into them rs was a company called radio spares which still are and they sell everything on that score so they've obviously gone out and bought some rs key switches so they've wired this up in a matrix so you can see there's kind of rows and columns that go across just as on a normal spectrum membrane and then they've got this really heavy duty again rs connector there so a db25 connector there that connects it onto the the main board so those two connected together gives you your keyboard and the spectrum itself so yeah this is really quite exciting i mean you don't get this kind of thing come up very often obviously from my experience when you when you're prototyping something you get this far you basically prove it's okay they're probably not the most reliable thing in the world you've got connections they're a little bit iffy maybe so you can do some tests and it's yes we know this is going to work and then you move on to a pcb as soon as you can but what usually happens is as soon as you get the pcbs in you're all excited right let's make one of these up and you just rip all the components off your prototype and prototypes end up in a draw and you keep rubbing it for bits or whatever as you need them so it's not very often that something like this comes along in its entirety complete you know that's very very uncommon so we're really really lucky well where did you say you found it again so this was donated to us we got contact from a lady called kate grant so her and her husband had a company called ninetales and they had various old bits of junk that we might be interested in they had a pdp 11 a really big pdp 11 35 system i think 1170 as well various other things and this was kind of a footnote to that you know oh and there might be a prototype of things like the spectrum and whatever so okay vaguely interested you know so yeah that was kind of more of a footnote to the the other things but that happened so many times people offered to donate things to us and then you know we're really excited about the thing that they were less excited about so it happens a lot and this is a great example of it this is the most extreme example we've come across have you fired it up not yet no is there a plan i think we're getting some grief online because we haven't done it yet but unfortunately day-to-day business gets in the way yes we definitely are going to but also you've got to take a lot of precautions over something like that surely yeah yeah definitely i mean this is a you know there isn't another one we're not going to do this thing any damage i mean you might look at this and go hang on this is a little little bit for the cameras well no i wouldn't say we haven't done that before have we i mean so there's a couple of things so the museum has now become museums credited that's a really big deal to us that means that we apply procedures and policies to the way that we do we the way that we run the museum but also the way that we do preservation and it proves that we're taking it seriously secondly regardless of all that this is special you know until we've dumped the roms which we are going to do as soon as we can for anybody that's wondering why we don't just stick it in the eprom reader now which we were gonna do on day one but these are actually two five six four roms is it two five six four or is it yeah there are two five six fours so i was just expecting these to be two seven series a problems as many machines would use but two five series are a different pin out and they need to be treated slightly differently so our reader by default won't read them so we need to make a little adapter that is going to take these convert them into the same pin out as a two seven series and then we'll read them so that's what's getting in the way really and it's just again one of those little things that needs to be done that other things get in the way of but so so there's that and obviously you don't want to go and do something to this that's going to damage the data on those roms so we're being ultra careful there also some of these components are static sensitive so we do have the static mat here and we're earth and i'm wearing these gloves and the gloves are again not necessarily for the static but they're about getting oil and grease and things off your hands on these things you know we are really seriously taking taking all this so it's you know it's about preserving these and treating them in the best way we possibly can but yes we're gonna try and fire up as soon as what we're going to do is we'll take all the components out we'll power it up make sure we've got the right voltages so we have a little negative voltage converter there for the ram make sure that's sticking out the right voltage make sure the five is being dropped down properly it'll be terrible if we just plugged it into an adapter and the the nine volt went straight through the the regulator or something like that we're not gonna do that so we'll take check it all out first put the chips back in and then see where we go from there and as soon as we do we'll let people know obviously there's enough people emailing and saying well you put out a video about it but you haven't told us anything else yeah it doesn't work so the only scientist we just haven't quite got around to it but it's not for the want of our own kind of let's get to it there's other day-to-day things we have to do now i've got the token so i can load a value in add the value for merger into it and store it back and hand the token and now i've got the token again i can load something into into my register add something onto it throw it back and pass the token on and i've got it so i can load the value in add the value for my register store it back
