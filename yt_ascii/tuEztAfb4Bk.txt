we're here again remotely by the magic of video teleconferencing you've had to do some upgrading i understand i've been wanting people to ask me about my upgrading hell it's something where i guess all of our audience can find common cause you may not be running the same mix of kit as i am but one's attitude towards upgrading i think divides us into two camps are you a serious early adopter of anything that's new or are you like me token dinosaur it's only six years old what do you mean i should be upgrading it i have two pcs that run windows 10 i have two ipads and the one that is the center of all my efforts is the legacy unit really in steps going all the way back to the 1970s but at the moment it's a linux box right and the linux box i have at the moment but i'm in the process of changing it sean it's only six years old as my dad used to say and i said dad get with it son these things should last a lifetime and i always say that to steve and he looks to heaven whenever i say it and i think you do too a bit but you know let's be honest computers tablets whatever are becoming a household appliance yeah and it certainly used to be that you would buy a household appliance and expect it to last 10 years or maybe if you bought a mealy 20 years yes quite so that's exactly right but as we all know it's just not like that and you've got to be flexible enough to to know exactly when is the right time to upgrade for you when i'm in as it were windows desktop mode i'm happy to live with windows 10. and the the people at work keep it up to date and all for me and it's not the main focus of what i use but they're there when i need them and it's fine thinking back what was the earliest unix box i had it was in the early 1990s as microport unix it was in those days running on very underpowered pc 386486 sort of chip something like that and it was okay it was a home unix system it was with a sense of woe and foreboding really when i had to move away unix that i was so familiar with for 20 years to actually having to embrace linux and in those early days and one of my proteges is the legendary john masters from red hat who was at nottingham so yes he was red hat first of all but then as red hat became more and more how she would say had to get more commercially focused they the happy hobbyist heir fell away from it and yeah you had to use something like fedora i think it was and i was never very happy with that so i suppose the question is then what is my most recent linux box well it's an open soozie system now before we start getting avalanches and males and why did you choose that i chose that for the pragmatic reason that the guys at work whose judgment i trust had gone for that flavor of linux for the whole school of computer science and i thought well you know it may not be quite like the red hat i'm used to but if they're offering backup advice and everything on opensuse i'll do that at home and it's the only way to go because it reduces the hassles so yes the box i am upgrading away from is open susie linux 13.2 go on sean ask me what forced me to upgrade here we are in lockdown can't i just wait a while go on sean ask me why i'm upgrading well so there are two main reasons there are loads of reasons to upgrade something but in my estimation there are two main reasons and they are the two sides of the one coin of computing hardware or software where are we going both i had problems with both simultaneously and they kind of interfered with each other to an extent of giving me inappropriate error indications what is the software not of mine but of other people's where they are determined to obsolete you and get you to upgrade answer the web browser every flaming time i do not watch movies if you send me an mp3 or mp4 that's standalone that's all right but i i'm not a mad gamer or i don't watch movies but i do need to be able to play back my computer file episodes so there was i still happily using firefox from 2014 and somebody without my explicit permission goes and starts imposing html5 as a requirement it started to be longer and longer and longer before i could see my version and i think you told me that because of my ancient setup i was waiting for a flash version was that right i do know what dave i have no idea i mean youtube makes dozens and dozens of versions of each well you know definitely many many multiples of different versions from h.264 to blah blah blah it was making the html5 version first because you were happy i had to wait for quite some time often several hours before a version came that i could view but i could live with that it was it was getting more and more annoying i thought this has got to change but then what tended to happen was that even on my ancient browser and even when i wasn't trying to view html file files because you get nowhere with that it was still falling over as we say a lot that browser and i started thinking that every time it fell over it was leaving a crash dump somewhere because my root disk file system got full up like crazy and then on top of that i began to suspect and it took me back to the mid to late 70s when this was commonplace that 2014 system is running off proper conventional disks right rotating things you know with brown iron oxide on them inside which our colleague dr steve i've never heard this before calls spinning rust spinning rust dave you're on spinning rust i bet you've got bad blocks i said you're right we used to get those in the 1970s off our big disk packs we put in you used to have to do an fsck before you started up find your bad blocks map them out and all that i started to have the odd file fortunately not important once at all where i couldn't delete it it just wouldn't let me because there were bad blocks so i thought okay for hardware and software reasons i must now upgrade so i went to see dr steve without his help i couldn't even begin to stay in the linux firmament he said dave open susie is so yesterday and so deprecated if you want me to support you and of course this is where we're going to get in into linux flavors wars he said the flavor of linux i find just about tolerable is debian and i said steve whatever you use is fine by me so long as you can keep me going on that new version and the first thing he gave me was a mostly configured linux system with no spinning rust i think i've got 16 gig of main memory and something like 200 and something gig of what i still regard as disc except that it's really solid-state memory now and boy is it a lot faster than when you're having to wait for the next block to come around on spinning rust then of course you've got to ensure that your new linux system has got all the utilities on it that the old one had one of the most wonderful things about linux is that you get i'm sure there's exceptions pretty well binary compatibility you don't have to keep on recompiling your stuff are you listening up there steve jobs one of my problems in doing this upgrade and why i have to have steve around as a consultant is that if you start only doing it every few years you forget really really crucial things and i mean one goof that just about finished me was that in the good old days because discs were so small you had your root file system on this disk and you could optionally have your user file system on physically separate disk right so your slash user and its descendants could be on a separate disk physical list they're now all on one walloping great big disk with lots of partitions but when i was running out of space on the root file system [music] immediately below that is slash user i thought back in the berkeley days if you had too small a disk you could put slash user on a separate disk i thought right going to super user mode a little knowledge is a dangerous thing and i tried moving slash user to elsewhere to free off more space and you know what happens next it won't recognize any or will only recognize a tiny proportion of your unix commands when you type them in from a command line all right somebody like who to see who's logged on doesn't work and why because you have made slash user slash bin where it was finding the binary to do that you've made it invisible and i've forgotten all about this so pick up the phone steve i've got a problem i actually bless him he was really dave listen carefully stop gibbering you know we'll get it back we've all done it we have all done this but because i do it more often than you i now do it less frequently and if i do accidentally do it i know how to rescue myself so it's things like that it's a system that back in the 70s required a lot of expertise oh and that's another thing look and feel oh no probably a separate extra bits of video on this that's the one last thing i want to talk about honestly yeah again you you go with steve jobs you take the pill you drink the kool-aid or you follow bill gates and his successors and you get windows 10 but basically what you see on your screen is what they think is good for you you do not get like you do linux oh what sort of windowing system would you like on top of all this sir are you a gnome customer or are you a kde customer well i flirted with both in my time and i think i've relapsed they can now cohabit i find in this latest debit they seem to cohabit a lot better but this is this is the problem of having such a amorphous market as linux is i mean it's covering everything from high-end servers got all sorts of things so you can buy in exactly what you want but but but but it means that if everything's an add-on then nothing's standard you know so yeah i'm basically back on a machine that will tolerate either gnome or kde but it's choosable and that suits me fine and yeah even in the great wild west that is linux systems there are signs of common sense breaking out i think they are more upgradable in general perhaps better maintained than they used to be five six years ago graphics community it's not a few computer-sized nerds trying to rescues rescue command line software from the 1980s but yes so i've got all of that here could be number two that sort of thing but the problem with that is then it becomes very easy to say
