i've got bad news for porsche tyon owners their electric car technology is evolving faster than you can say porsche tyon turbo sross turismo that is to say the latest generation of tyon is here and the lineup is better in basically every single way you might think that because it has more battery capacity that it's heavier nope it's lighter you might think that because it has way more power that range will suffer nope it's actually more efficient you might think that because it holds a lap record at the nurburgring and lagona sea that tesla stands would stop reminding you that for the price of a well equipped tyon turbo s you could buy a tesla model s plaid and a performance cyber truck and a model y performance and still have money left over but they absolutely will not and okay real talk that's kind of actually a valid point regardless the peak of the ev performance sedan has three contenders the model s plaid the loose air sapphire and porsche's latest addition to the mix and the track king the tyon turbo gt and with the newest generation of the tyon porsche has really leveled up their ev game with a concerted effort towards pushing the boundaries that's refreshing to see from a legacy automaker so put your glasses on and focus because we're going in deep on what will likely be the nerdiest video you've ever watched on porsche tyon as we focus on four key elements of the new model the battery the charging experience the powertrain and finally the suspension as porsche's new active ride provides an extraordinary level of chassy control starting off with the battery capacity is up thanks to a revised chemistry and pouch style battery cell it's an nmc 811 battery meaning the cathode material split is 80% nickel 10% manganese and 10% cobalt gross energy capacity is 105 kwatt hours up from 93.4 kilowatt hours on the last gen with a usable capacity of 997 kw hours significantly greater than the previous 83.7 so with capacity up over 12% you'd expect the battery to be larger and heavier but it exists in the exact same footprint and actually weighs 9 kg less so what impact does the new battery have on range overall range is up about 34% for the new tyon based on the worldwide light vehicle test procedure the largest contributing factor to this is the larger battery the next largest factor is whole vehicle optimization like decreased weight improved air dynamics and better rolling resistance drivetrain efficiency is also improved and finally an improved drive and regen strategy makes up the remainder but range is not the only perk of the larger battery it also means you can deliver more power the previous tyon battery could deliver 860 amps of current during launch control the new battery can deliver 1,00 amps which paired with an 800 volt architecture is good for 815 kw in the most powerful tyon the turbo gt that's a jump of 255 kow over the most powerful tyon from the previous generation nearly 1100 horsepower versus about 750 horsepower quite the leap but the energy doesn't just leave the battery quicker it also goes back in much quicker as well which brings us to charging there's two ways for energy to go back in the battery regenerative braking where you use the car's kinetic energy to recharge the battery by slowing it down with the electric motors and of course plugging the car into an outlet both are now faster from a regen perspective at high speeds if you hit the brake pedal the battery can take in up to 400 kw of recuperation power that's way up from 290 kw previously porsche brake pedals blend the motor regen with the friction brakes but with the new b battery you can press that brake pedal even harder without tipping into the mechanical brakes regen alone can allow for up to 46 gs of slowing power up from 39 gs previously there's a compromise at work here personally i find that the brake pedal because its blending regen and mechanical brakes doesn't quite feel as good versus the alternative strategy such as what tesla does for tesla regen is accomplished by lifting off the throttle known as one pedal driving this enables the brake pedal to be dedicated purely for the mechanical brakes and as a result the feel is very consistent pora doesn't do this but on the flip side they can decelerate at higher rates using regen alone and this means in a scenario where you're breaking hard the porsche will be more efficient putting more energy back into the battery technically you could do this on the tesla as well but it would mean anytime you fully lift off the accelerator pedal you'd have really heavy braking part of what makes the drivability so nice is that you can fully lift coming to a stoplight and the regen is quite calm with no fancy footwork required hard breaking should be rare so the compromise of limiting one pedal striving max regen rate tends to be worthwhile for daily driving wait a sec what's going on with my footwear oh glad you asked shout out to today's sponsor tuxmat that provides floor mats with year round protection for any scenario they cover a much greater area than the factory floor mats are of course waterproof and and personally i'm a big fan of the quick snap tabs and velcro clips that ensure they stay precisely in place locking in with your factory trim so whether you're hiking rock climbing snowshoeing skiing scuba diving you name it your floors are ready for adventure and you don't have to worry about the mess my floors are looking great thanks tuxmat you can find a link to floor mats that perfectly fit your vehicle in the video description okay so we were talking about breaking and while the latest tyon has more powerful regen it also offers faster fast charging up to 320 kw at the pump versus 270 kw from the previous gen in ideal conditions that translates to a 10 to 80% fast charge in just' minutes whereas previously it took 21.5 minutes and so you're thinking 3 minutes big deal but keep in mind it's also a larger battery pack so from 10 to 80% means you're putting in more energy another 9 or so kilowatt hours in less time and perhaps you missed when i said in ideal conditions the real world is messy you end up at a charger when it's cold outside and suddenly all the numbers are way off and charging can take much longer not the case with the new tyon which has vastly improved the breadth of conditions that it can accept fast charging the old battery needed to be at a balmy 35degrees c to charge at its maximum rate that's now just 15degrees c for the new battery a drop of 20degrees according to my calcul this has really important implications which can be better understood through two different scenarios first let's say a new porsche tyon and an old porsche tyon both show up at a fast charger with 10% battery left and both have their batteries at 15degrees cus while the new tyon will immediately start charging at the maximum possible rate the old tyon will start fast charging but at a limited rate while also working to increase the battery temperature so that it can accept a faster charge the result is the new tyon will be at 80% charge in just' minutes while the old tyon will take twice as long 37 minutes to hit 80% so the obvious advantage here is real world faster charging but there's another sneaky advantage baked into this for our second scenario let's say a new tyon and an old tyon are on their way to a fast charger perhaps on a road trip and they're both 30 minutes out from the charger to ensure the car will charge at the maximum rate both cars start preheating their batteries to the ideal temperature the old tyon needs to heat the battery all the way to 35degreesc so this requires a lot of energy depleting the battery even further to a lower state of charge when it arrives at the charger the new tyon only needs to preheat the battery to 15degrees c so under plenty of driving scenarios it won't have to preheat the battery at all and if it does it's a much smaller amount meaning less energy is used so you arrive at the charger with a high high battery percentage or you have more range and simply keep on driving to the next charger and if you're nerdy enough to still be listening i have great news as it gets even better not only does it have a much lower battery temperature for peak charging but it can also heat up the battery twice as fast as the last gen the onboard heat pump and high voltage heater are capable of dumping 17 kow of heat into the battery pack up from just 7 kow previously this is incredible for winter drive driving conditions as it means the tyon will have no trouble getting the battery pack up to temp quickly for fast charging while the old tyon has way less power and needs to bring the battery up to a much higher temperature and in case you were wondering if it's super hot outside the new battery pack can also fast charge at higher temperatures as well and it has more cooling power versus the last tyon 12 kw up from 9 kows all in a battery that weighs less it is better in every single way sorry old tyon owners yeah let the disappointment continue because the new powertrain is also much improved every single tyon variant and i'm told there are 14 is faster and more powerful the base tyon is up 80 horsepower the turbo s is up'7 horsepower and yeah there's a new turbo gt which is up over 340 horsepower from the previous turbo s the turbo gt is hitting 0 to 100 kmph in 2 .2 seconds or 0 to 60 mph in just 2.1 seconds and that's a porsche 2.1 seconds none of that roll out nonsense it will actually do it and this is all done with just two motors with only a single motor in the rear which is an interesting discussion porsche looked into possibly using two motors in the rear much like the tesla plaid or lucid sapphire but ultimately it would have required a huge packaging rework that's code for expensive but also there wouldn't be much benefit in terms of launching acceleration that's because porsche opts for a different strategy and unlike the tesla and lucid has a two-speed transmission in the rear with revised gearing on the turbo gt first gear allows for boat loads of wheel torque for a great launch off the line while second gear now reaches a higher top speed 305 kmph or 190 mph both the front and rear are permanent magnet motors with a new more powerful motor in the rear in the turbo s you have a 6 amp inverter in the front and a 600 amp inverter in the rear this means you can send about equal power to each motor though in the real world the torque bias is always going to favor the rear for the turbo gt there's a new silicon carbide inverter in the rear with 50% more output now peaking at 900 amps so you have 1,00 amps you can deliver from the battery which can be split front to rear with the front accepting a max of 600 amps and the rear accepting a max of 900 amps if you have a hard time digesting these numbers the math conveniently works out where each amp roughly translates to one horsepower so potentially peaking at about 900 horsepower at the rear motor that's a huge number but it's also for a brief moment as peak power during a launch is only available for 2 seconds okay back up a second how did i get that 900 horsepower number well if the car has 815 kw of peak power and the battery delivers a maximum of 1100 amp amps 85,000 watt divided by 1100 amps gives you 740 volts looking at the rear inverter 900 amps * 740 volts equal 666 kw or yeah as i'd mentioned about 900 horsepower all of this power in a vehicle engineered to handle a track means insanely fast lap times and the turbo gt now holds the title of fastest electric series production car at both laguna sea and the nurra and it's the fastest four-door around the ring period which includes vehicles with combustion engines part of the key to that success of course a brilliant suspension the tyon now offers porsche's active ride a complete level up in terms of capability and vehicle dynamics personally i kind of like to think of it as suspension by wire and that much like steer by wire and brake by wire you now have complete control of how the suspension behaves for any given situation at any given moment in real time the chassis engineers aren't simply picking a spring rate and a damping rate then dusting their hands and calling it a day you can tune this suspension for absolutely anything the simplest way of thinking about it at every corner you have a damper with a piston inside which is controlling the height of the shock at that corner each damper has its own electric motor and pump which is powered directly from the 800 volt battery so at every wheel you can control the exact ride height by using hydraulic pressure to move the damper's piston up or down it can do so quickly and with tremendous force about one metric ton of force at any corner in theory the dampers could take over the job of the springs as well though it would require continuous energy to do so as a result active ride is paired with an air suspension which allows for holding the car up at any chosen ride height but the dampers do eliminate anti-roll bars as this job can be completely covered with the new setup the implications are absolutely wild you can eliminate pitch and dive whether launching or breaking you can keep the car completely flat during hard cornering you can manipulate tire loading to maximize the work done by the inside tires during cornering but it gets even more wild if you were to have two motors at the rear of course you'd have very precise control over the torque at each wheel but porsche only uses one motor so they compensate with the use of an electromechanical limited slip differential ensuring the deal with more grip gets more torque however it can also use the active ride suspension to manipulate the force at each wheel pushing downward on a tire that loses grip to very briefly increase its load so it can thus receive more torque balancing it with the other side it is suspension based torque distribution or say you're going over a jump active ride can also force the tires to m in contact with the ground assuming you know it's a small jump the famous flon garden section of the nur green is a great example which is often a downhill jump if you're traveling fast enough but here the porsche actually maintains contact with the ground by pushing down the tires so while there are performance advantages of the setup there's also massive comfort improvements for example you can have the car lean into the corner rather than roll out or tilt the car forward as you accelerate or lean the car back as you break and for modest bumps what's absolutely wild to see is that they can be effectively eliminated as the suspension very precisely counteracts the forces it sees at the wheels also since this is a low to the ground vehicle it can quickly pop the ride height up 55 mm upon opening the door to make ingress and egress easier lowering back down once the door is closed if you're a current porsche tyon owner i'm sorry to say but you're going to have to upgrade the new tyon is such a leap forward in every metric and if you made it to the end of this video bless your scholarly devotion as your curiosity has allowed this channel to persist and i remain so grateful if you
