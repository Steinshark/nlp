there's a phone sitting on the desk that perhaps looks a little old i never had the first iphone that came out 10 years ago today it's june 29th but i did get the iphone 3g the next year the i the original item didn't really come out in the uk until october and this one came out pretty quickly afterwards in the next june so yeah i just thought we'd talk about the iphone and in fact for something slightly different sean is filming this one on my iphone so i'm actually shooting this on the iphone 7 plus give us a way for sean there we go excellent we could go into lots of detail about how the iphone is the greatest mobile phone in the trends it's set there's plenty of other people producing videos like you can get interviews with people apple who involved in creating it i think the the fascinating thing for me two things this is purely personal it was a huge difference when it came out in 2005 i bought this so it was a a mobile phone and an ipad unfortunately it doesn't work anymore if i drop it into its charging cradle i think the battery is gone it'll get as far as booting halfway through the instruction thing and it'll just dice so i bought this in 2005 it was an ipad and it was great in some ways so it was a touch screen with a resistive so you could tap it and you could use it for making notes it would run word sorry yeah it's just a slight problem with the iphone is that the black light is making you turn into a silhouette and that's how you you're yeah the atari is is flickering like nobody's but that's okay i'll just keep that right yeah so it worked sort of quite well but it had a few things it was it wasn't smooth though it would suddenly drop the 3g connection or i don't think it was 3g are coming out and literally you'd be sitting there waiting for a phone call and your phone completely discounted from the network and it never arrived so it was annoying things and actually so you you could get devices before the iphone that did some of the features but they just weren't as smooth and actually most of the time i went back to a sort of classic star trek beam me up scotty style motorola pretty soon afterwards and actually apple had worked with motorola on an itunes compatible variant of this the motorola rocker which was an unmitigated disaster i think is the phrase that's best used this is a phone that we have worked on with motorola so actually when this came along it was in many ways evolution i think it was just the fact that it just was so easy to use the sort of touch screen the multi-channel zone you could get on and it really was revolutionary i think and of course it influenced how android designed their phones and so on so it's sort of changing and of course it's interesting now that for a lot of people they don't use normal computers they just use a mobile phone like an iphone or an android phone perhaps coupled with a tablet like an ipad as their day-to-day computer device so it has it's it's in many ways it was as much a step from what computers were like before the macintosh to what they were like after the macintosh so before the microscopy had something like the apple ii of pcs at the time to the macintosh where you had a full sort of gui and we looked at the macintosh a couple of years ago when it was its 30th anniversary so you sort of i think it has created the c change in the way we use computers i don't think the vast majority of people are going to be using desktop or laptop computers we will still have them people still use them for certain tasks gaming perhaps although these qualifying consoles may get better at that who knows phones whatever certainly development probably want to do it on that although i'm starting to get ids that are even better on that so who knows maybe we'll just be talking to computers all the time like in star trek one one thing that i think is also quite important is it is obviously the interface it was was revolutionary you know this idea of touch people didn't use to or didn't have big screens and things like this yeah i mean it was interesting the sort of the multi-touch display was around you could see i think it was jeff han had a video that came out early 2006 you had the microsoft surface back where microsoft surface made an actual table service that took up the size of the room turning friends on to new music will one day be done with the greatest of ease the idea was there but suddenly you went from large displays the sort of installation type things to something you fitted in your pocket and i think that was again how they did how they managed that and actually sort of realizing that that created an interface that was just so usable was sort of fascinating the other thing i found fascinating in terms of its family tree and obviously you've got the apple sort of line feeding in it runs mac os x or a variant of it which comes from the mag and comes from next and so on but it was all designed around the arm chip so it's actually powered by an arm chip which is not unusual for a mobile phone or the ipod but of course that comes from the acorn line of things so this is a an old acorn 3000 and this is the probably great great great grand sommelier the granddaddy of the processor in a modern mobile phone this was the original arm 2 chip which powered things like this or the original archimedes so i can sort of see lots of different lines of technology sort of merging to form this one device we've got i would say one device but that was the one that sort of crystallized and from that you've got the android phones your windows phone i'm sure someone still uses them and so on and it really was different from having devices with keyboards or limited interactivity you could actually view a web page on this which you couldn't really do before even on something like the ipac it wasn't apple's first stab at having some kind of organizer in your pocket well yeah so apple had in the 90s they created the newton this is the original model i didn't have one at the time i sort of picked one up later which again you could actually sort of use to take notes it didn't have an internet connectivity although it did have an ir port so you could sort of stick your mobile phone if it had an ir port and get online that way but the interesting thing about this is that you could actually write on it and so in the sort of classic thing let's create a new note file this note in putting business this was shawn trying it the other day print note facts beam mail delete that's probably the best thing we want to do my important note you've just got absolutely so in the classic thing we just want to sort of take a note so in the classic one we want to beat up martin and just like in the symptoms it doesn't come out with the right answer take a member on your newton beat up martin so we actually got martin this time rather than eat up martha so yeah apple had done this before and actually this again was probably for its time a revolutionary device but it just wasn't quite ready the handwriting recognition wasn't quite good and of course it's still it's file effect style rather than sort of slip it in your pocket and use it so yeah i think it's everything came together and we history's shown how it's changed everything running there so yeah and of course the cameras aren't getting better and so we can even film computer file on a mobile phone now so what we've got here it's another zylogix disk controller of some sort you've got the control chips in the
