when you're doing that kind of back and forth on the topic like the economy which you have to me or have some naive but it seems both incredible and incredibly complex the economy the trading the transactions that these transactions between two individuals somehow add up to this giant mechanism you've put out a 30 minute video you have a lot of incredible videos online that people should definitely watch on youtube but you've put out this 30 minute video titled how the economic machine works that is probably one of the best if not the best video i've seen on the internet in terms of educational videos so people should definitely watch it especially because it's not that the individual components of the video are somehow revolutionary but the simplicity and the clarity of the different components just makes you there's a few light bulb moments there about what how the economy works as a machine so as you described there's three main forces that drive the economy productivity growth short term debt cycle long term debt cycle the the former productivity growth is how valuable things how much value people create valuable things people create the latter is people borrowing from the their future selves to hopefully create those valuable things faster so this is an incredible system to me maybe we can linger on in a little bit but you've also said well most people think about as money is actually credit total amount of credit in the u.s. is 50 trillion dollars total amount of money is three trillion dollars that's just crazy to me maybe maybe i'm silly maybe you can educate me but that seems crazy it gives me just pause that the human civilization has been able to create a system that has so much credit so that's a long way to ask do you think credit is good or bad for society that system of that's so fundamentally based on credit i think credit is great even though people often overdo it the credit is that somebody has earned money yeah and you know and what happens is they lend it to somebody else who's got better ideas and they cut a deal and then that person with the better ideas is gonna pay it back and if it works well it helps resource allocations go well providing people look like the entrepreneurs and all of those they need capital they don't have capital themselves and so somebody's gonna give them capital and they'll give them credit and along those lines then what happens is it's not managed well in a variety of ways so i did a another book on principles principles of big debt crisis that go into that and it's free by the way i met put it free online on as a pdf so if you go online and you look principles for big debt crisis is under my name you can download it in a pdf where you can buy a print book of it and it goes through that particular process and so you always have it over done in all ways the same way everything by the way almost everything happens over and over again for the same reasons okay so these debt crisis has all happen over and over again for the same reasons they get it over done in the book it explains how you identify whether it's overdone or not they get it overdone and then you go through the process of making the adjustments according that and then and it explains how they can use the levers and so on if you didn't have credit then you would be sort of everybody sort of be stuck so credit is a good thing but it can easily be overdone so now we get into the quote what is money what is credit okay you get into money and credit so if you're holding credit and you think that's worthwhile keep in mind that the central bank let's say it can print the money what is that problem they you have an iou and the iou says you're going to get a certain number of dollars let's say or yen or euros and that is what the iou is and so the question is will you get that money and what what will it be worth and then also you have a government which is a participant in that process because they want they are on the hook they old money and then will they print the money to make it easy for everybody to pay so you have to pay attention to those two i would suggest like you you recommend to other people just take that 30 minutes and it in it and it comes across pretty clearly but the my conclusion is that of course you want it and even if you understand it and the cycles well you can benefit from those cycles rather than to be hurt by those cycles because i don't know the way the cycle works if somebody gets over indebted they have to sell an asset okay then i don't know me that's when assets become cheaper how do you acquire the asset it's a whole process you
