have even played this game i played halo reach okay well let's see how that works for you i've been watching ltt for about like three years now i was watching since the old langley house let's hope being a longtime ltt fan will bring you some luck against linus all right that's one down he's a lot better than i thought he was come on looks like jake's halo reach experience is helping him out what did i get a melee kill and die linus dropping those grenades like he does best look out jake oh sorry buddy that's it that's three gg hey maybe the next gamer is gonna actually freaking beat me here so i won a rtx 3070 here i was looking for this card for so long now especially actually this one that my computer doesn't have much rgb in it right now it's sure gonna light up now i was not expecting to be 3-0 bring in more gamers we need to stop this madman my name is plato aka last one i am a game developer working at kabam currently i'm a front-end engineer i will try to beat him at halo because he's an app oh first are we playing with mouse and keyboard right your choice okay so yes hey i'll try not to plow toe you over typically i've been watching lmg since 2014-15 around that i gotcha i haven't played this game any of those games that he gave me the option in the last 20 years at least see you later plato come on plato you could have found some time in the past 20 years to brush up on those skills gigi plato thank you very much for coming out i won a gpu i lost the matches but i still a winner right well we'll sit on the shelf until i can get the rest the other parts of the computer now it will it will be much easier yeah for sure all right what's your name i'm i've i'm a game developer i'm learning right now i have not played any of the games that are there so i'm good with fps so maybe halo i was going for halo but i saw you destroy him i'll try halo i'm much fun you can try hello yeah all right let's do it i don't know if that was a smart move or not i've been playing games like as long as i can remember and again for all i know this guy could be just like a total sandbagger oh i'm sure you i'm not i just came in thinking i would be better because i've played a lot of fps in my life do you want to fight me or do you want to run uh-oh looks like linus has poked the lion oh get away from me and they both bite the bullet i got a first kill on liner so i thought it would be easier but no it was like a lot harder oh see you later bud 2-2 another sudden death let's go arnoff show our boss who's boss all right thank you so much gg man great game great game yeah i didn't beat linus but i got a chance to get to 30 60. that's a win in my books i'll use this gpu for my school work i'm a game developer so i'm needed for it challenger number six approaches so my name is johnny i'm here to buy a graphic card to verify i'm an actual gamer gamer you're going to beat linus out today i played mario i'm feeling pretty good i'ma go get me another coin oh oh all right these poor gamers have yet to win any discounts on their gpus yes i think i could could have done better but to be honest i haven't played that game for 30 years thank you for coming out two out of three that's it gg man good game cooking it's a good battle i got a 3070. just gonna enjoy the graphic card and play games play my old games i couldn't play that's the first thing come on up come on down oh my name's pop hi follow me on twitch twitch.tv pop eats tadpoles or not you know don't feel peer pressure i hope to beat linus at memes because honestly i'm not really sure that i'm that good of a gamer lttstore.com but you know isn't the real winning thing to just be in the presence of linus no the real winning is beating lattice yeah you're right yeah getting a gpu at msrp is already a win up until a couple of years ago i used to be really into competitive overwatch okay all right you know what i i'm confident enough but i'm willing to offer you 15 off if you can beat me and if you get killed only once i'll do 20. you want a piece of that action yes all right let's do it somebody stop this madman he's changing the rules oh wait he's the ceo because you know how this works right like if i have to sell these things for less than msrp you know i'm losing money right that's okay you have money our gamers are showing line is a little attitude see you later i assumed that he picked all these games because he was good at them so i definitely didn't come in hoping to win oh i'm sorry you know what though if you can kill me three times in a row you can still have 10 off i was just gonna choose halo because well it's a shooter i can at least you know aim the gun at it and hope for the best i'm gonna need a little bit more than hope to beat linus did you jump blow yourself up you have minus one point i was sure i didn't kill you i guess i blew myself that's okay you put forward a valiant effort and the consolation prize is still 30-70 at msrp there we go 70. time to sell it on ebay and kijiji let's go nah this is mine you can't take it back sorry no take backsies oh my god i did terribly against lioness he has that big boomer energy you know don't forget to shop at lttstar.com i thought i was going to be down so much money by this point in the day my name is steve i work in i.t i get a lot of recycled computers my way so that's what i usually used to game on and stuff yeah we're gonna beat last out today hopefully beat saber these everyone option today also there's no freaking way now that sounds like a challenge let's do mortal kombat our first mortal kombat challenger will this finally be our combo breaker i've been playing mortal kombat since i was like elementary school back in the 80s 90s going down to the 7-eleven on my lunch breaks and stuff i do not know how to play this game only evga was here to help me with this one the gamers have discovered his weakness a challenge to best of three in mortal kombat oh wait what is fatal blow extra damage oh round two all right looks like our boy steve's got a strategy here all right so i just gotta get in there fine yeah well that's fine i can wait oh nice i just figured out a combo the timer linus the timer what what just happened timed out shut up i don't even know the rules there it is our first discount winner do you go sudden death just one round for the opportunity to win a 25 discount with you on this yeah all right like stealing candy from a baby okay all right because maybe i was faking it no i know when you're kidding i've watched your shows long enough let's go steve the hopes and dreams of gpu discounts lay in your hands that's it ladies and gentlemen i just gave out my first 25 discount so i apparently am the first winner of the day i beat linus and all the challenges good game gamer 25 off i was using a lenovo thinkpad notebook with a external graphics card in a b stock and 970 which i sold for 450 dollars no questions asked but i do have 580 in my current desktop it's fun it's exciting in all this code times get out of the house and do things i'm kevin i upgraded my whole system and just after christmas but have been sort of lacking on the graphics card sex department since then i've been playing call of duty cold war a lot lately i'm hoping to beat him at halo but it's been a while so we'll see how that goes i've been watching the channel since it was ncxtec like whenever that was has the loss in mortal kombat oh there we go one kill down okay this guy knows what he's doing ladies and gentlemen oh looks like the halo king is back i had a feeling that he would probably be pretty good at whichever games he picked i think that's probably an advantage okay got the melee kill my expectations weren't super high because i probably haven't played that game in like 10 years i only gotta get one more kill no problem unless kevin here is sandbagging me sandbagging run kevin he's a madman he lines beat me i was three nothing oh gg kevin thank you very much for playing i won the evga 3070 for the win three i've had my name on a waitlist at memory express since probably january i just like to thank linus media group and evga for having this program and making cards more accessible to gamers i memory after i moved to vancouver or canada youtube just like stopped like started stuffing your stuff in and i started watching it and i was like okay like i like this i'm gonna pick halo because to be honest like i never played the mario battle something i don't even remember the name and for the mortal kombat i didn't play that for so long so i'm guessing my best chance with like halo i know you play a lot of halo so i hope i had a chance but no i don't i just played it when i was young and the demo was free i don't want to encourage the scalpers because as long as people are buying them like people gonna just do it again so i will say like okay like i will wait okay ah that's all right gotta reload oh see you later ah crap it's two to one let's see if emery can clutch two kills real quick oh there it is oh i was expecting this all right emery good game yeah it was a little humiliating but at least i'm in this little guy called rtx 3070 thanks to linus finally i got one thank you evj next challenger approaches what's your name gamer my name is clarence i've been a fan of the channel for a couple years now maybe three or four years currently i'm only able to play valorente or cs some games i'd like to play are maybe apex legends or call of duty today i think i'm going to beat linus at halo i think shooters was my best option here i'm not good at fighting games or platformers so clarence just threw a grenade at a gun what what did you just did you just fall and die i sure hope he doesn't play valerian like this oh my secret's out i'm not actually that good at fps games 1-1 oh no it's 2-2 got that nate kill we've got a tiebreaker situation ladies and gentlemen next kill wins come on melee finish clarence slips out of linus's mail [music] oh no yeah tie breaker baby here we go i'm not very confident at beating linus at halo because it's my first time playing oh you went and you got that again didn't you again with the grenades linus doing what he does best dropping everything he has good game man that was tight take the 10 discount you earned it i stole that from you with that nade killed just take it take it and go linus what happened to those rules you laid out at the start i just won an rtx 3070. we tied but lioness did decide to give me a 10 off so i'm really thankful for that so last christmas i bought all my pc parts but the graphics card and cpu so now i can finally build it and i'm really happy step right up step right up my name is mike i've actually been watching linus since he was for ncix so it's been a hot minute i'm upgrading from a really old laptop i had a gtx 960 mobile card and now i'm going with a full desktop setup hoping to beat linus in mortal kombat today okay i am going to come clean with you i have basically never played this game before you have chosen wisely oh boy he's not letting me move that's very cheap judging by the look on his face linus is getting a taste of utter defeat and he even knows the finish him combos and everything look at that do you want to go sudden death one more round to go from 10 to 25 discount i don't think it'd be very exciting if i didn't i've been playing mortal kombat for a while so yeah i'm fairly confident no he brought me over there the puppeteer mike what a move i didn't want to go over there oh all right gg gamer and thank you very much so today i won an rtx 3060. i have been waiting to put a new graphic card in my system for a very long time the parts have been sitting in my bedroom annoying my wife i couldn't justify the scalpers if it came down to it i probably would have sold the parts i had at home and bought a laptop i used to work on the deeper speed franchise and so i've driven some like crazy cars and stuff and after finishing that i had the same sort of like handshake that you do getting out of like a proper sports car so it was fun next gamer come on up hello what's your name gamer my name is alexa i'm hoping to beat him at super mario bros we'll see how that goes because it'll be my first time playing but i feel like that's the game i have the best shot at to give a percentage i want to say like maybe 77 no that's really high like maybe 70 chance of beating him but we'll see hi alexa right i've never heard that one i'm so sorry i'm sure that never comes up i haven't played a platformer or a fighting game or an fps in a very long time so i thought that this was the one i had the best shot at what games do you play no fps no platformers no fighting we thought we had the spectrum covered pretty well here i normally play like really open wide like large story based rpgs like anything where your decisions matter i think my favorite right now is dragon age origins that's the game i have the most time on and it's a game i love the most all right unfortunately we don't have competitive dragon age origins dragon age won't help you on the bloody battlefield oh mario ralph okay now are you messing with me here how'd you stay alive down there so long i don't know wait what are those little fly guys i don't believe that you have no idea what's going on here are you sure i'm pretty sure okay i'm starting to believe it a bit more it's one one i might have watched a couple of youtube videos all right about it will linus see his first loss in mario battle today good game alexa i got the 30-70 and i'm very excited you know i think if i got a second chance i could beat him i probably could i'd say i'd say i'm almost where he's at maybe i'm really looking forward to baldur's gate three i've been kind of avoiding playing the beta just because i don't want to spoil it for myself before it's fully released definitely would not have been able to afford a new graphics card without this program so i'm very very very excited my name is eric i hope to beat linus at mortal kombat i've actually never played i just thought it'd be a game to pick up like really on the spot so maybe i'll change to like halo or something maybe i guess we'll go with halo halo all right i've been watching ltt since the ncx days back when lioness was still doing unboxing videos should have stuck with your first choice eric linus has been practicing all day got that name too [music] watch out he's right behind you did i just get you yeah yes sir oh bummer i'm sorry you hear that possibly i would have done better in mortal kombat i switched because i was more comfortable with first-person shooters oh no it's 2-1 oh wow that was a favorable spawn oh what the see you later bud oh gg i won a 30 70 from evga i actually got destroyed i've been waiting for a card i guess beginning of the year so yeah it's been a few months i'm looking to put together like a new rig so last piece of the puzzle and i finally got it i don't want to i guess influence the scalper market so yeah i would have waited i guess forever maybe 40 80 would be out by that night thank you lmg for putting this all together and getting the cards to gamers let's meet our next gamer my name is jonathan i've been watching lct since 2014-2015 so a few years i do play a few first-person shooters the most recent i've been playing d-pro galactic i'd like to think i'm decently good at fps's well where i measure up against linus we'll see yeah i have zero experience with halo so yeah that i don't know how that's gonna go oh god you're this way oh no wow okay if you win here he goes again you can have a 20 discount 20 but you gotta not get one more death that's a great deal on a gpu i basically got a new computer apart from the graphics card in october i'm running the entirely new system right now just with an rx570 oh how are you not dead yet jonathan's already got one kill can he keep his lead or you're not dead yet can you die please oh there goes 20 off oh that's such a shame i mean i wasn't gonna pick super mario because i'm not great at platformers and you know or mortal kombat i've never even seen mortal kombat before so he just had to pick games he was actually good at if you don't die again you can have 15 points quit teasing the contestant's life where you at boy as a gamer he's he trash talks a lot oh there he is got the foot shot linus has completely turned the game back in his favor wow oh man all right good game yeah i won an rtx 3070 uga yeah i got smoked i'm just glad i actually got the opportunity right otherwise i would have been paying two times three times the price with scalper prices and that's just ridiculous so very happy i got this i'm ready for my next gamer come on in my name is brandon probably been watching for about three or four years i watch all the main channels i've missed some you know channel super fun videos but i try to stick to as much as i can i have a 9900k with 32 gigs of ram 970 evo and a 750 watt power supply but i don't have a video card because i sold it so you know it's that's a problem i sold my card back in the summer and you know thinking i was going to be able to get no problem little did i know everyone on the planet wants one if i don't get a single kill 20 off what gpu you're buying 30 70. that's a lot of money it's a lot of money it's a lot of money on the line so act like it you going let's go all right all right these deals seem more like a mind game than anything at this point man if i lose i think i have a shot at it you know just playing wars and a lot but tink linus is pretty familiar with it and you know maybe after a whole day of gaming he'll be all tired out and i might have a chance watch out folks he's been warming up all day and these hands are hot see you later bud oh i'ma give it to you for 20 off if you win all right all right so you get another do-over he has some tricks up his sleeves and he's a he's a pretty tricky guy what is this some game you play or whatever where there's no grenades apparently all right see you later buddy do you not use grenades do you know do you know what they do they you pull the thing and then you throw them yeah they're so overpowered in there wait oh yeah it's over it's over did i just melee you four times i think you might have i was too busy pressing f i'm spamming after the grenades yeah well i'm gonna press f pay respects to your chances there at a discount but that's okay you still get a 30 70 at msrp which is basically like getting it for half price these days yeah you think i'm gonna complain this is 50 off basically at least someone is enjoying the savagery that is halo against linus yeah so i got an evga 3070 right here and it looks great i'm really happy with that i didn't get the discount but unfortunately but you know what it's msrp and i really can't complain about that i definitely feel a little bit less of a gamer by being beaten by linus considering he i don't he plays as many video games as i do so that hurts a little bit it stings but i just need to double down i think now so that if i do ever get this chance again i'll be ready welcome actual gamer my name is james i'm a gamer i've been with linus since the beginning basically i could say that i was hoping to play some fps but i think i'm gonna go with otherwise i'm gonna go with mortal kombat what do you think your chances are yeah maybe now a little lower my chances are probably a little lower after hearing that but you know i'm not warmed up yet so we'll see hey he grabbed a mouse to play mortal kombat this is a good sign i mean evga all right they're they hooked us up they hooked you up everyone's getting gpus at msrp everyone's getting discounts if they can beat me so go ahead here sure one round with no he's locked into the keyboard and mouse now what do you think this is it's not some kind of chair i made a mistake james has chosen the right game but has he chosen the wrong weapon previous experience with fighting games would mostly be smash bros a lot of smash bros ever since smash 4 a little bit of mk x not 11. i'm hoping they're pretty similar i should have went with the controller i'm being stunned yes yes he's unlocked he's unlocked ladies and gentlemen here we go here we go here we go here we go oh this is the cheapest thing i've ever seen in my life come on james you gotta mash those buttons strategically oh crap wow that's how it's gonna be all right no i don't even i don't even care what is this has linus finally learned how to play did i just win it mortal kombat hold on a second here without mortal kombat as his weakness how will he ever be defeated oh not quite linus please have some mercy on the poor boy no yes unbelievable i got destroyed over a comeback all day you get a 10 discount anyway i don't even care no oh my ego my ego feels so much better after how hard i lost at this game my mouse and keyboard i feel terrible i should have used a controller let's give you the opportunity i gave you the 10 discount do you want to go double or nothing but you get to use a controller so if you lose you get no discount if you win though you get a 25 discount we have to you got to reduce i came all this away and i was late like all right for the contract i think the true trademark of a gamer is to never tilt and never give up he's got a second chance but linus is just about to put him down one last time no wait there's no way could james turn this around i don't know if it's quite enough is it enough i think it's enough strollers are better i pulled it off at the very end 25 discount new gpu 30 70 with 25 percent off sponsored by linus himself was a quite a roller coaster to get there though i pulled it off with whatever left left and right trigger do together it really got my heart going and but yeah i'm really linus i shouldn't see lioness was very generous to still give me the double or nothing despite my failure in front so yeah i appreciate linus for that well that was a ton of fun and i didn't even have to lose quite as much money as i thought so that's a definite plus i just want to thank evga though not only for providing the gpus for the in-person event but also the ones for the online drop that went along with this video and for sending over their z20 and x17 gaming peripherals for all of our verified gamers to use i also want to thank everyone who came out and participated one way or another
