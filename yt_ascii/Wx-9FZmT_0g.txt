what's up happy friday and welcome to the wan show we've got a great show lined up for you this week but that's what we say every week but this time i actually mean it youtube has announced a spam crackdown and coincidentally so if you so have i yeah yeah we're gonna be talking a little bit about that later on also oh wow really really twitter blocked jerry rig everything yep along with journalists who have covered elon in the past particularly elon jettle so the elon jet account so we'll be talking about the'0 degree about face that elon musk has done on his whole freedom of speech absolutionist thing that he said and never really demonstrated any commitment to what else we got yeah which one of these should i do you don't like this one which one is this the one i highlighted come on it's awesome okay tick tock takes on youtube with experimental landscape video feature ticked up we got landscape now boom boom boom boom boom now we've got landscape with copyrighted music we're not paying licensing fees for about yeah also linus is going to rant about apps that copy paste metadata along with text yeah cause it's stupid that's annoying [music] [music] the show is brought today by ovh cloud msi and zoho one let's go ahead and jump right into youtube announces spam crackdown on wednesday youtube announced that they will be dealing with the scourge of spam comments stealing creators profile pics and posting emoji-filled prize-winning lies that's right they are finally doing something i mean they've been they've been doing something for a while but they're like what do you mean they removed the dislike button okay i mean but no problem solved no but like even even live chat is apparently getting improved bot detection for example which is actually kind of exciting because i don't know if you guys realize this especially those of you who are watching on youtube but i do not look at the youtube chat at all i mean you guys see me screen share and how often if ever do you even see this window open do you ever see this window what that means is i am not looking at the youtube chat because it moves so fast it is full of absolute garbage and do i need any other reasons no than that no that's good enough moves really fast and it's full of garbage it's fast garbage yeah twitch is like loading and chunks is actually kind of helpful because once it loads a bunch it pauses first it's slow garbage you can actually read and then there's float plane which is quality yeah yeah exactly but hey maybe that's going to change so youtube will be implementing improved span spam detection on video comments as spammers change their tactics our machine learning models are improving to better detect new types of spam so that's good they're working on improved bot detection in live chat and they are okay cool so they've this is this is the mo the controversial part this is what i really wanted to talk to you about because up until now as far as i can tell and like a a machine learning chat moderator or comment moderator was only able to remove a comment but the real change in capabilities is that they will now be able to issue warnings and timeouts to users so if you leave abusive comments an actual bot will be able to issue you a 24-hour timeout what do you think of that bought moderators that will not only remove a comment or hold for moderation but actually take moderator actions can you can you turn it off as far as i can tell the plan is to implement these features platform wide without any kind of toggle for creators i i would be far more comfortable with it if you could turn it off because then the vast majority of people could just leave it on and it would be fine but then like remember when they were i don't know exactly how to word this but youtube was reducing the spread of of anything that mentioned covet at all yes those types of well it wasn't the okay so hold on it was that monetization was disabled on anything to do with but doesn't that basically automatically mean when you're youtube that you're not boosting those videos as well no well okay so i've had this conversation with people high up enough at youtube that they should at least know the right answers whether they tell them to me or not okay youtube claims swears up and down that the monetization status of a video does not affect its reach they also swear up and down that they don't know how the algorithm fully works because it's machine learning i believe that yeah so how would they know this because if they're telling the thing like we want you to find ways to make money why would it promote demonetizing my understanding though is that that is not a focus for the algorithmic inputs the focus is for the algorithmic inputs are not just watch time okay so it used to be views and then things like likes and comments yeah things like interactions started to play heavily into it as well and then it evolved to watch time that was the that was the animation apocalypse right when youtube started to emphasize watch time over view counts because animation is so expensive to make per minute compared to something like vaude or in particular something like like like long gameplay videos or or streams right then they kind of realized well okay watch time is not the bl and end-all and for at least the last few years their emphasis has been on satisfaction that's the word that you can't talk to a youtube employee for more than probably 10 minutes about the algorithm without them using viewer satisfaction sure so they take a number of signals for that they take whether you watch the video through right like how much of the video you watch how you engage with it commenting on it liking it for example a big big one for satisfaction is if you click on another video when you're done watching if you click on another video from that creator that's a really strong indicator for satisfaction so if you want to be fed more of a certain creator or more of a certain kind of content watch through a video click on another one of their videos and watch that and i pretty much promise you that your feed is going to be full of that kind of stuff the other thing is that interesting sometimes youtube uses ad spots for things that are not ads and you've probably seen this a fair bit no you have premium don't you okay so one of the things that you will see if you're an ad supported user is surveys and they won't just ask you did you like this video because that's what this button's for right and you know they've got five different settings so you can tell it exactly how much you liked it anywhere from one star to five stars wait that'd be a good idea though so that's 2006 youtube yeah that's what the thumbs up and thumbs down is for so they'll ask you things like how did this video make you feel right like you guys have probably you guys have probably seen this so that is all so that they can gauge the user satisfaction how much did this video satisfy you because the idea is that it's all about keeping you on the platform for as many hours of the day as humanly or i mean realistically machinely possible yeah we actually did an a b test a while back where we took two similar videos actually we did it a couple of times so it was with a few different videos but we took two videos that we kind of expected to perform similarly and intentionally disabled monetization on them to see if well because my theory was that the one without monetization given youtube's desire for better satisfaction from viewers i thought the one without monetization would actually perform better yeah than the one with monetization people would leave less right and so the reason that i cared about this was because sponsored videos will pay like way more per view than an ad supported video so the idea was that if we had a fully sponsored video and we could boost its reach by simply disabling google ads then that would be an obvious value add to the sponsor it would juice up our our view counts and it would mean that we could sell sponsored videos for more so that was my whole plan was i was like oh okay well maybe we can increase viewer satisfaction by removing google ads ultimately increasing the value of our sponsored videos but what we found every single time was that there did not appear to be any correlation whatsoever and i i called bs on this previously yeah the really wild part all right is that what you're getting into uh sort of okay call bs on okay so i i called bs on this previously because i said that if i'm ever on a device which is annoyingly often that i'm not logged into the one google account that i have premium on because there's no way i'm going to get premium on like seven different google accounts yeah so if i'm ever logged in or it thinks that account is active or whatever i will immediately leave because there's no way i'm watching an ad but i think i understand now there's an example that you're going to throw out that is that is really interesting but i think i also understand i think at this point if you don't have they're missing context still luke oh okay sorry go for it okay the really wild thing is that every time i talk to anyone from youtube they will swear up and down that ads do not affect retention or satisfaction yeah like even mid-roll ads like i don't know if you guys have noticed but because we have baked in sponsor reads to our videos we do not include mid-roll ads on our ltt content and the reason for that is that from my point of view i feel the same way as you a mid-roll ad is a very strong a very high friction leave point point for me yeah but they say that it doesn't affect retention and one of the highest profile the king of retention on the platform a mr beast i know enables mid-roll ads puts them in liberally let's google just figure out the best place to put them and just lets it do its thing and somehow that works yeah clearly yeah i i someone pointed out like oh that's just because you have another account to switch to no i i said device so if i'm on if i'm on someone else's computer if i'm on this laptop i don't have my personal email because my my youtube premium is on my personal email if i don't have my personal email logged into something i just literally won't watch youtube because of the ads but thinking about that i was like oh i will know that and not go to youtube or i will know that or not realize that go to youtube get an ad and immediately leave permanently so i think if people are going to youtube they're expecting ads so it's not going to make them leave an individual video i'm inspecting ads it's also a totally different viewer like the demographics of a channel like mr beast for example and our channel are gonna be very different in the same way that the demographics of like uh like a super popular you know beauty channel or gaming channel or science channel actually science and technology overlapitan that was a bad example but like yeah a comedy channel the demographics are going to be super different and i think that among tech savvy viewers you might find that the the way that we are conditioned to accept ads is not as much so i don't want to generalize but i think it's probably fair to say that among the tech savvy audience you are more likely to find people who engage in ad blocking yeah content piracy you're more likely to find people who engage with new platforms like i would say that the tech savvy audience that's watching us right now was far more likely to subscribe to netflix in the very early days than their mom or their auntie or their dad or grandma those people are super tech savvy as well but yeah exactly but that's what i'm saying is like i think that the tech savvy audiences tolerance for advertising is probably lower because they've spent the last 20 years not absorbing as much advertising as the average viewer like i go over to my in-laws place and the tv is on you know like all the time table yeah like television yeah and i'm standing in front of it and you know it's like it's like oh glowing object like fire me watch you know like it it draws you in right yeah or there's something interesting on it and then you know because it's like 30 advertising something comes on i'm like oh yeah ads have gotten like kind of kind of funny these sets see you later like that's it i'm done i'm i'm out because i'm not conditioned to to watch that whereas they'll just sit in front of it yeah and i'm like oh well that's a generational gap that i hadn't really like thought about in a while yeah and so maybe maybe i mean okay here's something tick tock to my knowledge doesn't have premium okay it i have no idea yeah guys you're gonna have to correct me if i'm wrong but my understanding is that there are no there's just either you view ads on tick tock or that's it i don't know that's actually a pretty good question what is tick tock premium tick tock pro is an extended version of tick tock what apparently their ads are super trivial to skip though so apparently they are they're super easy to can you just like scroll past it ads can just be scrolled away yeah yeah but someone's got to watch it or they wouldn't even be able to keep the servers running so i don't i don't know i i can't explain this because i'm i'm like you guys i mean i i don't even see ads most of the time someone will be like how you do that is is actually crazy i because okay so he's gonna say this and you guys are gonna go like oh okay yeah he just ignores him no like he literally somehow just like mentally blocks it i don't know how to describe oh man i've tried to like explain how an ad on a website like like interacted with the rest of the experience or like push things out of the way and he'd be like oh i don't know i didn't see it i'm like it's like half the screen he's like i don't know it's actually wild i do have a threshold i might have actually sent you this screenshot a little while ago but i opened up an article where on my phone my folding phone like my giant phone screen there was like two lines of text that i could read and the entire rest of the thing was ads yeah it's bad i think i did send you that right i was like well here's another here's an argument for privateering and yeah in that case i was aware of the ads but i couldn't tell you what any of them were for right oh i could see was my two lines of content and i felt my interests mental ad blocking service was like getting overloaded like there's too much it's gotta be an add thing or something like like hyper focus is like is is apparently a thing okay and so when i'm when i'm reading i am reading and you go fast if you could find my grade three four teacher i had her for both years and talked to her about kid linus okay i was a really really like bad student wow i am amazed and surprised by this information yeah thanks for that so you know what would actually be a really funny stream we should bring my my childhood report cards onto the show someday my dad kept them all whoa okay yeah so i have all my report cards and back in the day i don't know if they still do it this way i don't get report cards like this but i had letter grades effort grades yeah and then maybe it was just the school i went to they're very thorough they would write like a page or two pages about you for every report card or maybe it was just me we had we had paragraphs so our report cards are similar in that way and then we had paragraph sections under each topic got it so for like maths or or sciences or whatever you would have like a paragraph for each for each one well i got a page anyway one of the things that i would do in in class is and like at the time i thought i was totally getting away with it i thought nobody had any idea but i would sit you know you know the desks that you have in elementary school right with the storage in them a bar thing and stuff yeah yeah with like the cubby inside it so i would prop a book in my cubby and i would sit in class i'd kind of slouch like this and i would just read a novel like it's like a worse it's not the worst off topic thing you could be doing no but i'd have no idea what's going on it's still not the worst it's not good so when there's so when there's there's a a project you know and instructions have been issued linus are you gonna go get the construction pit oh sorry what i would have no idea that anything else existed the only thing that would penetrate my consciousness was math want to know why because any time the teacher said something something minus something because oh i would think i heard my name goodness no it's just math and i'd go back to my book oh it's pretty funny oh so anywho i definitely yeah twitch chat that's yeah hopefully yvonne doesn't like look at this it's definitely a sore spot with my wife because when i'm like on my phone oh yeah i have yeah i mean you know this when i'm in a meeting if i get sidetracked for a second he's gone i started reading something you say you can be talking before i finally acknowledge that i have not heard a word you've said and ask you it's it's not that bad in my opinion but for a reason that probably won't make you that happy because it's not that bad because he will always interrupt you because he thinks whatever he's doing is probably more interesting or more important so if he's reading something he's probably going to want to share the information about what he's reading so so you learn pretty quick he's not paying attention because he's gonna say something in the middle of using something he was just like okay i guess we're talking about this stuff reading it if it wasn't really important that's questionable hmm funny things i think i think if you in that moment decide that you even if the information is important you just don't want it right now you will you will sidetrack yourself with whatever sometimes i don't want to hear it yeah so you'll be like oh i'm gonna read something else ah yeah i mean i don't claim to be the world's most attentive person i genuinely think that that's a huge part of my success though i wouldn't undo it for the world because it's one of the things that like makes it so that i can be in the middle of a conversation and like have an idea like it's where i actually get a lot of my inspiration from that i'm not really paying attention i'm actually thinking about something else have you in our so we weekly we have these meetings where i go over like what the dev teams are kind of doing and all that kind of stuff do you notice that i repeat stuff sometimes no no yeah i didn't think so so i've learned i've known him for a long time so i will sometimes pick up on like he didn't get that at all and sometimes i will i'll make a decision in the moment and sometimes i'll be like once notice sometimes i'll be like you know what honestly that wasn't like that important i also write reports and send them out through email i do read them and i know he reads those so i'm like if it wasn't that important for him to know right now or if i don't need a response back he'll just read it later it'll be fine and sometimes i'm like no i actually need like what he thinks about this or his opinion on or whatever so i'll just say it again [laughter] wait until i'm like pretty sure you're done doing whatever you were doing and then i'll just fire again and i don't even bother go like so i think you might have missed this i'm just like whatever so the thing is like i kind of got that gen z multitasking energy but i do not have that gen z attentiveness energy so i am single tasking for things at once with one quarter of the quality pretty much oh no all right someone said i i don't i lost it but they said something along the lines of like luke just lets his boss ignore him it's not even that's not i don't think that's fair because i don't think he's ignoring you no i'm not he's just that's why i said he'll talk to you about it whatever it is he's just on a different topic now but he's he's on that topic now still with you so he'll bring you in and you'll go on this little adventure for a while and when he's ready to come back you can just keep going it's you are not off of the adventure he's not ignoring he's just yeah you are welcome to go with him oh man anyways back to yeah what are we supposed to be talking about way off of it yeah we're on youtube right spam crackdown yeah so this was a coincidence oh okay hold on we do have some discussion questions how bad is comment spam in lmg's experience it's gotten a lot better but i have still noticed some i mean yeah breaking through yep i've noticed some i've noticed i'm still seeing some of the copy pasting a highly upvoted comment with just like a sexual profile picture stuff like that i'm still seeing a fair bit of that i've seen almost none of the whatsapp bots though message me on whatsapp with like that has gone a lot better yep the one that you just mentioned copy pasting a highly uploaded comment that i've seen a lot more and i've seen it making small edits which is interesting oh that i haven't noticed but i've never gone and looked for the original i all i know i didn't particularly find the original i just assumed that's what it was doing but on a video fairly recently i said the control f thing the comment included my name and then ended up finding like a huge amount of almost identically the same comment and then some like lewd profile photo interesting what is this and it a lot of them were exactly the same and then other ones would have like slight edits it feels like maybe they like kind of merged two comments together somewhere right or maybe they're editing off of each other or maybe that i don't 100 know what interesting really really similar yeah it definitely does seem like it's improved i would like to see them i think that timing out is a good middle ground i don't agree with everything youtube does especially around content moderation but i think that timeout is a good middle ground between just outright removing accounts that are perceived as spammy because the line between a really smart chat bot and some people is blurry indeed so i think that it is possible that they could actually end up banning a lot of real human accounts if they just banned people but timeout is a is a great way to dramatically reduce the effectiveness of bots yeah and give them time to go in and like prune these with a more hopefully manual process yeah but also you know not accidentally throw out a bunch of wheat with chaff jaden in full playing chat just said to be clear jaden one of the full plane developers in full plane chat just said gpd3 is terrifying for spam absolutely yeah it really is yeah i mean there could be so much more spam than i realized like a lot of the spam comments could be totally benign now because these accounts are building up a history over a long over a long period of time of leaving good comments so that it's a lot harder to identify them as a bot six months or' months down the road i mean that's one of the things that is of value when it comes to either renting out or or selling a botnet or like a or like a like a fake account for whether it's a social media platform or youtube or whatever else is if you have long-term established accounts that have not in that time been flagged as spam accounts they're way more valuable that's one of the reasons why stealing something like an old inactive reddit account is absolutely something that a spammer would want to do yeah and they can even target them subtopic and it's total it's a total coincidence that this happens to be on the same week but i have decided to reverse something that has been a long time policy for me and the reason is pretty straightforward let me just see if i can if i can find my thing no that's not it i have an email that just i i had sent to a couple of people james wan that should bring it up just kind of talking about you know what would what would qualify as that's not the right one darn it hold on i will find this i don't know 100 nobody's looking for so i can't help him yeah here we go okay so i have said in the past many times that when it comes to content moderation under videos i'm basically kind of like yeah it's kind of anything goes outside of you know really really toxic obvious spam abusive behavior or anything like that you know go ahead and say whatever you want but as i was reading through the comments on one of our recent videos what i realized is that that policy has led to a very very low conversation quality under the videos if you kind of understand what i mean yep and so one of the things that i've decided to start doing is just using the hide from channel button a lot more liberally so here's an example of you know a critical take that would absolutely never get you hidden from the channel so this was on the corsair xenia on flex video i consider myself a bit of a tech enthusiast but i just don't understand the point of these flex monitors like not in any way at all i think it's such a total waste of resources and i wouldn't even consider buying one at any point in time for any price point if i was given one i'd sell it or give it away honestly i don't agree with that take that is i i can absolutely see the value of it at the current price pretty challenging but to say that you'd be given something for free and not at least give it a shot i think is pretty close-minded like i don't agree with this comment but it's it's absolutely valid an example of something that is not valid and just simply doesn't need to be under the video is this one linus casually suggesting 1440p 240 hertz and oled at peak 700 nits is noob level tier is funny it tells us where his head is that never happened i just i think i'm just kind of done with taking things i never said and being like wow i can't believe he said that what i said was that none of its specs individually are best in class top of the line and none of those specs are 1440p is not the highest resolution 240 hertz is not the highest refresh rate and 700 nits peak brightness is not as bright as a monitor will get but you said that you like pancakes that means you hate waffles right so what i went on to say is that but what it is is a really great package and so this is one of those things that i i think over the long term i think it's going to take a long time but i think over the long term could have a really positive impact on the kind of conversations that people can have in the comments because that's another thing i've noticed is that there's a lot less of it now i don't see long conversation threads the way that i used to like technical long conversation threads and it's something that i just didn't notice until i thought about it like an another one that came up a lot on that video in particular was people really upset that i called 1440p low res i didn't i said that on a 43 inch display 1440p is low res yeah relativity it is resolution is not pixel count and so basically if it's when it comes to well it's not pixels per inch sorry yeah yeah pixels print yeah yeah so the so so i just i'm finding that i get a headache a lot reading youtube comments but i can't stop reading them so i'm gonna have to start just being like no i'm not gonna i can't engage with that so you're still reading it though no because when you hide it from the channel then i just will never have to read anything from that person again oh it doesn't just hide that comment nope it means bye-bye so you're shadow banning the user yeah got it yep i think i'm i think i'm just done i think i just i think i'm just not interested in reading you took so much flack because you're still chilling nvidia and don't just own your mistake if you send spend 30 minutes chilling nvidia and five seconds in the end and say something remote bad is still chilling nvidia but now that you're a serious tech channel at this point just label the channel paid by nvidia this was on our radeon 7900 review where if anything we apologized for taking such a pro-amd stance like i just if you don't watch the video and you just are gonna be like that i just i think i'm done with you forever i think it's just gonna have to be like that i don't know maybe i'll maybe i'll change my mind but i i just i i just i just can't i just can't anymore i'm tired you know yeah james asks will this be an official lmg thing the answer is no this is just going to be a like if i'm scrolling and i just see a just catastrophically brain dead take i'm just gonna be like sorry i actually can't read what you write anymore it makes my brain hurt yeah it's the the stuff that is incredibly annoying and we i think we've talked about this in the past is the stuff that's just like they clearly either like didn't actually watch it and just yeah reacted before watching the content or they're taking stuff like you saying oh on this massive screen this is a low resolution as just completely out of context chopping off the on this massive screen part and then going after it like it's not it's not good it's not good conversation yeah no it is it is a little tough though and i do like that you're not making it like an lmg rule yep because i think that would be a hard thing to manage across a team of people and just oh for sure if that ability i think is more fine yeah well everyone technically has the ability i actually can't prevent anyone with access to the channel from like shadow banning someone i i don't think the management tools are that granular at least not since i've looked at them but it's just you know it's the kind of thing that i just maybe i mean maybe the right answer is something else entirely like okay one of the things that i've pitched to youtube multiple times and i would love to be a feature is the ability to respond to a comment that i'm reading with a short like one of the one of the comments that came up a lot on the xenon flex video is people misunderstanding what i meant by a low resolution for the size and and some people seemed genuinely like really upset really upset that i was attacking their 1080p monitor and like like treating them like they were poor and worthless or something because they had a 1080p monitor and this one was 1440p and i'm sitting here going no i said it was low but but for the size your monitor your 1080p like 22 inch monitor 24 inch monitor or even 27 inch monitor is actually higher pixel density than this thing i have a 27 inch 1440p monitor it's great i don't want anything bigger i think for the screen size it's good but the problem is that at 43 inches yeah then i would want something more it's a different story and so if you're not going to listen to what i'm saying at all i i i i i i i don't know but but that could easily be a misunderstanding so the way that i would love to respond to something like that is with a short hey i'm seeing this comment a lot i'd like to clarify what i meant because i think there's a misinterpretation where people are thinking resolution equals pixel count but resolution is actually the resolving the res the the resolute how how the eye can resolve the image like it's that that's where resolution comes from we're talking about the the clarity and clarity is affected by a lot more than pixel count 1080p could be incredibly clear on a display this size that would be like mind-blowing like you could get this close to be like wow this is sharp we keep on you keep saying pixel count but pixels per inch no no pixel count is 1920 by 1080. yeah but you that's a pixel count resolution is not pixel count it's not pixel count okay so pixels per inch is not a count of pixels that's that's a count of pixels per distance no i know oh okay but you're saying resolution is not pixel account and i understand what you're saying with the clarity thing okay but if you look on a spec sheet it says resolution colon this yes and that's something where that's the industry has failed consumers yeah i'm just the reason why i keep saying it is because people are gonna there's people saying yeah people are going to misinterpret that no resolution is not pixel count resolution is a function of pixel count display size and viewing distance just the resolution that is displayed on your spec sheet is pixel count the reason that we use the word resolution to describe pixel count is because it was a much easier way to market it that's why this is one of those areas where product marketing and has utterly failed consumers because by focusing on pixel count and that's the reason that i'm framing it that way then by focusing on the number of pixels you are actually and doing a complete disservice to the user because you are not telling them the useful information that's one of the reasons that apple in my opinion wisely stayed out of the resolution race when it came to phone displays because pixel count is what matters excuse me pics account because it's a because what matters is a combination of the pixel count the size of the display and the intended viewing distance as long as those three things are balanced you don't actually need any more and so in the same way that a 1080p projector at you know 120 inches is going to look like garbage a 4k projector actually okay so 4k is a really interesting one because then you start getting into how much of your field of view should actually be occupied by content and so the bigger you make the image the farther away you have to sit right and so going beyond 4k actually may not matter in any context but but at lower resolution the further you get away from the screen exactly so because of that distance function going higher than 4k can almost never matter like you can sit close enough to an 8k tv that you can make out the difference between 8k and 4k but you're sitting it's taking up so much of your field of view that the content is not really designed to be enjoyed that way like you like you're gonna miss details because you're i think it's only like four degrees or eight degrees i forget i forget how much of your field of vision is actually sharp and your peripheral vision is not so by sitting too close to the content you actually reduce the amount of the content that you can see clearly no matter what the resolution of the display is and by resolution i do mean the relative pixel count compared to the the the display size huh someone at philippine chat said what you're describing is optical resolution versus image resolution yes but they're closely related and there's still confusion there as well if you google image resolution the first result from i don't know what university this is but it's um.edu website is image resolution is typically described in ppi which it's not in printing it is okay so isn't that interesting that would make a lot more sense isn't that interesting so we actually do use pixels per inch so we did it we did it right first right but we didn't because digital cameras which were really coming up right around the time of photo printers also oh we're measured in pixels instead of pixels per inch rip because it's the only way to really conveniently say you know how how fine the image is right because the reason we use pixels per inch for print is because we know what the scale is going to be but digitally we don't that 2 megapixel picture could be this big it could be this big so the actual resolution of it could be completely different but the pixel count well that we can convey i know it's really complicated and i don't i don't know how to fix it you necessarily can so so yeah it's frustrating anywho why don't we talk about tick tock taking on youtube with experimental get this landscape video yeah what i find kind of funny about the little thumbnail that we have here is that it's it's still not the full screen which i find kind of interesting i don't know if that's because of how the person filmed it or what but yeah it's like still only part of the screen which is interesting so this is a duet it's actually two vertical videos yeah but you can do that when it's oh is that why because they can't horizontally expand their currently vertical content ah that's weird i don't know anyways yeah the feature marks another way that tick tock is competing with youtube particularly in terms of attracting longer form video creators and increasing the max video length to 10 minutes back in february we talked about that as well yeah i somewhat questioned the attracting longer form video creators i mean i'm sure it will happen but i have seen a bunch of stuff about monetization on tick tock and unless you're getting them sponsors it's quite lacking yeah that's pretty tough i think that they're i mean obviously they're not going to be able to attract long-form horizontal video creators without allowing long-form videos that are horizontal well theoretically they do that now but there to be able to attract long-form creators if they don't implement some kind of reasonable revenue split it'll it'll have to still be in the funnel model right where you use things like tick tock to gain followers and fans and then you funnel them elsewhere so that you can gain monetization from them or else you won't be able to fund doing what you're trying to do [music] people sometimes talk about the funnel model when you talk about twitch because like if you start on twitch you're basically going to gain no one new until you're really really big so you have to funnel people into there eventually yeah yeah i'm trying to think of like what it would take for me to start uploading our long-form content on tick tock and the question isn't really could we do it yeah of course we could like well as long as it's under 10 minutes yeah it could be it could be fairly easily integrated into our workflow but why yeah why would we do it yeah i guess is the question and i honestly this is a question that comes up a lot for me why exactly is it that every social and online video platform feels the need to just copy each other and become each other i kind of and this is this is probably just me being like old man yells at cloud you know like why does youtube need a a competitor for tick tock why does it need these you know 30 second to one minute videos why can't youtube be youtube and tick tock be tick tock and everyone is just fine with youtube being youtube and tick tock being tick tock i do kind of wish platforms focused a little bit less on feature tracing and a little bit more on like not being crap like we had a problem with teams the other day yeah it the other day being i think yesterday no wait yeah yesterday and it's just coming off of that i'm just like man like i wish we could have used msn because it was more stable like i would have expected everything we did pretty much to have worked on msn better than it did on teams and that's crazy it's made by the same company but it's like two decades newer you'd think it would be better and obviously in some ways it is i'm not that stupid but it's just it's so unstable it's one of those things where i mean it's even stability aside what identity does a platform have anymore yeah like i as someone who hasn't used facebook in quite some time other than to occasionally get like a messenger chat from someone that i know that means messenger i don't really understand what facebook's identity is anymore because they kind of have everything and i feel the same way about youtube these days what exactly is it that i go on to youtube for i mean i understand what youtube wants me to do they just want me to spend as much time as possible in their app but beyond that what is your what is your identity what is your your elevator pitch for pretend i'm a completely new user i've never seen your platform before i i am i am choosing a video platform that i am going to watch videos on what's your pitch well we've got this and we've got this and we've got this and we've got this and i'm like okay but right but this elevator ride ended a while ago yeah yeah yeah i don't know i feel like youtube out of all the ones that you mentioned almost feels like it's the most focused sort of not as much these days stories was a super weird detour that has gotten basically no development since they launched it you know i've been saying for like two years now or something like that that i don't know a long time i've been saying for a long time like hey i understand that short form video is not going anywhere but i couldn't help noticing that shorts and stories are extremely disjointed like what why those are the same thing no what is what are they stories is the competitor for instagram stories which are what what's the word ethereal ephemeral whatever the the non non-persistent yeah ephemeral i believe is the word so non-persistent videos that are meant to be just like like a casual update hi this is definitely not totally rehearse and this is absolutely the first time i recorded it let me just do this perfectly timed camera movement bye so that's a story right and then a short can be edited you can put stickers on it it might have music or dancing or whatever else but it's just a short form vod effectively so stories are so it's supposed to go in in order of spontaneity from live to stories to shorts to vod right so it kind of sits in between live and and shorts okay i didn't even know it existed yeah there are some cool things about it one thing that's really neat is that you can reply to a comment on a story with a story so if you upload a story that's like hey i'm here in my garage i just wanted to share some knowledge with you and someone were to ask hey what's the best knowledge you have in your garage you could pull some knowledge out of it and be like this is my favorite knowledge and that story would have a well it would actually have the comment like the original comment and so you just reply to it directly you don't have to say hey someone asked me what my favorite knowledge is and and this is it and that that's the ephemeral content yeah so it goes up for a little while and then it just like goes away and it actually like got a lot of views i don't know what those view numbers meant i don't know what percentage of the video they watched or whatever else but jaden said like youtube video replies from 15 years ago i know right yeah and i think there's a lot of room for for development there like they could have taken stories and turned it into a cameo like feature for example that could have been extremely powerful for creator monetization i i picked something earlier i would love to be able to reply to like a highly uploaded video comment with a story they should take something from only fans and do paid requests paid requests oh oh where you just send a message to the creator well i is that is that that different from cameo i don't know how it actually works okay cameo is you you don't know how it works on either so on cameo you set a price and it's like you know 20 or 200 like it's kind of all over the place and people will basically send you a request hey can you wish jeremy happy birthday he likes tigers you know or whatever and then they'll record it and fire it over to you okay so is that kind of what i don't know how it works so it might be exactly the same yeah i think it's i think it's fairly similar okay yeah but i know you can like ask for something and and say that you'll i think you can i don't i genuinely don't that's why i don't know how it works whatever stop it i think you can ask for something custom like say you wanted pictures of something you could ask for it and say you'll pay a certain amount right so if you could do that on youtube if you could ask a youtube creator for a video of something and so you'd pay a certain amount that could be an interesting monetization yeah absolutely yeah absolutely i mean another thing too is that one of the admit i would admit it if i used it it's not that weird whatever one of the things that youtube is not shy about pushing is channel memberships so there's there's super thanks i believe is a way that you can you can boost a comment under a video members members are supposed to get some kind of like priority and video comments okay i would see replying to a channel member with a story as a way that you could incentivize people to sign up and become members of the channel and because we have float plane it's not something that you'd be likely to see us do a ton of but if i was a small like a niche creator a smaller creator or even a larger one who was completely youtube focused i could see stuff like that being extremely powerful but hey i'm not in charge of youtube obviously so i guess they'll just keep not developing meaningful ways for creators to interact with their viewers and that'll be great yeah pretty much it's neat as for tick tock i just i i don't know i just don't would die it won't though i know they apparently now outrank youtube for average minutes per day spent by people ages 4 to'. who is putting their four-year-old on tick tock that was my biggest reaction to that was that you started with four whoa uh wow true scott asks would you take the ceo job for youtube if they offered it to you how do i put this i don't think they can afford me we i think this is going to be the year luke i think this is going to be the year that ltt store revenue eclipses video production revenue they've dropped some bangers we also did i think backpack and screwdriver this year we did yeah well don't worry there's bangers coming next year too yeah i'm almost ready to start teasing some pretty cool stuff one of them was in a video oh what yeah what was it i think it got reported what was it just tell me well i'm ready it was in a video do you know what i'm talking about no well i don't know like how many people noticed it was there i don't know if i want to say anything oh did we remove it i don't know to be honest i say go for it you put the thing in the thing i'll say it that way what oh the shape sorter yeah oh yeah yeah that's fine okay we can talk about the shapes yeah no no that's not going to be a banger no yeah that's the new product yeah we'll we'll sell some and they'll be babies will play with them and it'll be cute yeah but no no we've got some we've got some really exciting products actually i know i know sorry i know a lot of people that are getting the like baby stuff this year for christmas off the store like a a lot of people our age know people that have small babies yeah and a lot of them that i know have casually mentioned oh yeah by the way i'm getting like one of the books in a plushie or whatever else and i'm like all right sales have been very good of the book and plushies lately yeah no one of the things we have coming i already teased to lauren from tasty pc shorty version of the screwdriver short oh only six bits and it's like this long so it's meant to be kind of like palmed but it still has the full full fat ratchet mechanism and still has the magnetic retention for the bits in the shaft shaft is way shorter as well handles gonna be like super short like like basically the whole the whole thing end to end is about this long oh wow okay yeah so we're working on a shorty version of the screwdriver there's there's some potential leaks which you can maybe go off of because it talks about us hiring also we're looking for an electronics engineer and then it lists a bunch of things do we want to say oh yeah why don't we talk about that yeah we we haven't got a ton of applications just having the electronics engineer position up on the site so we're we're shouting it out on the wan show guys here are some examples of projects you will be working on if you join our engineering team essentially a mouse i don't think we've ever talked about that before i don't think so but it's been on the docker that has been in development for over a year we actually have some pretty good ideas for how to differentiate like that's my that's my whole thing if we're not adding anything to the conversation why are we doing this i promise you we will be adding something to the conversation the gamer battery bank slash shoe dryer the reason it has shoe dryer on there okay stop be nice the reason it has shoe dry hair on there is because that was the original reason that i wanted it i just wanted something that you can like throw in your realistically not in your shoe but actually just like in your bag have i talked to you about it before yeah oh okay so the idea is that something you can just huck in your bag and it'll run for like eight hours and having kyle tested it and he was like you're right he was like not happy he was like what tiny little fan like that can't make that much of a difference i'm like no no even a little bit of airplane was like huge yeah and so over eight hours how quickly a bit of just like a gym bag would dry out compared to if it didn't have even that tiny amount of airflow in it was like it was a colossal difference it was like half the time or something like that and when it comes to preventing bacteria growth and therefore smell the faster you can dry something out the better you don't want it to just sit there damp anyway the shoe dryer may or may not ever come to life but a lot of the work that we did on the shoe dryer is going to be absolutely reusable for the gamer battery bank what makes a battery bank gamer i will get back to you on that one but they're we we have a clear differentiating value add there and i'm really really excited about it another one the rgb doormat okay this one has been under this one's been in development for almost two years it's just been stalled by screwdriver so much of the pipeline has been stalled by screwdriver that makes sense because kyle was working on this one and he pivoted full time to screwdriver we are working on cables i want a battery tester okay you know those things you can buy for like four bucks and it just has like a little pinchy thing and you put your battery in it they suck yeah yeah they even when they work they barely work and i hate them and you can go get a multimeter and like you know or like create yourself a little jig to put your batteries in and hook the multimeter up to that or whatever but i want more i want way more than just how many volts i'm getting out of the battery i want a product that will do a discharge and recharge cycle and tell me how much capacity is left in a rechargeable battery so obviously i want to be able to quickly test disposables and go okay which ones go in the bin which ones go in the other more different bin but this is a problem that i can't be the only one who has is like i have rechargeable batteries that are like 15 years old because i'm smart and i buy rechargeable batteries and use them for a very very long time but how good is that one should that one be should i be marking that one as like you know tv remote duty only or could i potentially still use it in a hydra device has it not been cycled that many times i don't know and so i want a device that will tell me the remaining capacity of the battery i man i'd be so excited to have that product and i think a lot of people would there is one that exists that we found but it's like four hundred dollars and i'm looking at it going well that's not reasonable right i think we can do better we want to do like wireless charging pucks and desk accessories extended pc access so this is this would man are we really disclosing all of this okay it's in the door i was stunned when i read this before the show i was like okay ah okay you know what i'm not gonna say anymore all right cool ah okay this one's funny i don't think this came from me an rgb tissue box for the haters what i have no idea anyway cool so those are some of the things that we that we want to work on slash have been working on for quite some time hopefully they all come to life and are huge successes we're gonna have some stuff at ces by the way did you know that creator warehouse is going to ces and they're going to be unveiling some stuff i didn't know they're gonna be unveiling stuff yeah yeah they're gonna be they're going to be showing stuff there that's cool which is pretty cool i think they're also trying to recruit other creators there's a creator that we actually i was talking with recently that i was like hey like you do you guys want to do a screwdriver all you got to do is redo one mold like that we intentionally only put our branding on one small mold with the idea being that if anyone else wanted to brand our screwdriver all they would have to do is redo that one mold and then boom we could produce whoever tech tips is screwdrivers i think that would be like super cool making making the making screwing better one driver at a time oh boy oh in other creator merch news i got ludwig's bidet oh okay i haven't installed it yet because in north america it is actually not that typical to have a power outlet right next to your toilet so well yeah but like really yeah that's what i did yeah okay great but yeah like i i don't want i mean it's routed i don't know where the plug-in your place would be well it was in a completely separate room oh yeah that's a lot worse like the the main the main bedroom ensuite has a like a little like toilet room in it that room does not have a plug in it okay and so the nearest outlet was you go out of that room across like my entire vanity and then like it's over here so basically it would be going like across my countertop yeah into that room yeah it's not good and that's something you go through a doorway it's like yeah that's not that cool yeah so i had i had the very talented electricians who worked on our place come out and put in an outlet for me next to next to the toilet and i'm going to be installing it this weekend my butt will be the cleanest it's been since our trip to japan it was it was mind mind opening seeing like the japanese standard for toilets like when we were over there i don't think you went with me to this like one place that i went but there was a long car ride that i had to be on for some reason it was like three hours or something like that and i needed to stop to use the washroom on the way the driver didn't speak a lick of english but i managed to gesture like yeah and if he figured it out and anyway we pull over it this like essentially truck stop and it had a toilet in it that was nicer than any toilet i've ever seen on this continent it's like what is this i don't understand it's kind of sweet though yeah it was pretty amazing i i was very impressed hey we should probably do a couple of merch messages for those who are not familiar merch messages are the way to send a message to the show you'll see our producer dan a little bit hello producer dan see you later producer dan replying to merge messages down there also dan will flag certain merch messages for luke and for me and luke to respond to why don't we do a couple all you do is go on lttstore.com you can check out and you'll see a little box that says hey would you like to leave a merch message they're live right now and you guys can go ahead and do that and you should either get your message showing up down here you can get a little reply from dan or we might even talk about it on the show wanna hit me dan sure i've got one here from jaden linus how are you still using plex instead of mb or jellyfin i run all three in docker containers accessing the same library with no issues on the same server plex calls home to about 500 different places well mb and jelly both don't you're not the first to ask me this the first to ask me this i think was oh i'm gonna hate myself if i get this wrong but tim from the labs team if i recall correctly i i believe it's tim who is a huge jellyfin guy not a plex guy and basically was like what how are you still using plex the answer is because my phone license oh oh yeah there's that but i think jellyfin is open source and free anyway oh okay yeah i'm pretty i'm pretty sure jelly fin's open so yeah the free software media system but more importantly my plex is already set up and already works however i have actually had enough problems with plex that we are know we we have a conditional not working with you i don't want i don't know if i would call it an order but basically i told i told the sales team that we're not going to work with plex until they resolve some of my long time issues with it some of my long time issues include the fact that it doesn't advance to the next episode properly on some of my devices and i'm like this is ridiculous that's like fundamental one of my long time issues is that i was oh yeah right right right downloading local copies to mobile devices has as far as i can tell been completely broken for like over a year again that's something that i consider to be core functionality they seem to be very focused on developing you know plex tv and some of the other features that are not why i have it i have it so that it will manage my media library and so that i can watch my media library on all my devices anything else is utterly irrelevant and might as well not exist yeah download to download to local just does not work for me properly on android or ios i it this came about because of a recent trip that i went on with the kids and i wanted to load up devices with movies and tv shows for the plane and between my son's oneplus seven something whenever they did that mclaren edition he's got that one between my son's oneplus my wife's samsung my samsung foldable so i expect some weirdness but my other more different samsung and my iphone 13. i couldn't get any one of those devices to reliably download content i some of them went through but you can't just cue it up and expect it to finish and i basically sent out an irate email in the middle of the night as i'm preparing for this like 5 a.m flight that was like we are not working with them again until this is fixed so yeah i i might be at that point now because that's yeah again that's it's it's fundamental like it works great for certain things i have no desire to use anything other than plex and the nvidia shield for the theater room i don't touch anything else there's just no reason to right everything is flawless and perfect but on mobile devices i have just not had a lot of fun with it so i yeah i don't know maybe yeah maybe i'll give jellyfin a shot because one of the other things that i'm going to be doing soon is switching off of unraid for for my plex or i guess jellyfin and firing it up on true nas scale so i switched to trunas for most storage but i haven't gotten around to setting up a docker container for plex so i actually still have all the media on my my older server which doesn't matter to me that much because the main reason that i migrated was due to reliability concerns those are really old drives in there now yeah and so if i like like what i'm gonna lose a couple blu-ray rips that's not a big deal to me whereas like losing pictures and home videos would be would be catastrophic i've got another one here from christopher hey guys with the popularity of handhelds like steam deck do you think amd or intel will explore putting gddr on the cpu package for the igpu to use and if so do you think even two gigabytes would be improving the performance oh okay well there's a couple of different angles that we can approach this from so first of all i doubt that amd or intel would do it i think that amd might do it but it would be a custom silicon product kind of like i mean really this what this sounds like to me is an xbox or a playstation processor like they've done for the last couple of generations in those cases it's not on package but it's designed to interact directly with gddr memory and the operating system is designed to use that same gddr memory for both system memory and graphics memory i think that solution is pretty good yeah it it seems to work pretty darn well for game consoles yeah but there are a couple of concerns so one your suggestion of putting just a couple of gigs unfortunately wouldn't really work because it's oh man okay maybe it could maybe you could load assets into your higher speed dddr memory until it's full and then go out to main memory but the problem with that is that gddr memory is faster than non-g than regular ddr memory but it's not that much faster so it's it's not like using an ssd to cache a hard drive like it's not an order of magnitude faster so using it as a cache i think would have so much overhead that you would actually lose more than you would gain by doing it that way so what you would have to do then is you would have to put the full amount of memory that you intend to have in this product on package like that now apple has gone and put system memory on package not on die but on package and so i i don't see any reason why we couldn't see something like that in the future but i doubt that that's something that amd or especially intel would just productize and hope that somebody's gonna buy it yeah that's the kind of thing that valve might have to come to amd and say hey we're going to pay the however many millions upon millions of dollars for you guys to do the r d to build this product and we are then going to sell millions upon millions of steam decks and it's going to be great my other concern about sharing that memory because i would kind of imagine that that would be a shared memory i mean if you're going to have like a super high speed memory that's sitting on package well heck you might as well use it for everything but i don't this is just something that i'm not going to be able to speak to very well because i simply don't know enough about it but i would have concerns about performance and compatibility with regular pc games that are designed to have two different memory pools so you've got your gpu you've got your vram and then you've got your system memory i don't know how they would handle those being one end the same then again i don't know if you ever saw this video but there was that that super weird chinese console that actually did take that approach and ran windows oh and seemed to run games so maybe it's fine but there's a drawback because gddr memory even though it's very high bandwidth is also higher latency compared to regular ddr memory which is not good for cpus so i don't know yeah yeah hbm sure how much you want to spend on a steam deck yeah 900 bucks let's go yeah hbo memory so yeah from like from a technical maybe yeah from a technology standpoint there's no reason it couldn't be done but from a a practical standpoint i don't see it happening anytime soon nw gat asks what about xbox and playstation yes but that memory is not on package the question was what about right next to the cpu die because the closer the memory gets the lower the latency which is great but the more integrated this product is and the less generally useful it is like amd can't take that product that they developed for steam deck five or whatever it is and just put it in a box and sell it at newegg so ultimately that cost of developing it has to be covered by someone and that someone is going to be a customer that's not going to be amd they're not just going to build that and hope somebody buys it why don't we move on to

quickly yeah i like that i like that idea so lots of things have happened on twitter there's been the twitter files stuff there's been it's i think every 12 hours they try to drop some type of craziness on twitter to keep the users rolling so it's been a little bit too much to cover we haven't been covering it as much as when when this stuff first started because i think we're all getting a little a little tired but what we have talked on the show about before is elon jet the twitter account that used to track well elon's jet if you couldn't figure that out and there were other similar ones for other high-profile public figures using publicly available jet information to that's an important one because it's not like this information is now gone because the twitter account is gone no it's just not being automatically posted on twitter but like it got that information from a public resource that anyone can access so the information is 100 still there and able to be accessed by anyone like it's not like it's not like this person had privileged information is what i'm trying to say so that that person who again we talked about this on the show elon offered them 5k to delete their account way back they asked how about 50. they wanted a model three and i yeah i think like an actual fan was the one doing it which is sort of interesting yeah i think it was 50 so that i can buy a model three yeah i believe so yeah elon refused and if i remember correctly and i don't really want to misquote this oh no here it is he he tweeted a while back and he hasn't taken this down and a bunch of people been roasting him for it so it's still up but he tweeted on november 6 2022 my commitment to free speech extends even to not banning the account following my plane even though that is a direct personal safety risk he has now banned the account tracking his plane he has also and this is where things get a little bit hazy for me he has also banned a bunch of other accounts that as far as i can tell taught talked about i don't know genuinely i think it's talked about it might be retweeted but yeah interacted with that account yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure where the cutoff of interaction is yeah but some level of interacted with or talked about or something that account have also been banned just like right off the hop change the rule band yeah elon also spended the accounts of at least six journalists who have covered the twitter saga implying that they had dox's real-time location and endangered his family as of now there's no evidence any of the journalists did this well i mean the accounts are closed so you wouldn't be able to get i don't whatever twitter has not provided any they don't as far as i know their entire public communication side is gone just like he did with tesla yeah so so i don't think there would be like these things are not going to happen basically yeah elon posted a video on wednesday of someone that he claimed was a crazy stalker who climbed on the roof of the car carrying his child x which seems like a thing that someone might do yeah that would yeah i mean i like that scenario would absolutely suck yeah you probably want so wouldn't want someone to try to block the road of a car that has your child in it and climb on the roof of said vehicle yep that would be i suspect if someone was a parent and that happened to their child they would be pretty freaking absolute red line yes exactly yep yeah he he posted that one thing that i thought was somewhat entertaining was you know how he's been doing a lot the video was the issue with the video is that it's not on topic none of those journalists had anything to do with that so well i think the my assumption was that it had something to do with his plane landed and then they were trying to drive away from where it was and they were followed by this person okay so the root of the information was the plane that's my i don't know if that's what's going on that's my level of understanding sure yeah i finns things are a little crazy over in twitterland zach from jerryrig everything yeah here i've got this got banned by by elon or blocked by elon sorry yeah not banned off the platform i said that incorrectly he got blocked by elon because in the video of as far as i can tell one of the security guys yeah getting video coverage of the person who chased them yeah and then also covering the lights or not covering the license plate getting video footage of the license plate that elon tweeted out jerry rick everything responded and said yo contact the police don't send your mob didn't you just tweet that docsing is against twitter rules and elon blocked him didn't ban him yeah so that's neat yeah yeah the some suspensions seem to be specifically affecting people who point out elon's hypocrisy shortly before his band the band banned mashable reporter matt binder binder sorry posted screen caps of elon encouraging people to invest in tesla the day he dumped 3.6 billion in stock come on oh so that's pretty good but like the eu and the un published statements contending twitter's decision oh man oh yeah oh oh that's not even in here but mastodon's official account has been a banned yeah so you are not allowed and you can't link to mastodon anymore either but i think people can still put their like mastodon usernames or whatever yeah in their profile yeah but i think you can't link to the site yeah we'll see when that happens yeah when that happens that'll be a lot of people nick showed me you know i i was with you until nick showed me something really interesting today where i i think your take on sort of the some of the hysteria around oh it's just twitter's gonna collapse immediately was like well like it's it's it's running like it's it's not gonna just immediately fall apart yeah nick showed me a recording on his phone today of the twitter app doing some weird stuff dude did he show you that okay so he showed me a screen recording of him tapping on the same picture in a tweet three times and it having three completely different behaviors once it opens the picture once it navigates to a totally unrelated website and a sec and a third time oh that one's weird it opens up a completely unrelated tweet and i'm like what because i haven't seen anything that's pretty funny i haven't seen anything that bad but honestly i've not been using it as much like i i think i've talked to you about this but i've had myself on like a twitter diet or whatever for a while yeah yeah like i i set my i set my app time limit to 30 minutes like months ago just because i realized i'm doing so much doom scrolling on twitter and it's not really contributing anything it's not making me feel better i've been i've been getting myself i haven't done that but i've been getting myself to be more busy and i just haven't had the time which is a good solution in my opinion but yeah i mean twitter's done weird stuff for a while that's pretty weird that's weirder than anything i've seen for sure i still don't think it's necessarily going down anytime soon also there are still claims i don't know how true it is necessarily there are still claims that uh what was it oh right users have peaked again oh yeah apparently because of the banning of people i guess people reacting to that are coming to twitter and going what's going on oh i could see that yeah i could see that i don't know we've hit another peak i don't know that those users are going to interact in the long term so what this means for the for the long-term health of the platform i couldn't tell you i mean maybe there's a big brain 4d chess i've seen more and more big names permanently leave that's an interesting one to me permanent's a big word though yeah permanently gone in a year or if the dust settles and i don't know yeah yeah but okay and another thing that i'll bring up about the the like twitter stability thing is people were saying it was going to be down in like a couple days yeah which is like clearly ridiculous that's the main thing that i was reacting to back then is it was at first it was like oh it's gonna be down in a couple days and then they're like oh it's gonna be down by the weekend or whatever i don't know what that was and then they're like oh it's not going to last until the next week well there was like the lettuce the lettuce comparison the lettuce thing which no one talks about anymore probably because the lettuce is gross now like the the goal post just kept getting moved over and over and over and over and over again i'm like okay yeah the the nuking twitter spaces thing okay this is another one where like i i've heard about so much stuff happens on twitter and i just hate all of it because i hate twitter i have then this isn't new yes i have hated twitter for years way before any of this even started so this is don't even try to pull that out but apparently there was a twitter spaces going on and some people started and he joined it no i think it was one of the band journalists or something or suspended ones oh right they could still join spaces they could still join spaces but couldn't tweet or something like that and he like joined it and elon joined the space and like they asked him some questions and then he left and then disabled the spaces feature all together just killed it and then brought it back like the next day or something are we seeing are we seeing this new level of escalation as a result of him getting booed with dave chappelle because like i gotta tell you guys as a public figure if i went out on a stage was like introduced and i mean that sucks for anyone and i thought that like i was cool and i thought that people were gonna think i was pretty cool and i think pretty much regardless of how big your ego is if you go up in a in a public speaking environment in front of what was it probably a ton of people i mean it's a it's a it's a dave chappelle live show so i have to imagine hundreds if not thousands you go in front of that many people and they boo you hard like that's gonna hurt yeah like pretty much no matter who you are and so i guess the knee-jerk reaction is to quiet try to try to eliminate criticism wasn't this supposed to be a good quick topic that is that is fair it has not been 20 minutes hammy 3d banned turn off float plane live chat turn it turn it off now aj's like i don't even know if we can do that i just don't you know i just don't get it right because like yeah he spent his whole career being criticized like i spend my whole career being criticized it's not new it's just that the criticizing is the criticism is ramping up because the things you're doing are awful the current volume so why would you double down and do way more awful stuff i think that's a pretty normal human response it's not gonna help i'm not saying it's a good one but i think it's a pretty normal human response that's gonna help though yeah i i don't disagree we both got to take a drink we both do the like lean away lean away thing i didn't realize we both did that yeah some people are talking about like freedom of speech and stuff like that what about it what he stands for nothing yeah i want to get over it one of the problems with the plane thing is again that that is that is public information plane plane routes planes with transponders on you can figure out where they are like that's planes need transponders yeah so that's the thing yeah and now apparently promote installing trains there you go apparently it's just on reddit now so he streisand affected the  out of it yeah and like that that's what i was saying removing the twitter account didn't remove the information it just stopped the twitter account all of that is still public if people really wanted to know they are going to find it it's out there like i don't know anyways let's get off a twitter yeah let's do that are we doing that are are we pacting that now getting off of twitter yeah i'm not getting off of twitter my problem is there are people that i must communicate with that communicate with me through twitter dms i'm one of those people who's very chat app agnostic like here's my here's my social folder i have pretty similar to mine i i'm missing i think two of those hangouts instagram whatsapp facebook messenger wechat line teams discord yeah it's just wechat in line i don't have those i don't even have my sms app in there and i have encounter ones that you don't have in there actually now that i think about it oh what you got what you got hit me up icq telegram at the very least oh i have signal signal yeah or wait yeah no yeah both of those actually telegram and signal signal's not in there because i don't use it much but yeah yeah i have it etc etc like yeah i'm on all of them as well and and there are there are like just like with facebook i only really use facebook to private message certain people just like with twitter yep i need it because there are people that i have to be able to get dms from yep for like my job so you're stuck with it so i'm gonna keep using it yep yeah pretty much there it is wechat on a western phone crazy to trust that did i say i trust it i have it some people that i might need to talk to might not have western chat apps right yeah hey there you go i mean that's the thing like i just i don't that's this is one of the reasons that i don't understand the whole imessage thing it's like oh yeah i love it i messaged well it's like it's like having a phone that only connects to certain lines why would you want it get like so if you need to why don't you just get a phone that connects to every line like like imagine imagine trying to sell an email service where the main feature is that you can only email people who are on the same domain how the is that a feature that's a bug or like if you email someone who's on a different service it's a degraded experience it's like you get to shame them for being poor they can't afford this email i just i think there's some i.t security stuff where you can only email people on the same domain but that's like obviously we're talking about something different yeah that's a completely different totally different thing yeah yeah i don't know i i it is what it is so i'm not going to be completely getting off of twitter but i effectively don't create new tweets anymore i like reply to stuff sometimes i interact with things sometimes but like i think my most recent tweet was the ovh video because i wanted to re-blast it because i like that video i was trying to help promote it the one before that i think i'm like roasting you on your birthday and then i don't even remember what's before that but it's probably like a year ago or something like i i basically don't use the platform anymore because i do not like it oh man this isn't in the dock unfortunately but did you see that it looks like the eu is going to force apple to allow side loading yeah wait i thought this was in the dock is it maybe i'm just i read notes on it did you yeah did i just like completely miss it i don't know i don't see it for some reason i think it was something we were going to talk about anyway that could be amazing that sounds great yeah go eu there's a i mean not everything but but definitely this definitely this i hope we're not missing it because i saw it as a topic i'm like certain because they were talking about how there's some people that are countering it because they're saying if you allowed side loading and that becomes common things like facebook and these other major applications might try to leave the app store so they can get around the payment cut and if that happens then we're going to lose the security layer and people are upset about that okay then don't install any of those apps that are not in the app store and don't ever use a computer it's called user choice any kind of computer yeah and it's it's really interesting to me when i hear the argument that the user choice is to not use an iphone okay but okay but no no user user choice and and fair and open competition is doesn't just mean well then okay you just can't then you're just completely locked out of one of the only two vendors in the duopoly that is smartphones and also by the way both of them are behaving in exactly the same monopolistic way this is this is bad and we actually do need less legislation to fix this so there you go yeah i think it's cool as well though let's go yeah yeah i'm pretty excited yep we got a couple of other pretty interesting topics epic games is shutting down servers for a bunch of old games again okay like a lot so i i should have followed up on this and i didn't that is my bad this topic was shared with me where is it let me just search for epic i think there's some extra juice on this oh where i think they have been removing games from stores as well interesting so in while he's looking that up the affected games include a thousand tiny class dance central one two and three the vr online multiplayer will remain up green day rock band monsters probably stole my princess rock band one two and three the beatles rock band supersonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars unreal gold unreal to the awakening unreal tournament 2003 unreal tournament 2004 unreal tournament three though that one will be reactivated and re-released for free as unreal tournament 3x it is already renamed it is barred from sale on steam and that'll be on epic online services in the future with cross play between steam epic game store and good old games unreal tournament game of the year edition the master server has been up in some form or another since 1999 so goodbye it is possible to specify a master server manually though so players could use for example old unreal via unreal.ini tweaks battle breakers unreal tournament alpha rock band blitz rock band companion app and sing space some games like unreal tournament game of the year have support for direct ip connections and should still be playable without the master server browser and most also feature local multiplayer options but once again luke and i are bringing up how horrible this is and what it will mean for the next round of server end of life's when you just are utterly unable to use these software titles that you paid for excuse me rented it's very frustrating did you find what you were looking to talk about no i think it all right here we go one second the reason okay the reason for it is that epic is pushing to support its epic online services system which they say will provide a unified friend system voice chat parental controls and parental verification features okay i guess yeah like some is this in here yeah like unreal gold real gold i don't know a ton about this game and yeah like if you look up unreal gold on steam right now it says notice unreal gold is no longer available on the steam store yep so if you didn't get it that's it and there didn't appear to be a ton of warning for this recent reviews are apparently like this is a single player game or it's listed as a single player game on on steam so it's it's not that they just like because this is talking about turning off servers right yeah epic says some titles will still work offline while there's not be playable at all so unreal gold is not sold anymore i guess i mean was anyone really buying it i don't know it came out in 1998 it's not really the point though i know it just sucks yeah just sucks yeah but mugma game in history unreal gold is just like the first one in the list so that's what i dove into but i don't i don't know if like some of these other ones are also off the store it also sounds like like there's a note lowered down somewhere where like the game is being re-released i don't remember which one that's unreal three unreal tournament three yeah being re-released as unreal 3x yeah that barred from the steam sale and it's on epic game services so i feel like part of this is trying to get it to move to their own stuff well yeah absolutely it is epic seems to be the only other game store owner that is still holding holding out is like no no we will we're gonna compete with steam everyone else has come crawling back oh except blizzard activision blizzard is still on there blizzard won't yeah i am 100 certain blizzard won't because they've been doing it a lot longer but ea ubi they're back yeah they're back baby because blizzard had their own launcher back when tons of things had their own launcher and they actually had like a launcher for it and everyone got used to using it yep before steam just like ran everything because they blizzard is doing an mmo and back in the day steam didn't support mmos through steam right so like yeah people just got used to it i don't think blizzard is ever going to bail blizzard is getting people pretty used to launching god no you can just buy cod through so activision part of blizzard is still using steam i guess but but yeah yeah on steam yeah i think that's where we're at yeah yeah ubi caved recently yep matter of time anthony's take you know how long should game companies really be expected to keep older games afloat though and to epic's credit a lot of their older games using unreal engine are very open and easily modded not all of these games are though regardless of how long they were supported for though imo once they sunset games they should release the server software until the community to restore them yeah so my point isn't actually at all how long companies should be expected to keep games afloat i can totally understand if you're like man we have zero users on almost every day not wanting to keep those servers going but it is entirely based around those companies releasing the server softwares and tools needed for the community to restore them like like anthony said that is that is where literally my entire argument lies because the only thing i'm worried about at a certain point because you brought up like how many people are still playing this yeah that's very valid for a lot of games probably no one yeah probably literally no one but people should be able to down the line if you want to for like literally historical reasons yep like we we shouldn't lose the entire history of video game development that would be really depressing like it's actually a huge deal yeah just like hardware bought removed our y cruncher world record yeah what happened there well we released a video recently setting a world record for calculating 2.5 billion digits of pi in y cruncher you guys would have seen us submit the results live but hardware bot actually removed our score from the leaderboards is it because they're bad people no it's because we didn't submit the screenshot right and we didn't have cpu-z or gpu-z open in the screenshot so we could actually probably grab a still from the video and resubmit it but i told adam that that's probably not worth the time to set up the server again and run it again and like submit it again so we're not going to do that it was definitely fun setting some world records and i'll know i'll know we had it but apparently it's it's unofficial now it's unofficial yeah what's this linus and luke react to linus dropping things 2022 edition so this is kind of an amazing this is a really well edited video oh it's got how many views does this have now it's kind of ridiculous let me just yeah 450. yeah 450 000 views how am i on an account that doesn't have premium right now me too for crying out loud oh oh jeez yeah here comes another one it's long no no no but i skipped it oh oh yeah should i should we have sound for this do you want to have sound very high mine mine is muted i don't know which one of us you're watching oh him yeah ports on let me make sure you guys can hear it don't worry i caught it with the foot because the chaos dropped the ks wasn't out yet oh i can hear it look at that awesome i know right can you hear it do you know yes i thought there was something wrong and i realized because i need to watch it oh i think i've got an echo from you we never we never don't hear this oh cool or like i can text him and whoa that was a good one story all right all right listen after that story this was actually last week but we missed it and that was not intention foreign anyway it's too long for us to watch the whole thing on wan show but i just i i definitely felt the comedic timing of the edit was better than most of things like this that i've seen i i thought that mr chicken banner lord did did a pretty good job pretty good job so i won't have to dmca take down you this time this time or or ban you yeah yeah yeah i block you though have i ever really like addressed this publicly like our stance on on remixing our clips into we have sort of i think it's always been on wancho though but we have sort of yeah okay anyway we're chill because we context dependent yeah if you are if you're trying to pass off our footage as your own like say for example if you were to upload a review of a graphics card and just shamelessly put our b-roll into your video i i get i get pretty annoyed but we're not so down with that if you ask in advance which is very easy to do because we're not hard to get in touch with i have i think every time said yep no problem just make sure you credit us we yeah we just we want to see like proper credit and and a link in the video description but other than that i don't really think we have any any rules about it yeah not particularly so yeah we've always been i think i think pretty pretty pretty pretty open as far as all that stuff goes anyway i thought this was i thought it was pretty funny i thought they did a good job that was it that was all and then i've got another little side topic here can we ban apps that copy metadata when you try to copy text i also okay i want to attach something on this which is more of a uh people pattern thing so that would be great but also i think when you send someone a message that's like an address or a phone number yeah or basically something that you know is going to be copied yeah man would i love it if it was its own message well you know that's actually that's actually what started this was someone sent me their wi-fi ssid and password in one message on teams yeah and i tried to copy the password and i was like i hate this because for whatever reason teams and microsoft's infinite wisdom does not allow you to select part of a message and copy it and it is absolutely infuriating this trend towards not allowing you to interact with text on the screen the way that you would intend to start it in my mind with right clicking and copying a hyperlink in a google search result and it pasting a whole bunch of tracking crap progressed to texting apps that will copy like a timestamp and username and whatever else when you paste their stuff and also offer no way to just manually select the part of the text you want so you so you just you can't paste things where they just need to go and it just adds a bunch of clicks for no reason and it's really annoying because a lot of times when you have to input into a field that field is often very size restricted yep so now you have to trim the message in a very size restricted field in some other way which is so annoying and then paste it over i've i've sent people back their own messages but like basically cropped like they'll they'll be like here's oh no problem still in the same message here's this information here's this information here's a bunch more text and i'll just send them back just the like password completely new message that account name completely new message that and then you copy your own sent message yeah nice like come on nice it's just it's so it's so frustrating ad damn says pixel phones can copy text from app switcher that is an utterly unnecessary solution to a problem that should have never existed yeah that's the that's the issue and to be clear this is not a world ending problem this is not a huge deal it takes at most another 10 or 20 seconds to get around this every time i encounter it for me it's not about how much time it wasted it's about how utterly unnecessary it's just annoying it should have never happened there was no reason for it whatsoever yeah just makes me mad pretty much oh man ah really good one is you know how when someone sends you an address or a phone number in a lot of text apps you can just like long press and like open in maps so if that message contains other extraneous crap it doesn't work and okay like i don't know at least on android in just kind of any any text field if you select something that's obviously a phone number it'll prompt you for the phone as well but no you can't do that in a chat app that also has that other stuff because there's no way to like we have these modern conveniences but then we get in our own way no no yep yep i've and like the thing is i know i've been in all of these scenarios and i feel like everyone else must have as well yeah because it's just like it's a part of life right now and it's just unnecessary and annoying yeah okay i'm pretty happy about dell apparently continuing to push forward their modular laptop dennis demo dennis yeah this is concept luna so this is like a new concept luna modular laptop that can apparently be disassembled in 30 seconds whoa so we're gonna watch this here 10 times fewer screws what am i looking at here just this is another ad you're looking at ads you know what i figured it out i figured out why i can't see it because i'm only looking at this i'm only looking at the skip button did you notice how he said what am i looking at here because he didn't even recognize there was an ad he does this and it's crazy like it's not crazy as in he's crazy it's just i i can't i like wish i could so i think it's like frustrating that i can't just block them out like that here we go check this out whoa 30 seconds let's go man when i used to work with laptops all the time this would have been so sweet i know right and what's really cool is they're they're pitching like a sustainable sustainability element of this where when it comes to like refurbishing or for large organizations you know reassembling partially working laptops into and into full working laptops just fewer of them apparently those qr codes are so that it's like super easy to to test it and identify it so that you can so you can much more easily do that it's so cool that's awesome this is really awesome yeah so lots of rails pogo pins cart edge connectors no cables no screws nothing no screws if you can eject a sim tray you can disassemble this laptop what and its thickness is still close to a current year 13 inch dell latitude with internal volume to spare for higher end components oh that is super cool now this is not a real product not yet but dell is hinting that we could see elements of this of of this project make their way into real products down the line i suspect you will have some screws in a real product maybe maybe you're right but i think some screws are okay some screws are okay yeah especially if they're all the same yeah and like i don't necessarily think that plastic clips are a better solution than me either yeah you know give me a good screw and i'll thank you yeah it's amazing i i this is another just like super dumb comment that i read this week it was just like it's just i hate the way that they've gotten so immature and there's so many sex jokes now it was always like that we have always been like blink-182 level toilet humor genuinely always been a thing i have learned nothing i have grown up not at all yeah yeah yes ceo but it's just a title still me the discussion question here is thanks anthony how does linus feel about his investment in framework now good yeah i don't i don't think that was the point yeah 100 i mean even off air talking to luke about the investment in framework talking internally to the people here i was very clear that my investment in framework was like if it made money i'd be surprised yeah i love their mission i love their mission and to be clear dell is still not trying to compete with the framework mission they have mentioned nothing about upgrading your chassis like this right it's still super cool regardless my framework laptop went from six cores to 12 core 4 to 12 whatever i like dramatically upgraded the hardware in that machine without replacing my chassis your screen or speakers or touchpad or anything like that it's super cool still but really what i was investing in was the mission to make laptops less disposable yeah and if if this if if that was what it took to shine a big enough light on what framework was doing that dell comes and does it better fine so be it yeah i will i will i will kiss that money goodbye i do i do still think that framework has a solid shot i don't know a lot that isn't public information but i do know a little bit and i don't want my money back i i'm pretty happy i'm pretty happy with what they're doing i'm happy with the direction that they're going but if i lose it all then i guess it's gone and i feel the same way about financial game yeah i the the point was i want these things to exist and it's exactly the same with that nas software that i discussed last week i need an easy to use like prosumer nas that doesn't suck like it just it has to exist i am so tired of cloud being the only user-friendly option other than stupid like one touch backup hard drives yeah because you want they're not reliable you want to promote people to do their own like personal clouds but then it's it's hard it's hard yeah and i get it i get it you know full-time sis admin part-time home lab user who does this kind of thing in their sleep i understand that to you it's not hard to my brother-in-law it might as well be brain surgery even for decently technical people yes like it's it's still a lot it's non-trivial and it's something that you need to like re-educate on constantly which also probably shouldn't really need to be that necessary what's wrong with synology is a great question how about the completely closed ecosystem how about the ridiculous pricing yeah you should be able to have a functioning nas for literally zero dollars like there is hardware that people actually throw in the garbage that is perfectly capable of running a nas operating system and i get it in europe you might not actually want to run that because the power efficiency is going to be a killer but if you happen to live somewhere with cheap power why is it going into the trash it should still be used why are you gonna throw that working hardware away go buy some apply some overpriced appliance yeah not to mention underpowered in a lot of cases that is not upgradable at all and that you're ultimately gonna throw in the trash later and your data sync it can only go to other well okay this is very old information it's complicated okay you knew where i was going yes you can sync to a lot of different things but also syncing just to a target like properly is a little more complicated to set up the point is there's a better way and i want there to be a better way yeah yeah pretty much new topic should we should we do more merge messages yeah we should do a couple merch messages probably but there's a few that are built up here yeah yeah i've got some potentials you guys should probably have a look at too sure i've got one here from ronald working in the medical imaging field i've seen that a lot of imaging data being moved to the cloud and he doesn't necessarily agree with it oh no what are your thoughts on medical imaging using cloud storage sounds terrible but also i mean this ties in perfectly to what we were just talking about so what is every like small independent office supposed to have a full-time i.t person to handle their in a lot of cases like regulator not endorsed what's the bloody word i'm looking in forest like they're they're they're like regulated data storage like compliance system like they think this is what this is what my like company before i started working with you was right so who's going to manage their compliance when it comes to safely storing all this data in a secure and reliable fashion i mean cloud is the answer is it actually safe well i i don't know i hope so yeah but like what if you could so so one of the one of the things that i've told this nas software developer that i insist exists is a peer-to-peer yeah a peer-to-peer encrypted backup solution yeah that's great so that if luke and i were each running linus nas or you know whatever it ultimately ends up being called it's not it's not it has a name [laughter] anywho sorry okay keep going until if luke and i each had one it should be as simple as entering each other's like profile like friending each other essentially and being able to allocate backup space to each other that is then encrypted so that even with access to the hardware luke cannot look at my files and i can't look at his but we know that our data is safely stored somewhere off-site yeah that should not be complicated in the year 2022 that should be like three clicks and if it's not we suck i could totally see that being amazing for our professional offices too like if you could just have like doctor net i mean this is the like this is in my opinion the biggest problem with with like at-home storage for basically anybody is if you want to back it up because everyone tells you like oh it's not a backup if it's raid whatever so you're like oh okay i know i'm not i probably shouldn't use the voice but the reason why i use the voice is because a lot of people hear that and then they go cool but i don't really have the technical ability or the knowledge or whatever to fix said problem so like great thanks i don't know like what am i supposed to do with this information so if you can give them something to do with that information yep that would be awesome that'd be nice leo lan asks didn't you say that if you have physical access to a server that encryption security doesn't matter anymore encrypted data as long as it is properly encrypted is probably going to be very difficult to gain access to at this point in time you would still like as as we said before no security is absolute yes i yeah when we've said things like that there's often been context around it like for example when we talked about how apple allowed the chinese government to dictate which data center all of their chinese customers data was stored in what we mean is an entity with extreme capability and extremely long-term access and yeah essentially it's a it's a ccp owned data center so come on yeah come on yeah right and in a lot of cases like we're talking about a situation where the way that the like okay something like bitlocker for example if you had unlimited time and access to an encrypted drive you might eventually be able to brute force it but in this case if it's just a dump of encrypted data i don't have the technical expertise to know what it would take to break into it do you know anything about that like it seems to be completely honest reading potential merch messages but you're talking about breaking encryption on files yeah just on just on just a a dump of data in like a in a container file if you're if you're taking brute force uh if you're taking the the attack vector of brute force yeah like aes256 you can somewhat like measure how long it's going to take or measure an estimation of how long that will take on average i should say right if it i mean there is always the potential that it guesses it first try but like the chance of that is you know well my password is password so what do you think get it in the first 50 years yeah yeah but yeah there's some amount of measurable difficulty there for brute forcing but then you also have to question the ability of removing the lock right right because you can you can basically always compare any type of security to almost any other type of security because there's locking key similar attacks right right so for yeah you yeah there's always the possibility of finding a way to remove the lock or go around the door or do whatever basically some way that you don't have to interact with guessing the password so nothing is ever 100 if something exists you should not assume that security on it is 100 if anyone tells you that security on it is 100 either they are a fool or you should deeply question the motivation that they have for telling you that that's basically it what is this [laughter] yeah there's always a way yeah that's great okay hit me again more this one's from ryan happy holidays having heard all the recent talk about the ai in the media and the art how do you view ai and art as it relates to copyright saw a tweet thread about this relation to disney and mickey mouse all right i'm tagging in coach all right so i curated this one from the potential merge questions so i'm going to use this question as an onboard to say other stuff that i was planning on saying but didn't get full preparation for but i want to start the conversation in some of the comments on last week's when there was some valid criticism of my stance on a few ai things there was a few different comments talking about how i seemed quite pro gpt or large large language model ai things and i was quite anti art model bots oh okay so i was talking about how i didn't like ai art i did and in the same show i was talking about how i did like gpt sure and people were saying that that was fairly hypocritical and i think from oh okay watching the show and the things that were talked about in the show i think that stance was quite fair to be completely honest i think part of that reason is because i haven't dove far enough into my reasons for that and to be completely transparent a fair amount of my opinion on that at that time was basically a vibe check right i hadn't really dove into it enough i have dove into it a bit now i still don't think it's enough and i think one of the reasons why it's not enough is i think this is actually just a ridiculously ridiculously complicated topic well yeah sure like it's it's really really hard i think there are some problems there's lots of problems one of them is that the training depth is highly questionable on some of the ai art generators yeah to the point where i have found examples where it is trained on one artist and when you ask it to output different things it basically just outputs pretty much exactly what that artist did i have also done some stuff i was talking to you about this where i search for a specific term that is highly related to an extremely famous piece of art and i've gotten a bunch of different ai art generators to output pretty much just the original with some extremely minor changes right hey we didn't copy it haha yeah and and this is like i'm talking i'm not giving it a ton of terms i'm not being super super hyper specific so that if you asked pretty much any human artist to do this they would have output pretty much the exact same thing i'm not saying like draw me a cog wheel and pretty much everyone draws the same cog wheel i i'm like or i'm not saying draw me a cogwheel at this exact orientation and then with this many spokes all that kind of stuff i'm i'm giving somewhat vague things and not very many okay i'll just say the term i said arab girl green eyes yeah i wonder what image you end up with and that's all i gave them so it has a a race it has a color of eyes and it has a gender that's it wait you mean this one and that's the i believe that's the original yes and these ai art programs were putting out pretty much that at like you know different angles and stuff yeah but like oh maybe a different color of you know robe or whatever this was i did this like yeah and almost immediately after last win so it's been a little while but if i remember correctly she has freckles sure and like every single one she had freckles in it i don't know how common that is but like wow it was it was afghan i don't know sorry i did this like a week ago i don't remember the exact search term i i lifted basically this scenario from somebody on twitter but they deleted their post i wanted to share it on the show they they deleted or privated or they did something with their post and then i couldn't get it back again because i wanted to attribute the they also had photos of it happening and they had everything and it was really good but i think they they got a bunch of heat from the people that are very pro ai art and they decided to private everything which is totally there that's fine but i just wanted to use that and i couldn't so i redid it i don't remember exactly what the search terms were anyways that photo was re-spat out by a ton of them then i dove into it and figured out that there was one particular artist that was upset because someone had trained an ai art model off of only their art and like there's all this weird stuff going on i think the ai art space is very murky right now i think there are ways to do it right i don't think it's automatically bad yep i think there have been a lot of bad examples are we having this conversation less around chat gpt because it is far less obvious what it was trained on i think so i have because writing is another like endanger profession that has been i mean been under attack for a long time like this is not this is not new i was reading a really interesting article recently about how the proliferation of celebrity kids books not just celebrity but also i'm adding this part this was not part of the article but celebrity kids books and also old kids books has made it really difficult for new artists and new writers to break out into the children's literature space because why would you go and invest in publishing a new artist's book when you can just print more copies of the cat in the hat or you know i don't even know if martha stewart has a children's book or whatever but like or you could just get someone to ghost write martha stewart counts turkeys or whatever right sure and that that'll that's so much more likely to end up in the in the checkout aisle at the grocery store then some some random thing and it's kind of like killing creativity now i want to make it very clear the abcs of gaming was not a cash grab was not particularly profitable compared to what else i could have spent my time on for how many we've sold and it's about my expectations in terms of sales and i did not have it ghost written i actually wrote it every word i'm not saying that that's like hard and i'm some kind of like master poet or anything like that i'm just saying that it was not just a marketing gimmick for the book i just wanted it to exist so i made it that's kind of how we do things but give her info plain chat says kim kardashian's daddy isn't feeling well is that an actual book shut up wait what no okay okay i thought that might i thought that might have actually been a children's book that anyway so the the point is that writing is an is another art form that has absolutely been under attack and i just yeah i wonder if the conversation is just different because examples of plagiarism are so much more difficult to point at and go there that that was obviously trained on that article yeah it's it is far easier with art and that's that's another thing that i came to was like is gpt better or is it just harder to tell and i i have some minor counters to that so when a float plane chat just said i put afghan girl green eyes into dolly too and it's super similar it's like yeah code is the one way that i've kind of poked that so something that i started doing was i started looking at googling questions where you would expect a code output and finding the top responses and then asking gpt chat the same question and getting a different response oh okay that did happen but but and i haven't gotten a bunch of this produced and this is where i'm saying like this is not an end a finalized conversation and i'm very interested in people continuing to dive into these things and i think it matters because i think pretty much now is when we need to figure out how all this stuff is going to work but i have heard claims that people have gotten code outputs and then people have asked it to or they got code outputs and they asked it to include comments and the comments included unique things from like people who wrote original code that was highly related like names and stuff oh weird i have never had seen i've never seen an example of that okay which has me a little sus right okay because almost every time anyone's like oh look at this thing gpt did they have screenshot in it and i have not seen screenshots of this but i have heard a screenshot even if you had it could easily be fake so that's that two especially with text because you can just inspect elements and people have done that with gbt i know that for sure i was planning to come on this show and talk about how gpt had been uh like cut down very substantially in what it was able to do and then literally yesterday they like patched it and now it's not so i don't know they i was like gonna come on the show and complain about how it just tells you it can't do any things all the time yeah and then you have to fight it to get it to do it and then they updated it and part of the patch notes is like it will do things more often instead of saying that it can't and i'm like oh all right well that's cool so yeah i don't know it's a it's a really complicated question does making it so that your model is trained off of everything instead of one person make it better or does that just make it more plagiarized yeah yeah i'm not sure i my my gut kind of says i don't know if it makes it okay but it does feel a little bit better because when i saw the ai art model that was trained off of one person mm-hmm that that was gross to me that was like really not cool or okay at all because you were genuinely getting very similar things and i'm not just saying this to defend the artist the originals were definitely better they were clearly better you could see that there was a vision for it there was an idea for it it was more actualized like this is someone who's clearly very good at art but the ai art was pretty good if i hadn't seen the originals i would have thought the ar was like really solid you know so i don't even remember what the original question was but the original question was linus can you clarify what's going on with the cost of byoc tickets at ltx 2023 i screwed that up the byoc ticket is supposed to include admission for the two days whoa so i told chase that's too cheap and we are changing the price yeah i was gonna say that's really yeah that was like very not good pricing for it anyway and that's also if it if it helps chase to feel better i don't think that's how that normally works like for for packs you have to buy a pass to the event and then you also get your byoc badge yeah so anywho we're getting it sorted out stay tuned but on the subject of art say i'm gonna bring it back there hey there we go i get to show you guys the draft branding for orca and dolphin packages oops oh that is so sweet dx so we have whales orcas and dolphins all the dolphins don't get a chain oh i see so it goes chain with the dollar thing yeah and then it's just chain and then it's no chain yeah i asked glasses though i asked sarah to do more like like oakley like blake beach douchebag sunglasses on this one yeah and she she thinks that those look stupid and doesn't want to put them on the dolphin but i was like yeah but dolphins are apples so like i i tell you what please humor me draw it on and then we can fight it out with the a b in our next in our next meeting and she was like okay so i think i think we'll get to we'll get to see that sometime soon cool in other internal news float plane exclusives will be going up well at least one we'll be going up on lmg clips as an experiment we're gonna run one of them the behind the scenes from our shoot with nerdforge and will be available for 48 hours if you guys like seeing a little bit of float playing on youtube the idea here is to use it as a promotional mechanism for float planes so you guys can see it and go oh there's like hours and hours and hours and hours of more stuff like this on float plane oh cool and way newer stuff because that's a little old at this point yeah it's great at this point but it's a little older at this point yeah we actually have way too many topics this week there's a lot i think we might have to kind of call it there and just go to q a what time is it yeah it's oh wow very we are very deep into the show yeah and i have to pee so that's going to be our limiter here all right here's another one from danny first check cleared for my first real it job nice getting a backpack to be my work slash tool bag a question for linus or luke have there been any recent gaming publishers slash developers that you've committed to boycott my library is getting thin with no activision blizzard ea riot or ubisoft games you have a fantastic opportunity to start playing indie games yeah wow that's pretty thin not me personally i wish i was as principled as that but i i can't say that in my line of work i even necessarily have the luxury of not buying games from a particular developer like i'm not gonna go well we're just never gonna benchmark anything from ubisoft and that's you know what that's that's weak right like that's a weak sauce take i'll own it because a more principled take would be no i strongly i strongly disagree with the way x company treats why members of their team or or whatever else and i am i'm drawing a line in the sand we will just not acknowledge them in any way but i'm weak i i have i have put i have put content that will appeal to the people who will play those games and will buy those games i have put that first in this case okay here's another one from corbin how long do you think x86 is long for this world my understanding that it's their instruction set is getting very bloated and with pc building survive such a drastic change i mean anthony did a video a little while back that was called build a pc while you still can and i think he does a pretty good job of actually addressing this very issue because even if x86 sticks around it's very clear that more tightly integrated components have not only cost advantages for manufacturers but also practical advantages i mean we talked earlier on the show about how beneficial it can be to put dram extremely close to a cpu die well that ain't changing anytime soon and as we as we start to build interconnects with higher and higher and higher speeds like we saw with the dell cam video did you happen to see that dell created a new standard for a laptop memory modules that allows the oh yeah that allows the dram packages to get closer to the cpu so that we can actually hit ddr5 speeds without sorry where was i going with this right so we can hit ddr5 speeds without losing the modularity that comes with a removable module so they don't just have to solder the bloody things to the board and i think yeah we're going to see more and more integration so regardless of how long x86 is for this world i i think there's going to be some challenges ahead for custom pc building for sure okay and last one i've got here is from tristan hi guys first luke can you finish explaining how the stream is distributed second linus linux i'm waiting to i'm waiting on a rack mounted gaming chassis on the store no time soon no progress updates none sorry yeah it wasn't all that complicated basically i was just describing that we have our own restreaming service in-house basically so when we stream from here we're actually streaming to a float plane server and then the floatplane server redistributes to facebook twitch youtube and also float plan and also float plane i think that's it that's it do we support twitter no i thought we did at some point did you guys ever expect i think i think you asked me to and i think i decided no so i'm not the only one who doesn't listen yeah it's fair enough in this case you were listening actually i don't i don't remember i think i'm trying to remember aj would remember i i think we might have looked into it and it was like possible but annoying or something i don't remember what it was sure yeah i'm over it's also very possible that i was just like nah but i thought yeah i don't know david e no i'm sorry i don't have any hot takes on virtual desktop's latest quest update which requires an internet connection apparently because of piracy i mean i guess that's pretty obnoxious but nope sorry philippe asks is it true that most of the amd aibs will be reusing their huge heatsink designs from the 4080 and 40 90 for 7900 xt and xtx designs leaving us with incredibly overbuilt heatsinks i don't well okay so there's a couple of things one no they will not be reusing exactly the same design there will be new design work but b a lot of the technologies that they invest in whether it's to do like a a direct heat pipe on chip you know cooler design or whether it's tooling to build a new kind of shroud or whatever else they're absolutely going to reuse that to the greatest degree that they possibly can so i think you'll see a lot of similarities andrew asks hey wan team if you could have any person living or dead receive and review an lttstore.com product who would you choose and which product would you want them to check out you don't have anything that's slap powered oh wait no that's a different person yeah uh you do he did a ton of stuff he did a ton of stuff man man i'd want billy mays to check out man what would amaze billy mays i'd want him to do the screwdriver billy mays here and i've got the ltc description ah it'd be great it'd be glorious i i don't know i have no idea i'd be so happy and it'd be fun at all all positive i mean you know he never crapped on anything it would be kind of cool to find like the person who first invented any form of screwdriver and get them to check out like this this is what we have now yeah it would be pretty cool that'd be pretty cool aj asks speaking framework do you ever think they will make laptops with gaming gpus i'd love to get one but i really need a decent gpu in my laptop i'd love to see them do it too i think that that's something that's going to be a lot more challenging i mean it's been tried time and time again like modular gpus and laptops right mxm as a form factor seems to have basically no support from particularly nvidia who actually seems to have been on a mission to kill it for the last five to ten years so i think it's going to be a real challenge but i would love to see them do it that's all i can really say about that yes i'm aware that it's a complete not answer miles says hey linus and luke on the subject of p2p nas solutions have you heard of cubit i think their goal aligns well with your values it would be awesome to see it talked about in ltt i am not aware of this i always pronounced it qubit i've heard of them i haven't looked deeply into it huh geodistributed cloud with immutable backup and s3 compatible object storage it sounds kind of cool it also sounds probably complicated to use which is not quite what i'm talking about but yeah it sounds kind of neat and i think that's pretty much it yeah i like really have to hit the bathroom yeah so bye see ya okay yeah i think yeah again next week saying bad times on that channel yep hitting it it didn't go clicking it again did we start the server all right i don't know i don't know i don't know what to do with my hands the i could i go bye again you get two oh it worked there we go [music] thank you [music]
