[music] mrbeast [music] [music] oh [music] [music] mrbeast [music] [music] oh [music] [music] mrbeast [music] [music] oh [music] [music] mrbeast [music] [music] oh [music] - i went over there and brett was like, "i
think they need help." so i came back over here
and nobody was over here and it said "water was great." and, like, a stack of hundreds. i don't understand. why did they do that? - why not? - that was way too big of a tip. - funny story. we recorded this video a few days ago and since then, a ton of news
stations have picked this up and ran stories on this. we were on the front page
of fox news, sky news, all these different news
stations were covering it. snapchat covered it. we were on indian national television and just so many news
stations picked up this story about me ordering two waters
and then leaving a $10,000 tip which is kind of funny
because i've done many videos that are much bigger than $10,000. but for all of those who
are just watching this because, you know, you read
some news article or, you know, you heard about me from some news station, i just wanted to give you a quick montage of some other things i've done because, like, literally, this
isn't even the craziest thing i've done. - what on earth? my mom's not even answering. pick up the phone, mom. $35,000 donation, this is unreal. what is happening? oh my god, oh my god. wait, mrbeast just donated another 9,000. - we're gonna give her 15
seconds on a stopwatch. every time she blinks is $1,000. all right, let's see this. - that's one. - yeah, right there. two. she got two. all right, it's been 15 seconds. hey, wow, that was fast. - oh my god! no way. - what's up, guys? we have tons of money
right here, like, $20,000. we have a drone. drone 'em. yep, we're gonna drop money from the drone on completely random people and yeah, this is going to be interesting. - what the heck? - eric, my whole life, everyone's told me, "money doesn't grow on trees." like, what do you say... what is this? - seriously, dude? what the heck? - i know, dude. i'm tired of people lying to me. money does grow on trees.
