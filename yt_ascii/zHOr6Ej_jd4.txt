[music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here and welcome to your first unboxing of the brand new iphone 10s and 10s max video one of two for the day again so yes these are the newest phones they're both the gold color and they're both also the 512 gig which means these are some pretty expensive phones but this is just your look at the unboxing experience and you'll notice the clever wallpaper to hide the notch you know as much as they want us to embrace that notch that is a lot of work to cleverly hide at apple icu also fun fact there is a slightly different planet on each box they're not identical anyway let's not waste our time let's get right into the box because it's actually not the same as iphone unboxings from years in the past you'll see that in a second so at the top you get in there and it's the paperwork again designed by apple in california i sure hope so and in the sleeve you get your apple stickers you get your sim card ejector tool and the quick start guide this stuff is actually the same so no need to pay any special attention to it you can toss that to the side and next up is of course the iphone itself and all its glass stainless steel and gold glory it's looking pretty clean but we'll get to that in a second too underneath the iphone is the charging brick and under here too is the lightning cable it comes with i was kind of hoping by 2018 we could get either a fast charger in the box or a usbc to lightning charger or both but we get neither of those things i personally think it's getting kind of lame and kind of outdated that apple of all companies doesn't ship a fast charger in the box of such an expensive premium phone just saying anyway you put that to the side and you have your headphones here which look the way they normally do but when you turn it around this time they're missing one thing so yeah that's right confirmed no headphone jack dongle in the box of the iphone 10s so all these previous iphones with no headphone jacks have always come with a little lightning to headphone jack dongle in the box very considerate this year it's gone now you know if you're buying a thousand dollar phone or even a fourteen hundred dollar phone like we have here you probably wouldn't blink twice at buying a little eight dollar adapter but it's clearly done on purpose apple can afford to put the dongle in there but they chose not to this time trying to nudge people again towards wireless or lightning headphones also fun fact in case you didn't know the best-selling product in apple stores and in retail stores i guess by volume for the last two years has been dongles this will not change that anyway here's the phone and we can take a second to admire it as clean and scratch free as it'll probably ever be in its life and that completes your unboxing experience for the record it is exactly the same on the smaller 10s but we'll go through that anyway now by the time you see this i will have actually been using the iphones for a couple days since the launch event so this was recorded a couple days ago so lucky for you the full review which has been in the works is also launching today as well dropping exactly 12 hours so 12 hours from the launch of this video check back to your sub boxes 6 pm eastern for the full iphone 10s and 10s plus review so that should be fun also after setting up the iphones real quick i want to share with you the new wallpapers for these new phones there's always new wallpapers with new iphones i'll try to get them on twitter if i can but check out these three new live ones if you haven't seen them yet they are super cool and they look incredible on this inky oled display the super high resolution with the deep blacks but of course don't let that distract you from the fact that they're still hiding the notch perfectly but this this might be the best use of 3d touch at the moment honestly anyway that's your unboxings thanks for watching it's a quick video but stay tuned shortly for the full review i'll see you guys over there thanks for watching peace you
