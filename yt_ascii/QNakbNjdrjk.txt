whatever will we do to keep warm during this frigid crypto winter have you tried looking at the hot prices on gpus there's so many deals to be had that clearly it's time to party and by party i mean build computers now we did just do a 500 pc build but the case wasn't very good and it was filled to the brim with used components so this time we're spending a thousand dollars and we are going brand new baby except for the graphics card that's still gonna be used but it's gonna be great you know what else is great today's sponsor team group team group is giving away an exclusive set of their 32 gigabyte delta rgb 6400 mega transfer per second ddr5 memory modules along with other fabulous prizes learn more at the link down below at double the budget of our last bang for the buck gaming pc we've clearly got more money to spend but what we don't have is money to waste and that's why instead of springing for intel's shiny z690 premium platform we've gone with their mid-tier b660 it's everything we need you get twice as many ram slots compared to h610 greater bandwidth to the chipset which enables better i o like front usb type c more m.2 slots that kind of good stuff and perhaps most importantly it supports memory overclocking allowing us to squeeze a little bit more performance out of our cpu the particular board we've chosen the b660 plus d4 from asus is fine it's got rgb two and a half gig lan decent cooling on the vrms and as much io as most people are likely to need it's got a lot of rgb it has five rgb headers okay for our cpu we've got a big upgrade over last time the 12400f may only turbo 100 megahertz higher than the 12 100 that we used last time but it also has two full additional cores now you could spring for a 12 600 kf for additional cores even if they're efficiency ones would be a huge boom for multi-threaded workloads but it's 70 more dollars and doesn't come with a heat heatsink which adds at least another 25 to 40 dollars to your cost at this budget we just can't make that work without another trade-off that we wouldn't be comfortable with we've used this cooler before so i'll need to apply some thermal compound to the cpu but if you bought this brand new there would already be some thermal paste pre-applied here and you really don't need to reapply it and the installation of this boy is as simple as pressing on these it's like sticking pins into a baby what one typical drawback of budget boards is that you might not find the headers in their usual or ideal locations so the cpu fan header is over here by the rear i o rather than being up along the top edge it's not as nice for cable management but it's not going to affect performance i'm gonna take all these horrible little m.2 standoffs and pre-install them asus you could have done this but instead you wanted to save a dollar since we're at it now seems like a perfect time to install our ssd while the conventional wisdom would tell us take your boot drive and install it in your highest performing m.2 slot the one connected directly to the pcie lanes coming off of the cpu in our case we went with a 670p drive from intel it's got a 5 year warranty and is a great bang for the buck but what it isn't is a top performer so rather than waste our top performing slot which we could install something else in later i'd rather choose between one of these two both of them run at pcie gen 4 speeds through the chipset meaning that you could encounter bottlenecks if you've got a lot of other heavy io going on at the same time but one of them has four lanes and one of them has only two we're going to choose the four lane slot and the reason for that is that if we installed it in a gen four by two lane slot well because the drive only supports gen three and the slot only supports two lanes we would get gen three by two cutting our maximum whoop i got it cutting our maximum throughput in half it is very convenient that they sue silk screens this information onto their pcb so you don't have to consult the manual and it's just such good energy building rigs people can actually afford you know screws yeah i haven't oh for our ram the obvious choice was ddr4 we've gone with a 3600 mega transfer per second 16 gig kit from g skill because we feel this is the sweet spot in terms of bang for the buck for gaming we could have gone for a ddr5 board and ddr5 but the reality of it is while there are performance benefits in some scenarios it's not all the time and the additional cost just doesn't make sense to us at this price now it's time to drag out our case the p300a from fantex it might not come with the greatest packing material and it might not have all the frills and gimmicks but what it is is a solid value pretty darn good looking and compared to our last case it has much better airflow and is a lot nicer to build and just little creature comforts like better cable management here you see hide everything away back there and just having all the edges folded over so you're not liable to cut yourself while you're digging around in it you don't have to go the same route as us though at this price about 80 us dollars there are lots of options one notable one is the fractal design pop air before you forget bend back these otherwise they will end up in your slots and you will have to take out your motherboard to fix it then the i o shield pops in a little something like that credit to fantax for having a nice robust system for attaching their hard drive cage to the case but that means that if we want to completely remove it to fit our large power supply we've got to take out a whopping eight screws our power supply choice an evga supernova 850g plus might look a little overkill it's 850 watts 80 plus gold and it's got a modular interface but at this price point we can afford some creature comforts and we can afford a little bit of the f word future a good quality power supply is a benefit both today giving your components nice clean power and down the line when you go to upgrade and knowing what we know at least from the rumor mill about nvidia's upcoming 4000 series cards a high wattage power supply is looking like a pretty good play at the moment they're accustomed to operating on gpu margins so they came into the power supply space all like who needs to make fun money we're evga and that right there is why we can't have a hard drive cage you could pick up an 850 watt power supply that's a little shorter than this one and maintain your hard drive cage but at 90 bucks it is hard to argue with that value the last two modular cables we're going to install are an eight pin cpu connector looks a little something like that and one of these dual six plus two pin connectors for our gpu one option by the way for expanding your storage now that you've given up your hard drive bays is throwing two and a half inch ssds on these sleds well this one sled at the back or you could just double sided tape them wherever you want pro move at this stage in the game is to pre-run your cables to where they need to go ow now we can go ahead and install our motherboard one of my favorite features of fantex cases is that the middle motherboard standoff has this little kind of raised like nipple lip thing that helps the board stay in place once you've got it positioned over the middle hole won't move evga doesn't have the little little things that hold the two four pins together so yeah i'll figure it out while you're cursing evga trying to get that installed you can just think about the money you saved here comes our front usb 3 little something like that beautiful our one case fan does not quite reach that's okay there's a solution to this problem we will unzip tie it gotta appreciate nice clear labels on front panel connectors shout out motherboard manufacturers and case manufacturers that do that why look at the manual if i don't have to you know now we've got our front panel audio right down here in the bottom left corner boop and that is pretty much it can i just say i love budget builds no rgb no all-in-one water coolers with a whack-ton of fans everywhere and especially rgb 4gb this is great it's kind of amazing when you think about it that 9.99 has been the sweet spot for a diy gaming rig for basically as long as i have been in the business you can get rtx 3070s these days for anywhere from around 400 to 450 dollars yes they are secondhand and there is a chance that someone will sell you defective goods but that's what buyer protections are for so if a shady seller says oh hey you know why don't we do the transaction off of ebay so that i can save the transaction fee you say no buy it make sure it works and if it does 400 rtx 3070 baby let's go like if you dispute something say look they shipped me a brick or they shipped me a defective product you can get a refund pretty much no questions asked we went with a zotac card but really at this point you're going to be choosing based on the price that you can find it for as opposed to which particular brand you prefer it's not like you're going to have warranty support anyway because it is a secondhand product one thing that occurs to me is you will want to watch out for i o if for whatever reason you need dual hdmi ports not every 30 series has those and you can see that ours does not can fit so much gaming in here rtx 3070. jake was sad he missed the peel but there's a second peel cable management here is not bad i think we're ready to close it up by the way if you haven't already signed up for a notification the ltt screwdriver is coming so soon head over to lttstore.com i have some doubts about our rtx 3070 in a case with no front intake fan but optimism this computer gpu fans definitely ramping up a little bit i happened to also shoot the all knocked will build today that was quieter you know we're not in game yet we're not in match serviceable what's also serviceable is our floatplane exclusives by the time this goes up yvonne's meet the team will probably be there i haven't watched it i don't know what she said hopefully it was all nice things guys i'm running at 4k medium presets right now that is responsive it's responsive look at that you got a nice none of my t no one on my team is going to drive me 60 fps halo infinite 4k medium if you can't get kills at these kinds of settings then the issue was not okay really what is my partner doing did you want to get me a shot at anything maybe oh my god the worst driver ever 30 70 baby definitely good enough to get kills boys i love that this is like a grand you too could be the proud owner of this machine and you could die just like that we are turboing all the way to'50'75. gpu temps are under 80. that's fantastic i mean you gotta love that nice open front mesh panel because even though we've only got the one exhaust fan and boy is it ever moving some heat out it's just that there's no resistance to the airflow so it's able to draw that fresh air in from the front and keep that gpu fed i kind of love this machine just like i love our sponsor squarespace if you're thinking about creating and
