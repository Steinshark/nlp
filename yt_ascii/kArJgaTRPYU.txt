berkshire hathaway recently released a snapshot of their stock investments as of september 30th 2022. the company is well known as the investment vehicle for billionaire investor warren buffett two t's not one in this latest filing the company's biggest new purchase 4.1 billion at an average price of about 68 dollars per share has been our friend taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc the piece of news made the rounds for a short bit the stock is traded in both the u.s and taiwan it jumped about four percent in the markets the day of the announcement and a lot more thereafter i've been thinking about this a lot recently so i figured that i would do a short video sharing a few thoughts about the news item also by the way i'm not advising you to invest in anything i'm a youtuber not an investment analyst for pete's sake all i own are s p 500 index funds but before all that i want to thank private internet access or pia for sponsoring the channel i will talk more about them later on but help support the channel by checking out pia in the description below the first thing to say is that it is not entirely clear who did the actual purchase berkshire hathaway employs two money managers to invest about 34 billion dollars of the company's money todd combs and ted weschler buffett tends to attribute smaller investments to one of those two investors and they can make those investments without his counsel the larger ones though are buffered for sure buffett's personal record when it comes to technology stocks is mixed on one hand he has made the world's single most profitable tech stock investment that is of course a legendary 36 billion dollar bet on apple starting back in 2016. as of this writing this 5.6 stake is worth about 137 billion dollars for a cool 100 billion dollar game on the other hand he also invested billions into ibm back in 2011 when he made the investment on the basis of how the company acquires and keeps it departments as its customers even back then i think that was a pretty rough view it took them seven years to fully exit that bet i reckon this tsmc bet which is fairly large but not unprecedentedly so was probably initiated by one of the two secondary managers todd and ted sorry about the click bait that being said it is berkshire's 10th largest position across the whole company which probably means that buffett knew about it and approved it if this bet gets larger down the line like it did with apple buffett is behind that for sure he also tends to go on a tv channel like cnbc to talk about the investment so that is a dead ring or two fyi if he does it then i'm looking forward to him explaining high na uv lithography machines and multi-patterning what follows is a gross generalization of berkshire's compounding growth model berkshire combines the use of cheap gentle leverage with purchases of growth oriented stocks or businesses at a relative discount to compound shareholder value let us examine the two parts of this gross generalization in further detail the first part is leverage this leverage stems not from debt taken out or equity investments from outside parties but instead from the premiums berkshire receives from its insurance customers referred to in the industry has float premiums only need to be paid back when claims are made and accepted the insurance company is permitted to invest this float to generate investment income for an analysis by aqr berkshire's annual cost of leverage has been about 1.72 percent about three percent below the average u.s treasury rate during that time the other side of this gross journalization is the purchasing of stocks or businesses that compound value at a rate greater than the leverage during the 2012 shareholders meeting buffett mentioned that he likes to buy operating businesses with a 10x pre-tax earnings ratio this translates to about a 10 pre-tax return much like a mortgage if you use cheap leverage to purchase an asset that compounds in value faster than what you pay for that leverage you gain value in the difference berkshire seeks to buy a persistent 10 pre-tax earning stream using leverage that cost 1.72 percent if you can find an opportunity like that you go all in on it this is also why berkshire hathaway has a massive energy and utilities division it is picking up dollars at scale with this now in mind let us take a look at the stocks that buffett buys he has been consistently referred to as a value investing guru i think the interesting thing is that berkshire itself does not lean towards traditional definitions of value investing buffett himself might have started out that way early in his career but that is not how berkshire invests today the traditional definition of value investment would be to invest in companies with a relatively high asset value compared to their market stock value a ratio referred to in the industry as having a low price to book ratio in its purest form you don't care about the characteristics of the investment only the price you paid for it everything can be a good investment at a cheap enough price buffett calls this method cigar butt investing for his 1989 letter if you buy a stock at a sufficiently low price there will usually be some hiccup in the fortunes of the business that gives you a chance to unload at a decent profit even though the long-term performance of the business may be terrible i call this the cigar butt approach to investing a cigar butt found on the street that has only one puff left in it may not offer much of a smoke but the bargain purchase will make that puff all profit it works however berkshire does not do this rather the company puts the majority of its portfolio on very large companies with growth potential undervalued by the market i mean buffett and his partner charlie munger say this explicitly munger explained in a recent 2021 interview that the cigar butt approach made money but it would not fit as berkshire got bigger this required a change in approach as munger said well it was perfectly obvious that he'd made so much money in the other technique that it was hard for him to leave something that had worked so well but it was not going to scale so when he started looking for investment values and great businesses that were temporarily under pressure it changed everything for the better that 130 billion dollar apple investment is a good case study of this work in action but first i want to talk a little bit about our sponsor private internet access or pia i agreed to work with pia because i was already using and paying for it myself before they reached out while doing research i found that i needed to visit websites that look or act differently depending on where you are and also just being a person abroad in taiwan some sites are entirely inaccessible for those who are not familiar with vpns a vpn hides your ip address and encrypts your internet connection so it wasn't a question of whether or not i needed a vpn it was a question of which one i really had no idea what to make of all these vpns so i talked to a friend of mine whose opinion i trusted and he said pia is pretty good when i asked him why he listed a few significant reasons first he mentioned that pia's code is open sourced that is something personally important to me to be able to just rummage around with the code or to download and package the chrome extension myself second one subscription can protect up to 10 devices at the same time it's more generous than many other vpns of the type between the iphone ipad and macbooks and whatnot it adds up finally and most importantly i never had an issue with vpn reliability using pia let me rant a little bit the hbo max app is kind enough to let you purchase a subscription from taiwan but not so kind to actually let you stream from abroad so if i want to watch hbo's show chernobyl then i have to vpn in the best thing that i can say about pia is that i personally never had to worry about the vpn connection when doing this it also works with all the other streaming services like netflix iplayer amazon prime and more and it has servers in over 84 countries and each and every u.s state up using the link below and use pia for about two dollars a month and four months free my thanks to pia for their support thanks to kalani scarrett and his allocators asia newsletter for helping on this section when berkshire first purchased apple sometime in the first quarter of 2016 the company generated about 68 billion dollars in pre-tax earnings over the past 12 months the company's market cap at about that time was about 600 billion dollars that calculates out to a market value to pre-tax earnings ratio of about 8.8 times this meets the 10x threshold that berkshire shoots for at a gram and dodd annual breakfast berkshire hathaway managers todd and ted elaborated on the metrics they used to find apple it says combs goes to buffett's house on many saturdays to talk and here's a litmus test they frequently use warren asks how many names in the smp are going to be 15x earnings in the next 12 months how many are going to earn more in five years using a 90 confidence interval and how many will compound at seven percent using a fifty percent confidence interval in an interview given after the investment was announced weschler explains it is cleaner to make the argument on apple versus the past names nokia blackberry etc that there is a subscription element to it so they clearly care about the predictability of the earnings to them the increasing stickiness of the iphone ecosystem allowed apple to create a recurring revenue flow this gave them confidence that the company will retain its earning power over the next five years plus buffett and berkshire continued adding to their apple stake up through the second quarter of 2018. they would add some 75 million shares pre-split in the first quarter of 2018 alone and like i said those shares are today worth over 137 billion dollars now we are finally going to talk about tsmc per the 13f sec filing berkshire purchased tsmc throughout the third quarter 2022 at an average price of 68.56 throughout that third quarter tsmc's market capitalization declined from a high of 729 billion dollars where it had once been the world's eighth largest company to 353 billion dollars in doing so the company's ratios reached a very attractive level over the trailing 12 months tsmc generated about a trillion ntd or about 32 to 33 billion dollars in pre-tax earnings depending on your currency rate 353 billion dollars to 32 billion dollars gives you a market to pre-tax earnings ratio of about 11 times this is not quite 10 but it is quite close now berkshire also wants to have a high confidence level about the sustainability of future growth so we then need to review the variety of reasons why the stock might have fallen so far i have a few in mind geopolitical tension surrounding taiwan and china of course larger macroeconomic concerns around the semiconductor industry as the economy grinds slower various companies and technology are pulling back spend and doing layoffs higher interest rates causing the relative value of stocks to fall as compared to bonds increase government intervention with chip technology export bans and plenty of chip subsidies being splashed around and intensifying technology competition from samsung and intel and so on many of these concerns are legitimate the market is right in valuing the company far lower than its peak earlier this year in january however there are plenty of points to tick off in support of the notion that the market put tsmc's investment value temporarily under pressure as munger would put it i have no comment on the geopolitical concerns first the company's products have high margins this gross margin in q3 2022 was 60 and the company also generates a significant return on its assets and equity above 40 percent tsmc also generates an immense amount of free cash flow though a substantial portion of that has to be reinvested into equipment and capital expenditure second the company has maintained growth in 2022 despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions and an increasingly large revenue base based on its own projections tsmc is estimated to do about 76 billion dollars in revenue in 2022. the company reports its monthly revenues and the latest november read shows growth accelerating again to over 50 percent year over year as tsmc ships new chips for apple devices third the company's revenue model is easy to understand they take orders from customers to build a factory and sell them the production tsmc is not going to invest in new factories unless they know the demand is there i mentioned this in the newsletter but at the start of this year financial analysts sebastian ho pointed out that tsmc's revenues tend to be about three times the amount of capital expenditures in the prior year now this ratio dipped a bit this year if tsmc hits the 76 billion dollars revenue this year they are predicting then that is 2.82 times last year's 26 billion dollar capex in q3 2022 tsmc revised down its full year capex spend to 36 billion dollars but even if we are to carry over that same 2.82 ratio from 2022 that implies tsmc produces about 100 billion dollars of revenue in 2023. the assumption does is that tsmc grows its revenues predictably and that capital expenditures are leading indicators of those future revenues fourth the company's technologies are difficult to switch away from as i mentioned in a previous video design technology co-optimization means that nodes are by and large customized for the end user and its design close relationships make it hard though not impossible for customers to onboard a new foundry the company has pricing power recently they raised prices on their core clients including apple qualcomm and the like many of the ips that tsmc customers use are proprietary and patented tsmc has been in the top 10 us patent filers and the acceptance rate of its patents have also consistently been over 95 percent an indication of high patent quality and finally the macro trends downstream are very strong management consistently talks about the technology transitions that semiconductors enable whether that be an ai the cloud electric vehicles and the like i discuss a few of these interesting technologies in previous videos again this video is not investment advice while there is some evidence that emulating buffett's portfolio can generate better than average returns over the long run everybody has to invest in the way that fits their own personal financial style and circumstance are you a multi-billionaire are you a 600 billion dollar corporation with a massive insurance float in multiple extremely profitable and consistent operating businesses no you're not so why are you trying to invest like them with all that being said i think there is a reason why tsmc is already berkshire's 10th largest listed investment it's a solid technology leader very transparent and fits the company's business model it was also quite underpriced with its growth potential underappreciated in q3 2022 the stock has bounced back quite a bit since then berkshire probably won't buy more at this higher price but let's keep an eye on this position in the future all right everyone that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the newsletter and i'll see you guys next time
