right so ai is here to stay whether you like it or not chat gpt chat gpt chat gpt terrifying and exciting a large language model trained by open ai and yes inevitably it will replace some jobs that is the purpose of technology but i think what everyone's missing here is that technology also creates jobs like when the modern computer was created i'm sure there was a big outcry against like oh the computer's gonna replace like mathematicians accountants bank tellers but what it also did was create this like knowledge work industry where we're now using computers to do all sorts of things that could not have been possible without computers whenever there's like a new leaping technology like there now is with this new chuck ebt there's two types of people there's type one of people who are afraid of it and who reject it it's like the people who still refuse to use a computer to this day and then there are people who embrace the new technology who learn how to use it and to infuse it with themselves to do new things which is where these new opportunities are created and i don't know about you but i definitely want to be in the second group so that is why i decided to use chat dbt for a week and try to find as many ways as i could of using this new tool to automate not only coding but my everyday life and here are the top five ways that i found first i wanted to understand how could chat gbt be used in my everyday coding activities like building my coding projects i decided to first give you some simple programs to build and to test its limits because i like to be original and like not do what everyone else is doing i started with a to-do app it took a couple of tries and some going back and forth but within literally minutes i was able to get the ai to build me this which is honestly a pretty impressive starting point for like a series to do application whatever you want to build you can use chat gbt to essentially give you a very good starting point for your application for example for my budgeting applications startup with the help of gbt i was very quickly able to build this starting point for the ui of the applications which is not pretty but it's something and it's always easier to have something like on paper on the page and then iterate from it and it's pretty insane the extent to which i was able to use it to help me write code like look at this for example i could give a code and just say please fix and it would literally fix it for me correctly and even explain to me what i was doing wrong with my original code you can essentially think of this as a much better and much faster googling machine by using chat lgbt with coding was definitely not all i found so here are four more ways i found to use chat tbt to automate my everyday life but before we discuss that can we just appreciate how insane it is that we now have this like this technology and this ai that can literally like be your own personal assistant that's just like there that's able to solve your problems and it's further reinforcing the fact that to learn to code today you really don't have to be that smart another example of this is just how easy it is today to build yourself a personal website there's so many tools and so much technology available to you and one example of this is today's sponsor hosting as brand new website builder which literally allows you to build a full website with no coding using this drag and drop interface in like less than one hour so when you sign up to hosting it you'll get access to this very intuitive dashboard and you get to this builder where you can just play around you have designer made templates to start from so you don't need to start from scratch you can make a blog or an online store and one of the most annoying parts of creating a website for me usually is making it responsive to different screen sizes but this one just does it for you you automatically and another thing that i love is that this builder gives you like a full library of royalty-free images that you can just use for free on your website to make it look amazing and the other option they have which i personally use for most of my website projects is wordpress which is very beautifully and seamlessly integrated into the hosting a process you're gonna need hosting for your website anyway but unlike other providers with hosting it you get access to both wordpress and the hosting a website builder for completely free as well as a free domain a free professional email inbox industry standard security features and much much more to get the best pricing i recommend they're 48 months plan because i partnered up with hostinger you can also use my code internet make coder at checkout to get your discounts up to 91 thank you for hosting it for sponsoring this video so we talked about using ai as your coding assistant but you can actually expand this to use ai as your full personal assistant to essentially ask you any questions that you want and get pretty good answers so because chad gbt is like basically google on steroids i found that as i was using and getting used to jack dbt more and more all questions that i would normally google i could much more easily just ask from chat gbt and normally i would get answers much faster and the answers would be much better and much more tailored to the exact question i was asking it and i was pretty amazed at all the things that i could give me honestly i was able to use it to get ideas to find places to rent apartments to get christmas present ideas so while child gbt might not replace humans he might just replace google put for thought but sadly what i wasn't able to do is arrange a date with it it's worth the show the next thing you're gonna do with chargpt is use it as a summarized station machine to supercharge your ability to ingest information much much faster pretty much any knowledge that you'd ever want to have that humanity has ever been able to find is available somewhere on the internet so then the challenge always is is finding that info imagine and finding the ways to learn the exact skills that you want to learn so where charity bt is really powerful is you can use it to summarize a lot of articles to summarize books there are even browser extensions that can allow you to summarize youtube videos by just giving it the link actually i want some of you i want one of you to go and use one of these extensions and like summarize this video and i want to see how well it does now let's get into the serious stuff how can ai help you learn faster and i know we sort of touched on this but it's basically whenever you want to learn anything you can rather than using google you can use chat dbt when i learn a language just ask the bot to explain it to you want to learn history just ask any question from the boss as long as the answer to the question you're asking exists somewhere in the corpus of text that this bot is using to generate these horses is probably going to be able to answer your question it's much faster to ask you from the bot than to like go scour google from all the different articles to find exactly what you want which again just speeds up the process so much and it's going to be able to ingest information and to learn things like 10x faster but you do want to be careful because sometimes the summaries are not exactly accurate so just remember to also use your own brain with this the last one which is probably the most interesting and definitely the most scary one is using charity as your personal writer let's say you want to write an email to your boss just ask gbt to write it for you and he can even write it in the exact style that you want to use i also used it to write three threads and it actually worked let's say you want to start blogging just give the bot a topic and it's going to write you an article about it now what i wouldn't do here is just literally copy the exact thing that the bot gives you if you're just writing articles the written word for word by the bot because everyone can now do that that's not going to be something where you can stand out so to stand out use what the ball gives you use it as ideas and then iterate from it and you can again use this to start like a blogging website much much faster than you could ever do before however this can be even more powerful using copywriting or writing your cv or cover letters again use it as a starting point to get past the blank page stage then make it more tailored to whatever you want to do if the previous two things like using as a teacher and a summarization machine can allow you to ingest information like 10 times faster this can allow you to output information 10 times faster and no i don't think this is fully gonna replace humans but it is going to allow us to use it as a sort of anti-entropy machine to simplify all this sea of information and data that we as a humanity have created to give us the answers that we want much much faster and do also allow us to use it to do something else to create output much much faster you can either reject ai because you're afraid of it or you can embrace ai and find ways to use it now to make your life easier because ai is here to stay and there's nothing that you can do about it so that's what i think about ai i hope some of these five ways give you inspiration if you want to see my previous video where i discuss in more detail about whether ai can replace coding jobs i actually gave you some tasks from my actual jobs and saw how it did you can watch this video here many exciting things coming up on this channel in 2023 if you're not seeing what those are hit the subscribe button and i'll see you in the next one [applause]
