this year's seen more than the usual number of references to flat earth conspiracies in the news including some very fascinating twitter tirades i think that's as good a reason as any to talk about a field of engineering and earth science that you may have never heard of before geodesy i'm grady and this is practical engineering shorts where we dip our toes in the pool of technical details behind current events or non-event how does your airline pilot know which direction to head when he's over the ocean with no landmarks how do we know the exact boundaries between parcels of land and between states and countries these are questions we answer with geodesy the science of how we characterize the shape and size of the earth you see it's easy to compare the distance and direction between two locations that are close to one another but it's a whole different matter for places that are far apart geodesy provides the mathematical framework we need to make calculations about the globe and answer questions like how can a gps satellite guide me to the nearest taco stand well how can it you can't just take a measuring tape between every point on earth so to be able to calculate the distance between me and my favorite taco joint i need to use a coordinate system for short distances it's perfectly fine to assume things are flat and use cartesian coordinates but over long distances that assumption starts to break down because drawing a straight line between two locations will actually pass through the earth rather than along its surface flat earthers say that the earth's not a sphere and i have to agree with them on that in fact if the earth where a sphere our lives would be almost as simple as if it were flat we could use a spherical coordinate system and define locations using radius polar angle and azimuth instead of x and y well i did say almost simple but the earth is much bumpier than that and in fact because of its rotation the earth actually bulges along the equator it's not a sphere at all and unfortunately bumpy bulging coordinate systems make calculating things like distance challenging if not impossible so to bridge the cartographic gap between me and delicious tacos we need an idealized model of the earth and it turns out that there's a three-dimensional shape that matches there's fairly well the oblate spheroid also known as an ellipsoid giada says have defined a number of reference ellipsoids over the years to try and match the shape of the earth for use in performing geodetic computations the reference ellipsoid serves as the basis for the coordinate system that we all know and love latitude and longitude the map isn't quite as simple as with cart or spherical systems but it's much more accurate in fact the satellites have formed the global positioning system or gps use a reference ellipsoid to calculate a receivers location anywhere on earth mapping software can take data from gps satellites and perform computations with a very high precision for example the distance between me and well you know they say that wherever you go there you are and no one knows that better than giada --ss they take the irregular amorphous rock that we live on and give it structure form and definition providing a framework for a whole host of other sciences and technologies geodesy tells us that if it looks like an ellipsoid and spins like an ellipsoid it might be the earth thank you for watching and let me know what you think oh
