who is the best voice assistant we've got apple siri versus google assistant versus amazon's alexa versus samsung's bixby and through 65 carefully selected questions we're gonna find out who can make your life the easiest so let's start off in the study with some math questions what's two plus two minus one what's 104 plus 64 times 14. too easy divide that by three nice and now multiply that by seven convert 6 cups to milliliters all of them got it splits a bill of 69 pounds 42 between three people oh oh there's another dimension to this let's say that i'm finished with my studies and i want to turn off my smart light bulb i can just say turn off the light and actually every single one of these assistants can do this providing you have a light that's compatible with them i bet you didn't expect alexa to be winning this right now but that was light work so let's get a little more complicated let's say you're in your bedroom you're winding down for the day and you want to use your voice assistance for device control turn off bluetooth increase screen brightness by 20 percent wow change my wallpaper turn on dark mode come on alexa take a selfie hmm oh let's try this take a picture in five seconds alexa is falling behind and how much battery do i have left not bad unsurprisingly google's made back some ground here as device control is kind of what it's designed for but again there is a bigger picture with these assistants what if someone brings your smart doorbell while you're in bed what i've done is set up a ring doorbell outside my cat flap and on google assistant bixby and alexa i can check up on it just by saying who's at the door and they will show me oh my gosh this guy's too cute siri doesn't work with ring doorbells well instead just serve you up huh you tend to find that apple is a bit more restrictive with the brand that they're compatible with but they do still get the point here because there are smart doorbells you can use all right now i imagine you're doing some cooking your phone's on the counter but you don't really want to touch it because you might have greasy hands but you still want to ask yourself so how good is each of these assistants at answering internet queries what's the weather like today that'll bring a coat then what will be the highest temperature today oh i like this one what will the weather be like on tuesday next week that's shorts and t-shirt weather should i take an umbrella with me today love that what song is this hmm [music] honestly horrific okay but what if while i'm doing this i want to set the kettle to boil without touching it well the way you would do that is to have a smart plug that you can turn on and off remotely and then a specific kettle that allows you to hold the boil button on so that as soon as that plug is remotely activated it will go straight into boiling the water and turns out every single one of these assistants is able to control smart plugs like this so one point to all of them okay let's delve deeper into the internet queries how old is rick astley that's smart how many number one songs does he have that's right playing any concerts in the near future can you print me some tickets too okay let's try a different act when is the next avengers movie due to be released what's it called oof will spider-man be in it show me paintings by monet [music] style of painting was he famous for yikes show me a recipe for passion fruit pie could eat one of those right now but what if i have guests over to eat a big slice of my passion fruit pie what if i want to set the mood i'm gonna need some smooth jazz music of course so siri google and alexa all have accompanying smart speakers and because these are wi-fi speakers your assistant will be able to locate them within your house and automatically start playing your smooth jazz through them a sub to the channel would be jazzy bixby doesn't have its own smart speaker so the only way to play your music out loud is to connect to one via bluetooth but that's not nearly as seamless so it's not getting that point but we can get tougher by testing now how much control each one of these assistants can exert over third-party apps open the app store set an alarm for 7am just bear in mind for alexa that sometimes even when it is actually correctly executing a command it doesn't always show you that on screen show me my photos from 2021 which of them were taken in the united states each of them had dogs in them ouch how far is it from sicily to rome can you give me the directions nice google play a song on youtube oh yes this is really tough play stranger things season 4 on netflix hot take stranger things is overrated send a tweet now also while we're in this room i've got my smart vacuum cleaner so let's see if we can put it to work that vacuum up the kitchen please the kitchen is on the other side of the house from here so i'll be quite impressed if it understands a command that specific and can actually navigate all the way to the kitchen to clean and turns out it does on google assistant bixby and alexa that's incredible siri doesn't though you can use it to start vacuuming but it doesn't understand anything beyond that and now for some of the most advanced app commands send an email to mrs hughes the boss no way search ebay for nintendo gamecube translates the following okay you can probably blame my friend for that read this outfit i know someone who could use this send this to mum yes google what can i do here create a new contact new dad message them to say hello oh can you switch from voice input to keyboard input add a laughing crying emoji foreign what about the human factor because it's one thing to have a really intelligent assistant but i would say it's just as important how naturally they can interact with a human user what's my name that's not actually how you pronounce it call me boss man instead thank you can you cheer me up tell me a joke tell me a dad joke remember that my keys are under the mat okay forget everything i told you today and finally the toughest category of them all routines every single one of these assistants also has the option to execute a whole series of actions when you give them a single command you can create routines that activate based on where you are like for example i've set one up that detects whether i'm home past 5 pm and if i am it will say welcome home it'll turn the lights on it'll even turn the kettle on and shockingly this works on both google and siri i'm impressed one point to each one of the other things i wanted to test was a routine that detects when you connect your phone to your car via bluetooth and then opens up all the apps that you want to use on it and only bixby can do this one where it starts playing my driving music playlist opens ways for traffic detection turns on do not disturb on my phone and then asks me where are we going that is awesome for number 63 i wanted to use dismissing my alarm as a trigger to be able to open news because first thing in the morning when i get out of bed it would be so cool to be able to immediately just be on the news and seeing what's happening in the world and this actually works on all four of them plus you can take it further by also activating a morning routine just by saying good morning to each of these but bixby is truly the hidden mvp when it comes to routines i realized it can actually go as complex as managing your bad habits it can detect if a game that you're addicted to for example is is being played between certain times on certain days and it can use that input to trigger alarm bells it can make my light red it can close the app deactivate my wi-fi and even tell me off for trying so the winner of best voice assistant is google are you ready to see me drop the one iphone 14 that i have the only reason i did that is because this case the rhino shield solid suit can absorb impact like that and it's just been upgraded it's now easier to take off and put on it's easier to clean it's grippier you can now get a version with magsafe compatibility that is two times stronger than apple's own cases and this is my favorite part about rhino shield it is even more customizable along with new colors you can change the camera ring you can change the buttons you can choose from what feels like a million designs from pewdiepie to dragon ball and when you pair this with rhino shield's new grip which is available in both adhesive and magsafe versions then it's not just that it can tank just about any drop you can throw at it but you'll also be about a tenth as likely to actually drop it in the first place so whether you're getting a new phone or you just want to spruce up your existing phone check
