all right so open ai just introduced sora our text to video model sora can create videos up of up to 60 seconds featuring highly detailed scenes complex camera motion and multiple characters with vibrant emotions all right i have that on the upload prompt beautiful snowy tokyo city bust is bustling the camera moves through the bustling city streets following several people enjoying the beautiful snowy weather and shopping at nearby stalls gorgeous sakura petals are flying through the wind along with the snowflakes i believe they didn't say the city was busing that's i mean what what kind of ai model is this okay so what we're looking at right here is is shocking this is not will this is not will smith eating spaghetti and so this one i so this one's crazy but there's one or two i just briefly skimm the article where i think your mind is going to be blown if you're thinking about previous gen ai video but this kind video like just the previous generation of ai yeah video i mean obviously there was like like if you okay oh check this out so i did catch something that was a little awkward watch this girl walking yep for a second and you'll notice that it gets really odd with the perspectives right here like look at this she's like walking on top of whatever that is she like kind of flows through that thing so it just looks awkward and then then it kind of looks more normal now but still there was like that awkward weirdness there for a second yep and there like too tall for some stuff like look how much taller they are than but even so you typed in a paragraph and they got this this is crazy yeah like look at these poor little steaks right here right here they're like the size of her thumb like who who eats a steak that big look at that little steak maybe they're just giants i guess we don't really know they didn't say regular sized humans to be fair to be fair they did okay so you're saying that there's some other ones like this this one so go to the go to the actual like blog post from the top oh we got one more video we got one more video look at that one that actually looks pretty good yeah that's what was the prompt for this that one was several giant woolly mammoths approach treading through a snowy meadow their long woolly f fur lightly blows in the wind as they walk snow covered trees and dramatic snowcapped mountains in the distance midafternoon light with wispy clouds and a sun high in the distance there's no wispy clouds they somehow got wispy clouds meaning these these guys are admitting just just admit what appears to be a volcano in the background mmoths are creating the clouds it did get a little bit confused about that yeah it did okay so let's here i got i got the article up let's look at this article creating video from text okay all videos of this page were generated directly by sora without modification oh cool that's cool yeah oh dang oh d the crazy thing is without modification you know like even if they're handpicking it's still wild yeah still with no modification really this is this is what so this is where i was like i don't know why they picked the one of them walking in the town even just this first one crazy yeah this one definitely has like uncanny valley with her feet on the ground but besides for that like perspective obviously is really hard but dang but if you wanted they they're literally doing art perspective from a seventh grader but everything else is incredible but like it so okay it's like okay so their feet clip poorly with the ground all right so just zoom the video in 15% and you're done you know what i mean i guess you wouldn't have been able to tell me that right here this was a fake person and the crazy thing is like the reflections so this is the thing that's like really blowing my mind right now is everything i've seen up until now for like ai video stuff right they can never figure out like what it means for something to be a reflection or like for things to interact in an environment at all basically you know what i'm saying this is wild the reflection in the glasses yeah and this like see the dark part right here versus the two bright spots on both sides mhm so it does like kind of actually make it happen this like actually so it's like sure you can find problems with it but also if you're like watching a movie you're not actually looking at the background people like you know there's like all those videos on youtube of people like picking apart random background actors y or stuff it's like yeah well you never noticed cuz you're watching the thing that's in the middle of the screen that's fact teenage wolf did you ever watch teenage wolf i believe with michael j fox i think he was the teenage wolf high school wolf something like that did i just become tiny you did tj are you tiny oh man t oh crap i did that my bad my bad my bad here bring it bring they're finding out dude it's an ai don't let them know ai filter this whole time so anyways the show with i believe michael j fox it's like high school werewolf or something along those lines i don't know show a guy in the background during the official release drops trout runs during the final scene just dick out in everything it i mean it's in movie theaters it's it's fantastic no way yeah you got to go check it out it's pretty funny because you know it's like a classic high school like basketball game or something that they all do and then just some dude in the background just just just raging just raging it out okay that's crazy that's so good all right but then there's like a ton of other ones from here too like it did it not have the left and right arrows on that one or no i don't remember i don't see any left oh yeah oh oh yeah yeah there's more okay there's the bully mammoths and the prompt for this is just a movie trailer right and it like says stuff and it remembers all the things this also makes me question like how is chat gpt not able to write my code anymore you know what i'm saying like how are we i'll i'll tell you why chat gpt can do this but not be able to write your it's actually really simple yeah it's it's very very simple when it comes to your eyeballs you actually have quite a bit of leeway if if you drop one frame and it and you're going from say 60 frames to 59 frames most people can't even notice it at all like 99.9% only the only the 14-year-olds thinking they're ninja you know snorting aderall those are the only ones that actually can tell when something is dropped and so your your eyes are very very willing to let go of things whereas if they tried to do sound you would hear a lot more of it but code requires 100% precision there's no you can't get it 85% correct it just doesn't work that's true and so this thing even though if it's like 90% correct like that guy walking in the background then he's just gone like that's effing up the whole thing the whole thing's broken code doesn't work unless it was supposed to be like that but yes yeah okay that looks real i would have just assumed this is real to be fair that one could be literally just a copy of a real video copyright just real video right there yeah yeah that is crazy though yeah the water is really good i guess that makes sense because in a sense like water is so chaotic and so and so like you you can't really tell it's probably too complex for my eyeballs to really understand that it's wrong right and your brain kind of is just like yeah it's water hitting stuff like okay okay that seems fine yeah i've seen that rip pixar yeah pixar's dead i mean they their flame kind of sucked i i'll i'll give you that flame's not that great all right so it looks like everything's pretty good oh this one's really cool with the paper that's that's pretty cool these paper model styles that's super cool that's really really it be so cool to see people like mix art styles of things so today is becoming available to red teamers to assess critical areas for harms or risks pixar ar poster about to have its own content let's go we are also granting access to a number of visual artists designers and filmmakers to gain feedback on how to advance the model to become to be most helpful for creative professionals for that big strike they all just had the like the writers and actors guild and stuff oh well we before we didn't really believe it was possible but now we watched sora so we're going to go back on everything we said before writer writer's guild is like we're never going to do this vfx people are like oh what you got there what what are you doing yeah i'm totally in for this this is gonna cost so much money i can't imagine that this is cheap i i i don't i have no idea if they say in the article or not but like how long did it take to render a video let's yeah that's a good that's a good idea we're sharing our research progress early to start working with and getting feedback from people outside of open ai and to give public sense of what ai is capable or what ai capabilities are on the horizon okay so there's all this kind of stuff you have a bunch of this okay super cool very complex scene you know you would assume this is just right out of blazing saddles would have no idea that it's not all right s is able to generate complex scenes with multiple character specific types of motion and accurate details of the subject and background the model understands not only what the users has asked for in the prompt but also how these things exist in the physical world okay there's that perspective part again it's not not very good about that part oh it even shifted the car a little bit going off the side that was okay that was pretty impressive yeah we cycle through some of these ones okay that there's still like like there's still okay cu this was the one that i saw that blew my mind whoa that was so good cuz i have not seen like a video that demonstrates this capability of like the reflection and keeping the subject the whole time yeah super good that was s right there that was super good and and yeah everything about it is just crazy like that it's distorted right that it looks like it's from some like you know irl streamer camera and then you see them in their one is yeah she's holding a phone you can actually see the phone right now and then it comes into view and goes out that was really good that that that one's pretty crazy let's see if they have any more that are pretty crazy this is just looks like a standard tourist d the you're going to be instead of having to spend one billion dollars to make rings of power maybe they can like spend 500 million instead and have it be just as bad yeah that's all right they won't have to go they won't have to go and film things on set they can just do all the big action scenes from there what is this so th these ones too are crazy right because the prompt has two different subjects so it's wild to see them be able to track the two subjects the whole time right cuz like i don't know if you've tried to do prompting for like image stuff before and then gets off really quickly like like i want a guy riding a camel and so then it always makes like a dude with a camel face or something like that right and you're like no i wanted two subjects in the picture like you know all right hold on let's see a large orange octopus is seen wrestling on the bottom of the ocean floor bending with its oh my gna stop moving oh gosh i can't stop it hold on css is hard all right there we go they've made ai video but they cannot render the text on the website dude the te well the text keeps shifting because this counter right here the counter slightly shifts and it shifts everything with the sandy rocky terrain it his tentacles are spread out around its bodies and its eyes are closed the octopus unaware of the king crab that is crawling towards it from behind the rocks its claws raised and ready to attack the crab is brown and spiny with long legs and antenni the scene is captured from a wide angle showing the vastness and depth of the ocean and the water is clear and blue and the rays of sunlight filter through the shot is sharp and crisp with high dynamic range the octopus and the crab are in focus while the background is slightly blurred creating a depth of field effect that's crazy that is exactly what they got yeah like that's so cool yeah i want this so bad for like b-roll content for youtube yeah this would be the greatest b-roll content of all time on youtube like you can make so many memes i can't wait and like like i feel so dumb being like dude i cannot wait to make so many memes with this but then it's like this technology is going to potentially destroy the world yeah yeah we'll get let's talk about the destroying world one hold on what is going on in this one this one seems all wrong so this i think this section said these are the areas where it's failing right now proper use of a treadmill this is the greatest reason why it can't code for us right now this is javascript on the back end right here this is javascript on the back end ain't no way this is working out yeah hey guy a tread download that video right now and then tweet after this this is javascript on the back end ah that puppy had a puppy oh they're having puppies whoops oh there's that perspective problem yeah right or broken physics too yeah this one asked it to explode right doesn't that what isn't that what it says yeah but still it's really funny that bam and another balls flying through the air yeah mhm it's like one of those who watch in reverse yeah this looks like watching like a tennant or something you know you you know the the one where they do the reverse time thing that's what it looks it this one says archaeologists discover a generic plastic chair in the desert excavating and dusting it with great care that would be a pretty crazy discovery to discover a plastic chair like that in the desert especially one that floats away yeah it just keeps like that that's actually an alien even this i feel like would be great for memes like when it does something that so impossibly ridiculous i'm like oh i would love to use this in a meme yep the interesting chair aspect ratio that chair just gets all weird all right all right so this is this is super cool safety so what is the safety i'm i'm curious what they consider the safety problems because obviously number one internet porn thing number one is probably like impersonating people not just not just for porn right but like yeah like before it was really hard to make like a deep fake of someone saying something else right now you could do you think is going to be the biggest problem though do you think that's going to be the biggest problem i don't know i it has the potential to probably do like the most damage like societally right like if you can just say that oh like say this requires inperson more and more right it's just gonna kind of prevent prevent you could just write you know so and so drops bomb on this like hospital or something right and then like post that that really happened yeah and then like get a bunch of yeah like we already have people that don't like to tell the truth about everything you know both sides etc right so it's like and it's just going to be so easy because you just literally write it out right you just like yeah saying saying say so i don't know so i'm not sure i think the porn one is going to be really bad though like the that worries me about the porn one isn't that there's going to be porn of celebrities like that has you know that's kind of like that's been consistent problem but it's going to be the ninth grade boy taking the ninth grade girl in his class and them generating porn from it and then causing like you now you have like a whole new set of issues that just like taking advantage of people like like the one to one taking advantage not famous person being taken advantage of which is already kind of like you know there's r side of it which is really bad and then there's also i think sort of like the interpersonal stuff as wild interpersonal stuff and as well as just like then you have no basically like you can it's it's going to be like brave new world right like where you just sit down in the pleasure machine and then that's all that you want right instead of like doing real things you can like generate all the things that you want here and that one i think is also really scary right so like on a on personal levels i think those are way scarier than like misinformation or disinformation but i do like i'm worried like there's going to be a war before that gets started you know what i'm saying like like it would be that would be also really bad yeah well i mean i i'd say the the one good thing though that comes from all this is that people stop trusting the internet which i think would be a much better thing is that you cannot you cannot look at headlines or images and you can't do any of that it has to purely be like you have to go and like look at the thing itself if you want to know if someone said it you have to like literally be there or else it's probably all fake i do think at least hopefully people will be less trusting and more suspicious yeah yeah dang this is this is actually well this is probably this is a huge iteration i mean i'm i'm i'm not an ai accelerationist i i still think we're going to hit like kind of a wall where it's just like it's not that great i'm not in the that it's going to keep on improving at the rate we're currently seeing it i you know i'm just not on that although to be fair i would not have predicted sora either like i thought we were kind of far away from this you know i don't know i don't think we're that i i mean this isn't that much further away from the what's it called this i mean this is significantly better than the will smith eating spaghetti one but it's not dramatically better but the it's not so much about it being better i think though it's like about that the accessibility of it is so much bigger oh yeah right that's fine that's right so that so it's like so much easier to be widespread right and so much harder to find out like who did it right you know what i'm saying like before if there's only 10 people in the world who can make convincing deep fakes you like find the people you know you're like who did this but now it's going to be like oh it's going to be super easy to like pretend joe rogan endorsed your ad or like mr beast is doing a giveaway or something right and you're like scamming people or that it's like oh here's a picture of a person make a video of them like trapped kidnapped by people and now they're going to like call the grandma and like scam the grandma into sending money to like save their kid you know what i'm saying like this already really hard for those people to do it even even when it's not like super even when it should be obvious like oh it's clearly not my granddaughter it's a guy on the other end of the line like of a different you know ethnicity or something right and they still fall for it so then now it's going to be like oh they have a video that looks convincing of your daughter like kidnapped they're going to send it right so it's like that's our so there's like this whole i think the accessibility of the technology is like somewhat frightening yeah okay that's fair accessibility is a very interesting thing because that's the thing that's going to cause the most amount of like distributive problems right you know there is definitely something about it being more constrained but i mean the the the positive note is that kid boga probably is going to have an incredible dude there dude ai cont the content for the is going to be out of this world the content i i like it's so goofy cuz like i know it's you know it's just like dumb but you're like man will be so many fun there will be i think like a bunch of really funny and hilarious like really interesting and beautiful things made too right you know what i'm saying like this lets somebody like make a whole movie basically by themselves maybe right and there's a bunch of people who are super funny who like would never get into hollywood or something right yeah so it's like okay you never get to see their movie and now like we could see their movie that's cool i'm excited for that part there's just lot of other parts that are less exciting i like that okay you know that really positive note that that little ending part that was a really positive note i like that i don't i'm surprised that we that i mean i keep i i i am partially surprised that we're here already but i'm it also feels like it's not that shocking yet i'm very curious what like if there will be an iteration that's actually going to be like big in a changing way cuz you know all the things that have been released up to date they're very cool but none of them feel like they change my day-to-day life you know like co-pilot incredibly convenient if you make youtube videos this this changes how i can get b-roll if i get access to this but it it doesn't change you know it doesn't it doesn't actually change my life in any fundamental way i used to have to go and buy for $500 a b-roll package now i'm going to have to go spend $500 generating a more precise b roll package yeah and then yelling at it and then like tweeting about how like man i used to be able to get it to like generate a funny cloud guy and now like i have to tell it eight times to generate the funny cloud guy and don't respond with json you know or something like yeah and not only that but like when when co-pilot or more more importantly when chad gpt came out i i kind i talked about this earlier but there was this like amazement factor that i was kind of already built into me like i haven't seen something this good yet and so when i'm watching it and it's going i'm like i i think i'm kind of like tricking myself to how cool it is and then now that i've been using it for a while i feel like it's gone dramatically downhill but i actually don't think it's gone dramatically downhill i just think my expectations have gone up they've risen with the times and it's actually not as good as my initial you know perspective you're not on the honeymoon with it anymore right you're like oh it actually does bother me that chat gpt does this i can't just look over this fact yeah yeah yeah and because when when i first did i was like make a dice game it's like here's a dice game like wow that's mostly a dice game you know like i'm just like shocked that it worked and now i'm just like dude just generate me the python code already yes yeah i i do wonder what this will do towards so like the main ways that i could see this potentially changing like day-to-day life is we already talked about like the disinformation i like our our day-to-day lives won't be affected by the fact that this can generate porn probably and people will find out ways to do that cuz that's not our jam but but i think maybe it will change quite a bit of the way that people generate like online content so like maybe there will be like a bunch of really interesting like tv like tv style shows right or like music video right or something like before versus trump ai arguing will now just get better no i was thinking more like a guy who has an idea for a show right for like a tv show is he can never get enough funding to like make the show maybe it's like you know super niche or like right like maybe you'll be able to find like really niche like content that will be really funny for you but that would never get funded because like it's not going to attract the same people that laugh at the big bang theory jokes right and so like you know so i don't know so it's possible i think that that could like i don't know i don't really like saying democratize blah blah blah because there's no democracy about it but like you know spread the ability of people to be able to make like a bunch of those like kinds of content that could be really fun yeah yeah on people are saying something that that that guy def not forklift certified dude i know if you weren't watching that fork certified guy he dude it's it it was bothering me how many weird things were going on with oh dang it hold on you just got to look at it cuz it was yeah it was more wrong it was more wrong than the rest i've seen it's in the last one it's to the left of the yeah here it is right here so the guy starts off on what appears to be the right side of the forklift right here he turns the corner splits into two people just runs over that guy turns his car and craps wild whatever's going on there now he's on the left hand side oh man to be fair maybe like they make forklifts like that we have things that can turn a prompt into a video now so maybe it's like a maybe it is what it is i do i'm also interested to see if we experience the same problem of like people generating tons of code with co-pilot and then like it's training on more videos like are we going to experience this generating more ai artifacts as time goes on i don't know we'll have to see i we can't get we can't get access yet so yeah we can't get access this is unaccessible sam we know you're watching you i know you watched all our last videos about the drama that's why you came back weo for you sam we were roo for that's why you came back thought you the devil we're not sure which one there was like 50/50 like like he's going to save the world or he's the antichrist we're still like undecided but either way if you want to give us access we'd love it we could make another video yeah we would we'd make another video tj and i would make a little video for you yeah true superhero you'd be the superhero oh we could make a featurelength movie of zack snider vers with sam alman as superman but good damn tj you just hit so many people with that one swing so so many things just went wrong with that one phrase the name is the hollywood aen bam
