- you know what time
it is, it's time for me to spend way too much money on wish and then regret my
decisions almost instantly. - [jared] are we surprised by that? i, i thought that was expected. - wish select, designed with you in mind. adsorb firmly stable charging, six suction cups to avoid bad contact. are you really good to suction cup a wireless charger to
the back of your phone? i absolutely love it. it's genius. a wish select t-shirt,
that says wish on it. i can be a true wish shill for only $3. - [jared] maybe now
they'll finally sponsor us. - i'm pretty sure the people at wish have seen these videos, we're never getting sponsored by wish ever. wait, wait, wait. time out. new rtx 3070, i7-11800h. 165 hertz display, 16 inch 2.5k, 16:10, wifi 6, windows 10 pro
notebook computer laptops. jared, what would you spend
on a laptop of that power? - [jared] well, that's gotta be like 1500. - [austin] knock zero off that price. 169,99! - [jared] oh, what!? can i make that my new daily driver? it's a great deal. - we may have just found a hidden gem. wish may have finally come up
for us, after all these years or i might still be in denial. you ever wanted to grow
some chest hair jared? cause boy, true man, for
$2.73 has got your back. or got you front. what does that dinosaur doing to the other dinosaur right now? oh god! is that how the dinosaurs
became extinct? dad, i have so many questions! do you think $109 refurbished one, xbox one elite controller is legit? - [jared] ooh, that actually might be. - that's cheaper than gamestop
sells that for, i bet. - [jared] (laughs) i can almost guarantee it's cheaper than gamestop sells it for. - what about a $69 pixel? pixel three, no less. one of the better pixels. i mean, it says poor condition, but how bad could it really be? so, we have a lot of items, from our good friends over at wish. so now, it is a matter of, let's see what actually shows up in one to two months when
things actually arrive. worst case, we've wasted $770 on wish. best case, we've
discovered a $2,000 laptop and all kinds of fun goodies. welcome back to wishtery tech, a mere two and a half weeks later. wish shipping, getting
better and better every day. - [matt] that might be the fastest that we've ever gotten stuff from wish. - i got that one. i'm proud of that. (laughs) beautiful way to start,
with our wish shirt. - [ken] wait. - [austin] oh, you weren't here
when we were ordering this? you guys know, oh! - [ken and matt] no, neither of us were. - you guys don't, see jared, we're the only ones who
know what's actually coming on this episode of wishtery tech. how much was the wish select t-shirt? - [matt] $2,84, with $2 shipping. - [ken] that's actually
really good for a t-shirt. - i mean, is it a giant
walking ad for wish? yes! is this a thumbnail gonna use for every single wishtery
tech for the rest of time? yes! - [ken] wait, so it didn't cost $4. it actually cost negative
$7,000 per video. - that's a very specific number, but sure. we'll go with that. it's not $7,000 per video,
i'll tell you that. (laughs) (inhaling) - [ken] which country does it smell like? - (exhales) gotta go for
round two on that one. - [ken] wait don't. wait. there are kids watching. - all right. so now that i have been
properly outfitted, with a blue and red
colorway for my wardrobe. - [matt] that shirt's a little short. - the cut's a little
different, but it's fine. i've gotta actually say, real talk, $5 shirt, very high quality. i would say it's above
the quality i've gotten, from some like $20 shirts from youtubers. (screaming) - [voiceover] shots fired! shots fired! okay. thank you for another shirt, ken. i'm not gonna put another shirt on, right after i put my wish shirt on. - [matt] you ordered these. - you think i'm, i just put this on. i'm not gonna take it off again. give me a moment, friends. this shirt was actually something that was sent to me by a
wishtery tech viewer on twitter. i have never insta-purchased
an item faster in my life. presenting. (all laugh) - [ken] the self-report. [music] i love you. you love me. [music] [music] commit tax fraud it's a felony. [music] - [matt] this is how you get canceled. - barney told me it was okay, matt. - [matt] what's so upsetting to me, is this is one of the
most expensive things that we've ever bought on wish. - this actually was a lot of money. - [matt] at $28. (all laugh) - [austin] what's up? the walmart.com bundle, for tom clancy's rainbow 6
siege and the division 2. why'd i buy this again? - [matt] you, we weren't here! i'll be honest with you, if this is, i mean, these are real, this is not a bad bundle. $8.64. - you got rainbow 6 siege,
the xbox greatest hits edition and the division 2. i mean, i'll crack these
open but these seem legit. - [matt] they're both selling for $10 each. - so i could resell these for $10 each. are you trying to tell me
i could commit tax fraud- i mean, make money on selling items? - [ken] wait! let's sell
'em back to gamestop. let's sell to gamestop. to commit tax fraud. - that was heavy. that was, wow. all right. - [ken] (gasps) oh, i know what that is! i recognize that shape anywhere. - an elite series 2
controller without the box. so slightly weird. i mean, we've got the carrying case. - [ken] wait, that looks
kind of real though. - how much was this? cause this i believe, was
a used controller, correct? - [matt] it was refurbished. - [austin] refurbished. - [matt] and it was
$109, with free shipping. that's not bad for re, if it's authentically
refurbished, it's not bad. - because this new is about'0. and that looks like an elite series 2. so yeah, definitely used. the telltale sign is you got
finger dust on the stick. - [ken] but they're replaceable
so that doesn't matter. - i don't think, i believe
that this has been refurbished. i think this is just used. - [all together] no, no, no! - ken, smell it. - [matt] which page of
the handbook do you want? - i'm pretty sure that's illegal dude. - [matt] josh, if you could
go ahead and clip this out, so we have something to show the lawyers. that'd be fantastic. - [austin] the price is nebulous, but this is without a
doubt, a real controller. - [ken] it's a good modding base. - sure. are you about to pitch me a denki video, where you mod an xbox series elite. - [ken] wow. it's almost
like i want that now. - wow. is this a giant elaborate excuse to subscribe to ken's
brand new channel, denki. where you'll find high
quality tech content that i stopped making in 2017? - [matt] wait, shockingly good videos. - [ken] shocking, yes.

- [austin] wow. - edit team, can you please
put what the actual darkness ablaze pack looks like beside this? ken forgot how to focus the camera. isn't that unfortunate. - [matt] you forgot
how to focus on videos. - okay. (all laugh) - if edit team could put an actual photo of what the real darkness
ablaze pack looks like, you'll see, it's just
different colored, right? - [ken] wow. the only
thing that ablaze right now is your whole existence, cause matt just flamed the [censored] outta you. - [matt] roasted you
more than an apartment. (all laugh hysterically) - look, i dislike
all of you. all of you. - if i'm gonna get fired,
i'm gonna get fired. - these are just ridiculously fake. like, i'll show you like- - [matt] i have a
non-holographic full art. - one day, i'm gonna
end up with some sweet, great deals on wish.com. - [ken] you know what i say? - [ken] (beep) this. welcome to (beep) extreme. so, there's really nothing for it. how much was my (beep) extreme? - [matt] $20. - oh wow. wow! - [matt] that's aggressive looking. - would you like to
smell my (beep) extreme? - [ken] my god. - you don't spray it
like lysols, you know, you know how to do it. - [matt] you do it on your wrist. - [ken] yeah. - [jared] then you, yeah, then you. - oh, i actually, you know what? - [matt] does it smell like ocean spray, with a hint of woodsy? - [ken] this is the one thing
that's the most appropriate for him to smell. - smell it. - i mean. i'm glad it smells like
macy's in here now. - it's- (laughs) look, i'm just gonna just get
this outta the way real quick. so there's- - [ken] no, no, no. nope. - all right. this is, aircraft. - [ken] cool, you bought a plane. - okay, that's actually
slightly smaller than a 747. this is a drone. i mean, you know what? it doesn't seem terrible. it's kind of designed a little bit, like a little dji or something,
except it is very tiny. how much was this? - [matt] this was, with shipping, $33. - oh that's, 30 bucks. man, how could you possibly go wrong? (all scream) so that, was slightly more dramatic than i thought it was going to be. (drone whizzing) - oh! oh! oh! - so it only goes forward. so the problem that this drone has is, the stick for lift also moves it forward. - there's a good bounce on that one. so this is a mega ultra wide
screen fake apple watch. i think this is gonna be
dumb, but let's find out. oh! i forgot about this! you can put ear buds inside your watch. nevermind, i remember
why i bought this again. i mean, it actually,
honestly the difference. that's pretty close. - [ken] well, well,
yeah, one is just thinner. but all these fake bands
are usually pretty thin. - take a look at my
cutting edge new watch. not only, can i use it as a watch, but i also can turn on training mode, check my steps, my sleep. i mean, this thing's pretty incredible. i am at zero beats per minute right now, which seems less than ideal. headphones, straight out
the side out of the watch. i mean, keep in mind that
these are headphones built into a $50 smart watch
and they're also tiny, so they sound very tinny. if i was just leaving one of these in, to like watch a video or something, while i'm like on my
lunch break or something, this seems far better than $50. it's not good, and i still don't really recommend it, but wish didn't scam us on this. we're actually, we're coming
out ahead on wish, right now. and that's something i don't think i've ever been able to say. oh. oh, i remember this. okay. so, we bought a lot of
weird things on wish before, including counterfeit phones. however, this, is a google pixel 3. i will say, that i love
the google pixel 3. this was one of my fav- ooh. matt, what was the quality
that they described, exactly? - [matt] so, you, okay. you actually bought one
that was in quote, unquote, poor condition. - there's a, a little crack on the screen and a big like, bit of grossness. but, the screen works, although
it's definitely burned in. wow! can you see how burned in this screen is? it's very, very bright. how much did i pay for my poor
condition google pixel 3? - [matt] $67. - nice. android 12. how many $60 phones can
download android 12? i'm happy with this decision. i'm calling right now. this, is the greatest episode
of wishtery tech ever, because we finally beat the man. we have acquired the bag friends. we, are the wishtery tech masters. all these years of pain,
suffering, scams, it's over. the tyranny has begun. i mean ended. 
- [ken] where's your laptop? - what? - [matt] yeah, i'm looking
at the order here. it seems we are missing a laptop. we have a tracking number. it was left at the leasing office. we don't have a leasing office. and you paid $260, for an rtx 3070, i7 11th gen. that's all i can see on it, because if i click on the product again. oops. doesn't find this listing. - [ken] to be fair, you
expected a 3070 laptop, for 200 something dollars. you played yourself,
yourself, yourself, yourself.
