this little box is part of a billion dollar network no one uses it's called a helium miner and i was gifted it by a friend who told me that it would pay me every day just to sit on a shelf how radio waves magical thinking i honestly didn't care it was free for me because it was a gift i'm heavily in debt from the 10 million studio obviously and so i had nothing to lose and fast forward four months we finally have the results and they aren't great i've made 22 dollars with this little thing which is a 20th of the cost of the actual machine it retails for about four hundred dollars which means if i had paid for it i'd break even about six years but even worse the daily rewards of the helium miner have been falling fast partly because of the discovery that most of the revenue of this network come from other miners buying more miners and finally it looks like it's collapsing with users complaining very loudly on reddit and things just look really bad and today i want to tell the story of how that happened how this little company helium grew a billion dollar organization building a network no one uses helium was a company that originally started without the idea for a crypto coin it was first a company trying to help build the internet of things you guys have all heard that buzzword before right internet of things or iot it's basically the trend of putting bluetooth in your toothbrush radio sockets in your socks basically connecting everything with the internet even things you wouldn't expect like this ring on my finger right here right now it's selling health data to some overpaid pharma rep as we speak that's iot and the point is if you're going to connect everything to the internet these iot devices which are much smaller usually have different needs than something like i don't know your phone you don't need to transmit large amounts of data you're dealing with tiny batteries and you need these devices to work over long distances which is why helium uses a special frequency range called lorawan also known by its much catchier name long5 and you don't need to fully understand longfi to just know that helium set out to kind of catch this wave of internet of thing devices but as they set out to build this network there was a big problem because how can you afford to build a huge network without people paying for it first and on the other hand how do you get people to pay for you to build a network without building it first it's a classic chicken or egg problem and helium struggled with this until they found out about crypto and devised a way to do both at the same time they did this by creating a crypto token called helium network token or hnt it works in two ways on the one hand it rewards people who set up hot spots that's on the supply side and on the other hand if you want to use the network you buy h t and spend it on the demand side for data credits which is simply a tiny packet of data and the idea was early adopters who set up little hot spots like this would make lots of agent t which in the future would be valuable as more and more people needed to buy these data credits it all sounds pretty good right so what's the catch well for a long time this really was the rocket fuel that propelled the helium network and it was pointed to as a real use case of crypto i'm sure you've heard before like what do we actually use crypto for well oftentimes people would point to helium network as a great example of real-world use cases of crypto because a single crypto coin was bootstrapping an entire wireless network no small feed and for a while things were going great hundreds of thousands of regular people were setting up and spreading the word of wireless hot spots and of course passive income this is the best way to make passive income passive income passive income and i can't stress enough how much of the adoption of these helium miners were due to thoughts about getting rich and passive income initially payouts were eye-watering it was a lot of money some miners were making hundreds of dollars if not a thousand dollars a month just from one miner and if you consider that each of these cost about four hundred dollars it wasn't hard to see why many people quickly ordered more and then more because they're literally little money printing machines and demand for these machines grew so fast that it actually became impossible to order them for a while they were just out of stock people even joined waitlists that were over six months long for these things but eventually these supply issues were able to be worked out and the supply of these little guys exploded just in the year of 2021 they started the year with 14 000 of these hot spots deployed and they grew that to 450 000 in one year that's over 3 000 hotspots a day right now they have 900 000 hot spots which by anyone's standard is impressive however behind the scenes trouble was brewing the first sign of trouble is when helium started to reach a saturation point in the market for hot spots basically helium operates on a grid system where you're incentivized to provide coverage in high usage areas but if you have too many people around you it hurts your profits so in an area like this it really isn't profitable this made it so that more and more people were competing for increasingly smaller shares of profit as the helium network exploded and that might have been okay if on the demand side helium had been seeing increasing adoption you know selling the actual product of connecting the internet of things but unfortunately that's not what was happening by looking at the data that the helium network themselves provide we see absolutely abysmal rates of adoption remember that in 2021 the number of hotspots went absolutely parabolic as you can see here and one would hope that usage would follow but looking at the data credits used we see a different story now i'm going to have to explain what this chart means but basically this is the entire revenue of the network the data credit usage but not every part of this chart represents actual demand for helium because there are several ways you would use data credits and helium for example it costs 10 in data credits for example just to set up one of these mining hotspots but that isn't actually someone connecting an internet of things device and the same is true if you want to change the location of this device it costs another 10 you can also be charged fees for using the network and there are all these proofs about like if your hotspot is where you say it is but none of this is actually the system doing what it's designed to do which is connect these devices instead that category of data credit usage belongs to the data transfer category this you can see in yellow and if we take a close look at this chart again you could hardly see the actual usage of the network in comparison with all the insane amounts of data credits burned for everything else this means a few things actual demand for this network is almost non-existent literally in june of this year it was reported that the actual demand revenue for helium was only 6 500. this was reported by the generalist and it's hardly enough money to justify a 1 billion valuation now the ceo of helium amir haleem responded to these accusations arguing that while the numbers are true they weren't fair because the total revenue of the network is insanely high 54 million dollars over its lifetime but i think he's confusing things here because we all know that the helium network is being used a lot the problem is who's using it this whole adoption scenario by real people we've been promised isn't happening instead it's all the miners who are using the network of other miners for example in the last 30 days you could argue helium made 1.8 million dollars in network fees but the actual demand side of these fees was only 2 000 meaning 0.1 of the network revenue is from actual internet of things usage which is just horrible and understanding this starts to make sense of why miners were actually making so much money early on it wasn't because people were actually using the network it's because other miners were onboarding thousands of new hotspots a day and paying tons of fees it was sort of like a ponzi like system where old investors were paid from new investors and once the market got saturated it was all doomed to fall apart and many of the investors who got involved for those passive income dreams are now left with expensive plastic boxes that may never pay off that's of course assuming this long fight dream doesn't work out because some optimists will argue that the reason long fight hasn't been adopted yet is because no one was building products for long five when it wasn't a thing now that it's a thing people are gonna build the products and adoption's gonna grow in the next five years that's their argument but i have to say i'm a bit skeptical given the unit economics of helium because think about it on the one hand their pitch is that their data is way cheaper 360 times cheaper according to their ceo on the other hand the amount of data helium wants to sell you is by design tiny because of the frequency band so you're selling a tiny product and you're selling it 360 times cheaper how do you become profitable with that you have to be servicing absolutely massive numbers of devices and i'm just not convinced that's going to happen because i already own plenty of internet of things devices and most of them just use bluetooth or 2.4 gigahertz wi-fi i don't need long-fi and i guess this all begs the question how if this data was sort of always public did we miss this for so long how did helium manage to convince so many people that they were on the cusp of being successful well it's on this front that it turns out the helium team may have been misleading customers because for a long time helium advocates would point to key partnerships as a sign of real-world use right around the corner they advertised two really important companies in particular lime and salesforce both recognizable and large brands however it was recently reported to mashable that these partnerships weren't really real at all the scooter company lime says they only tested the product three years ago and part of the condition was that they couldn't use their name for promotional material because it wasn't a real partnership it was like a trial and according to the verge salesforce also wasn't in a real partnership with helium they say quote helium is not a sales force partner and that they don't use the technology so oops now once again i have to tell you that helium responded to this and said it's all a misunderstanding and they just made a mistake but on this front i'm not going to give them the benefit of the doubt i think it's far too convenient that they were able to use these large brands to make themselves look good and i ultimately i just think they're upset they got caught now with that you're sort of caught up to speed with helium as of now and the question of course is now what they're obviously in trouble they have a huge network with hardly any real customers but they do have a lot of loyal miners so what's next for them they're pivoting they want to move into another network category with potentially more adoption that is 5g and like last time they want this to be rolled out by their faithful investors who built their first big network the catch of course is that you can't use your old device for 5g you need to buy a new device and it's much more expensive like five times more expensive and from here it kind of gets complicated they set up some sub-dials they created a new token to represent this but even so it seems like there are people willing to go along with this ride too because already 2 000 5g hotspots have been set up in 47 states it's pretty shocking given how bad their rewards are right now that people are just dumping more money into their new project but either way i think more than anything this shows how good crypto is at getting buyers before demonstrating real demand for a product it shows how people ignore actual fundamental value when faced with the enticing opportunity of passive income and it also shows how much early adopters just want to see those 100x gains that may or may not come we may never know for years whether helium's plan to bootstrap a wireless network from scratch will have worked but what we do know is they certainly aren't the ones who paid for it and to be fair neither am i didn't pay for this thing so in a way i'm not too upset i'll probably go plug it back in and make my pennies until either i'm a millionaire or it stops being worth the electricity that it uses but for those of you thinking of jumping in investing in helium and these crypto schemes that are going to change the world this is a really cautionary tale just because you build it doesn't necessarily mean customers will come
