i have challenged pro gaming youtuber vikkstar to a gaming face-off there's a catch i told him i'm so confident that i'm gonna win that i'm going to build a setup that is a fraction of the price of your setup and still take your okay i like it i'm always up for a challenge he also just so happens to have one of the most expensive gaming setups money can buy so in order for me to even stand a chance i have to make a tiny bit of money in comparison go a really really long way okay so let's get the peripherals out the way so at least we know how much we have left for the gaming pc itself i mean addison's pretty good it's 20 for a decent looking backlit keyboard wait mechanical for 15 it's definitely worth spending a little bit more than the base price if i can make sure i avoid ghosting which is where with cheap keyboards by pressing one key you accidentally trigger some of the others around it you know what i'm 100 sure these people have just imported it from china so see how much cheaper we can get it if we just go direct from source ten dollars to have pretty short key travel which is good for responsiveness anti-ghosting compact layout backlighting so i can show up in style waterproof thing could come in handy depending on how the game goes nice let's get this so while we're here we've got to find what mouse we're doing as well okay so what do i want i want something that's wired so it's got as little latency as possible something that's comfortable so that i can perform optimally and i guess something that looks cool too because don't want big to laugh at me i don't know what a 6d key dazzle is but victor won't see it coming i think this is the one 299. we are smashing it right now so i've got to go for a desk probably doesn't make sense to import that from china oh wow these are so expensive the amazon's better it's like 90 pounds minimum i need to save every penny for that pc if i actually want to run the game properly i've got to get a monitor as well all within 500 when all else fails ikea yes the price difference is incredible i guess that's the beauty of it coming unassembled it'll save like three quarters of the shipping cost which you know what would be really funny is after we beat vicstar at this game we asked him how much he thinks the overall setup cost watch how wrong he's gonna be i think what's gonna make a really big difference is if i can get one of those extra large mouse buttons still glide my mouse around these are really cheap it's gonna massively reduce the amount of friction between our mouse and our table and 500 really is not a lot to cover everything facebook marketplace this is so cheap the 60 pound i can get a curved 2k monitor what if i've just discovered a gold mine i don't understand these descriptions illustrator says curved monitor good condition 40 each have two for which curve monitor i think i want to take a gamble 40 pound is a safe amount of money and this looks like a really good screen to message the seller i've never used this site before but this is quite exciting if that works out it means we're still in the first hundred dollars of our budget which actually gives us a fair bit to get a decent gaming pc so i said gaming pc and every initially suggested option is already above our entire budget wow that's cool okay i should stop looking at that just had an idea if i look up the recommended specs for the halo game that we'll be playing they'll give me a framework for the kind of pc spec i'm looking for that the game will have been designed to work with quite a high spec the graphics card on its own is two to three hundred pounds facebook marketplace is my last hope maybe if i limit my price to around 400 i can just see what the absolute best i can get is this is very very close ryzen 5 2600 it's got an rtx 2060 super basically the same as the 2070 fits within our budget just about the processor is very slightly weaker but we can make this work so if that goes to plan we have a tiny bit of spare budget right now and i would like to spend this on rgb if you've seen vic's tour of his studio space he has the most ridiculous setup there's rgb lights everywhere and i do not want to be embarrassed a rhythm sound bar i mean vic can have his party with his fancy leds i'll be having a great time knowing that i spent 66 cents to get this let's get two of these oh vic also has a starry sky ceiling in his gaming setup because vic star he will no longer shine the brightest i want to see if i can outdo him i think if i use these in a subtle way it'll be tasteful we could just get a massive like led strip and do the classic line it around the edges of the desk tech youtuber 101 five meters of this is a dollar oh sugar i completely forgot to get a chair i can't get an office chair that's for sure so the 17 pound i could get a stall that kind of matches my setup i think that's what we have to go for better than a cardboard box that's for sure right that's everything bought see what shows up everything's arrived but we only have two days till i face off with vic that's the hidden cost of going with facebook marketplace but at the same time i am struggling to believe that this stuff is actually real and here like this mouse was 2.99. kind of feels like instagram versus reality bro did you literally just hear mouse and come running in i remember the led strip was shockingly shockingly cheap i really really hope these work because just a little bit of led it doesn't matter how cheap it is it makes such a difference to the atmosphere in a setup this was one dollar and we've got 40 different lighting modes 2.5 cents per mode hmm oh this is a little more impressive than the mouse you can tell they painted this with a very very quick spray and not gone over again oh this is cool vic is gonna like this maybe if he wins i'll let him keep it so this is our three dollar extra extra large mouse pad this is pretty nice it's really grippy on the back and it might even make this mouse work on the front oh yes this is probably one of the most exciting parts of this i mean they feel light and fairly cheap it actually works look at this it really makes you realize how much of a ridiculous markup there is on led gadgets in most western countries i think vic is going to be very jealous this is actually quite a fun one it's got our desk ikea has really kind of cornered the market on low-cost furniture nothing was even close to this price online wait a second dave they've given us two one for vic you really just can't tell from this finish that the whole thing was like 30 pounds that's a beauty can't speak for how comfortable this is going to be i mean it's not dream gamer setup vibes but to be honest you get a pc like that i'm happy to save on the stall did we go so low budget that we only got one side to our case i'm kidding this is actually quite a solid feeling almost like a test bed kind of case i even bundled in a free stain on the back yeah boy it's got a great power supply it's got an rtx 2060 super it's got 32 gigs of i think it's led ram this should not be 375 pounds is this like stolen goods if vic loses he can lick the stain you know when i saw there was a monitor for 40 pounds i thought it was going to be like this big this must be 30 plus inches this is part of the same robbery but no stains so maybe not i'm putting a lot of trust in this equipment let's hope it actually pulls through on the day [music] not one of the more comfortable walks okay [music] can you carry your pc on your back it's like thick with five c's so this is a rtx 49t yeah 24 core until core i9 you've actually got really angry with me because they're like you've got a graphics card that has real lighting in it and you have yeah you can have a clear side panel so you've had dummy oh wait there is no that's that's different i've never seen that it's different it's multifunctional but the time had come to finally piece this 500 rig together i'm just setting up my super budget rig right next to his and i'm having some slight stability problems should we tell vic this is immersive mode we'll do leds all the way around this is where you feel the fact that the led strip is a dollar i mean technically they weren't wrong about it being five meters but they didn't specify how many led bulbs you actually get for that we've just basically taken like a one meter strip and stretched them out further led strip is up so look i think it's got like a disco mode oh yeah oh yeah they're infrequent but they're quite bright i'm really curious about this light i managed to get it at the last minute for an extra 20 pounds this is what's going to be lighting my face while we're recording i'm not gonna lie i think ours looks cooler than his taking home that win very very shortly oh no look laughs how did that happen quite excited to see how much of a bargain we got with the quality of this monitor this is becoming quite an imposing setup the mouse i should probably flank the monitor on either side with one of these leds he's coming up in two minutes he's got to get these stars on okay stick them around our table all right this is it now that our setup is built it's time for vic to rate it so basically yeah all right what i want to do is i want to show you what i've done here and i'm quite proud of myself because i've done it on a slim budget we'll put it that way you even put the stars on for a vic star oh you knew leds okay i'm quite impressed actually there's a lot of decor okay this is better than setups i've used career i guess actually the question is if you have a little fiddle what do you think is the total price we've paid for everything in this setup what is this like a transformer it's like optimus mouse yes that's what it is you can have a fiddle with the keys it's not it's not my favorite keyboard this is included this is included 20 quid you wanted to maybe a hundred i'm really really bad at this kind of stuff by the way as a gaming youtuber people assume that i know tech you're the one that knows tech i don't barely know what's even in my own computer i sometimes get relatives they'll come and they'll be like my computer stopped working you do youtube fix it but you probably could fix it i can't i can't do anything so i don't know maybe maybe like yeah okay 700 800 900. i want to say like maybe like between 800 and 900 pounds for the total ring oh the desk maybe an extra like 50. the chair this is this is this is sturdy i still think yeah maybe around 850 800 would be my guess so the answer is 495. oh wow i guess actually because if you can't you can't downgrade yes i'm thinking i'm like where did i go okay wrong if you bought this as a pre-built the premium would probably bring it up to like about six seven hundred it was pre-built it was pre-built oh wow okay that is impressive yeah i've got a deal on that surely so basically we facebook marketplaced it ah and it came with a nice little smudge on the back which we've decided the loser of our face-off is gonna lick oh that yeah that is an unappetizing looking smile yes that's concerning maybe that's why the price was yeah what i thought we could do is just compare it quickly to yours because i have not seen your setup fully on should we start with the room probably okay this is not how the room is intended so look this is like daytime this is like civilian mode what are you about to do so if we did you say civilian mode yeah civilians yeah and then you close the blinds and reveal the true vic star yeah here we go right yeah you have any favorite colors you know i'll let you i'll let you two colors for our okay so one's the top one's the bottom this is touch sensitive yeah so you can go whatever you want tell you what that's right you can pick mine oh nice okay you know i know i like this i like this i almost feel like this might distract you because it's changing colors so much and you're gonna keep it like that that's the one you know that is the room light we've got the starlets is this your idea yeah so vic starr made sense to have stars on the ceiling yeah i mean my setup is actually as far as like the gamers and youtubers go it's very very simplistic let's say that again yeah no this is if you think about what's on the desk a lot of gamers they're gonna have one of these future i've got a very very basic stream deck yeah just a few buttons i've got my lights on there let's see if this there we go so i've got my my that's absolutely not that dissimilar in brightness to ours to be fair these do go brighter they're on 20 now oh they go up to 100 and then you're like oh my god okay so headphones so what do you use i i use bear dynamics so these are actually like music studio headphones but for the longest time we've all used these for gaming just because they're very comfortable and the nice thing because the they're open back so if you can see there's just material and it means you can hear yourself so when you're commentating it's quite nice yeah yeah yeah yeah would you say that having those would help you like locate enemies better is it that level of quality yeah and you actually like you use the sound to be able to like find enemies yeah especially like when i used to compete on call of duty keyboard mouse yeah i have this is a very heavy feel the weight of that that's probably like a kilogram yeah it's a guy called glasses oh funny that he's made for me as well so this is mechanical this is going to help you be more responsive and do you think that's going to make a tangible difference versus like what i've got here with these well you think it's just more the the feel like how satisfying it is i think really like i'm kind of only going to make a difference if you're competing in 0.1 percent is it shaving off like fractions of milliseconds milliseconds off let me just log into this oh oh wow wow you've been vic roles yeah have you ever been vicroad before i have yeah i have but now wait is this a prank on me you've been very cruel that's good that is good i have two other advantages in my arsenal one is i have a a hybrid melee gaming chair these are like the most expensive chairs you can get and they are very very comfortable standing desks oh god so everything goes up and down you look like comfortable enough like you could be there for hours yes you're like inserted into your desk yeah r i originally photography oh every time i look at this home screen that is true i might say it's actually a potentially disadvantage oh because if you think about your field of view you might right here and i've also got less space between me and my monitor yeah you've got probably twice as much rooms what is the monitor i said 240 yeah you've actually got different monitors you've got a main one and then samsung's on either side yeah basically this is the one that's important my gaming these ones they just to display information here's what they're gonna do deathmatch halo infinite first to ten kills okay after the first person gets three kills my team has prepared some extra challenges so i guess test the strengths and weaknesses of each of our setups okay what are the strengths of your your setup [music] okay i've got a bigger remote than you there you go and so with the trash talk out of the way time to whoop this guy once and for all nerves are starting to set in big star one two three versus mr boss mr boss gee the name of master chief is in your name exactly it's got to give you something oh he's got his headphones on all right i'm relying on speakers are you ready to play some halo info now halo infinite actually i need some sounds see i could headshot you and kill you right now i'm aiming at your head with a sniper so i could have one shot you but i didn't no because i'm doing the sound yeah you know i'll let you do yourself i'm gonna have to find me sucker i'm running indoors ah okay he knows see you've got a game knowledge you know when big star's got the sniper you know you don't want to be outside oh okay oh he's killing me oh no he's not me did you no scope me i won no i quit smoked you one shot to the house i have zero idea what this gun is but we're gonna find out none of that it's where it comes oh he's got he's got three kills three kills in fast succession yeah what happens eight third kill okay that means the fourth kill the rule for both of you is one chair no chair don't mind if i just [music] this is foreign does this monitor bend okay it does bend that's fine how comfortable are you right now yeah i'm pretty cozy it actually feels quite good i feel quite pretty quite fluid well what is that weapon i couldn't tell you [music] oh oh here he comes nope back again it's oh oh i've nearly got him he so nearly got me back again this is it he escaped found some cover got my shield back up my health back up so that's a long sucker i don't like guns i don't understand what they do come on come on come on guys can you set a new rule okay rule number four is that both of you have to use your maximum desk height my maximum death kai is not actually particularly convenient it does okay okay this is where i look like at the wall okay okay he's comfy i'm not so comfortable okay this is good this is good i feel in control how do you think this compares visually to other shooters out there this is the smoothest halo playing experience i think i've ever had i've never come a long way actually because i remember it just used to feel so clunky yeah 100 [music] there was no way that could be guaranteed to be a headshot but it was five now guys the next one is windowed game so you've got a half screen it both of you have in your i'm gonna make this as small as i possibly can just to see how we go there no we're gonna have to look at the vicro i have a tiny screen here now so you're gaming right now on a phone size it looks like do you remember the nintendo sp that had the little square screen the little the little flip up yeah it feels like i'm gaming on it yeah nintendo xp i can't even screen watch him now yeah that's one upside i've gotta kill you come on my time reload off i'm getting a bit closer oh god okay thank god got my first kill i probably deserve that the next rule is i'm gonna use speakers only oh headphones out i'll just do no sound the sky you know i've got a kill now right you can't you can't talk like that anymore and then to properly spice things up and to stop vix domination we swapped setups this is gonna be conclusive proof of does the setup matter yeah or is it the gamer you know what i actually i feel for you okay this is not enjoyable this feels incredible and i've got the mouse cord like catching so i can tell like one of the things that makes such a difference here is the contrast and the sharpness of your monitor colors are not great over here the frame rate is not great over here and it's kind of a combination of everything it's the fact that your pc is powerful enough to play it at its absolute best and the monitor can display at its best i've got the best control it's also proven that if you play a game on a higher frame rate when someone comes around the corner in front of you you'll see them foreign which would be this battle rifle that i have right here wow ah this is great how the tables pass oh [music] oh oh oh oh that was close but you got me you got me so we've not just swapped pcs we've also swapped scores which i desperately needed but that technically means i'm ahead right now so as long as i stay ahead always come from above you cheeky oh that was well played oh yeah that's even if your setup's not great you can use hover in the game use movement what's the biggest limiting factor of everything you're using there at my i just feel like there is there is delay between oh my god you and so the first shot i missed on that setup i think the first shot would have been a head shot i moved i went and shot and i accounted for the kind of delay on this setup but then once i realized that i'm like okay i just need to wait a little longer for my aim to actually catch up with the head of the playoffs like and then i hit the snipes it's crazy humbling because most people i play games with i'm the best person in those groups but wow oh it's different out here stay away from me oh he's overtaken me i've set up is in the lead there are a lot of people who want to get into pc gaming but they don't have enough to splurge they've got the kind of budget you would have for a console but they want a pc game and so i guess the question we're trying to answer is is 500 enough to build a pc setup or at that point are you actually better off just buying a ps5 i think nowadays pc is always the way to go you can access more games there you go yeah yeah no i was like a pc gaming is the way to go there's more games that you can play i think it's just it just gives you a lot more options yeah six six we're completely tired oh now it's seven six that was another little gaming thing right there so i identified that you had the rockets yep and the safest place you often time with rockets is on the high ground so i immediately moved to that right above you and now that you shot a few rockets and i got away with it i survived so if i was above you i could have shot down and exploded the ground around you you would be able to miss effectively ah still get me so it's just little things like that so even if you're on a budget set up if you know your game this is like actually really like interesting like it's fascinating it's a sniper you're much better off where you are now and i want to get you to come down really so i want you indoors what do you mean by that well that sounds that doesn't sound great here we go and now when you're on the lower ground wow i regret to inform you that on that point right here on this yep on this one kill to go set up so if you're enjoying this a sub to the channel would be a dog yeah he's easy done i'm not on this setup this won't be an easy go it'll be a dub why do they call it dub i guess it's another way of saying double you win it's final life i'm actually like even though i kind of knew this was gonna happen the reality of it is scaring me it is it is slowly but surely i still think i got this oh come on turn around turn around turn around turn around turn around come back here come back here no don't you dare shoot me in the air don't okay all right nine seven i'm still in this we're still in this one that would have been disrespectful yeah you know what i nearly pulled it off she's your next move wisely vic it's not game over till it's game over i love how i'm just unashamed at least been watching i'm not even trying to hide it i actually i miss this i miss couch co-op gaming there is something that we've lost in gaming that is that i grew up playing split screen with my brothers my cousins it was like it becomes much more real and yeah i just don't think anyone does it anymore it's just seeing the face of oh that's not how i want to go in seeing the face of someone you've just beaten up and i see you getting onto high ground again you're doing it yeah i'm gonna switch weapons oh yes did i did i catch you off guard dude you did you did i didn't i didn't know you were there oh he's closing down he's closing up all right it's rising okay oh oh he's cold no no he's got me nothing i have no awareness on this setup i just have no i just don't there's i'm now awareness of what's going on around just to be clear it's 99 right now it is an even square nine nine right now okay it is anyone's game on this next kill and you do have two power weapons right so oh my god this could go either way here i didn't think it would come to this we've slightly cheated but i did not think it would come to this i've got you real careful now desperately careful oh that could have been it i could have been it it could still be it oh okay [music] the rocket hit me directly the rocket hit me directly i would have been fine i think that was your last rocket as well so there we go that is what happens when you bite off equipment matters the boss chief defied all odds from beating the pro game and so maybe the setup does matter it did make a difference maybe i'd say it's 20 give me like 20 minutes and i'll be with you i'm just just bathing in the glass that was a good game wow there we go gg my friends oh my god right so this stain no no
