i thought i you know we could talk a little bit about digital twins today just because you know it's a sort of buzz word it's been about in the been been around the blocks a little while and you may have heard of it it and it's not entirely clear right immediately is it really a new relevant important thing should i care about it what is it even is this just a new cloud is it is it exactly is it just the new cloud is it new or is it just sort of old wine in new bottles as it were digital twins similar to simulation isn't it simulation is not not an unimportant thing in ind digal twins but it's perhaps not the first thing to think about i think i think it's worth perhaps looking a little bit and maybe i'll i'll try and sketch something out there and then we can sort of start talking a little bit about is it just simulation or what's what's going on there you know you ask seven experts on digital twins you'll get 10 different definitions of what a digital twin is i'm not even going to go there right i'm going to try and keep this really simple and and and and fairly high level and just sort of try and work out what the of the key components and the biggest two components really are that we have some sort of actual real world system which i'm going to put here it could be anything right it could be a bridge it could be a human it could be an organization it could be a car and then what we do in the digital twin setup is we create a digital representation of that real system we have a digital twin over here and a digital twin as the name implies is a digital artifact so it's not something in the real world it's something that lives in the computer and depending on you know what our real system is the digital twin might just live on a little desktop pc somewhere or it might you know require quite a significant sort of cloud style deployment somewhere depending on what we want to do right i mean there's some people who talk about building a digital twin of earth that's probably not going to fit on the desktop you'll probably need a fair amount of computer for that if it's you know a digital twin of my copty at home which i've built maybe for for the fun of it then maybe i've run that on a little arduino or something the important thing is it's connected to this real system it's connected in two ways we need sensors on our real system and the twin uses those to learn about the state of the real system so it learn it it tries to work out what's happening in the real system and it so that it can maintain a sort of continually upto-date representation of the real system that doesn't mean it's millisecond to millisecond accurate how accurate how often it keep gets data from those sensors depends really on what we're actually built the digitals trend for and we'll we'll get to that in a moment the other thing that a digital twin typically has to have is it has to have some way of affecting the behavior of the real system so it's so the real system has to provide some ways of changing it and the the digital twin will will use those effectors to make changes now if that is a digital twin say of a car engine then typically there little ecus etc little control devices built into the car engine that allow the computer systems of the digital twin to talk to those little control units and they can then make adjustments to the amount of gas that that that that that's that's being injected or the amount of air that's or you know whatever other aspect of of that system for other systems they these effectors may need to be more complicated things and again if we look at say for example organizations etc as our real systems then these effectors can become really complicated really quickly because they they really then maybe are about having a human decision maker in the lube somehow who then tries to actually make change in the organization based on something they've learned from the digital twin rather than something more direct like a sort of very close loop control system the reason why we built this really and that's the important thing is because we want to be able to provide additional services we've learned i think over the last 50 60 70 years or so that computers are really good to keeping track of things they're really good at helping us plan things and of doing what if analysis doing calculations and so on and so forth but of course they can only do that if there's something in the computer to manipulate and to track and to plan over etc right so they need a representation of things in the real world and if i have a a bridge like you know waterl bridge down the road and i want to maintain that effectively and the digital twin is about bringing enough information of the real real system into the computer building a model effectively of the real system in the computer so that the computer now is able to do analysis on top of that make plans provide the decision support or even make decisions and apply them back to the real system in some way and so that's where the value of of of the digital twin is you started out early on i think and you sort of said isn't that just simulation right and it's lots of things in a way right we could equally ask isn't that just modeling you could equally ask isn't that just ai isn't that just data science isn't that just controlled systems isn't that just scada right there's lots of these these things that are seemingly doing similar things or i would argue perhaps are doing part of this what seems to be different here is those connections you mentioned senses to send data so so so that's one i think that's one thing there are these these these differ although you know especially if you look at things like control systems they kind of have that as well right or or adaptive systems they they they kind of have that kind of notion as well there there's i think partly a difference in scale there's a difference in the capabilities that we typically would then put into these services in our digital twin if i go back at the sort of starting point of sort of is this just a buzzword is this really something new i guess the answer is yes and yes right so so yes of course it's a buzz word because all of the components and building blocks are fair we we know how to build simulations in fact we know how to build simulations that keep up with the real world we know how to do data science and data analysis and and we have a good idea nowadays of how to do a lot of ai stuff but what i think is new is that this is this makes an emphasis on bringing all these things together in an engineered system that represents something in the real world and allows us to manage that something and i think that to me is where the value is and that to me is also where the challenges are because it's not immediately obvious how do you engineer these kind of complex software systems at this scale how do you bring complex concepts and ideas like simulation like ai like data science data processing data cleaning like control systems together in a safe and robust and assur way that's manageable like the humans developing it that can live a very long time right if you imagine this is a digital twin of a bridge again that bridge is going to be there for hopefully you know tens hundreds of years it'd be great if the digital twin could kind of live alongside it for that period of time as well but actually also the bridge is going to change what we want off the bridge is going to change over that period of time the kinds of things that we therefore want to do with a digital twist are going to change over that period of time and arguably we don't know at this point how to build those sort of systems that are able to to manage a huge amount of data about something in the real world adaptively allow flexible decision support or decision making over that system over the long periods of time and do that in a world where everything around that that that real world system also has a digital twin that also has ideas of how to manage its part and ideally should work all of these guys should work together as well okay so what what's really happening in here right because i've sort of tried to make this this this point about how different disciplines are involved but but obviously have been a bit handwavy about this so maybe if we open up this sort of digital twin box here for a moment we can perhaps see that a little bit more so let's let's see what what happens in that box right in principle say if i draw sort of a big box here for our digital twin then what goes into this right so we've said it goes and says well which i'm going to draw this this way around it has various sensors and we've said eventually we'd like it to do things okay so it has to have those affectors but what happens between this and that okay and what happens between this and that is a number of steps right so we get this data in here so we've got lots of data and data are really just numbers okay those numbers they need cleaning up right because sensors are fallible they might not always get me data every time step i'm asking for them or the data might not be accurate in fact the real world might be outside of the range that the sensor can handle but also i've got multiple different sensors and i kind of need to stick them together right so there's lots of processing that needs to happen so i've got a sort of initial just sort of kind of data cleaning pre-processing i'm going to call it where the data is brought in and it's cleaned up to a standard where we can start doing stuff with it okay the next step we need to try and understand what that data means and so we're going to do what's called analysis right what we could call what we could call analysis and that that really turns data if you will into information into knowledge and information and what we do there is we may combine different different data sources of different sensors we may but also we we will perhaps already have some built-in knowledge in in in our in in our system here in our digital twin where we kind of know for example we have maybe if this again if this a digital twins say of of an aircraft engine we might have a model of the physics involved in aircraft so that that helps us make sense of the sensor data by by saying oh well if that temperature sensor is at that value then i can predict that over here in the in the engine something interesting is happening right and or i maybe or i would expect that sensor value to be in that kind of range and then if it isn't then that's an indication that maybe something has gone wrong right and that's only possible because i have some knowledge about the thing that i'm monitoring that allows me to expect certain things or that allows me to infer certain things from the data that i've collected okay so at the end of this really what i come out with is is a sort of upto-date model of the real system that's what comes out really of the analysis phase and and what's fed into this is the data that that that we collected from the sensors which is kept in some sort of knowledge model in my in my digital twin that's also fed into this analysis that allowed me to to make the analysis in the first place what i'm going to do with this model next is is i'm going to i've got look at it and i go okay maybe i just present it to somebody so i can see it and that's one of the possible services i might provide right is i present this to somebody and i say okay this is the state of your of your aircraft engine this is the state of your healthc care emergency department or this is the state of your car or your bridge etc great here you are right that's the first thing i can do some people call that a digital shadow because it doesn't actually do anything through the system it just shadows what the system does but i can do more potentially right i can do whatif analysis at this point i can do scenario planning etc and i would do that perhaps if the analysis here tells me how something is not quite right maybe the system doesn't quite run optimally or i've spotted a problem something unexpected in my data etc and so then i would do some form of what what what we call planning really i guess at that point right so for example what if analysis so what if analysis typically is if i make this change change to the system what might happen right and that's particularly interesting if if i have a digital twin say of a soci technical system so where there's people and technology involved say as say one example might be an emergency care department where i don't want to go in and just go oh right from today we're going to do everything differently that probably wouldn't be a good idea so instead what i can do is i can say okay i've got a really good model of how my emergency department works i've got a good understanding of that i've got data that comes in i've analyzed this i've got a reasonable representation i've got some knowledge about maybe the workflow processes etc now what if i made an adjustment to the work processes or what if i used a different tests from a different provider perhaps to check for a particular illness or or or something like that right what might the outcomes be like i can analyze that typically that's where simulation comes in i would analyze this to to sort of run it in difference in in different context right i might say okay if i do this what happens under normal conditions what happens if my emergency department sudden is overrun by patience what happens if half of my staff are ill and i can really try and explore that and obviously yes it's all in the digital in the virtual and it's all sort of at one remov from the real system and so i need to take that into account when assessing the results from that they might not be a totally accurate reflection of what happens in the real world but they will give me an indication of whether this is a sensible thing to try and do or not right equally if this is the is if this is say a digital twin of of an aircraft engine again i might want to say okay something's weirds going on based on my knowledge of the physics and and the data i have about the current state what if i injected more fuel or did that with that and i can sort of try out different scenarios there hopefully i then do a sort of more automated decision making that then might might actually directly affect the engine rather than just providing it as a decision support system right and so that's sort of what if analysis is is one of the things i i might do here i i could do forward planning i could sort of try and sort of you know do do problem solving of that sort of thing you know the m rover might might might do something like that where it finds itself in a situation that doesn't quite match the expectation from from from the mission planning and i and it kind of has to go right there's a stone here i can't go straight what do i do right and then it needs to work out where it goes again it needs the digital representation of itself and its environment to be able to do that and that's a digal twin and then eventually hopefully we get to some sort of decision making that allows us to say these are the changes that we're actually going to implement and again in the sort of digital twins where as they come from the manufacturing world and from the of of aircraft management and car management and so on world this we would want to be automated fully so we'd want to be able to go around this cycle fully and it just having a direct effect but there's nothing wrong with digital twins of say social technical systems etc where this decision making might actually be done by a human and then and then lead to changes in policy or changes in in in workflows or or changes in in the sourcing of equipment and and so on but again i think the key thing that you can see is that there's all kinds of different disciplines involved right we've seen all of this over here is all about data signs and and and data analysis we've seen seen here some aspects of sort of extracting knowledge from data which is very much the sort of realm of ai isn't it we've seen this sort of planning stage well we've seen this modeling stage knowledge models and these models in the m middle here which is really about knowing how to build models these could be knowledge graphs but they could also be more typical sort of engineering type models right and then we come to the planning stage which again could be some ai component that goes into there or it could be a simulation components and and and again needs that exper expertise and then decision making is a about understanding the results of that but also about knowing how to translate that into signals to be sent to the various effectors that we actually have available okay and so so all of these things have to come together to build to to to build a digital twin and they have to come together in a controll systematic way where ideally we're also able to afterwards say and we're okay with relying on that digital twin we've build it to a sufficient standard of quality where it's not scary but it's actually a useful thing no matter what the system is it's difficult to get it to be what am i trying to say not accurate but as complicated you know even your cup of tea i remember high school chemistry and brownie of motion you know how you decide to what granularity i think that's a really that's a really good question right and it's a really important question because i think one fallacy i should i'm always tempted to say in in in some sort of descriptions of what a digital twin is is is i think some people call it an an identical digital representation or or you know or like for like or or or things like that and of course that's not right that's that's fundamentally impossible but even if it were possible what why would we right if we if we if we just want something that's absolutely identical we have the real thing why not just use that right the point of the digital twin is a that we have now a virtual representation that we can manipulate more easily and analyze etc more easily but also that it's focused on the things that we're actually interested in okay so take the example of the bridge again you know water bridge i i'll be interested in in maintenance perhaps perhaps for that okay so i need to i need to probably know something about the materials from which it was constructed and i need to have some physics knowledge around that okay it's probably going to be useful to have a bit of data about its usage so you know how many people walk over it and may maybe even on average how much they weigh so i get a bit of a sense for the of load that it carries that way equally with the cars right how many cars and what how much you know how many buses versus how many suvs versus how many minis i think is probably a useful sort of information and i probably don't just want that as a sort of one number average but i probably want some sort of time serious data about that it may even be interesting to know a little bit about say the weather in particular might be i i might not care so much about how much it rains because i probably assume that maybe that isn't the biggest impact on on the decay but maybe i'd be interested in knowing whether there's any heavy storms that have affected the bridge because that may have more of an impact but again maybe i find out actually you know i'm not at all a civil engineer so so it it's entirely possible that waterl bridge you'd kind of go as a civil engineer kind of go it really doesn't matter how much it storm so so i don't care about that information and then you leave that out right everything you can leave out is a good thing but you don't have to manage it we've talked about water bridge right exists for i don't know how long it's been standing there and hopefully it's going to be standing there for another however many years so that dig wind needs to live alongside it over time i might learn i might say actually i thought the wind isn't important but it turns out especially with climate change winds sort of strong wind events have become more frequent and i've noticed that that does seem to have an effect on on the bridge so it probably would be a good idea to be able to to include that in my analysis now what you do right well one thing is easy right well comparatively easy you can say okay well i'm going to build an extension of my existing digital twin and from now on we're going to collect data about the weather and and we're going to include that in our analysis but then what about all the storms that water l bridge is seen before you did that should you care about those as well and if so how do you do that if you haven't collected that data because you didn't have the sensors so then you can bring in historical weather data and you can start building up you approximations but you've got to build additional complexity around that at that point right and so so i think one of the things that again the digital twin idea none of this is new in some ways right but what the digital twin idea brings is it to focuses in and says actually you know when we build these things these are all concerns that we have to somehow bring together and the line and make work together and and really think through as we engineer the system we've got to work out what's the minimum data that we need to collect both for our needs now and for meaningful future needs but we don't want to col too much we got to work out what granularity do we collect that data and when do we throw it away which really you can't keep all of that data about even even just about waterl bridge forever right i mean that's just very quickly that just becomes ridiculous so so there's lots of these sort of engineering questions that suddenly pop up just because the idea of digital twins is about taking all of data signs and simulation and ai bringing them together to focus on real world objects on a continuous and and sort of long-term adaptive basis and that's where where it becomes interesting i think various places it do have just hardcoded text but it puts in text that it copies out from the model right so it'll go into those into those don't need to worry about the difference too much if your loop or your function does the same thing repeatedly with only minor variations this will be very effective
