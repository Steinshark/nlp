hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about the dramatic impact simply changing your wheel size has on an electric car's range so right here we have some tires and they have about the exact same diameter as these tires right here the difference is these are on'-inch wheels and these are on 20-inch wheels and this actually does impact range and there's two unique things about electric cars that kind of help explain this first of all electric cars don't store that much energy on board second of all thankfully electric cars use what energy they do have extremely efficiently but what this means is they're very susceptible to small changes as far as how it impacts the vehicle's range so in this video we're going to be looking at you know what does going from an'-inch wheel to a 20-inch wheel how does that actually change the vehicle's range now we're going to need some sophisticated equipment in order to be able to figure this out so let's head to the whiteboard so there are several aspects of this that i am curious about so first we're going to look at the tire's width and see how does this tire width actually impact the vehicle's range we'll also look at rolling resistance and we'll compare a very inefficient tire versus a very efficient tire and see how that can impact range and then we will look at the wheels diameter and see how does the wheel diameter actually impact range of course going to those larger wheels means more aerodynamic losses and then finally we're going to do some math to show how we can actually save the planet and the good news it's pretty easy so it's all going to be great so to start off we are looking at tire width and we are analyzing this from an aerodynamic standpoint so if you're looking at the front of a car you could have a narrow tire like a 205 millimeter width or you could have a very wide tire like a 305 millimeter width and let's say your car has about six inches of ground clearance or 150 millimeters well you can multiply length by width there and you can get your area of that front of that tire that is exposed to the air rushing underneath the car and so we're simply going to use this to look at how this change in the frontal area of the car actually changes its range so you have that 150 by 205 that gives you 0.03 meters squared or you have 150 by 305 that gives you 0.045 meters squared so that's a difference of 0.015 meters squared per tire you of course have two tires on the front of the car so that gives you a difference in area of 0.03 meters squared now if we're looking at energy required in order to make all this happen we have energy equal to force times distance so we're analyzing this purely from an aerodynamic standpoint we're not going to be looking at the aerodynamic changes from changing that wheel with from a coefficient of drag standpoint we're not looking at changes in the tire's rolling resistance we're not looking at wheel weight or inertia we're just looking at that change in frontal area and so we can do the force of aerodynamic drag on the vehicle based on our specifications here we're going to be traveling at 75 miles per hour we've got a drag coefficient of 0.25 and a frontal area of 2.2 meters and so if we drive a distance of 200 miles or 320 kilometers well that is going to take us with these narrow tires right here about 33.6 kilowatt hours all right well what if we put some fat tires on up front well that will increase our frontal area by 0.03 meters squared so now instead of 2.2 we have 2.23 meters squared and that gives us a total amount of energy required in order to travel 200 miles of 34.1 kilowatt hours so a massive difference in the tires width i mean we're adding 50 percent more tire width there and yet we're only increasing the energy required to travel 200 miles by half of a kilowatt hour so a very small impact just looking at the aerodynamic impact on width frontal area alone on changing from a narrow tire to a fat tire all right so now let's look at rolling resistance so as you're driving along your tire is constantly deforming as it comes into contact with the ground and those tire deformations create heat which is energy lost and so you have to accommodate for that energy loss you have to hold that within your battery pack and so we can analyze you know how much energy do we need to compensate for that rolling resistance and so of course energy equals force times distance and our force in this case is equal to our coefficient of rolling resistance multiplied by our normal force in other words how much does our car weigh and so this coefficient of rolling resistance is very important and for tires it generally falls about .01 but you know for a very efficient super super good passenger tire basically as good as you can get you might see a coefficient of rolling resistance around 0.005 and for a high rolling resistance you might see something like 0.015 so this is going to be kind of our best case worst case range we're going to go with in this scenario and so we can look at energy equals force times distance in this case we're going to have an eighteen hundred kilogram car about four thousand pounds and we're going to drive over a distance of 320 kilometers or about 200 miles and see how much energy does the tire alone use up and so if we have our super eco-friendly tires here with their 0.005 coefficient of rolling resistance multiply that by'00 kilograms the mass of our vehicle times gravity times our distance traveled and you can convert these units into kilowatt hours you get a total energy required eight kilowatt hours now of course our worst case here we're looking at tires with three times that coefficient of rolling resistance resulting in three times the energy requirement in other words 24 kilowatt hours so a significant difference over the course of 200 miles 16 kilowatt hour difference so theoretically the right tire can save you quite a bit of energy while driving now realistically cars are coming with tires that have pretty good coefficients of rolling resistance so if you were to take a realistic example and say your car came with a tire with 8.01 and you were able to find an eco tire that had a coefficient of rolling resistance of say 0.008 well in that case you're only saving three kilowatt hours over the course of 200 miles in other words you're gaining about 10 miles of range and that's not meaningless i mean that certainly is something i think it's just not quite as big as if you look at you know best case versus worst case all right so finally what impact does changing your wheel diameter have on the range of the vehicle and this is where things get really interesting so if you look at a graph of a vehicle's speed versus the resistive forces going against that vehicle well you'd have something that looks kind of like this as you reach higher speeds of course you have a much higher resistive force and so what happens is automakers actually have to submit this curve to the epa as coast down data and so the way they submit that curve is they give the epa an a b and a c variable and so the resistant force acting on that vehicle is equal to a plus b times the vehicle's velocity plus c times the vehicle's velocity squared of course aerodynamic drag is a function of velocity squared and so that's what this variable here is accounting for and so you can use these curves to then build out your own based on the battery size of the vehicle curve looking at the vehicle's speed versus how far can it actually travel given that you know how much energy it has on board and so that's what i did for three different vehicles the model 3 performance the model s performance and the model x performance and the reason why i chose these three vehicles is because tesla actually submits a different curve for the various different wheel sizes on each of these so there's three different wheel options on the model 3 performance and tesla submits a curve for each of them so we can look at its range versus speed for each different wheel size now what i was curious about is let's say you're traveling at 75 miles per hour and the only thing you're changing are the wheels and tires you're changing from an' inch to 19 inch to a 20 inch and you're traveling at 75 miles per hour what's your theoretical range with each of these different options based on that curve that tesla submits and so you can do that math and you get with the' inch wheels a range of 301 miles with the 19 inch wheels a range of 284 miles and with the 20 inch wheels a range of 262 miles so look at that a two inch difference in the wheel diameter and we're getting a 40 mile range difference i mean this is about 15 difference in range and all we've done is change from' inch wheel and tire to 20 inch wheel and tire that is pretty incredible that it makes that dramatic of an impact moving on to the model s performance with the 19 inch wheel it has a range of about 341 miles with the 21 inch wheel and has a range of about 315 miles when traveling at 75 miles per hour assuming a 100 kilowatt hour battery pack so an 8 difference and all we did was change the wheels and tires and then finally looking at the model x performance going from a 20 inch to a 22 inch on the 20 inch wheels and tires 296 miles of range versus with the 22 inches 270 miles of range or about a nine percent difference so ranging from an eight percent to a 15 difference in just changing that wheel diameter by 2 inches that is pretty wild to see now i wanted to combine all of this into one easy take home message to prove that we need to bring back big sidewalls and get rid of these silly low profile tires and so the way that we're gonna do that is by looking at carbon dioxide emissions and so if you take the average electric vehicle in america it emits about two metric tons of carbon dioxide now let's say you take your wheels off these you know low profile tires that come with the car and you put on some higher profile tires that's exactly what i did with my model 3 and let's say you can save about 10 on range which isn't an unreasonable assumption we've got eight percent here fifteen percent there so not an unreasonable assumption that you could save ten percent by switching to some smaller wheels so we've got two metric tons multiplying that by ten percent and we've got two hundred million drivers in the united states so we take that number and we divide it by the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted in the united states each year and what do we get we get a number of 0.6 percent so what this number means is nearly one percent of all emissions in the united states could be saved by switching to big sidewall and you know there's other benefits there you can resist pothole damage with fatter sidewalls you've got better ride comfort you've got cheaper tires and on top of all of that you literally save the planet i mean it's a win win win win can't get any better than that and if you happen to come across a tesla owner who says they own their tesla because they care about the environment and then you see on their vehicle they have the highest wheel option the largest wheel size option you can ask them why do you hate the environment now another interesting thing to think about is that if smaller wheels extend your range well then you could theoretically get away with a smaller battery pack and because the battery pack is one of the most expensive components of an electric car this could mean dramatically reducing the price of that vehicle so it's a huge benefit to go with a smaller wheel now in summary do what makes you happy but it's at least worth knowing you know what are the actual differences in range by using an' inch or 20 inch wheel and what impacts that has on your efficiency thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course
