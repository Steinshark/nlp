roll the dice or go all the way by charles bukowski if you're going to try go all the way otherwise don't even start if you're going to try go all the way this could mean losing girlfriends wise relatives jobs and maybe your mind go all the way it can mean not eating for three or four days it could mean freezing and a park bench it can mean jail it can mean division mockery isolation isolation is the gift all the others are a test of your endurance how much you really want to do it and you'll do it despite rejection and the worst odds and it'll be better than anything you can imagine if you're going to try go all the way there's no other feeling like that you'll be alone with the gods and the nights will flame with fire do it do it all the way all the way you will ride life straight to perfect laughter it's the only good fight there is you
