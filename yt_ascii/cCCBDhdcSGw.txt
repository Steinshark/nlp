[music] so on one hand it's nice that you can look back at your previous work and see a difference and actually know that you're getting better at something but on the other hand it is kind of embarrassing when all that old stuff is still up and it's just not good but i've been making videos more or less for about 13 years or almost 14 years now which is crazy to say out loud but the thing that i think i'm most proud of as far as the video making process is that pretty much all of it is self-taught there is no how-to guide for creating a tech channel and making videos and and making a business out of it until now we basically have created the blueprint i got to basically crystallize this blueprint in the form of a master class i actually got to make a master class which is pretty amazing it's in pretty special company i mean i've watched neil degrasse tyson's class and then i got to talk to him in person we just watched steph curry win an nba championship with the warriors and he did a master class and so to celebrate i'm going to go back and look at my older videos or at least i'll go back in time slowly and try to survive the cringe i'll review them a bit maybe shed some light on the behind the scenes process on some of the stuff that we did to make it happen and we'll see how far we get back as they get increasingly more and more old let's do it all right so this first video i'm going back to is already october 2020 so it's about two years old this is the sony xperia one mark ii reviews of smartphones has kind of become the bread and butter of the channel and i've definitely noticed that stepping outside of that a little bit more has been more fun lately and this is one of those videos snapdragon 865 eight gigs of ram a 21x9 widescreen display triple cameras a 4 000 milliamp hour battery really it's like smartphones have gotten so consistent and a lot of people just say boring which makes a lot of sense for this video it's like the first two minutes of it is just quickly explaining what this exact phone is but then we jumped right into all the more interesting questions about like why this sony phone if you didn't already notice the two in the background the two lights that's for the xperia one mark ii there's there's always some easter egg in every video fine but you know technically anybody can build that but the thing is this phone also has a bunch of other stuff unique really useful stuff that i haven't seen in any other phone but all this stuff leads to one question which is why don't more people buy these okay so this video so this is why don't people buy sony's phones from two years ago it has 7.1 million views and i just tweeted this the other day because it was so interesting like i like the phones and i talk about them but these videos average more views per video about the phone than like any other brand i found it funny because they they still have like zero percent market share but there's just a couple factors in between sony actually getting real customers and not one of them being the fact that there's like months between when they announce the phone and it comes out the other one being that it's fifteen hundred dollars it's frustrating because it seems like sony's kind of suffering from some of the same stuff lg has lately anyway which is their inability to rip lg all right i think we can go older okay so this video here is the samsung galaxy fold unboxing from 2019 23 million views the recent unboxing of the samsung galaxy fold that's a cool box this is an interesting one this is the first foldable phone that's really going on sale to the masses it's priced way higher than even any other high-end samsung flagship so it's clearly positioned as a luxury device so this this video style is pretty similar still to you know three years ago to now it's close the funny behind the scenes story about the fold though that i i've kind of told but maybe i'll just put it all in one place here you guys already know it broke and there was lots of stories that came out about it i actually got a shot of me peeling the screen protector off and it breaking on camera but it never made it to the internet because what happened was i'd shot this whole unboxing and first impressions video and the magnet paper and all that fun stuff and then as i was editing it i said oh you know what i didn't get a shot yet of taking the screen protector off so i set up the camera and got the shot of peeling the screen protector and got it i mean it shut down as i was peeling it off so i had that shot and i said oh that's bad well let me get back to that so i finished editing the unboxing video published that and then the next day i'm like trying to figure out what happened to the screen and then another person on twitter saying hey me too hey me too and so i chimed in on twitter hey mine also broke and that's when the avalanche of galaxy fold screen breaking stuff happened there were very very few review units this is one of them they were all taken back so there's a magnet in each side of the galaxy fold about two thirds of the way down as demonstrated by this magnet paper the magnet paper is so it's just so fun it's evergreen everyone likes seeing where the magnets are in things and this paper every time i use it in it in a instagram post and a tick tock even it's just fun we just like the magnet paper so they're so strong that they have a bit of a field effectively outside of the phone itself strong enough to pick up metal objects and things like that yeah i remember that a bunch of washers nails or even whole bags of nails what a weird feature and i even had a small wrench that worked and an apple pencil which of course has a piece of metal in it for the ipad's magnet that worked and a really really big allen key it's made of metal and it can pick it up this magnet is for real so just have to share that a little proof from what i was talking about from the last video so you can see in the background this is in the old studio we're in a different part of the same building now but i can picture almost with photographic memory exactly where everything in this old studio was until we moved out the retro tech episode 1 on the original game boy it's a good time to be a video nerd either way thanks for watching okay so the clock in the background or the little screen as you can see 8 million 304 962 subscribers that was a a live counter at that time when youtube didn't round now they just round to the nearest this would say 8.3 but they used to actually tell you how many catch you guys in the next one peace still similar in style i've had the same camera stuff setups i've used a lot of the same lenses since 2019 so i think we can go even older so this is the htc u ultra rant slash review from 2017 i mean it's my channel i'm i get to talk about the things that i like and that i'm interested in and so the process for like deciding what to make videos about is like when something is so cool or so good that i want to talk about it then it gets a video and then there's this like gray area in between and then there's the stuff that's so bad that it needs like a psa or people need to know not to buy it yeah if you don't think i did negative videos you should probably watch this one [music] i remember this notch this weird side what's up guys i'm kittyhd here and this is the brand new htc i don't know why i look different it's probably the lack of oh it's the beard that's what it is yeah it's definitely the beard you ultra and it is definitely the shiniest phone of all time and this happens to also be htc's first big smartphone of 2017 and it's coming to the us with a price tag of 749 so this is definitely a that used to be a lot of money for a smartphone the galaxy note 7 nice little clean top-down shot which stands for extra large and it's bigger than all of those and even others with even smaller displays it's bigger than all of them and it's still eight millimeters thick so it's also definitely not trying to be a super thin phone in any way either so okay so this these shots here this is what we used to do a little bit more often before we had enough of a studio space to really make a large variety of shots we'd use this thing called breather which is it's originally supposed to let people just rent a space in the city and just like take a breather or study or read or hang out and they all looked kind of cool and cooler than our studio so i would use this as a like mobile video studio that pop-up new york city and the portless future isn't quite here yet and htc you definitely could have also but you didn't for some reason seems like a poor use of space and then the battery the htc u ultra has a 3 000 milliamp hour battery which doesn't seem that bad but for context yeah something's a little bit off here i love this i mean this is one of my favorite videos to put together not because i like trashing on phones but this is one of the earlier times in a video in a review or something like this where i spend an extra bit of effort to make sure that there's a common thread throughout the video a really poor use of space poor use of space seems like a poor use of space seems like a poor use of space for your space this doesn't always work with phones or reviews at all but when it does it's great for obviously retention and for enjoying the video the whole way through because you know what you come away from the video with that i'll say skip this one and you could pretty easily wait for the htc 11 to come out pretty soon or just grab a galaxy s8 when that comes out or an lg g6 or pretty much any other 700 smartphone which will be a better use of space than this one so that's been it hope you enjoy yeah there's been there's been quite a few videos with said tone in the past no big deal there's a there's a lot of fun of trying to figure out you know trying to toe the line between what to talk about not to talk about all right let's get older this is the most nervous i think i've ever been in my life so this is in 2015 and it's it's kind of out of the blue and random for the channel i've been talking about tech and gadgets and handheld stuff and along comes this email from nike saying hey kobe bryant's releasing a new signature shoe this is in the middle of his farewell tour in his legendary final nba season and there's some tech in it and we figure it would be cool to invite you to come talk to him about it you down what okay sure of course yeah i don't know if i still don't think i'm that good of an interviewer but this is what the talking tech series since then is this is what it's all about from a tech perspective you know i've i've kind of tried to dabble into it a little bit but i found myself not being extremely passionate about it unless it's centered around sports right and things that involve health training things of that sort but overall i wouldn't describe myself as a very tech savvy person love the brutal honesty this is the thing about kobe like when he cares about something he dives into it i have no idea yeah with a cd player star struck that let alone a walk man it was like wait you had to rewind what yeah wait so that song was over you had to flip it over and like use the other side of the tape yeah yeah yeah so you know when i first came in lee the world was such a different place this is also this is a three camera shoot i remember we took three cameras out there i shot with a friend john from tld today awesome with making videos and this is also the last video that i ever edited in adobe premiere shoe b-roll the shoe must it's harder than phone bureau when you're used to phone b-roll but it's the same shot in my hand some free technology we've combined some of the zoom and lunar technology would have been some of the staples with some of my other shoes but they normally behave in isolation they normally don't communicate with each other this is like way more in-depth information that i actually thought i would get normally you get someone who's like doing a sort of a promo tour and they're just like oh yeah watch my new movie oh yeah buy my new product he's literally explaining how like nike flyknit works with the ankle of the shoe and how he has more torque around the heel but less around the sides so there's mobility with the shoe it's crazy thanks for being a part of this i appreciate the time and hopefully we get to do it again thank you awesome that's that was the first of like the interviews that i ever did in hindsight i feel like i have a lot to thank kobe for i mean i obviously that was the only time i ever met him i remember when i first we went to go set up the video stuff and the guy was like alright yeah so kobe when he walks in he's going to go and go over to the left he's going to do this interview then he's going to go over here and do this interview then he's going to come to you and do that interview and then he's going to head out my heart's in my throat he comes over and he's the nicest guy and he helps sort of break the ice and i heard you doing this youtube thing this is cool let's talk about tech incredible we need more guys like him all right this is we're going back to 2014 now so this is a in case it looks kind of crazy already this is a video i shot in collaboration with the verges video team they have an amazing video team they still do to this day but this is like the they're in their prime of like this crazy ultra wide video and and you know a very recognizable style with motion graphics so this is a collab shoot also my hand is broken because as you can see there's some stitches that i and practice i just broke my hand like a week or two before i shot this it's fine though we could still shoot a video kind of like the galaxy note 4 and i take the finish from the nokia lumia series so that's motion graphics instead of a rawness soft touch is obviously easier to hold than 2014 this was state of the art it's funny that five and a half inches was a massive display back then and now i think the mini iphone is just a little smaller than that so inside we got to have top-notch specs so here in late 2014 that means yeah what is that four snapdragon 805 three gigs of ram the adreno 420 gpu basically the whole deal so for the battery the whole deal i i'm reviewing a phone right now with' gigs of ram just for context empowers you better did you see that fully translated in a dream phone i'd be okay with anything 3 500 milliamp hours or better this it says this transition we were using if you pause it at the right place it says film impact demo on the right here is an lg ad and then on the right here is a samsung phone ad and the next shot there's a google android ad these things are everywhere i think that's why we shot this year because i said oh for the operating system android but also i'm shooting this right around times square and i have if you look over the left side of the frame that tall billboard very recently we just got a team c's billboard put on that exact super tall billboard where the ball drops in times square i also have a shot of my own face on a time square billboard recently it's crazy how that works out there's just pigeons flying behind me and then the verge mq bhd collapse see that was kind of neat all right so now we're going we're going really really far into the archives here this is where the cringe really hits so this is 2009 [music] okay so i can explain i can explain it's hard to explain but i can explain even today i still have a short intro before the video so it was like you could make a short animation with some free tools and i wasn't skilled with video editing so i was just using free tools so this thing called animoto you could put in a couple of photos it would create this animation for you so i didn't [music] this is the first place i ever made videos which is in the corner of my bedroom and my parents house i'm on the webcam of the first computer i ever had which was the hp pavilion dv7t i used this computer for like the first 400 videos so what i'm gonna go into is that right now i have i'm gonna check right now right now i have approximately 70 sound like elmo just gonna put that out there if i go to my page youtube.com marcus brownlee just click on the link over there i have 74 subscribers i clearly was not making money from this had no intentions of this being my job at any point it was just a fun thing i enjoyed doing when i got back from practice i'm literally like wearing my hoodie from after practice before i had to go do my homework i would just like make a video because it was fun what else can i tell you i mean video 100 uploading more i've run out of things to say stay tuned for more battery tips i'm still uploading more battery tips for you guys i ran out of things to say it was actually back in the day when i used to get an email for every single person who ever subscribed to the channel and when they did i would click on their profile and i would leave a message thanking them for subscribing yeah alright that's basically it so thanks for watching subscribe and stay tuned for more and i hope you like this video peace peace never never didn't have that let's go all the way back this is the best place to end it here we go bought a new laptop and literally this is the so this is the first video i ever made january 2009 i turn on the laptop webcam and i just start talking and then i realize that my glasses are reflecting the laptop screen and i just take them off i just panic and take them off i don't know who told me to put my collar like that okay so yeah quite a nice remote so quite a nice video center remote this is like those old makeup tutorials where you got to hold it up to the camera like this because there's auto focus i don't know if i can make it through the whole video without cringing let's try these i'm like struggling with like the fact that it reverses so when i move left it moves right so i move back to try to keep it in the frame fast forward you're playing media controls yes it's a media player remote oh no it's pretty handy i it fits in your pocket quite easily it's as you can see i have a big hand but it's pretty small wow i said that in the first video leave comments and subscribe thanks that was fun i hope we'll probably do this again some some future version where i look back at 2020 videos and cringe but hey until then this has been it if you want to check out the master class link below that'll also be there but yeah thanks for hanging around and sticking to this and subscribing and being here for the videos guys catch you in the next one peace [music] love a train horn
