don't call it the cuban missile crisis even that didn't end as badly as this one did mark cuban recently promoted a crypto that has now blown up in his face thanks to some degenerate crypto farming the coin is called titan it went from four dollars to 60 inside of a week and then immediately crashed to less than a penny in a few hours mark cuban in response tweeted this i got hit like everyone else crazy part is i got out thought they were increasing their tvl enough then bam more like boom ladies and gentlemen welcome to d5 now in the aftermath people lost millions maybe more memes are being made to memorialize the event and mark cuban is curiously suddenly calling for a stablecoin regulation he says in a statement to bloomberg there should be regulation to define what a stablecoin is and what collateralization is acceptable you know i obviously agree with this idea of stablecoin regulation but i gotta admit losing all your money and then calling for regulation it's a bit like trying to ban gambling right after you got cleaned out in vegas i mean you might be right bad timing it's all i'm gonna say but honestly i think this is a good time to talk to all you degenerates out there okay trying to yield farm your way to the moon now look we've all been there you got that stimmy check and you're looking at index fund returns the s p might get you eight to twelve percent a year if you're lucky cash is trash you can't keep it in fiat so then you look at crypto boom a hundred percent gains baby over here 12 000 gains guys crypto is a whole new level of risk reward that the world is really still getting exposed to and used to it's it's just gains are ratcheted up and so are losses though to be honest people don't even open up binance or kucoin for anything less than 200 apy and it's got y'all all kinds of messed up okay even people like mark cuban like here's a guy who goes up on shark tank and he is he's buttoned up right he's asking questions you'd expect from a millionaire you know what's your cash flow who are your competitors what's your projected growth you know in other words he's a rational businessman he's he's been around the block but apparently when mark goes home gets in front of that macbook starts checking out these d5 projects this man becomes a filthy degenerate these were the kinds of yields mark was looking at here's a liquidity pool promising 347 percent apy here's another one promising 133 000 apy and here's another one offering you know just a a low low 4 billion percent apy if you put money with them now if you're thinking there's no way mark cuban would be you know taken in by such ridiculous returns right clearly these are scams well you'd actually be right he didn't go in for the 4 billion or even the 300 instead according to the blog where he shield this coin called titan he said he got an annualized return of about 206 guys don't worry we're not talking about anything crazy here just 206 on his money per year now this is completely nuts so today we're gonna break down what went wrong with the crypto mark promoted in this in this blog post that he posted only a few days ago it's called the brilliance of yield farming liquidity providing and valuing crypto projects june 13th in this post he describes the degenerate behavior but the token we're going to talk specifically about where he lost the money is called titan but it's actually part of a two token system that makes up an algorithmic stable coin called iron the two tokens are iron and titan they both collapsed now you should already be familiar with the concept of stable coins from our tether video remember that collateral is the thing backing the token so like let's say i give you a token that's supposed to be worth a dollar my collateral could be like a dollar that i hold in reserve right instead of that titan admits that it's only partially collateralized and uses algorithmic minting and burning protocols to maintain a soft peg to the dollar now if you're already bored to tears like i am i'm just gonna put this on screen for you to read from them this is how the iron titan token works now while you read this and try to parse out what this says let me just tell you the obvious even the basics of this are very complex which is something i should have addressed a long time ago but i might as well address now i'm gonna say this once extreme complexity and finance is bad okay as an investor it really is anyone you should avoid them why because the less you understand something ladies and gentlemen the more you can misunderstand the risks okay like imagine investing is like white water rafting it's a rewarding dangerous activity with twists and turns but if you know where the rocks are you know you can be safe you can avoid some of some of the pitfalls it's always going to have a level of danger but if you know what's going on in the river you're going to be fine but imagine you go in completely blind you don't know where anything is you don't know the river layout you gotta wash up on the rocks you know bleeding wondering what happened this is the case with investing if you do not understand something in investing you're gonna smash into those rocks and it's it's gonna be a problem this is why warren buffett frequently says that he doesn't invest in a lot of companies it's not because he thinks they're bad it's because he doesn't fully understand them according to him by the way not only is it true that complicated financial schemes can hide fraud it's also true that just because you didn't fully understand it things can get out of balance this is actually what happened in the 2008 financial crash subprime lending led to mbs's and then cdos which all confused and obfuscated the fact that the system was broken and people were still continuing to lend loans they should have never lent had things been more clear this might not have been a problem and so the same thing applies to crypto if you don't understand these tokens please do not invest in them so where does that leave us with the iron titan token the token actually was only the beginning of the problem mark cuban was also engaging in something called a yield farming through something called a quick swap it's just like more degenerate okay according to a blog where he promoted titan a few days before the collapse he said quote i'm a small lp for quick swap i provide two different tokens die and titan that enable quick swap to offer swaps between these two tokens so now not only are you dealing with sort of a shaky algo stable coin add a little bit of defy yield farming to the mix and ladies and gentlemen we have a recipe for disaster even mark cuban admits he didn't do his due diligence on this before writing his blog post about it he says even though i got rugged on this it's really on me for being lazy the thing about defy is that it's all about revenue and math and i was too lazy to do the math to determine what the key metrics were which all leads us to june 16th only days after mark cuban writes this about titan and drew tons of new investors to the project and literally one day after iron dot finance the people who create these little coins itself had claimed that titan was a bear proof asset oh the sweet irony of saying we're unstoppable it's like it's like being on that titanic but the shift counts so anyways on june 16th not to rub it in the unthinkable happened a few people start selling titan and it led to everyone trying to run for the door at the same time when that happened titan collapsed to zero along with iron as well people really hadn't considered that maybe what made titan make so much money on the way up would also make it crash just as hard as the post on reddit would explain best this is how the protocol was designed positive feedback loop on the way up negative feedback loop on the way down boring technical jargon in the middle and then it says this creates both massive deflation and massive inflation depending on which way the supply demand is going it seems that this bear proof asset hadn't considered the idea that maybe their math wasn't as solid as they thought well millions of people lost all of their investment or most of it ironically mark may have actually been one of the people the few people who saved some of his money from disaster because in his response he had said i got hit like everybody else crazy part is i got out thought they were increasing their tvl enough here i think he's referring to the fact that he got out of the d5 yield farming but was still holding some of the titan which went to zero some clearly didn't get out at all such as this post from reddit he says what the hell happened i put 23 000 today on matic titan lp token for 1 billion apr this morning and this was so trash i went down from 23k to 67 cents how does your coin drop from 60 down to zero you better fix this soon yeah this this really happened to this person i don't know how you help them i don't know how you explain to people that a billion percent apr is automatically going to be a scam i think it can be answered using a comment i got on twitter this is in response to everything collapsing it says well even mark cuban got rugged pretty normal in d5 it's risky but you can make insane money with ponzis now i don't know exactly when we all stopped thinking ponzi schemes were bad but i feel like there's this new logic that maybe i should give an obligatory bad idea to which is that people think if only i get in on the ground floor oh it's a ponzi sure but you know if i just getting on the ground floor to be fine if it is a ponzi get in on the ground floor to the moon like this is obviously pure nonsense and for the health of your bank account stay away from anybody who tells you this meanwhile the lovely team over at iron finance the people behind this whole thing they're ready to push another one of their stable coins they say in response to this giant collapse quote we have learned a great deal from the incident and while there was nothing that could be fixed in the current system we will continue our journey with more products in the future that these guys don't even say sorry you could control f sorry in their post-mortem they don't care they don't care about wrecking you guys they go they go hey we're gonna start a new one like tomorrow total clowns like and i would say no one's gonna trust these people again but honestly crypto's the perfect place for criminals to launch new careers off topic guys anyone hear about that new brian rose d fight anyways that's kind of besides the point i just hope this serves as a cautionary tale listen titan was a billion dollar token that's billion dollars of value that was just blinked out of existence and you know for those of you who are looking for those mouth-watering yields it's a good lesson that always the old saying turns out to be true in the long run if it sounds too good to be true it probably is oh yeah and also remember it might be fun to play high stakes poker you know at the big boy table but if you don't got it like that like don't bother right when mark cuban loses his investment you know in titan it doesn't matter not to judge most of y'all don't have flying lamborghinis in my audience you got to play a different hand you know when you when you get wiped out it's a much bigger deal so unless you have a flying lambo i banish you from investing in things you don't understand please guys you know be safe out there keep your money safe that's all i'm gonna say anyway thanks for watching and i'll see you guys next time hey you took my money away [music] you said that it was safe but i'm loved and i don't feel okay [music] i trusted you you said that it was all right [music] oh but now i'm broke and my wallet
