welcome to my channel my name is josh and today i'm going to be talking about the major layoffs happening in tech and what i think is actually the cause behind them let's get started i have a lot of opinions on this so i'm very excited about it hey josh appreciate this video very excited elon musk mentioned the first thing i want to talk about is what's been kind of on everybody's mind which is ai you always constantly see articles and people talking now everywhere around the internet about how ai is replace programming jobs one quick kind of pause here did you know i i i did want to go over this here soon but github does this like yearly accelerator thing and this year's accelerator will only accept ai powered stuff so yeah ai is kind of welcome to costco i love you i forgot the turn off alerts but ai is gone wild ai has gone wild as [ __ ] and now they're actually even like i mean dude this that's that's crazy news right that's crazy news right there that they're only accepting ai [ __ ] like that is that's why like this is like peak crypto right now we've we are now officially entering to the nft phase of ai now i'm probably going to have to make a totally separate video about this particular topic because it's such a big topic but the truth is i think that is a pretty minor reason why people are being laid off right now when we look at the big tech company by the way i i i think ai has has has literally not laid off a single person in in programming i i just don't even believe it if someone actually even tries to tell me i i will just plug my ears and go la la la la la i i don't even believe it at all i think the only thing that has happened is that it's just created more jobs i think we're probably at a we're at a significant increase in jobs due to a ai if ai is writing 55% of your code you're going to need one and a half times more power to actually do it and if you're letting ai write your unit test you are a damn fool okay that's all i got to say to the topic which i'm going to get into in a minute and why they're doing these huge layoffs i think there's something maybe much deeper that's rotten at the core and i think probably the most significant things are things react mentioned people aren't really talking about or thinking about so i'm going to get into that in a few minutes but i just want to kind of get the ai out of here for the moment if you've ever used google bard or if you've ever used chat gpt to actually program and make stuff you would know that it's not going to replace programmers anytime soon actually ai isn't new we talk about it like it's new because it's finally it's gaining public access right people are finally able to use it it's truly normy level right before you had to be like i i solved the the queen's problem and it's just like ah cool dog that's pretty awesome but now it's normie now it's just like yo tell me about mad dn and in wheel of time you know what i mean or moga however you say your name i have no idea to write stories to plagiarize things whatever but when we really look at ai it's been used for well over 20 years in aviation it's been used for routing pathing all sorts of stuff it's just finally people in the public have access so they seem to think it's this new thing well no it's been replacing jobs for decades it's not really new and it's not going to replace programmers anytime soon not entirely at least if you work and you know let's say you are a web developer that does html css and that's it yeah there's a possibility your job could be in danger maybe eventually but certainly not anytime soon and people that do hardcore logic anything low-level anything seer assemblers ai is just super inaccurate lowl learning how do you feel about that quickly can i get a quick take quick take lowle learning how do you feel about you being safe right now hard agree hard agree okay we got some hard agrees here okay good good good just just making sure plus the other thing too is the way ai works is it just resources public knowledge right ai doesn't really creatively solve problems the way people seem to think it does it tries to solve problems based on data sets that are already developed which means it can really only effectively solve problems that have already been solved and the whole point of hiring a programmer for the most part is that your company or your needs are going to be specific to that product now does that mean that the day that ai can do jobs like just just taking what he said the day that ai can take everybody's job is the day in which we're not doing anything new or cannot be extrapolated from already built data sets is that like is that supposedly the line i mean i i still don't believe it but that's also a bad take okay why why hit me come on i know you're new around here come on let's go i i appreciate the fact that you said it with such with with with with more verbosity than l take so i need to hear your reasons why hit me you got to hit me you got to hit me new things aren't always completely new you go are you hit me with some are you hit me with some solomon wisdom right now that there's nothing new under the sun is that what i'm is that is that where we're going with this talk because in a sense i do agree with you bro cooked yeah okay okay i mean i see what you're saying that they're technically isn't anything new and if if ai really what they are good at is just spotting distributions and and replicating distributions then yeah they're just one really really complex function approximation that's i mean that's really all a neural net actually does is it just approximates then yeah you're you're pro you're probably correct on that that since there's nothing really really new one could argue that it could keep on approximating but the problem is is that approximation is it does not mean prec precision okay you know there's there's an old phrase there there's an old you know close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades which means that which mean which means it doesn't count for ai okay last time i checked ai is neither horseshoes nor hand grenades so being close enough just doesn't count i make games that's my job i've tried to use ai to help with my game development especially like hardcore logic programming problems and i've just found it's just not very good sometimes it's helpful on some things it's a good resource for a programmer to have but it is not going to be replacing programmers dramatically anytime soon it is a small factor it is part of the reason why some by the way when i say it's good at math i mean it's like better than you at math but it still completely makes it up companies are looking to the future and saying we need to start laying off unnecessary staff because in the future and they're anticipating that this may replace certain jobs but again i think this is kind of a very small part of the reason why some people are being replaced so i just wanted to kind of get that out of the way get your concerns out of the way again i'll make a whole video on this and why it's not going to replace people not truly later but you don't need to worry about ai that's not the major factor here so another thing that it could possibly be is preparation for a looming recession most people that work in economics will tell you as we speak you see it all over the news that a recession is probably coming stock values can only go up so high for so long before something has to collapse right it's just it's it's the rules of entropy or gravity things can only get better and go up and then eventually they have to come down we look at interest rates for example and that's a good place to start your search if you think there's an economic recession coming soon i mean there is a lot there is a lot of discussion about that the hard part about like recessions and and tech is that tech has a disproportionate ability to monetize per employee and so you know like when you go to like a grocery store and someone that's working as a clerk they're not bringing in the same value to hour that say someone that's working in tech and that's because we don't you know because a lot of tech doesn't have distribution problems in the same way sas margins go bur right exactly it's just it's just a different thing and so like if you if you look at any tech company and you say how much money does it make per employee it's it it's really disproportional right it's it's really really disproportional so even if there is a recession there is a pullback there's a lot of ability to continue to pay for good employees now that's notice i was very i was very intentional about the word i chose there too when i said good employees professionals and people that are analysts see interest rates and they see that as a concern companies of course hire their own economists and the economist i do think war is obviously a big is a big fear too right because war is the only war is the war is a dark horse that you don't like who knows how big those things can you know can can inflate too and what how they're going to change the economy and all that kind of stuff stuff so that's like that that that is a that is a true true worry war is great to make money i mean most most people lose money some people make money which war i know that's that's that's the that's the actual sad reality to the statement i'm making which war war bad equals w take i think war is bad i i would prefer no human loss like that my ideal world involves people not having to kill each other to get what they want right i think we can all agree that that is not that is not like that is not awesome brave take i know brave take i'm i'm taking hard right now are going to be going to the ceos and going to the cto and people that hand handle hiring hiring managers hiring departments hiring companies whoever they outsource that to and they're going to say look a recession is coming we need to start doing minor layoffs slowly and we have seen some of those but again of these big major layoffs that we're seeing right now i don't think that this is the biggest factor i do think it's a factor just like ai is a factor but it's not the big one so that's the thing i think he's wrong here i think he's honestly completely wrong and i i'll show you why i think he's wrong and i can i can kind of show this with money i i we can show this with money here very very soon but i can show you why he's wrong so if you look at 2020 through 2022 what you're going to see is that every company grew like this that's in the that's in the in internet industry and then from 22 to 2023 what you're going to see is you're going to see actually less money being made and now we're starting to reach back into the point in 2024 where more money was being made than it was right here but what you're going to see is that this was everybody is staying at home and everyone's freaked out about covid therefore everybody's using what is referred to as the internet and so what happens when you have an incredible amount of money right an incredible amount of money that is being pumped into companies and an incredible amount of use that has never been seen ever well what's going to happen what do you think what do you think employee headcount was doing during this time do you think that employee headcount remained stagnant no employee headcount went like this as well and then what happens when the the you know everything kind of crashes and people are no longer using the internet as much because all of the sudden outside is now a new possibility again all of the sudden all that hiring doesn't make any more sense it just doesn't make any more sense and you can see a lot of this like if you go to amazon like amazon what's it called amazon quarterly quarterly earnings if you look at their quarterly earnings over time you'll they they don't give you actually specifics it'd be nicer if they gave you specifics but look at this they were making less per share look at their shares go back up now if we could get a little bit further into the past you you would see that their shares were also way up back in 2022 2021 right 2021 do they have like a do they just have i i don't know if they have like a really quick easy way to look at this do they have just like a nice table do they have a nice table net income i assume these are in the billions right these are in the billions but as you can see the m money money went up right money went way up on these things over these over this time it's in the millions oh it's in the millions oh yeah that makes sense it's in the millions what am i saying the billions the billions would be just would be out of control that would be absolutely out of control the millions yes okay it's in the millions right so so net income went went way up way way up i know slack happened shut up shut up pill slack okay okay okay okay and you can see this in a lot of companies i believe if i even go to ir. netflix.com which is a little bit easier for me to see just because they have a if i'm not mistaken if we do letter to shareholders you can also see a similar you can also see a similar kind of growth going on during this time right where all it's it's all going back up and if you look at 2021 2020 you'll also see a really high usage and so there's this like this this whole thing that just happened and so of course what's going to happen during this time is that you way more usage than you've ever had in years and then a sharp drop off in usage so by the very nature you have to have a correction and so what i think i personally think i see is that there's just been a a correction to the over hiring and i wouldn't even call it over hiring i'd say it was hiring that made sense during during that time it's hiring that made sense when covid was crazy and and everything flooded in and then all of a sudden interest rates are going up money costs more to borrow people aren't using internet nearly as much right and just everything started going that direction and so now what do you do i now as i start to talk about this and as i start to go deeper into the problem it's going to become more clear the more you start to look at people's critical roles in their company the real and major factor that's causing a lot of these layoffs i really do seem to think is being overlooked because people are so used to the way the tech industry works now that nobody seems to question it anymore what's been happening in tech about the last 20 years is what i like to call a hyp specialization for roles right 20 or 30 years ago if you were a programmer and you knew a couple programming languages or maybe even one maybe you were a generalist you could get basically any programming job companies were hiring based on the fact that you knew how to program and that you understood logic and you understood generally speaking how computer science works and how to make products that are useful for that company that's not how it works anymore to be completely fair though complexity i mean the general problems we're solving are a lot bigger right they're they're they're they're a lot different they're very very different i'm not saying that there's a lot of complexity i'm not saying that there's a lot of complexity that hasn't been introduced and self foot shot right like like like there's a lot like how we approach uis is significantly more complex in of itself than it ever was but there's also billion person sites now like can we all agree that in the last 20 years a lot of new problems that have never existed now exist for people to solve and so it is just different yes but only so many of them exactly and the worst part is is that people that solve those billion people sites people take what they've done as the as as the blueprint to how you should do and that my friends is how you make your life miserable that's called having more micro services than users and it's incredible it's absolutely incredible to see an app that can scale to 100 million users that has three users and they all go to the same email account which happens to be the ceo's email account like that's it's just incredible somehow all of your users have test1 123 as part of their username because somewhere along the way big companies like facebook i think snapchat is a particular offender i'll talk about that that in a minute they started realiz that they could grow their company's ar snapchat the only company that made a lot of money without actually making money absolutely incredible officially if they started hiring more people than they really need most tech companies most social networks could be managed by shockingly small teams of programmers now i'm not talking about legal i'm not talking about hr resources other things that are considerations as well but just the actual tech that goes into an app for ios let me give you an example say instagram or snapchat i think it would surprise most people how few programmers it actually takes a lot of these social networks were developed originally by one person but now for some reason you look at a company like snapchat who even uses snapchat anymore they still have something like 6,000 employees why okay that i mean that is personally surprising i i do agree that they've over hired okay i think we can all agree that they've over hired i mean i i think there is definitely a miss here comparing facebook to when it was first ideated and written in php to what facebook is today it's it's kind of it's like it is a stupid comparison of course there's like a lot of different things that have to exist right it is it is a stupid comparison to say that they're the same thing why can one person build this but not that it's just like well you're right one person built a house why can he build why can't he not build a skyscraper it's just like well you know i mean you could it just might take a lot longer you know it is a different beast and there's different problems that exist in these things especially when it comes to social social problems because the amount of like network requests and ingress data that comes in just just an entire different beast you have to think about i'm not saying that they're done well can we all agree they're not done well and obviously elon musk kind of proved to the point that you could cut the headcount to 1 and for the most part it's not like i mean can we all be real for a second twitter with all of its badness still operates better than almost any triaa game fight me on that one name a triaa game that's not just just dooo okay i'm just saying one would assume that there there there is something to it okay balers gate 3 great game balers gate 3 fantastic warcraft 2 also a good good call out warcraft 2 was a great game oh so was starcraft the 9s was fantastic and elden ring was amazing i like how most the games being mentioned are games from a decade ago or from free software yeah you're right free software does a great job free software is one of the few places that i i am confident that when something comes out it's incredible the last of us two or from soft not free soft sorry not free soft from soft from softw is amazing why do you need 6,000 employees i could understand having a few dozen programmers but they have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of programmers not so i again i don't i i genuinely don't like this take in its archetype not in its application and what i mean by that is that have you ever looked at software and then said why would anyone ever do this and then you take your software you take that software apart and you completely dismantle it and then you start rebuilding it and you go oh i see why they made that one concep one one concession here but you know i'm i'm doing it different they didn't need to do it this complicated and by the end of rewriting the software you've rewritten almost line for line what they had and that's because you have a fundamentally bad perspective of what is happening internally you can't quite understand the entirety of what's happening so i don't like an archetype saying why does company need to have x when they could be using y i don't like that at the fundamental stage but at the practical application it does feel like there's too many okay so i would agree why does snapchat needs 6,000 employees why can't they have 500 but i also might be the guy that's like you only need 500 we get 500 i oh you got to hire a couple more here oh you got oh yeah i didn't know about that you got to hire a couple more there and the next thing i know i'm back up to 6,000 right like i don't quite know you know i think you get the idea but not 6,000 engineers maybe not 6 th000 engineers not to mention all they're legal and everything else so what we're seeing is a hyp specialization of rules and companies are doing this to prop up stock values the core here is it's a type of invisible and legal fraud if you keep growing your that is pretty ballsy especially with today's really like hyper focused on free cash flow the ever hiring of employees is a really hard argument to make like right now free cash flow is like a really really really a really like like in-depth perspective on on what is on on a on the health of a company so i'd be a little bit surprised that hiring is health to a company right now company by just hiring more people and then investors and people that frankly don't know a lot about tech think that's necessary they see that as positive indicators i would agree in the vc private funding rounds this could very i think he could be very very correct cuz those those operate under completely different pre premises than than publicly traded companies and so the pro that's why i was having a little bit of a problem kind of processing it because i was still thinking in the snapchat world where snapchat is a publicly traded company versus if you're talking about a private company in these private equity firms if you've hired you know a bunch more people you've scaled up you're solving problems faster right i could totally see that right you're coming up with new vanity metrics we're you know network traffic has increased 40% but internally your application's just that much more shitty that you're making 40% more network requests right like i could see i could see that being like a uh you know like a massaging point so your goal if you're mark zuckerberg is to make your company as valuable as possible to stock investors not to the public facebook doesn't even need to make very much money at all the the key to facebook being valuable and more specifically mark zuckerberg being valuable is doing what investors want and what lenders want and they want to see positive growth constantly in the industry we call this employee farming so the idea behind employee farming is as long as you keep growing your worker base it looks like your company's growing it looks like you that's really bad like again he used he used facebook as an example the publicly traded company facebook they live and die by their their revenue rejections they don't live and die by how many employees they have and so this as a fundamental argument for why say facebook would go is is is not is not correct now he may be correct on principle in the sense that he's correct with private stuff but i but it's it's not true in public public is all about growing revenue and so you can't grow revenue by simply hiring employees right right you can't do that that's that's it's it's no matter how you no matter how you slice that cake you can't do that that's just not how it works and so maybe you make more products that sell more and so you're hiring more and so your revenue is growing despite it actually not actually resulting in any real money being made i could buy that but saying that specific metric is the reason why i don't i i'm not currently buying that as the thing you need to hire those people and therefore again bigger company means bigger stock valuations it means lenders and investors see you at sorry one more interruption he's someone just said yeah facebook stock price also went up when they started firing a bunch of people they did fire a lot of people they got slightly better margins that means the money that they're making plus the potential growth that they're going to make now is just worth that much more and then their stock price went up and then of course and they announced dividends which is a hard set stance that you are going to have cash available afterwards you're actually going to be cash positive which means that people really invested because that's like a commitment at that point and commit of a specific better growing big future company even if it's not and this is ultimately what's leading to this hypers specialization because they have to keep creating new roles and when you look at these videos i'm i'm sure you've all seen them by now people mocking them constantly on the internet but you look at these videos of these girls and guys who work in this hyp specialized role posting videos on tik tok and they post videos on twitter of like my my day at twitter or my a day in the life hold on everybody i'm getting viewbotted guys this economy sucks okay you think i can afford more viewers but i i do i do want to say i do i i do want to give like a quick like little shout out though hey code opg i'm really proud that you were able to make all of this i mean you are a really special person honestly you're a very special person i'm very happy that you are willing to be the absolute scum of the earth and say that to other people openly like i'm i'm personally really impressed you know like because a lot of people when they're scamming people they kind of like to try to like hide but you're not and that's it it's truly impressive it's honestly truly impressive to be an [ __ ] and be willing to let people know that you're the [ __ ] i mean can we get can we can we get claps come on let's get some claps wow i mean bra i mean this is brave this is bravery this is bravery like i've never seen in my entire lifetime absolutely impressive you know honestly when you get out of your mom's house i i i could have some i could help you find an apartment like when you're out let me know we could we could find you an apartment maybe we'll get you a bed frame here in about a year and then you won't look like you're 12 anymore like it'll be really awesome it'll be a great day of a twitter hr engineer or something like that and it's basically the girl or guy just drinking coffee hanging around chilling out they they show themselves sleeping in these pods that they have now they're really not doing much and again this is the result of hyp i do agree with this now that i mean that stuff the problem is he's using the term hypers specialized which somehow feels wrong in the sense that the description of the role was drinking coffee and hanging out all day you didn't specialize in [ __ ] what you specialized in being did you specialize in being what boomers think zoomers are like is that is that is is that a specialization i did i didn't realize that was a specialization now i kind of feel stupid right hyper specialization they were basically just creating bs jobs and now you have a bunch of people sitting around who don't work like once you have a hundred progam you're done you're not doing anything more useful beyond that maybe you hold on what did you just say i got to hear that programmers you're on hold and now you have a bunch of people sitting around who don't work like once you have a hundred programmers you're done you're again i really dislike that take that's a stupid take it's it's such a stupid take it is it is truly a dumb take and what i mean by it's a dumb take is that first off never put a number on something number two is that okay you have an application let's just call it netflix and we built out a ui right you build out a ui okay so how many people do you really need to build out a ui well you're going to need to think about deployment caching that kind of stuff so let's put a couple on build systems and stuff like that you're going to want to be able to do various uis plus you're going to also need some testing you're going to want some exploration on those uis various people writing stuff you're going to need a few on that you're probably going to want some like some form of really thinking about like testing and automation and all that kind of stuff you're going to need a few more on that then you also are going to want people that are managers just in general of those however many programmers you're going to need a few more on that and then at that point you're also going to need to think about like again this is netflix we got you also have to run on various televisions so you're going to need some partner engineers so you're going to need a few on there you know a couple per company because you're going to have to have various relationships with every single last company to be able to make sure that everything's like you know everyone is understanding each other and there's goodwill so a few more on there then you're going to need some people that actually build the c++ like layer to have everything run you're going to need a few on there you're going to probably need some javascript engine experts or what really whatever embedded language experts you want to be able to tie the engine into whatever we're you know whatever the base layer is we're going to need a few more on that then of course then you're going to need to think about automation and devices and all that so now we're going to think a few more on that okay so maybe we're over a hundred at this point hm okay that's a lot of engineers i guess we don't need any more right well what about the entire back end what about ai right what do you think ai has to do like how do do you think those recommendations are math.random what about security like there there's still an entire thing that exists that has even been talked about right and so yeah there's there's a lot so saying a hard number like that you only need a 100 you're discounting security or you're not thinking about it you're not thinking about what does backend mean right you're not think like there's a lot of stuff now netflix has like 12,000 employees but a huge percent or however many i don't know what what is the what is the number netflix employ employee count right i don't i know there i think yeah 12,000 what they say there's going to be there's going to be a certain portion of that that's going to be hr legal you got marketing you got engineering you got you got a huge amount that's going to be in the content side right like i don't know how many people are going to be in the content side right there's a lot like total number of employees does not represent what those employees are now i don't know if i can say total let's see engineering employee account i don't know if they have like a okay we have 2,000 engineers honestly which is kind of wild like when you really think about what netflix does and on how many different devices they do it this is a this is a shockingly low amount of employees cu when you go to google and you see things like this to 27,000 software engineers a different world okay that's like just if if we can trust these two numbers and just assume they're the same that's kind of wild right it's a wild thing i'm not saying that netflix is hyper efficient or that google is hyper inefficient we're just vastly different on what we produce right so anyways hey hey all right let's keep on going let's keep on going with this one i was yes i do watch asmin bald i yes i do watch asmin bal okay i do watch asmin bow okay stop making i love asmin you're not doing anything more useful beyond that maybe you could have people in specialized roles outside of the tech again people like legal and hr again like a lot of discount here what about like the swift programming language like that's such hypers specialized role and i'm using the term hypers specialized properly how many people does it take to run a language properly to run at the speed of a company it takes a good amount right like but we are seeing jobs for button engineers like literally they want you to specialize not just in programming but specialize in making a button do you know how i i do actually agree with this take if your job is to just make a button at facebook book like like it's one thing if you're building out the ui component set but if your job is to literally make a button yeah i mean then then yes we we can we can all agree that we've jumped the shark there many people work at snapchat for example snapchat has like i said early about 6,000 employees but they have over 400 employees that just work on ui that's it they do nothing but ui the entire ui of snapchat could easily be done by a handful of professionals if not i so probably i i'm curious when when they say ui people use the term ui and it's not necessarily fair right like when we say ui at netflix i mean it does encompass quite a few things that would be difficult to really call ui localization is a huge thing right they they fall under ui often i i can agree in the sense that i think you is bloated right i i i actually agree with this fundamental take that i think that there's a lot and and this is this is us doing it with unnecessary complexity i think there's a lot of bloat and really like i have seen the most complex code bases i've ever seen in my lifetime have always been ui and it's not because what they're doing is complex it's because they've decided to use really a a fantastic ensemble of the most complex libraries and it's like you look at it and you go wow like this is really hard to reason about like when i look at this code i am genuinely trying to just like really try to understand why you get there and it is true judo you're absolutely correct that anything that involves human interaction is is inherently complex completely on that team like i don't i'm not one person person that thinks that i i really hate people that just say ui or you know the front end is simple and the back end is hard it's like no the front end is hard for its own reasons it has its own things that that are difficult and it does take a really thoughtful individual that does a great job at making a good ui like a good ui is out of this world out of this world but there are a few good uis a lot of them are crufty slow and annoying as [ __ ] to use les if not one person probably if you've ever actually used snapchat you know it's awful anyways the whole ui is just a complete disaster there is no reason to have 400 people working on the ui they don't even have 400 buttons there's something like 30 or 40 okay that's a fair take they don't even have for buttons i do like that as like the measurement of what makes of how many employees you should have you're you're there dude that should definitely exist the amount of engineers you have this is the twitter moment twitter moment this is a twitter moment this is a twitter moment for sure the amount of engineered of software developers you have should be proportional to the amount of buttons on your ui go ahead fight me on that one fight me on that one yeah it's it's it's a base to take that's a base af take okay buttons on the whole app that's more than 10 people for each button that the app has and each function but they do it because the company is forced into this cycle of infinite growth and then other companies are doing it so they have to compete or else they look like they're small and shrinking and they lose value in investors as people port elsewhere but we're just i really think he's he he is missing that there's been a vast complication to software engineering that has happened in the last five years i call it conference driven development it's actually why i abstained from going to conferences for the last four years because i've just became so frustrated with conference driven development i really think that it's been a a a true disaster to our field like there's been no greater disaster foisted upon any field than conference driven development and so i' i would really i just have been very upset about it and so i think that he is missing the fact that a lot of this is unnecessary complexity that has been added that requires that many employees to move and i bet if you measured the speed it takes to deliver a feature per employee what you would see is that as they added every single feature the time it takes to deliver the next feature has greatly increased each time and that there's some sort of linear growth or maybe even quadratic growth of feature delivery versus existing features and that is the real problem is that that it's becoming untenable to wrangle these uis seen massive hyp specialization for roles that what do you mean by conference driven development there are a huge number of people that started using falor because they saw falor added conference okay they started using a tech that was used to solve problems specifically at netflix for having and obtaining data to remain on a device and because devices have limited memory like is that ever your problem yet somehow people started doing that conference driven development is a real thing probably shouldn't even exist to begin with and when we start to look at that problem we start to see why tech companies are doing massive layoffs a very big reason for this is the catalyst event which was of course elon buying twitter i'm going to get into that in just a minute too so now as we start to see negative indicators in stock value ai future growth things like that i supposed you know look at meta they tried to do this whole metaverse thing that failed billions of dollars by the way i think metaverse was not a i mean i personally thought it was a stupid idea but it's a great idea to make bets and to make bets early you know what i mean like as a big company and you have lots of money to burn you should make bets into these technologies because honestly you have absolutely no idea what's going to take off like would any of but would anybody think that tweeting at people would have been a billion dollar company would any anybody would have thought if i would have told you 20 years ago or whatever how many times it is that if you were to make if you were given only 140 characters to send messages on the internet to nobody like you would not have thought man this is a billion dooll idea this will become one of the most important things ever flappy bird what would if i told you that mario like tubes are going to be coming at a bird that you press your screen and a bird jumps once that this would literally be a $50,000 a day game you'd be like okay that's that seems a little strange don't you like you can't make those kind of bets and so i think it's very smart of them to attempt to be the company to be in that position now i think they're just too early right there's the early problem which is if you're too early to a tech nobody is willing yet to use it and so vine walked so tik tok could run exactly exactly now they know okay we need to recoup some of that money and the best way to do it is to start firing these people or doing layoffs of them that we never really needed to begin with so a lot of people have this sort of idea that oh programmers are all just getting fired now no they're not good programmers are not getting fired not predominant at least except maybe at unity but that's a different topic but the idea here is good take there like i mean obviously some good programmers get you know they they they catch a stray from layoffs and all that kind of stuff i i know that does exist but in general what he is saying i think is very very accurate that if you're a good programmer you're going to have a stable job you're needed there's tons of companies that are still growing that are still bringing in new programmers you don't need to worry you only need to worry if you're one of the people that's getting hired in something super hyper specialized and that's why i still recommend to people to be generalists be a good programmer who knows lots of frameworks who knows lots of languages who understands computer science intimately because that makes you a valuable resource they're not just going to fire you or get rid of you you know a little bit of math learn just a touch of statistics know what a standard deviation is let's go let's go great this is great have an intrinsic value when you bring something to the table beyond just being able to make one tiny button on the interface when you really fundamentally understand how apps work and are designed when you understand core architecture you are never ever going to be out of work and if you do get fired because a company goes under or something you're going to find work really fast as well so you shouldn't worry about that i i see to too many people panicking in the industry right now the people getting fired are in almost every case i've seen the jobs that never should have existed to begin with and i i disagree with that i mean that's obvious not true but i do like let's just one more time go back to something he said about being a generalist if your goal is to be purely a react engineer and you're learning every last thing about engineer like react there comes a point where it's no longer useful and you got to understand that like it's great to have good knowledge it's good you should be familiar but don't go so deep honestly it's not worth it it's truly not you you're bang for the buck is just not worth it it really isn't it's so much better that if you know enough about react we're very very valuable to know you should know those things you should be able to have like a a basic talk about react and kind of know how it works even i could have a basic to talk about react and just have like a basic like oh yeah these are the things that happens oh yeah these are some of the behaviors all this kind of stuff like that's good but if someone said okay let's talk about docker for a second i could kind of talk about docker oh you want to talk about go for a second i could kind of talk about go you want to talk about how network protocols work i could kind of talk about that as well right like i could kind of talk about a lot of things it's good for you it's very very good for you to understand the fundamentals of these things how do you do encoding and decoding what type of why would you make trade-offs why wouldn't you use json right i can have that conversation and that is good how old is your audience here they're predominantly 25 to 45 that's the 60 to 70% of my audience i don't mean to insult those people many of those people are generalists that ended up being forced into a specialization just to get a job because these companies don't want to hire generalists right these companies want to hire people in specific subsets because then they don't complain they don't whine about wanting to do better bigger things they get comfortable in in the rule they get comfortable in the fact that they don't have to do very much and i think that that's just convenient for the industry it's convenient for this type of mass hiring fraud which is what i considered it i know they they just call it employee farming but i call it employee fraud because ultimately this is bad for the companies because they do do major layoffs and then they lose stock value because people think the company's shrinking so it's bad for them and it's bad for employees because you never feel like you're stable you feel like you work on things that don't matter so you're just a cog in the well oiled machine if you want to even call it that more like a brick in the wall you're a brick in the wall of this machine like at meta or facebook and you just feel like you don't matter you feel like your job is what i think joe rogan had a podcast on this actually called bs jobs but that's that's ultimately what's led to this is is way way over hiring and super specified jobs that they don't need when you hire a generalist they can replace 50 or 60 of those minor jobs that you just you don't need if you first off joe rogen mentioned twitter's a wild place people i i mean there's part of me that really agrees with this take is that there's there's i mean i i do feel bad about the i don't want to call them hypers specialized i really hate that term because it's not valuable enough it doesn't really get across the the value of having hypers specialized individuals it's hyper compartmentalized people would probably i think is a better way to describe that oh thank you hotwife i think that that is a better way to describe that exact thing than than hypers specialized because they're they're they're they're they're silo becomes more and more constricted constantly and that causes their focus to be so small that becomes like a really difficult problem because i think he is right then it becomes comfortable it becomes easy to stay in that role becomes easy not to grow because you're so dang compartmentalized you were a good leader you wouldn't do that i think another thing to talk about too that people are ignoring is even beyond the intentional fraud that's happening a lot of ceos just aren't good they're just not good at their job they're kind of hands off they just push everything on other people and i've seen this personally i think i think this is a very wild take and what i mean by that is that that i am not going to say what the average ceo does because the average ceo like bad ceos i do agree with there's plenty of people that shouldn't be ceos they're ceos because they founded the company right they started it and and not every ceo is a good ceo but what sucks about it saying that they just simply don't do anything like i've always hated that kind of take in the sense that if you look at any of these startups you look at any of these people like i've seen so many people that they're doing like 80 hours a week every week for year after year and it's just like i don't want to simply just dunk on everybody i think it's it's pretty silly to say that ceos do nothing it's just like no no no no no no no there's plenty that do a ton what are you trying to say with that are ceos people who are technically engineers who then became ceos because they started the company they're just not good at people skills and can't plan ahead and they just really aren't the right person for the job yeah yeah i agree with that i agree that that probably happens more than you realize and they're truly not the right person for the job they're just the person that's there right now like that probably happens a lot a lot of people have absolutely no idea how the se how the c works right a lot i'm just you know like here's the thing is remember earlier when he said snapchat shouldn't have 400 employees and we all agreed that that's just completely silly that you shouldn't be making these statements especially when you have absolutely no idea what goes on you should apply the same logic to every everywhere else in life like if you don't if you've never sat on a midsize company seite board you should or at least be close enough to understand it maybe you should take a step back and not just assume you know everything right it's the same problem over and over and over again gavin bson best ceo clearly the best ceo my favorite thing about gavin bsum is that he was upset that other people are making a the world a better place better than he is right like don't don't just do that right there's plenty of really i mean of course they're shitty ones they're sh like how many software engineers just do nothing you can make the same argument for every industry that there shitty versions of put person in position a find person that is shitty at position a and say wow look at this all software engineers are lazy it's just like no that's not come on come on right too my wife worked for a small company that had maybe 10 or 12 employ employees at one point and they were growing a little bit but the ceo just wanted to constantly hire more people for everything like they are a 12 person small nimble light company and she wanted to hire an entire social media development company to post posts on linkedin for them they're 12 people the ceo should just make a linkedin and start posting posts by the way he's really right on this one like it is kind of wild that like that type of cottage industry can even exist when you got nobody like when you don't like do you know how do you know that it's not hard to just say something on the internet watch i'll go here i'll go to twitter and i'll say i guess i am working in javascript today wow i'm a ceo i'm a social media marketing genius they were hiring a social development firm for these tiny what i would consider to be kind of worthless posts basically something you could have just gone on ai and had chat gbt right for you he's right i think a lot of ceos are just bad with money i think their hands off they don't want to wear many hats they just want to rely on other people too much and people that aren't sort of by the way that's a good take right there don't don't don't outsource everything right like the people that i respect the most are people that get in the grind and do everything and really like really really understand it and then when it becomes too big of a job then you hire it out right micromanagers tend to be like that and you know micromanaging is its own problem of course trying to do everything yourself is its own issue that's kind of a separate topic but good lean startups understand where to spend money and where not to waste money and i find there's just way too much especially with these big companies of hands-off approach let's hire somebody for literally everything we need to have more people in the industry who know how to wear mini hats so don't be afraid to be a programmer that has maybe 10 frameworks under their tool belt right you know how to use a lot of frameworks you know how to use a lot of languages and you understand architecture so that should be your focus if you want to become a programmer and you're concerned about these tech layoffs that's always been a point of pride for me is one of my one what i would consider my biggest personal accomplishment at netflix even though i think it's professionally one of the biggest disasters different different story here is that part of the falor days one of the requirements is that we need to write a objective c client nobody wanted to do that and i said i'll do it i'll learn objective c and i'll do it crushed it out in like a month i was really really proud of that because i went onto a platform in which i had no idea anything about about it i had to use an editor that i absolutely hated xcode i had to learn objective objective c is just terrible just went did it because i wanted the because it's stupid to let yourself be limited right so i'm just like hell yeah i'm going to do that i'm going to do the thing because i'm going to do the thing and i felt really great about that that made me feel really good because objective c is objectively bad one of the biggest we've seen this indry was elon buying twitter now say what you will about him positively or negatively affecting the platform but i will tell you this i do use twitter i am on x x now as it's called sorry and seems to me as though when he first bought it and fired 70% of the staff things were shaky at first i agree but i think he tried to prioritize getting rid of the jobs all these hypers specializations that don't matter and keep keeping the good programmers that actually matter and actually fundamentally understand the architecture of how twitter's actually built and now what we're seeing is twitter's faster than ever before when i use twitter now it's way less bloated it's lighter than it's ever been there's some things i don't like about it i think bots are maybe worse than ever like that's been a big prioritization is make people pay and then that'll eliminate bots that that has not worked so not every i actually do agree with a lot of this take you guys are all saying what no no no no no i think twitter itself feels nice i cannot say that i have any if you were to give me twitter a year ago or two years ago and twitter today i don't think i could largely tell a difference i don't think he's sipping for elon because he just said bots are the worst they've ever been right like i don't think any of this is sing like i i honestly don't think that if you could you could tell a difference between two years ago and today i mean how many times did twitter crashed two years ago it crashed a lot or three years ago ago how many times does it crash today it crashed a lot but to say but to say that it that somehow these things are v like that it's it's it's it's like technically worse i think you guys are letting like maybe a little too much crap get in your head like i agree that the the the the practical application's way worse bots are awful every single time i make a tweet i got [ __ ] and bio on all of mine i got i got so much [ __ ] in the bio right now i don't even know how it's possible i got that much it's crazy it's wild it's unreal but humble bang i'm just saying the ladies love my javascript tweets okay they love it but i i honestly i i cannot tell a difference i can't tell a difference i really can't now i i will say one positive thing that's happened to twitter is that mastadon got popular due to elon buying it and all the people that i really find annoying went to mastadon which was pretty sweet like that i i i was a really big fan of blue sky and mastadon like thank you for that i appreciate that thank you i don't need that many well aues i don't thank you appreciate has worked but he managed to fire 71% that's what we know of it might actually be a bigger number than that but at least by the way people hate that i hate mastadon i love hating mastadon i i i i i cannot stand i i always the every single time i've been called a racist in the last three year which is three separate occasions each one their twitter name was their mastadon name my last one was yesterday in which he called both me and if you use htm x a racist that one was pretty impressive i've never seen a library of peace be called to racist that was like a whole new level of different like that one was pretty good he also said i probably listen to joe rogan which i think is hilarious like what a funny accusation you're a racist and you probably listen to joe rogan it's just like damn you got me you got me dude it's so good that's like that was so funny like honestly i actually really enjoyed that tweet it made me it it made me chuckle on the inside least 71% of the employees there was something like 8,000 and it's around 2,000 now and it's still operating fine yeah there were by the way i'm not saying anything about elon musk i have my own personal opinions about the guy but you'll notice i i i tend not to voice a lot of those kind of opinions on this channel i tend not to try to take down individuals or say things for the most part yeah know that's just a me thing that's a that's that's a me personal thing it's kind of one of those things that i've been trying to uphold the re it's just it's just it's just a me thing okay some growing pains at first or shrinking pains at first but it's working other tech companies looked at this they saw how many literally millions of dollars a month in operating cost it's saving them getting rid of all fine i'll fine fine i'll tell you what i think about elon musk i'll tell you flip zoom in yeah zoom in deep get right into my face i don't care all these employees now other companies are going like well you know stock evaluation does matter but making money matters too and that also affects stock evaluation so i think other people especially ceos now are starting to see how bloated their corporations are and they're starting to kind of go the elon route which is just the idea of well do we really need 6,000 people at facebook working on the ui no i don't think that they do i don't think they do it all i don't think they need more than a couple dozen at most and that might even be over hiring that might again agree with the idea and principle he really just needs to correct his specific takes which is more ownership and expectation should be delivered to engineers and when you don't need that many engineers you should cut the ones you don't need i think that's a better way to say it but man this man's been bruised by buttons this man there there's this man has been bruised by buttons and he's he's hurting okay he's hurting like i can't say how many i i i i cannot say how many devs are needed at twitter before elon took over probably needed less devs after elon's taken over probably need more devs but where is that line i have no i have no clue cuz i don't literally i literally don't know might even be bloated i think just a few guys can usually build great uis in ux experiments that's my opinion you know i've run lean startups so i kind of have at least a inkling of an idea what to do but i can't speak for facebook i don't know how many people they need i know it's not 6,000 though so i think a big part of the layoffs are are just they over hired to begin with if we look at cloud fair right now this has been making big news just the last few days cloud fair is doing basically secret layoffs now no one has the full we did we watched the lady that filmed herself getting laid off damn damn son that one was that cloud fair i mean that one that one was that that that was a video information on how many people they're letting go or anything but it appears as though they're firing people at cause but there is no cause and they're not listing causes which is really it's just layoffs in disguise because layoffs sound bad so they don't want their stock value to go down but they want to have their cake and eat it too they want to get rid of people to save money and i have seen from the videos i've watched of people talking about this and from the articles i've read of people who are getting laid off it seems to me that they're getting rid of those hypers specialized jobs that they probably didn't need to begin with so i think cloud fair is already you know kind of following in the footsteps of they're doing the same thing that everybody else is doing right now and i think it's sad and i think it's sad that they're disingenuous about it and not telling people the truth that's bad for employees and that's bad for the company ultimately because it really doesn't inspire that's actually a pretty reasonable take at the end that was actually a pretty that was a pretty nice take at the end that it it is not good to have these fake layoffs and all that it is not good for anybody right it doesn't make anybody feel better i don't think it creates confidence in the company you know there's a lot of stuff i wish i had the ability to ramble like this for 30 minutes holy [ __ ] technically we're only at' minutes okay and i i feel like i've been i i actually feel like i'm the one doing all the rambling here trust in the company employees don't want to go work for cloud fair if they know that they're kind of secretly behind the scenes firing people that they never should have hired to begin with that's just called by the way that is really good i mean can we can we all agree with this it's actually he's talking about you oh thanks tj that's shut up tj that's actually one of the reasons so to be completely fair when i started at netflix 10 years and 6 months ago when i went to netflix one of the things one of the very first things they said on the culture deck is we hire fast we fire fast it made me excited it made me excited because that means this is a company that's going to care right like i was excited for the challenge yeah we are a team not a family like that that was in their culture deck we're a team we're not a family don't like we're not loyal do good work get compensated well don't do good work get a generous severance package literally in the old culture deck it was so much more blunt and i loved it and i mean truly i think the downfall of netflix culture has been the reduction in the intense language and one of my favorite statements in the old one was be be an' player get paid a team well be a b team player get an get a a team severance something along that line it was like really like to the point and it was awesome it was so okay stop making fun of falor falor did solve a specific problem that we had on devices right they did like it it was such a like i really loved that falor was the right tool for the job for the what we were solving we had memory problems i know you guys have never worked in a memory constrained environment but imagine working in a memory constrained environment while using javascript okay you may not realize how hard it is but it is not easy okay it's not it's not i try you no shut we're not bringing up never ending story okay it's hard bad management unity said that they're firing something around 2,000 people maybe it was 1,800 or something around that it was about 25% of their workforce now it's not doing it all in one day they're going to kind of spread it out over the next few months i think this is a really good example of a company that's having to lay people off for both reasons they have terrible management there's no debate that they tried to screw over every game developer everybody that used unity everybody that worked with including myself i'm literally in the process of building a game in unity and then i go to my news app one day and find out unity is going to charge for installs which is just outright blatantly the stupidest business move i've ever seen in any industry i think that ultimately that will kill unity as a company so yeah i think with unity it goes way beyond just they over hired but if you look at who they're firing they're not getting rid of their best programmers so yeah we're seeing of course companies are t again i i i i love what he's saying but i think he's fundamentally incorrect in pointing out what the problem is it's not it's thor first off thor i'm not sure if thor said gdo is better than y i'm pretty sure he said here's the different strengths and weaknesses of each engine you should choose the one you want to use i'm pretty sure that thor's like literal words thor is entirely too pragmatic to just say blanket statements gau is better than unity okay come on come on come on he said it but with a much sexier voice the thing that i think he's really truly missing here is that the driving factor isn't like it's not employees that's not the problem the reason why unity was in the position it was in is that they went public they asked for money to expand they got the money to expand and so the expectation was more revenue they had to hire more and more people to be able to grow the product as fast as possible when you hire too many people you add in a bunch of process complexity you add in a bunch of relational complexity you add in a bunch of just people that may or may not be the best fit that adds software complexity and at the end of the day they had to increase their revenue and they couldn't keep on going with their per seat model because they did what is considered the biggest fousy in bargain which is becoming a publicly traded company in which you're ever required to get gain more revenue over and over again so what ends up happening they have to go and try to create a new revenue stream and the only way to create a new revenue stream is either by ads which they're trying to do or b they're going to need to take be able to charge more to the people creating sl downloading games and so what are they going to do they're going to have to get in between every single purchase and how do they try to do that they did it by an install fee stupidest plan ever absolutely really didn't think that one through i'm glad they walked it back but nonetheless they added yet another fee because what are they beholden to they're not beholden to how many employees they have they are beholden to how much revenue they create that is what it is and so if if you ever think that the number of employees correlates to what the problem is i think you're fundamentally wrong you are simply looking at a correlation and calling it the causation that's not the problem targeting the employees that don't matter so my advice i guess to you if you are a programmer and you're watching this now and you're looking to get a job try to avoid getting a hypers specialized job to begin with make it so that you're somebody that can't be easily fired make it so that you're in a role that is at least some sort of general rule that's not too hypers specialized so that you're valuable to the company and when push comes to shove and they have to get rid of people they're going to get rid of you last so here i have a list of companies that are doing layoffs as we speak and or going to do layoffs have announced they're going to do some and in the past year doing major layoffs and this i will say one thing that i really enjoyed about being at netflix over this over these last couple years because it's been pretty it's been pretty what's it called it's been pretty tumultuous for a lot of companies is netflix laid off 100 people and it had to do with us reducing our animation i believe is what we said i can't remember our exact reason we said publicly but we are effectively deines from a specific content vertical line and we are slowly releasing those people from that content vertical line and like that's it and so that was fantastic you know that's one thing that's been very nice is working at a company that doesn't have the ever threat of of layoffs for people that are working on that honestly i'm so sorry like that has to be so dang hard to work at a company that you have the threat the looming threat of layoffs at all points like the amount of twitch staff engineers that i like got to talk to that they learned that onethird of twitch is being laid off by a bloomberg news article and they had to wait more than 24 hours to learn if they're the one in bloomberg that was mentioned like that's so dang awful like that that level of awful i can't even like i can't even fathom that should be illegal i don't think being shitty should be illegal and i mean that i don't think being a shitty company should be illegal that's just shitty business practices and what that's going to mean is that their pick their their their ability to hire the cream of the crop just simply went down that's it right it hurts them in the long run because like me personally if you said hey do you want to work at twitch you're going to have a really hard time convincing me to work at twitch because i looked at what they did and i said like right like that's hard hey youin youin one of the people caught astray on on the layoffs right this is just a few of them this isn't all of them this is just the big ones we've got amazon they' fired thousands of people already and they're planning thousands more same thing with ibm thousands of people have been fired and let go dell rivan ibm's a unique story like a lot of these things he's saying like ibm has what 400,000 employees so if they fire a thousand employees like is firing 0.25% of your staff like is that like is that crazy it's not it's like it i mean is that crazy i you know microsoft google is or alphabet is firing 30,000 people we've got salesforce that fired 8,000 i think if i recall correctly meta facebook 10,000 they're doing a bunch more too coinbase fired th like 1,500 i think i could be wrong on that one you've got zoom fired tons of people spotify dropbox yahoo epic games just fired 800 people again i looked at the charts of who they were firing i looked at personal opinions i looked at twitter and it seemed to me like epic was firing almost entirely people they should have never hired to begin with xerox twitch atlassian amd intel lift and uber are firing thousands highland software noia nokia's firing 14,000 people in its tech can we just take a moment here nokia's still a company wow i know every time i every time i re-remember that nokia is a company i go the [ __ ] what sector you've got linkedin firing thousands qualcomm oracle shopify group on and there's like three or four dozen more big companies that i didn't even list almost all of them across the board were vastly over hiring and i can we take a one quick second to jump in here he just named all those companies i bet you could take any single one of those companies right now and you could go on google and say jobs at and they have open software engineering jobs right now so i think i think this backs up the point that they are firing people they did not need i think that i i think his observation again is correct and i've said this a few times now i cuz you could definitely go to any of those places and you could find that they're definitely hiring right now there were some good hires that got let go there were some of bad hires that that got that stayed right that did happening that did happen blackberry pivoted to networking they're doing very well that's about the last thing i think i would have ever thought i would read but here we are i me here we are engineers just thousands and thousands of more people than they needed there were employee farming that's all it is so so easy to look at this and think oh these companies are firing people in anticipation for of just a recession yeah that's probably a factor but yeah i think it goes way beyond that one other thing i want to talk about too is how awful tech interviews have become now i want to make a totally separate video about we got the the we got two minutes left of this video and this is where we're going you can't you can't just start there this later but because of this hyp specialization tech interview are just they're garbage now they're the most painful process to go through and they require so much unnecessary hyp specialized details when you're interviewing i just hate it so if you're out there and you're interviewing this is actually good news for you because we're going to start to see hiring practices massively shift instead of doing these hypers specialized roles all these companies are going to realize that it might actually be more profitable not to just follow the crowd of what people have done for the last 5 years 10 years but they're going to start hiring more generalists and people who wear more hats and have more value to the company so we're going to see a lot more useful tech interviews you're going to go into a tech interview they're going to test you on the basics of the knowledge we're going to start seeing fizzbuzz probably make a comeback which will be really funny and by the way i so just to be fair i probably asked fizzbuzz a hundred times in an interview fizzbuzz is one of my favorite questions to ask when someone doesn't know what fizzbuzz is it's like i honestly i think it's great it is an incredible problem to sus out how somebody thinks it's it's really really great it's really really great do people really not know fizzbuzz you are on a you you might be a little bit more terminally online than the average individual and we're just going to see more useful interviewing done probably by more useful people who are less hypers specialized themselves so i think that's one good thing that will come out of this if you're a good programmer i think you will actually become more in demand and you will probably make more money too because as they weed out all the people that are too specialized or maybe aren't general enough don't understand architecture well enough we're going to see the value proportionately increase of individual programmers and we saw this happen in the reverse direction the last kind of 20 30 years where programmers used to have super high wages proportionately to everything else and now today programmers make kind of much more similar money to a lot of bluecollar jobs i mean the average programming wage in america is between like 80 and $120,000 that's also what the average journeyman electrician makes now i mean things have really shift a little bit of too much correlation going here again you know what i mean there's a little bit of correlation going here that's not the problem with what he just said is that there there is such a a deep need for people who are skilled craftsmen right now that wages have risen incredibly fast in the trades and so like that's real and so saying that oh this mean you know look at this these these things are now lining up that's not that's not fair it's not fair we're having an aging out problem in the trades because of an because of a computer effectively revolution a tech revolution that's happened 20 years ago and so now it's just like now it's going yeah good skilled tradesmen are super hard to find that's because they're aging out and now you're left with a bunch of young dummies that don't know how to do it nearly as well absolutely think that like honestly if my kid said hey i'm going to go be a i'm going to go be a trades person i'd be like go get it buddy go go get it because that is i think that's that's a very valuable job and that's going to continue to be a very valuable job for a long time shed to blue color jobs being almost as valuable that's probably just due to oversaturation in the industry so it'll be what if you like driving buses i would not do that one a good thing to see that kind of change and shift back to what it really should be thank you so much for watching this video i really do appreciate it i'm going to try to start getting more active on my channel again please like this video subscribe down below make sure you click the notification i'm probably a new video every week thank you so much for watching again and see you later all right well i think again producer look i released this video two days ago stop showing me my own videos oh i mean overall i really liked that video i really did like the video and i think it led to a lot of really cool things to look and think about i i i think some of his his reasonings is where i thought was poor everything else you know every i know tech lead can you believe it the tech lead is here dude how how does that man survive can we all just take a moment and think how did that guy survive his personality shocking it's absolutely shocking it's shocking that that man can go on the internet and be like women shouldn't program and then he still makes a comeback i mean absolutely wild absolut i mean absolutely wild that that you could do that but you know i i think it just goes to show how many people art on the internet and they just don't care you know what i mean the art of the clickbait better than me i i i ain't good at it i'll tell you that much i ain't good at it at all it's because he's a millionaire oh that's what it requires i don't think that's i don't think that's how the internet works all right anyways i i really like the video and i think that it's it's definitely something to really mle over in your head in the sense of what do you want to see yourself doing in 5 years do you really want to continue down a hyp specialization on just react like maybe that just makes you happy and like that's okay that's okay if that's what you want right but also take some time to do other things learn other things become specialized in many things become a jack of all trades master of one it's okay to be a master of one but a jack of all trades you know because that was the original phrase i hope you i hope you guys know that that the original one was a jack of all trades and a master of one it became a joke to say my husband's a master of all trades and or a jack of all trades and a master of none right it was like it was the joke that became the that became the phrase so you know do that react can be your mastery that's that's fine if that's what you want go for it but be a master of but be a be a be of jack of all traits it will help you more than anything else the name you know the name don't even come at me like that okay if you don't know my name by now well the name's the prime if if you don't know it the name is the prime you know i'm just really
