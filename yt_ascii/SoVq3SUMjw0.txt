with over 100 employees producing nearly 20 videos a week there are very few companies quite like linus media group so what's it like being an employee here i don't know i'm the boss which is why my team has put together this video to try and explain what it's like to work for me with me and near me at this wild company and we're gonna see if i'm completely out of touch the only rules are that i'm not allowed to be involved in this video at all including watching it and i need to tell you about our sponsor asus gaming on the go check out the asus rog strix xg16a hpe portable monitor it's a 15.6 inch 1080p 144 hertz display that offers smooth gameplay and has a fold out kickstand that supports multiple viewing positions check it out at the link below yeah my name is sarah butt i'm a designer here and occasional host and i've been here for about three years i'm sean caldera i am our marketing lead here at linus media group and i've been working here since june 2022. i'm anthony i'm a writer i've been working here since 2017. what i'm emily i'm a video editor here part-time camera operator sometimes supervisor sometimes my name is arthur some of you guys might know me as artie i am the social media manager i'm maria i am the thumbnail artist and i also take pictures for the merch store i run tech linked and lmg clips and the pre-production part of the wan show and i've been here since april 2018. that was part time though i think if we look back at the original goal of creating a team that was fun to work with and hardworking and passionate that it's absolutely been a huge success what's your favorite part of working at lmg oh jesus christ it's gonna sound cheesy but my favorite part about working here is the people i know blah blah blah should be something better but i find there's a lot of like-minded people that have very enjoyable conversations with on a daily basis and i often find that i would rather just hang around and talk with my co-workers than work so i think my favorite part of working here is the variety and there's also a lot of freedom to do the weird stuff that nobody else would be able to every day and i'm learning something every project whether it's something new or something i already know about i'm gonna have to learn more about it i get to come in work on crazy problems most of which are linus's fault but you know it's it's fun my favorite part of working at lmg is probably how different it is every day there's always like 600 different things i should be doing and there's about' hours of work that needs to be completed i think one of the worst parts about working at lmg is that there's like' hours of work to do every day and all the tasks are very varied i would probably say call bolton it's fun stuff but in a hurry every week is stressful every friday every day is hard the upside of that is that you don't look at the clock and go oh it's only two you go oh my god it's already two which makes for a happier life i think it's just that your life might be shortened we're growing pretty fast right now and that presents a bunch of challenges in terms of like getting systems in place i don't really think that's a negative thing that's just something we have to push through i don't follow things up i am kind of scatter shot when it comes to training especially documentation like creating processes is not something that i'm good at at all i find it frustrating sometimes i wish we could collaborate a little bit more and so i think that ties into i don't love that we have to release so many videos i don't know what our current count is weekly but i know it's very high and every video has to make it out and there's not you know a huge amount of resources or time that can be given to any particular one and so i find very rarely in my particular really proud of a video i've worked on because of the rising production values in our videos i feel a lot like i'm crunching more than i ever was that and we're much more strict about how much time we're able to work in the course of the day so like i can't stay a little longer in one day to make sure i don't have to rush the next day so everything's kind of more compressed and there's more to it and i feel like a lot of the time i'm i'm just like rushing i don't like arriving at a set time i don't like leaving at a set time i don't like working exactly eight hours per day if i could do six one day and ten the next i think that would be great the problem is that no matter what it is if you have any kind of flexibility someone is going to ruin it for everyone and the bigger you get the better the chances that that's going to happen i'd say fat i've gained 30 pounds since i started here and yet i'm somehow always tired talking sucks there's no parking if you're not here by like nine o'clock you're probably not getting a parking spot and you're gonna have to park on the street i think the worst part about working here is for a long time my direct report was linus and he is the most stubborn person i've ever met in my entire life when he does like the thumbnail reviews with me one day he told me like oh why do you have my eyes blue i didn't turn your eyes blue like what are you talking about like he's in his own world and he's very busy linus is the only boss i've ever had who hides in the bathroom to avoid doing work and that makes him very relatable to me he farts a lot just constantly generally he has a super good spirit about everything that we're doing and he obviously cares a lot about all of the projects that we're working on too i think linus is a very good boss he does have his ego he does have his like you know biggest fish in this bowl kind of thing going on he does surround himself with like dissenting viewpoints i think working for me is the experience that you make it and i see that people will just kind of treat me however they think a boss should be treated we yell at each other a lot the only thing that i can really do is say look don't call me sir or you know whatever else right and i tell him he's an idiot he's very demanding and he has have really high standards he does change his mind but it's usually for a good reason so i've only ever had to basically argue full stop once i enjoy working with linus a lot when i first started at the company i was worried you know i would find him to be a rich guy weasel full of himself but what i find that he's more grounded and he's self-deprecating in a way that i really appreciate if i had to distill down what makes me good at this i think it's a combination of just generally being passionate about technology and having really though my superpower is that i get bored before anyone else gets a chance to you know it's from the writing team linus we should do a video about this i'm like ah yeah we've done something kind of like that i don't want to do that again you know or the audience saying we want more power supply unboxings and i go these are played out i have nothing left to say i'm bored let's move on i think that's what's kept the channel fresh all these years when i'm training new designers on my team to work with lightness the first thing i say is don't tell him no right like he's going to come with you with an idea and he's going to be super passionate about it and your job is not to say no but it's to give him every single reason why not to do it or if it's not a dumb idea what challenges present him in going the part that he chooses right it's like it's kind of like diverting his attention into like the channel rather than him doing a shotgun of like this is what it should be so working with lightness is like trying to guide her river sometimes it's like you can't stop it but you might be able to get it to move in a particular direction there's a lot of energy behind it sometimes it's a little intimidating because like to me he's still like a celebrity i know we you know we work together you know i'm able to talk to him whenever but to me he's he's such a he's that guy you know i don't know this is the lioness of lions tech tips can be a little daunting but once you get comfortable in your position and he starts to get to know you he's a great guy when he's outside of his persona of like on and getting ready to be on camera he's super generous super nice intense a little bit when he's filming but i think in the way of wanting to be constructive and get things running the best they can do what he's not like other people i have a psychology degree i could talk about linus for decades i think on camera he just has to be flamboyant and really out there but that's not necessarily who he is all the time otherwise he would like combust like you can't have that energy all the time he's happy on camera and a normal person when he's not on camera slightly more likable in person if you've seen the wan show you pretty much know what linus is like in person it's not like going to be an ellen degeneres situation where he's like a jerk he's a very nice person he's very good at keeping his cool he's very professional last time i saw him get like mad on like pretty mad because the shoot was a complete debacle and very public was two years ago already but i if i was in his position i would have a way worse reputation i would describe myself as an a type chaotic generally trying to do the right thing but also resigned to the fact that i can't change everything and i think that can come across badly sometimes i care too much how has lmg changed since you've started bro how has lmg changed since i started oh my god it's gone from it's sort of a company to it's definitely a company like i'll level with you i don't actually know half of the people who work here anymore we're in multiple buildings multiple different departments managers i mean even just the the that standard hierarchy that you have of like a department and a manager reporting to the ceo is like fairly new we've also added channels we've added labs i mean we've hired so many people i can't hold the door open for anyone because i have no idea if they actually work here and then as you grow that rapidly you have to start dealing with like real company stuff like hey we need a system for this because it's almost like unmanageable by a single person or double the amount of people using the shops and that means there's triple the amount of mess we went from just a few of us in the garage trying to survive with the hope that one day we will have enough revenue that we can all make a comfortable living i was hand assembling our first set with sheets of drywall and a two by two frame that i didn't even know how to do properly like i did everything myself whereas now i get in trouble for doing things myself i wanted to walk between the offices and james like pulled me aside and was like you can't do that that costs us whatever an opportunity cost i mean there's someone standing right out there making sure that i go to wherever i'm supposed to go to next right now in some ways i'm the boss and other ways i just ordered around all day how's linus changed well of course as the audience knows he's gone through the whole how am i gonna retire portion the environment around him has changed like it used to be the case where he could just easily say i would go and hang out with everyone who works here anyone who works here is cool and like they're all great people it's like now he just doesn't even know that it might seem like linus has changed but the thing is that everything else around him has changed and he hasn't and that's where some of the the idea that you know linus is out of touch because spending a thousand dollars on a gpu doesn't sound like a bad idea anymore but that's mostly because the shock is worn off like it's it's been like that for years now i was very naive coming into this i had no idea where this was headed i think i've had to grow up or at least act like i've grown up a lot i have to be more professional now than i used to be luke tells me i've changed he says it's mostly okay though he still likes to use windows when it's not acceptable like in a server he still is very stubborn i do miss when things were simpler and i think that you would you would miss that because it's it's fun you know it's like there's not really a hierarchy you're just kind of trying to get it out the door and to a certain extent we still do that but doing the hard stuff is fun for a while and then you kind of get sick of it and now you want help i miss how it used to be every day but i also see the opportunity that is over the horizon because if i wasn't looking for what's new what's next what are the career advancement possibilities here ed would still be our only video editor luke would still be what making notes for scripts come on right nobody's gonna stick around for that i think our retention here has been really good and i think that's a big part of it i think maybe there's an assumption that like working for a youtube company is going to be this otherworldly experience like we're running around as if we're doing channel super fun stuff all the time but in reality it's surprisingly normal we get to make cool content that lots of people enjoy but at the end of the day i'm just sitting at a desk like you you know it's not really any different it's not as easy as we made a video there's people behind it and that's the whole story our hosts the our staff they don't really put on a persona when they're behind the camera that is them and that's something i think a lot of people don't realize especially when when people comment you know whenever people have criticism obviously we take it in but you know sometimes people aren't so constructive about it i mean go on the subreddit and read the comments 95 of them are completely incorrect and four percent of them are mostly incorrect leaving one percent that has any modicum of correctness to it the subreddit infuriates me there's always a few people that you're like that person i hate that person so the things that i would change are probably things that would just hurt us overall i'd be like let's not have deadlines let's let's publish less videos if i could change one thing about lmg i'd make a car channel yeah yeah i wish we could back off the amount and focus on quality for a bit and kind of raise the bar of what we're outputting a little bit more i would like to focus on more content that is less expensive it's hard to make that content but at the same time i think there's a huge audience for people who want that so that's what i would like to see more time for projects would be good i would probably try and hire like five more writers and just allow us more time to work on a video we never have time for retrospection it's always just that's out what's the next thing moving forward moving forward moving forward i acknowledge that it's a treadmill but the reality of it is that that's not a pace that i set that's a pace that's set by the platform a pace that's set by the audience a pace that's set by the tech industry in general i think it's kind of in our dna i think if we ever freed up more hours we would just we'll have a whale land let's we just are always put i think that's part of the culture that comes from linus and goes all the way down it's like we're just always gonna squeeze every last drop out would be nice if the pace was lessened a little bit so we could just like relax maybe just like have some meetings on fridays have time to like debris if you look in the rear of your mirror though how things went but honestly what the main thing i would change is the location i would move the office i would go to the cheapest cost of living place can we relocate to calgary like is that an option more dinosaurs have a better snack bar like the one in qvc house on his studio i think just adding more people and personalities and getting to show more vloggy stuff and i think having an opportunity to show off some of the great people here that the audience doesn't get to meet that are really awesome people but i think we should continue to raise up the new or next generation of hosts and personalities [laughter] taking pictures of my boss in underwear for lttsword.com modeling underwear was really weird posting mostly naked pictures of myself on the internet the door was closed and the lights were off and i opened the set and linus is standing there pulling up swim trunks he's basically buck ass naked and i'm standing there never met him before never seen him in person slack jaw just like he's like can i help you as he's pulling up his swim trunks i'm like hi i'm tim i'm from the labs i need to get behind you he's like oh you're one of gary's group that makes sense i've slapped linus in the face i've thrown dildos at dennis like there's a b-roll shot from the only fans video where i'm like wearing wearing some like quasi-fetish outfit anything for a video one of the weird things that happened to me was i was asked to buy a cantaloupe because we we needed an analog for someone's ass the weirdest thing i've had to do here was where james tribe's wife's pregnant belly cast under a dress for a photo shoot for a video i have multiple company tattoos on me for no reason i didn't get paid for those i have an ltt store tattoo i've got an illuminati tattoo i've got a dbrand tattoo is there anything that you wanted to say that i haven't covered if there's one more thing that i could tell the audience it would be this message from our sponsor magicspoon are you always reaching for that popcorn while binging your favorite show
