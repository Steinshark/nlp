your so has had enough of the giant glowing rgb tower and if you're being honest so have you but the solution obviously isn't to stop gaming what if we could tone things down a little though wooden computers have been around since at least the apple one but it's only recently that the aesthetic has made its way into high performance gaming hardware wooden case check wooden mechanical keyboard double check is this a wooden water cooling fitting though and how about this wooden segway to our sponsor grovemade who is also wooden all the gorgeous minimalist desk accessories that you'll see in this video are made by grovemade they're high quality products make any desk look better learn more about them later in the video or at the link down below you might be thinking come on there's no way you can build a whole pc out of wood accented parts and you'd be right a search for wood and ram is just going to give you a bunch of little carvings of sheep but that may not always be the case the world's very first wooden transistor was revealed just a few weeks ago so it's not that far-fetched to envision a future where biodegradable memory and cpus could take a dent out of the world z-waste problem but for now with the wooden transistor running at less than one cycle per second that's one not one megahertz and measuring about three centimeters across we can safely assume that we'll be waiting a while for intel to release the 386. the core eye tree yeah that's fair we're going to kick this off with our cpu cooler the ek quantum velocity squared 1700 lignum edition which is apparently latin for wood get your mind out of the gutter i mean lignum doesn't sound like something particularly savory to me but i'm not in charge of vk's branding okay anyway the point is at 190 dollars it's even more expensive than their standard quantum velocity squared but as far as we can tell ek is the only one that's making wood accented water cooling parts and our goal was to build something that you could actually replicate at home assuming that you had copious amounts of disposable income we're going to be installing it on an msi z790 carbon wi-fi because after all what is carbon if not burn into wood okay no but seriously the motherboard had more to do with just having a relatively clear cpu socket area for our hardline tubing for our cpu we've gone with a 24 core core i9 13900k since by the time we spent this much on our block why not and then we've paired it with a 32 gig kit of 6000 mega transfer per second cl32 ram from g-skill okay it does look pretty cool though i do have to question why this costs so much more than the acrylic one given that this case the fractal design north comes with so much more wood and is only 120 dollars for the whole case it also supports up to a 360 millimeter rad in the front a 240 millimeter in the top and has all the modern connectivity you'd want including usb type-c it's available in a number of different color schemes but we settled on the black and walnut because we figured i mean we'd be idiots to choose anything else that's what we have this is cool i like fractals completely recyclable packaging for their accessories and look at this little leather pull tab oh our power supply okay this might not seem to have anything to do with our wood theme here but the corsair rm1000x shift is super cool it moves its modular interface from this side to this side that gives us extra room down here in the basement for our ek quantum kinetic flt80 d5 pump reservoir combo where no one will notice that they are not made of wood truth is certain things shouldn't be made of wood and power supplies and water cooling reservoirs are chief among them oh wow this is quite the endeavor look at that not bad not bad at all totally hidden stealthy one kind of bummer with this power supply is it means you can't use off the shelf replacement cables so hopefully black matches the theme of your build how did nobody ever think of this and it just keeps getting smarter they've got six of their pcie cpu connectors over here and then they've got two of them over here why so they can run straight up here to where the eight pin is on most motherboards look at that clean flat there's one odd choice from the cable management perspective here there is no pass-through on this side of the top of the motherboard so you just have to kind of go through either this hole or way over here by the 8-pin connector if there's something else that i would have said no please no not out of wood it would have been fittings for our water blocks this kind of reminds me of back when they did acrylic fittings and you know they all cracked obviously but here we are the ek hdc lignum 12 millimeter is available with a walnut collar that honestly like kind of looks amazing you can't deny that looks pretty cool but it drives the cost up to 17 us dollars per fitting shout out ek for sending these over because that's over a hundred fifty dollars in fittings and there's just 10 of them in the whole build we're using a sabrin rocket 4 plus g2 terabyte because on the one hand we're balling out of control but on the other hand we spend all our money on wood water cooling fittings so this is a nice little middle ground for radiators we've chosen ek's quantum surface series for the front for its superior performance and their cool stream sc series for the top for its thinner profile and easier fit really okay i mean don't get me wrong love the wooden stuff couldn't have done this build without you but you use different threaded screws for your different lineups of radiators oh oh my god they have different heads on them too uh naturally we've gone with noctua's industrial ppc 2000 rpm fans meaning this machine is going to sound as good as it looks and as good as the ltt screwdriver feels should we do a wood one can we do a wood one yeah okay if that's possible then maybe but for now you can sign up for a notification for the noctua edition one or just get the regular black one lttstore.com i moved these fans to make it a little bit easier to do this run i think we're ready to tube we've pre-done most of our tubing runs cooking show style but we are going to have to do at least one of them because we screwed it up so so let's start by doing this back run here these work exactly the same way that any other hardline tubing fitting wood you know what i think we could probably just shorten this a touch try and get it level and then we're good i have actually never used a pipe cutter like this before oh wait can you tell time to double-sided tape our reservoir pump combo down because yep that's how we're doing it how am i supposed to get in there no i've got an idea i've got an idea we're just gonna ow ah let's see how close it is hey that's not bad right it's pretty straight ish don't look that close what are you doing get get out of here and now we get to mount our gpu which is oh by far the most exciting part this is a vector squared block the dk whipped up for us for the asus strix rtx 4090 they don't actually have this one available on their site yet but i guess nothing would prevent them from making it available if someone wanted it that means the last thing we want to do is put it in like this where we're barely going to see it no no we want the showcase position for it but for that we're going to use one of these cooler master universal horizontal to vertical mount adapters we just plug our pcie 16x in here we go then we take this bad boy and it's kind of mash it down a little something like that a bit of a tight fit back there but it seems to kind of work okay and now this guy oh boy oh that's actually a pretty tight fit you gotta love the rtx 4090 and this my friends is why we created the stubby version of the ltt screwdriver wow that's really heavy do we have a support brace or anything by any chance [music] no okay i mean oh idea wood hmm nope never mind oh crap if i get this i expect applause oh yeah oh yeah no problem no problem piece of cake one now we just need our second rgb connector wait what is this one for oh that's for our reservoir we don't need that oh interesting the cpu block doesn't have rgb okay well this is progress whoa the theme of the build is wood and sagging flaccid wood yeah it's not clicked on that's why it has hooks see that these hooks weren't on there we go i mean it's still a little sketchy but that's a lot better you know what's actually kind of nice about these fittings even if you're not into the wood aesthetic because they're a little bit bigger than most fittings really easy to thread them on okay where's my last caller at right this is the one where i'm missing an o-ring and i'm extremely upset about it okay maybe if i do this it'll appear yep oh did it really by your foot right foot yes i got my o-ring back i get so upset about little things like missing o-rings because little things can cause big problems someone goes to do a wood themed pc sometime in the future and they use that fitting without realizing that someone put that fitting away without realizing that there was no o-ring water goes everywhere and you've ruined an rtx 60 90. nice or something like that and now we have the fitting that looks freaking awesome this will be interesting we actually tried to fill a loop with this particular reservoir combo yesterday and it was challenging and it's not right side up again so cool yeah maybe i'll just lay the computer down on its side that does make it a little bit more difficult for me to see what's going on but who needs to see anything let's go you know what i feel like we need david somewhere for the air that the water is displacing to go we're gonna crack a fitting somewhere in this system so i think what we're gonna do yeah yeah like this we're gonna pile up a bunch of paper towel here and then i'm basically just gonna crack this fitting in the top radiator and we're just gonna run it i mean wood's waterproof right they leave trees out in the rain all the time are you guys are you guys are you seeing any water in the tubes hey look at that man if we had a taller tube here we could actually feel even more of it okay this is where things are going to get really sketchy if this wasn't sketchy enough for you okay i'm just gonna i'm just gonna crack this just a little just a little just a little while the water starts moving just a little just a little crack you know and then when the water goes then i'm just gonna jam the tube back in boy the water it's squirted out a little bit and everything is fine the lube's filled the setup is set up oh i am like an ale have we actually seen this thing post yet oh boy if i heard up fresh show me the output oh man i feel bad covering it up yeah that sucks hey i do not know where my delete key is i don't think it gets much more wooden than this my friends is the experience good i mean you tell me how flipping quiet is this okay even with bubbles in the pump this thing makes no noise at all it looks absolutely amazing oh i guess now's as good a time as i need to shout out our sponsor for all these cool desk accessories it's a pencil got their headphone stand they've also got oh does anyone have an iphone i have an iphone no i don't have an iphone i lied actually i told you guys i had an iphone earlier boom whoa whoa three teams notifications what a popular guy probationary employee number 37 this keyboard is sick is this from grovemade no no well it's sick anyway wow the keycaps are off of etsy sorry how much are these keycaps 300 300 keycaps was the idea to make these ek blocks look affordable geez i mean they look great though don't they got my grove made wrist rest the mouse i gotta say the mouse is really letting it down though it's not walnut like basically everything else it's bamboo and yeah i think the most positive thing i can say about it is it's
