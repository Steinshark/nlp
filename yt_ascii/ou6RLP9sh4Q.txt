hello everyone and welcome this is just such a strange vehicle i am in the alfa romeo stelvio quadrifoglio as you can see i can't wipe this smile off my face this thing is it's bizarre to me because i know internally that suvs don't work as sports cars i know that that shouldn't be a thing suvs suck to drive and i don't mean that in a way like they're not comfortable or it's not pleasant to go on a road trip in an suv i mean that from an enthusiast standpoint they're not good cars to drive they're not exciting to drive and i think there's three main reasons for that first of all suvs are big and the bigger the thing is the more detached you feel from it i feel like you know an extreme example would be like do you think the captain of an aircraft carrier is like yeah like i really feel this thing going around you know it's just kind of this clueless thing where you're just wandering out at sea it doesn't feel connected in any way on the opposite end if you get in a go court you feel absolutely everything the thing's really tiny and as a result of being so tiny you know where everything's at you feel very connected to it that's the reason one why suvs suck reason two why they suck to drive is because they're so heavy and this thing here weighs 4 400 pounds it's a heavy thing and weight is the enemy of everything that's good about driving handling braking acceleration it all gets worse with weight and finally the center of gravity and so in an suv the center of gravity is going to be higher than in a core and with a high center of gravity you start to get more body roll you start to get more body movement and you get this uncertainty associated with it it's not as it's not as connected and you're just not sure about what it's doing you know again going back to that go-kart very low weight and very low center of gravity and you feel absolutely everything so you feel super connected but what we're in right now this stelvio it's just crazy it feels so good i mean not only is this the best suv from a driver's perspective that i've ever driven it's one of the best cars i've ever driven i mean this thing is truly phenomenal the way that it handles under the hood is a 2.9 liter twin turbo v6 engine producing 505 horsepower and 443 pound-feet of torque it's sending that power to an 8-speed automatic transmission zf automatic transmission it's fantastic shifting is great if you want to put it in manual mode these shifters are wonderful the shift speed is insanely fast it's just a great transmission and that power is being sent to all four wheels now this has a 50 50 weight distribution and another really cool thing about it is that it only channels power to the front wheels if it needs it so it can send a hundred percent of the torque to those rear wheels which gives it that real lively feel as you're accelerating around corners and you know it only sends that power forward if you need it to and so from a driver's perspective having a rear-wheel drive biased all-wheel drive vehicle that can you know if you start to get crazy it can send power to the front that's just phenomenal from a field perspective and from a driving perspective as far as you know putting down lap times for example driving really fast and this thing went around the nurburgring in under eight minutes an suv under eight minutes around the ring which is just astounding it's it's pretty incredible what it's done now i'm not going to infinitely brag about these things because i do think that there are very major flaws but a couple more compliments to give for it first of all these seats are fantastic you can adjust the bolstering here i'm a super skinny guy as you might have noticed and as a result most seats i don't actually get to sit in and have good bolstering i have a bit of a gap and this one you can adjust them in really good bowl string so as you go around that corner it really hugs you keeps you in the seat you're not moving around at all that also helps aid in that confidence and gives you a more connected feel when your body isn't moving around and you're instead feeling what the car is doing rather than what your body is doing on top of that i do really like the simplicity of the interior in here i think that's something that alpha kind of does is they keep things simple interior wise and it's not the nicest place in the world to be but overall they've done a really good job of just keeping it simple and clean so you know looking at this dash looking across it it's got a nice simple layout to it you've got the carbon woven in which looks pretty cool the leather up on top here there are some plastic bits as you go around but it looks nice it looks clean and it's simple and i like that simplicity now as i mentioned though this car isn't perfect and in fact i think it has some pretty major flaws because i think as an suv it kind of sucks like it's not a great suv it's a great driving vehicle yes but not a great suv so why isn't it a great suv well i think some people do buy suvs for the practical purpose of them perhaps you know a lot of the market out there just wants something that rides a little bit higher and that's it or perhaps they feel is safer because it's bigger and heavier but i think some people genuinely do buy suvs because they want the practical aspects of it rear leg room so you can fit your friends plenty of cargo space in the br in the backseat that you can bring whatever perhaps a tow rating so that you can take your toy to the lake whatever that may be and that's where looking at this vehicle it really starts to kind of fall apart the rear leg room is pretty minimal so myself i'm quite cramped back there the rear cargo space behind the rear seats isn't all that impressive there are crossovers with significantly larger you know rear cargo spaces than this and the tow rating it's kind of surprising i mean when you think of this like sporty suv i guess you don't think so much about a tow rating but it's only three thousand pounds and so okay maybe you're thinking well none of that all sounds all that bad but consider that this car starts at eighty thousand dollars and there's a couple other fast suvs out there which you can purchase for eighty thousand dollars or around that price range one of them being the dodge durango srt which has the 6.4 liter crazy fast vehicle zero to sixty and four point four seconds this is zero to 60 and 3.6 so yes it is faster but the dodge durango you know 8700 pound tow rating much higher till rating it's got almost seven inches more rear leg room it's got triple the cargo space behind the rear seats that's because of course it's a three row so if you do put up the three row then you're going to have a little bit less you know talking about boring suvs i don't mind all that much that i am surrounded right now by these dump trucks looks like they're actually turning off so perhaps we'll have some clean road again that is quite nice adios dump trucks so dodge durango way more practical not as fast won't handle anything like this but then the other option is the jeep trackhawk which just is a bit more expensive about 86 000 but this car as equipped is 85 so not a huge difference the jeep track hawk which you know 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds so just a hint quicker than this alpha male has a tow rating 200 pounds it's got almost 7 inches more of rear legroom it functions as an suv even though you know it's this 6.2 liter supercharged hellcat engine beast of a vehicle it also functions as an suv so part of me thinks if you're buying an suv and you want it to be fast then you would buy a trackhawk or a dodge durango srt if you're buying something that's really sporty but you kind of want it to be an suv and not as practical then you could get the stelvio and so you know if this was the only core alfa romeo made i would just praise it endlessly but they happen to make the julia and the julia is one of the most fun cars i've driven it's absolutely fantastic it's faster around the ring 20 seconds faster than this car so it does that sporty feeling that sporty amazingness that alfa romeo has really really well and it doesn't have weird sacrifices like this does because this is an suv so sure maybe it's mildly more practical than the julia you probably can't tow with the julia but 3 000 pounds isn't all that much you don't have all that much cargo space you know double in the grand cherokee triple and the durango so to me at the price point it's at it's a really strange vehicle because it's an suv that's amazing to drive which no other suv is but it's a bad suv for being an suv so again i have very mixed feelings about this car i'm not sure what to think about it but those are my thoughts if you want the best driving suv on the planet i haven't driven the lamborghini urus maybe that car is fun but this thing is truly phenomenal to drive and you know it's it's gonna have i guess a little bit more cargo space than the julia so you can spend more money than the julia i think that starts at 74. so six grand more you can ride up high and not seem to sacrifice the handling you know benefits or the handling benefits of a car so yeah it's a it's a very interesting vehicle i have quite enjoyed driving it it is just a ton of fun but if you want you know the fastest practical suv i guess then you would just get a trackhawk so i don't know mixed feelings anyways that's the end of my rant i hope you all are having a wonderful day and enjoyed watching this thank you so much if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below so good
