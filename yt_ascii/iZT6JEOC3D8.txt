to defeat mike tyson / mr. dream with my with my eyes closed is a dream i suppose so you're not going to get to see me beat mike tyson at a marathon ever blindfolded this will be the comic relief of the evening but mr. dream with my eyes closed and i'm going to lose i'll fight him blindfolded just for fun but you know this this is the blindfolded part portion of the run is pretty much over [music] have you ever played a game so much you think you could beat it with your eyes closed for nearly everybody for nearly every game that's just a dream that could never be accomplished but for one game a boxing game from 1987 a group of gamers have attempted to make that dream a reality mike tyson's punch-out is a game where reaction and quick decision-making is necessary for completion you've got to look at what the boxers are doing and adjust to play accordingly of course this involves careful reading in the situation in front of you in order to do that you'll have to use your eyes carefully at least if you're a normal player for the past several years a dedicated group of gamers have worked with each other in an attempt to complete as much of mike tyson's punch-out as possible while blindfolded it involves dodging out of the way of punches that cannot be seen and figuring out when you're invisible opponents and guard is down it may seem like an impossible challenge to most but if there's one thing this pyramid community is good at its doing the impossible [music] [music] it's impossible to say for certain when blindfolded punch-out was initially attempted they were probably people trying it just for fun back in the 80s and 90s it's unclear how far they got and it's unclear how many people were trying it however as far as this video is concerned the primary area of focus will be what's out there on the internet stuff with video proof and that story begins in 2010 at classic games done quick the very first edition of the annual charity speedrunning marathon andrew g who at the time held the world record for the original super mario brothers was there to do a speedrun of the game with the simple goal of beating it as fast as possible however he first did an attempt of playing through the game blindfolded it was not the cleanest attempt he hadn't really done much practice beforehand he was just trying to get as deep into the game as he could but even though he didn't make it past 1-2 it's still made for a really fun run [music] the crowd was into the run and rudy was into the run and everybody watched and was having fun one of those people watching was sinister1 a future mike tyson's punch-out speed runner according to sinister1 this run ultimately inspired him to try something similar a couple years later but instead of super mario bros he would be playing mike tyson's punch-out sinister1 was one of the best mike tyson's punch-out players in the world when this run is performed in january 2012 but he had achieved all of his personal bests and world records with his eyes open and when playing with eyes open the rules of punch-out are quite simple the basics of this game are dodging and punching you must dodge out of the way when your opponent throws a punch and punch your opponent when you get the opportunity so this begs the question how do you know when to dodge and when to punch when your eyes are closed how is playing a game like this while blindfolded even possible let's examine it from the start glass joe the first of the 14 fights in mike tyson's punch-out barely even throws punches at all so sinister is able to hit him in the face repeatedly by hitting mid strategic times he earned star punches which are uppercuts that take a lot of damage off the opponent's health bar at just a minute and 12 seconds into the first round sinister is able to defeat glass joe the second fighter pollen kaiser made it a bit tougher on him he actually threw some punches however these punches usually came out of the same rhythm every time and since it was just the second fight in the game sister was very familiar with her timing so he was able to dodge out of the way of most of them and take him down to help with star punches just as with glass joe it took sinister three knockdowns to the defeat von kaiser in punch-out three knockdowns in a single round signifies a tko and awards you a victory sometimes you can beat your opponent sooner by having mario count all the way to 10 after knocking an opponent down meaning he's knocked out alternatively you can beat your opponent by decision after three rounds of boxing without a victor if you get enough points which are earned from punching your opponent repeatedly you can be awarded the victory but of course if you get knocked down enough times you're gonna be unable to get up and we'll lose the match fight number three piston honda was significantly tougher than the first two his patterns are extremely random and his punches deal a ton of damage almost whenever he wants to hasten honda can duck down and throw an uppercut this is random and since he couldn't see it coming sinister usually had no option but to take this punch when it came out he was still able to sneak in a few punches to get stars but honda snuck in his fair share of punches too after a round and a half of trading knock downs back and forth sinister was finally able to get a 10-count knockout of piston honda yes the fourth fight don flamenco was quite a bit easier alternating left and right punches on him was an infinite combo from the developers that lester knocked him down in under a minute one more star punch a few seconds later and don flamenco was down for the 10-count king hippo however would prove to be a major road block you only have to knock him down once for an automatic knockout but getting this knockdown isn't easy the only time hippo can be hit is when he opens his mouth he has a three-eighths chance of opening his mouth on any given punch so sinister essentially had to just guess which punches he'd open his mouth on and which ones he had to dodge it didn't go too well he losted him in the first round he decided to rematch him and the second time through it went a bit better he was still taking a lot of damage but hippo was opening his mouth enough room to deal damage as well sinister knocks hippo down at the start of round two a great tiger was fight six he wasn't very tough sinister knew that he could repeatedly do a pattern of punching dodging and then delaying a punch to get a star that combined with using stars later once his pattern changed allowed for yet another first-round tko so all in all sinestro is performing admirably through the first six fights relying on just his game knowledge alone he was able to defeat everybody through great tiger without looking at the screen it was pretty incredible to watch live but flight number seven was bald bull he more or less had a tall enormous strength semi-random patterns and awkward delays in between his punches he was tougher than any of the fights before him [music] sinister started off strongly by executing a seventeen second knockdown on bull one with a bunch of star punches a strategy developed by martin charlevoix more than a decade prior he continued playing well and recorded a second knockdown by 102 he had taken just one punch from bald wolf from here it all fell apart he mistimed nearly all of his dodges and landed right into a bunch of bulls hooks he got knocked down three times in under a minute and by 156 the fight was over the run was over he made it a little less than halfway through the game bull was the seventh of 14 fights and punch-out given the little preparation he had done this was quite an impressive showing people loved watching this run he was unique exciting and showed off a great amount of skill and as it turned out this wouldn't be a one-time deal the next year sinister1 was back at agdq 2013 to play punch-out blindfolded again [music] once again his practice for this run was extremely limited but since he had already done it at a live marathon before perhaps a bit of the pressure was taken off the first few fights one even more smoothly than in 2012 he took a little bit of damage but defeated all of the boxers with relative ease he had a new strategy for king hippo thanks a longtime punch-out player a delicat intentionally draining his stamina over and over hippo is programmed to always open his mouth when stamina is recovered so sinister made this happen as often as he could he took care of great tiger in under a minute and then it was time once again to face off with the guy who took him out last year all bull a little over a minute into the fight he had his first two knockdowns on bull bull he just needed one more but if you recall the same thing happened last year this was the exact same situation he was in last year he got a quick couple and off bounds and then the fight fell apart and this time it seemed like nothing had changed the bull charged which knock sinister down a second time here occurred at two minutes in two minutes and thirty seconds into the first round you have to hit bull in the stomach at a specific time to avoid getting knocked down and doing it without looking was pretty much impossible for sinister this method if you wanted a decent chance at beating bald bull he needed to do it before two and a half minutes he did it sinister had officially made it halfway through mike tyson's punch-out while blindfolded fight number eight piston honda too was another tough one he threw a really quick punches and they did a lot of damage however he had one severe weakness wounded his banzai attack which occurred a couple of times in each round the player can hit him in the stomach to not just knock him down but ko him for good there's only a four frame window for this or a 15th of a second that's hard enough to do normally so with a blindfold on it's pretty ridiculous but all since you needed to do was correctly time at once and he would make it past honda to [music] ah that's probably it [music] it had been a long battle but he just couldn't hit that floor frame window at least he'd officially made it halfway through the game while blindfolded all right so next year we'll get past him [music] a year later since chiron was back yet again and as usual his twit stream from the past few weeks involved no blind fool to play all week at the events people had been asking him how far he thought he would make it this year but sinister1 had kept his lips sealed so when he started his run on that friday afternoon expectations weren't too ridiculous just as in previous year's fight by fight he took care of the early boxers of these he eventually made it to bald bowl and this time through it was really clean he timed nearly all of his dodges correctly and beat him without taking a single knockdown then it was on to the second half of the game see this guy sitting on the couch behind sinister this is punch-out speed runners allard won the night before sinister zallard and contra speed runner dk28 went out to dinner and discussed their upcoming gdq runs although sinister hadn't told anybody about any blindfolded preparation this year he had a surprise that's all these guys all flying from his twitch stream he had been extensively practicing blindfolded punch-out and he was prepared to at least have a chance at making it all the way to the last fight in the game mike tyson see it turns out in the past there had been a couple other players who found great success playing blindfolded punch-out they weren't at agdq or anything but they were offline one of them was a guy i mentioned earlier a delicat he claims to have been able to make it all the way to mike tyson he was a teenager in the 90s but there's no video proof of this he is verified to be a skilled player of the game but this obviously would have taken enormous amounts of practice sinister knew evade ellicott's accomplishments but there was another blindfolded player that gave him more inspiration a guy known as schmidt e300 smitty saw sinister's agent eq 2013 blindfolded attempt and got inspired to put in the time to try himself after a lot of practice he recorded an attempt of playing the game blindfolded in front of a few friends the first half of this run is apparently lost due to technical difficulties but what still exists today shows him starting on the 10th fight of the game he then defeats bald bull - don flamenco - mr. sandman and after loosing the super mantra man twice takes him down in dramatic fashion [music] [laughter] [laughter] the only fight left after super macho man is the incredibly difficult mike tyson who he obviously did not be blindfolded i'll talk more about strategies for these fights later but he had a nearly flawless knowledge of the opponent's patterns and had a plan for just about every situation this late in the game opponent's punches deal a ton of damage so he had to be super careful to get everything right the fact that schmidty a player with essentially no speed learning experience was able to make it all the way to mike tyson with a blindfold on inspired sinister to take it a bit more seriously but of course there was a catch schmidty was able to do this offline in front of no more than a few friends sinister one would have to perform it live in front of dozens of excited audience members all while it was being streamed in front of the tens of thousands of twitch viewers that was some serious pressure but nobody in the crowd behind him knew what he was capable of doing nobody except for his allard one who was sitting right behind him on the couch watching him fight the guy who took him out last year piston honda two [music] [applause] this year he had practice using an audio cue to time when to throw the gut punch when he heard a certain blip in the audio and honda backed up sinister knew it was the right time to throw the gut punch to knock him out with honda two out of the way sinister attempted to make his way as far into the rest of the game as he could the remaining fights were going to be incredibly tough but because of all his practice he was prepared i'm gonna do my best but this this guy can totally own you fight number nine was sodapoppin ski he had a specific work that made beating him a bit easier whenever he crouched down to throw an uppercut you could press down on the controller and soda will stay frozen in place you can then hit him to get a star punch and using the star punch will automatically knock him down no matter what there were a couple of problems however soda sometimes randomly throws hooks instead of uppercuts which you can't get a star from and even when he does throw an uppercut he can randomly delay before throwing it and giving that you can't see this delay you kind of just have to guess whether or not to throw the punch so sinister was trying to survive all of the random hooks and delays that soda gave to wait for an uppercut so you could get the star punch for the knockdown he recorded two knockdowns in the first round and got knocked on himself in round two but was finally able to get the tko after getting some uppercuts [applause] next up was bald bull too his punches are generally thrown at the same time throughout the fight but they deal a lot of damage if they make contact any mistake can result in disaster which is exactly what happened to sinister in the first minute of the fight he pulled it together though and was able to even counter the bull charged at two minutes his second bull charged gives you a larger window for the knockdown thirteen frames instead of four so he simply dodged out of the way the first one to wait for it he was able to get stars and use them in round two and since bolts whose health was weak each time he got up he was able to finish him off fight 11 was don flamenco - his pattern for the first minute and a half was to throw straight jabs over and over so sinister simply blocked each of them encountered with face punches he intentionally got down to low health the end around 1 and then waited out the rest of the round since he didn't have time for a tko in round 1 he was gonna get three knockdowns in round two instead and round two is very simple - he threw a punch don countered and he dodged out of the way to hit him with face jabs rinse and repeat for the first two knockdowns he then intentionally got knocked on himself because when he got up don two's pattern was to do this [music] eleven fights down he had blown any of his previous runs out of the water and the crowd was amazed as to how he was doing it there were only three fights left in the game the first of which is mr. sandman [music] sandman is all about speed if you don't know exactly what his punches are coming out you're gonna get hit and you're gonna get hit hard most of his rolling jobs in the first 50 seconds come out the same time every time you fight him but sinister still had some trouble countering all of them and a minute and a half into the fight sandman did his first dreamland express he stands in place then at a random point unleashes three really fast uppercuts sinister basically had to just guess one to start dodging and he ended up getting hit in round two sandman does a dreamland express every time he gets up from a knockdown by punching them twice in the face then dodging left repeatedly so this year was able to lock in a timing that was usually able to clear him out of the way of the three punches each time he was rewarded with being able to punch him in the stomach repeatedly that was just about all he needed in round two to take mr. sandman down three times for the tko [applause] the whole room was unbelievably hyped after every fight last year he had lost to the eighth opponent in the game now he was about to try fighting the 13th one the second-to-last one super macho man macho was fast strong and had a wide variety of punches he could throw including the mini spin this punch comes out at a random time and takes off about half your health if it makes contact but the one nice thing about macho was the delays between his punches were usually very similar sinister could dodge a punch hit him a few times then wait a brief moment before dodging again and usually avoid getting punched he was able to record a knockdown a little over a minute into the fight but then got tagged by one of his punches and got knocked down and in this brief moment sinister made a decision that could only be described as game-changing instead of getting up right away he elected to wait to get up on a nine counts the last number before you be knocked out in a word a loss in mike tyson's punch-out you're able to get up after a knockdown by pressing a and b on the controller repeatedly if you do this right away you would get up when mario says one and get a lot of your health back however the punch-out programmers put in a little secret when you get up if you get up when mario says 9 instead of getting up with some of your health your health will be completely replenished and as an added bonus whenever you're not gonna put it down will new yourself have full health they will automatically get up with a lower health refill however getting up on a 9 count especially when you can't see is extremely risky if you're off by just one number and get up when mario says 10 it'll be too late you'll be counted as knocked out and the fight will be over in fact when sinister was doing offline practice in the weeks leading up to this run he specifically wrote in his notes to never attempt getting up on a 90 count against super mantra man he would have had to rely on counting mario's beep since he had a blindfold on while he was already under enormous pressure from having made it this far in the game while a crowd of nearly 100,000 people was watching him all while knowing that a single mistake getting up would end the run but in the heat of the moment since they forgot about the warning he had given himself [music] he did it he got up a full health and he continued fighting super macho men when he knocked him down again later in the round because sinister1 had full health macho got up with far less health than he otherwise would have and this small health refill left sinister with just enough time to knock him down a third and final time before the first round is even complete [applause] sinister had just beaten 13 fights in mike tyson's punch-out blindfolded alive at agdq largely using strategies he had come up with on his own the place was erupting with cheer of course there was still one fight remaining mike tyson but sinister explained that he basically had no chance at all of the feeding mike tyson blindfolded not just at this event but probably ever sinister's explanation that he gave the crowd before fighting tyson blindfolded was something along the lines of this mike tyson's punches at least for the first minute and a half of the fight i'll knock you down in one hit and as mentioned earlier getting knocked down three times in a round means you lose each of these punches has four possible delays that can occur before them zero delay a one delay a to delay or a three delay so sinister had to essentially just guess which delayed would be for each punch since he couldn't see it visibly and then dodged hoping his one and four guess was right he would then have to keep up those one and four guesses for nearly every punch in the first minute and a half of the fight which would obviously involve astronomically small odds and then somehow figure out a way to deal with all the rain and miss in the following rounds he likened the odds of beating tyson blindfolded to winning the lottery and sure enough when he started fighting tyson he was beaten within the first 90 seconds but regardless to this day agdq2014 s blindfolded punch-out lives on as one of the most memorable runs of all time the hype nosov the crowd and exciting atmosphere of the run have been practically unrivaled and as a quick side note the next scheduled run in agdq 2014 was for zallard 1 to attempt playing super punch-out the sequels of this game while blindfolded as well imagine how daunting it would be to have to follow up with sinister just did well let's just say zallard one did a pretty good job of that [applause] so that was the state of punch-out blindfolded sinister had proven to the world that getting through the first 13 fights regularly was possible but defeating mike tyson that was a different story when probably the greatest mike tyson's punch-out player in the world said that beating tyson blindfolded was essentially impossible people believed them and so that's where the game stood for a long time but eventually one man decided to challenge that notion his name fittingly was d tyson later the tyson aider is one of the most prominent punch-out players in the early 2000s becoming the first person in the world to tko mike tyson and round one on the north american version of the game with his eyes open a horse for years after that he didn't do too much work in my face that's punch-out but after washing sinister's run at agdq2014 he became inspired to try to complete with sinister stop short of doing beating tyson blindfolded his strategy was pretty simple he would use an audio cue to know when to dodge out of the way the first uppercut and then assume that tyson would give him the shortest delay for every single punch after that if tyson gave any delay but the shortest one for any punch he got knocked down surprisingly enough his attempts actually went really well he was surviving the first minute and a half of the fight a lot more than what was statistically probable he was still getting beaten up in round two but the fact that he made it that far so often was miraculous how was the tyson aider defying the odds well here's how sinister one's explanation he gave at agdq is actually incorrect for most of tyson's punches he only has two possible delays a long delay and the short delay these timings can vary between punches so sometimes it seems like more than just two for each but for the most part you're either gonna get a short delay or a longer one so the tyson aider is only playing 50/50 or better odds on a lot of these punches that was significantly more reasonable throwing enough attempts at it eventually yielded him some pretty nice results fight after fight of getting to round 2 his round 2 pattern was pretty random but nothing that knocked you down him one hit like in the first round the tyson aider is able to develop a game plan he would listen for punches at the start of round two then counter in the gutter instars hooks came with about a half second delay before each of them immediately after which t tyson leader could throw the star punches into he often threw two quick uppercuts in a row which could be countered for a lot of damage in round three hearing no punches for a few seconds signal a pattern of two quick jabs in an uppercut which could again be countered for a lot of damage with mental notes like these the tyson aider is able to grow as consistency with practice he was able to make it deeper and deeper into the fight and on june 6 2014 in the back of his video game store and see games in a dark corner of twitch.tv in front of just to chat members while the world wasn't paying attention d tyson ater did the impossible [music] yes what the win 27 years after the game's original release every fight and mic taste this punch-out had verifiably been beaten while blindfolded it's possible tyson had been beaten by someone else earlier but this appears to be the first time with video proof even though he hadn't played the game seriously in years the tyson aider was able to come back and show just what was possible with the blindfold but he wasn't quite done yet [music] gasps you knockout turbine is i still love this stuff mikey you're done  away you stay down [music] with a little more practice the tyson aider got really really good at doing tyson blindfolded he wasn't interested in the first 13 fights just tyson himself eventually the first minute and a half of the fight became more consistent thanks to help from an unlikely source battletoads world record holder jc 583 jc watch t tyson aiders attempts frequently in camp with a maneuver called the double quick dodge in order to compensate for tyson's to delays you can do a quick dodge at the early timing listen for a punch and if you don't hear one do another quick dodge as soon as possible this dodge will dodge you out of the way of the longer delay so as long as you can react fast enough to the early timing or lack thereof both timings will be accounted for the attesa nader took to practicing this and by early 2015 he was able to beat tyson blindfolded nearly every time he tried in the span of less than a year the community went from thinking beating tyson blindfolded was impossible to doing so frequently terminan mikey well at least one person did through early 2015 the tyson atar is actually the only known person in the world to have beaten tyson blindfolded he could do it nearly on command but nobody else could even do it once and then came another revelation in late january 2015 there was a strong blizzard on the east side of north america a longtime punch-out player jack wedge was snowed in to his apartment building for a week and had a bit of time on his hands similar to the tyson ater jack had been playing punch-out for many years achieving world records back in the early 2000s but then he put the game aside for a while but after watching the tyson leaders blindfolded play on twitch for months and with quite a bit of spare time he decided to try doing a bit of blindfolded punch-out for himself what he discovered over the course of that week however was a way to make blindfolded punch-out way easier than anyone had ever imagined before he implemented buffer strategies in mike tyson's punch-out buffering inputs means while one action is taking place you hold down the buttons for the next action in advance and the game will perform the next action on the first frame possible for example you would hold up and be to punch in the face then let go and while the punch is going off hold up and be again so as soon as the first space punch is done the next one will automatically begin you can do this over and over again with different combinations of inputs to chain a bunch of moves together now how is this beneficial for a speedrun well buffering inputs will always take the exact same amount of time every single time on a glass joe for example there's a four frame window to knock him out at 42 seconds with a well-timed punch by buffering 22 face punches in a row and then to right gut punches then to left gut punches either the last or second to last left the gut punch will always hit last show during that four frame window depending on glass shows pattern this is because if all these punches are properly buffered they will all be thrown on the first possible frame each time so this series of punches will take the exact same amount of time every time glass joe can easily be knocked out at 42 seconds every time this way as famously discovered by zallard won in 2013 for a blindfolded speedrun these rules all still apply and they take away the necessity to see what's happening on screen you can buffer a bunch of inputs together and not need to worry about manually timing your dodges or punches jack wedge took this to an extreme and figured out but for stress for a bunch of different fighters and in the run he recorded from his apartments on january 29th 2015 you can see these strategies in action vaughn keyser you can buffer a face punch then three left dodges the third one will automatically dodge you out of the way of a jab from vaughn keyser then you buffer seven more face punches hesitate and then dodge then buffer a face punch and a star punch vaughn kaiser will always beat off down in exactly 23 seconds these strategies got complicated and took a ton of memorization like a bald bull won for example where you needed to adjust your buffer based on the punches you here bull throw but some provided a huge benefit piston honda - for exemple had a buffer strategy that guaranteed hitting the 4 frame window at 1 minute for the knockout armed with these strategies jack was casually making his way through the game nonchalantly defeating everybody who would dare challenge him [music] but what jack had up his sleeve for the mike tyson fight was absolutely brilliant he had a buffer strategy that basically guaranteed he would survive the one hit uppercuts for the first 90 seconds of the fight he would buffer punches to lose stamina so tyson couldn't throw a punch then when tyson did get an uppercut through he would dodge out of the way and hit him and then lose the rest of the stamina tyson always throws punches at a regular interval when mac turns pink so jack just buffer dodges to get past them he then lost all of his stamina again rinsed and repeated it till the minute-and-a-half was up he didn't do much damage to tyson but he was always able to survive in rounds 2 & 3 he battled hard against tyson but for strategies didn't help him much here because tyson's pattern was just too random but jack's game knowledge was enough to give him the victory in the end [music] [music] poor gino for the first time ever someone had verifiably beaten mike tyson's punch-out from start to finish without looking at the screen jack uploaded the video to youtube and a few days later it had gone viral with hundreds of thousands of views the world was taking notice of what people could do with a blindfold on naturally in true speedrunning fashion the point of blindfolded punch-out turned to how fast and how consistently it could be done throughout 2015 players worked together to come up with the best strategies possible for beating mike tyson's punch-out blindfolded the tyson aider even became the first person to beat mike tyson in round one ball blindfolded he had to hit 11 frame perfect punches with his eyes closed terminated i still avista mike you know my god hasta lavista mikey guys it's over and in early 2016 sinestro and zallard won raced blindfolded punch-out against each other live at agdq 2016 the odds in getting two players to beat the whole game blindfolded live in front of tens of thousands of viewers seemed grim at first but the punch-out community came together to help figure out as many consistent strategies as possible sinister zallard jack even a certain youtuber who had approximately nine subscribers at the time many of these strategies were small buffer changes or are listening for certain audio cues sinister and zeller practice mike tyson in particular for weeks in order to get the best saw as possible beating him live at the events zallard resumed to do so in round two and won the race but sinister was running out of time to finish him off in the second round if the fight made it to round 3 he probably would have lost because it tasted ridiculous randomness in the third round but at the last minute sinister was able to hit a frame perfect punch he had his sixtieth of a second to time it in order to get a star and finish tyson off after this race sinister one set a world record for beating the gameplan followed from start to finish 21 minutes and 32 seconds then the blindfolded cranes died down for a while with the only active player being detonated who did some mike tyson or mr. dream blindfolded fights each week and then in 2018 one of the top players in the world decided to see what he could do with the blindfold he'd been playing eyes open for years and achieved top times in all categories he tried but with the blindfold on it was a different story this player was empathy in april 2018 m papp did his first serious attempts of punch-out blindfolded after having practiced a bit in the days leading up to it on just his seventh ever attempt he beat sinister ones world record by 14 seconds it's over [music] not satisfied with that he decided to keep venturing onward he had a couple of new strategies he had developed to a system he was trying to set up a faster knockout over king hippo by listening for him to open his mouth and multiple times at the start of the fight if he got lucky he could beat him in under a minute as opposed to closer to two minutes with the old strat and on tyson he set up a buffer that worked with certain patterns from tyson to tko matt the 1:30 blinking pattern this once again was a solid half minute faster in game time than he would be beaten normally by using those new strategies plus getting better consistency and not getting punched he was able to lower the record repeatedly over the following month [music] funky go em pap has brought the world record down to 20 minutes and 27 seconds which is where it still stands today perhaps more importantly than the final time however is how far blindfolded punch-out has come the community went from struggling to make it halfway through the game at a live marathon to beating it only two minutes slower than it can be beaten with eyes open it's possible to narrow that gap by beating tyson round one at the end of one of these runs but that's gonna be a challenge for the future what once sounded like a little more than the dream has now become a reality gone are the days of needing to win the lottery to beat tyson blindfolded in their place are competitive speedruns to beat the whole game plan folded in 20 minutes there's nominee games that have been beaten blindfolded but based on what's happened with punch-out maybe that's going to change thanks for watching [music] [music]
