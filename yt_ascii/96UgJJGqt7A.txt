okay so imagine now we've set up a situation where the psychopaths are no longer punished for their manipulative invasive and narcissistic attention-seeking behavior in fact they're facilitated because they create a feor and they attract attention okay now then imagine this as we enable the psychopathic narcissists they exert a disproportionate influence on the political process and they drive polarization now they do that partly because they like chaos right if you're a failure if you're a resentful bitter failure your one of your best bets is to flip the bloody social system upside down because you might be able to garner some short-term advantage in the ensuing chaos that's a typical parasitic predator strategy wreak havoc and then feast in the runes right precisely okay the danger i see on the liberal side and this is a consequence of having like watched this for a very long period of time is that because the more liberal types are incapable of drawing boundaries they can't tell to what degree they've been invaded by the psychopaths now you tell me what you think i'm watching the universities burn at the moment now you know you could say that some of that's because the protesters are shocked by what's going on in israel and i'm just going to leave that aside because war is shocking and people have reason to be shock yeah it's i mean gaz of people are dying you know but by but by the same token like it seems to me to be a naivity beyond comprehension to presume that those encampments aren't simultaneously being invaded by people who are manipulative and psychopathic beyond comprehension well okay that the fact is that i you know it's funny my daughter and son-in-law are law professors at colombia colombia was actually very very calm the encampments were incredibly peaceful you know i i'm a person who got you know i was in sens in the in the late 60 early 70s you know i'm that old i think protesting and free speech among cols is should be protected and these encampments were totally peaceful and the and the police were called in to get rid of them and all of a sudden you had the pe police coming in and by the way the new york city police were actually quite respectful unlike a lot of the police that have been you know operating down in the south and now at ucla you know they they just basically calmly walked kids off thankfully as opposed to dragging and and using tear g but but all of a sudden the the president called in the police and all of a sudden all the agitators the proud boys came the other people came they're they're now at the gates they're not allowed in they're the ones spewing the most stuff they're the ones that now are getting now that's not to say there are not a few bad apples anywhere you know a guy a person you know the person who led the group in colombia had said some really horrible things you know a few months ago yeah you might say that right but he wasn't he he wasn't sort of at the time there was still a peaceful protest it was peaceful and and basically things have gotten have gone haywire you know brown they they is brought up now as the the the the president sat down talked to the students they were trying to work things out nothing went ar you know sometimes we try to you know the the the administrators are trying to respond but they over respond and i think you know it it's made everything look all the worse and it's been pretty terrible i there's no question about it but and i don't i think there's right and wrong on both sides here you know i've been i've been in the i think there is too but i'm pointing to a very specific danger that i would you you you're thinking the people of the kids at the encampment were the psychopaths i think that's no no no i'm not no no i'm not saying that at all i'm not saying that i'm saying they're susceptible to invasion by the psychopaths and i've been in the midst of plenty of protests yeah like many of them aimed at me and i've watched and i'm a clinician no well hang on let let me just walk through it the fact that there are lots of protesters or there were a few years ago who came after me that's beside the point i don't care about that what i cared about was one in 20 of those protesters who is psychopathic to the bloody core and praying on all those protesters and i think that the left generally speaking is constitutionally incapable of even admitting that people like that exist it's like well they're just victims they're just victims of the social structure it's like if those people show up at your doorstep like they have been for example at stan stanford they show up on your doorstep you're not going to be thinking they're victims you're going to be hoping that someone gets them the hell away from you as fast you're also claiming that that one person is going to have a major impact on all these others i mean one of the reason reason happened in historically one of the reas they may have a more greater impact on the right than the left one reason is that the people on the right conservative are looking for strong leaders they're looking for those people they're looking for leaders the left isn't the left doesn't value strong leaders and power and those people who are psychopathically you know who look who are psychopaths and can present themselves as strong leaders so i'm not sure i mean you may be right i have i don't have the answers here but i'm not sure it has anything to do i'm not sure it has to do with boundaries or anything else i have i think a lot of it has to do with a greater ability to just ignore and not want to rify and and and and and adore these people i mean you know trump has made it by moving you know we are talking about somebody with sociopathic tendencies we know he threw rocks at a toddler at toddles when he was a a kid you know you read about his childhood this was a child sent you know completely he was as a child exactly as he is an adult right he was sent to a military school because he a military account because his parents couldn't deal with him he is looked at as a leader by many on the right because they're looking for somebody strong there the left is not looking for strength and power that's just not there and i'm not so i'm not sure it's a matter of boundaries that's not to say look you know the the left we do lots of stuff wrong i'm not saying you know we have you know everybody's right you know terrific here and bad there you know there's lots of fault on both sides but well okay so let me ask you the same question that i've asked all these democrats okay and i have made a systematic study of this you know like i've asked every single democrat i've talked to in the last six years the same question so let me ask you when does the left go too far how do you know when the left goes too far here's a case where i thought the the case of the defunding the police was an interesting case because if you looked at was it minnesota where if you looked the at this whole defund the policing and by the way there's not that much evidence that more police make a difference but in and i discuss this at length in the book in a community okay let's say you're in a city the people who were most and i and it was in minnesota i can't remember was it st paul but anyway i apologize bear with me the folks most likely to be affected by crime in that city were were living in a poor poor black neighborhoods and many blacks there were very against the defund the police they were against it because they felt they needed the police and who was it that was there were a lot of very great black citizens who were for defent funding the police but the but who were the folks most defunding the police privileged whites living in the city because they weren't worried right now if it were up to me i think you know that's going too far when you are not a person affected your voice shouldn't count as much right you should be turning to people who are affected right and in that case i think maybe it went the maybe the left went too far in terms of the defunding the police it also by the way went too far because it had major impact on the election the assumpt assumption is it hurt democrats in the election because you know first of all the right wants police that's about defending and a lot of people who were impacted by crime wanted the police you know so anyway i mean there are that's an interesting case of going too far but i think in in deciding when you're going too far i think you have an obligation to think about who's hurt and who's harmed who's who's helped and who's harmed and and and and i think that would by the outome youris right so consequentialism matters there right you know that that's not maybe not a great example but i think well look i can tell you this that's better than that's a better answer than any single democrat that i've ever talked to has ever given me generally what i get i'm telling it's the truth and and i'm not i don't believe that i'm biased in this investigation because i've gone out of my way to talk to democrats everywhere i've seriously gone out of my way to do it and that's still that's the best answer that that i mean it's it's a tough one and you know these days now i i don't know it's it's very there's no question that you know we could take these ideologies and weaponize and and push them in all sorts of directions you know and and the and identity politics on the left which is what you're really talking about that's where things get tough you know there's a reason for identity politics on the left because if you're trying to if you're trying to get a more equal society you've got to see which groups need help more than others okay you you don't you don't help at an individual you help a group levels right that's a piece of it the downside of that of course is there there's competitive victimhood you know and it could it could and you know and as people thought it could be you know fraction you a society can become sort of torn apart it's a factionalized but but that doesn't happen if in social psychology if you have a very strong identity with your own group if you also have a subordinate d identity that's shared across groups american that is actually very healthy it's very helpful to have a super own you still what but our problem as a society right now is we're not very good at having that super identity be something people are very proud about calling themselves right you know and sort of you know if if we could develop that well the question that we talked about on the youtube side too is germaine to that it's like on what foundation should that superordinate identity be and what are the things that be based and what are the things that distressed me about the insistence of social psychologists that our fundamental defenses are illusions is that it undermines the claim that there is something foundational upon which a transcendent identity that unites can be based well yeah if we dispense with that i'll tell you if we dispense with that and we fragment into group identity we're going to pay a major league price for that yeah no absolutely i mean you know we we we need to i i feel like people need to be proud of their own groups identify but we sort of somehow have to and and the extent we don't come together and we even as left and right you know these you know super identities just are not going to be very powerful or meaningful and we need those we need those you know we need to be in this together you know we need to have a caring society not just an orderly society right we need both right we need you know and i'm hoping you know that when we think about order unfortunately order is now often about you know people's roles and what women should be doing what men should be doing all this and that i don't think i think order could come from people having good jobs being paid well doing you see i mean that provides order too so liberals and conservatives could come together around social inequalities and and work together because both social justice and social order could benefit from sort of less unequal societies you know you know people said you know democracy with brandise you know said you can't have a democracy when all the wealth is at the top you know when there's when and and and pluto talked about you know money is going to be the great divider right you know we have a we have great inequalities right now and i think if we could start on that start working on that both liberals and conservatives ultimately would feel would would would would be able to satisfy their own moral moral values even though right now it's a value on the left i think it it really would help social order in ways that aren't isn't quite acknowledged at this point [music]
