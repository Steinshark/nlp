ladies and gentlemen in this video i'm going to tell you the insane story of the very first ai ai stands for artificial intelligence and at the time of recording this video in 2023 ai is all the rage there are self-training computers that can do everything from trim down a consulting business to time when you're supposed to water your crops to play chess or create art and anything in between but in the year 1770 hey i was not as sophisticated ai looked something like this this is the turk the turk was an invention that was essentially a robot that could play chess against anybody and it was a hit it was created by a gentleman named wolfgang von kempelen and he actually made it to impress the empress maria theresa of austria which is wow i mean you talk about impressing somebody you want to potentially go on a date with the turk was invented as a chess plane contraption and in this video i'm going to share a few games that it played one of which was actually against napoleon bonaparte the leader of france yes it also played against benjamin franklin it went on a world tour but it had one dark secret which i will tell you in due time napoleon's game began with pawn to e4 and napoleon actually tried to cheat against it because you know he was a world leader and he because they all cheat and napoleon tried to like make illegal moves like you know he tried to make two moves in a row he tried to capture with a pawn forward he tried to move a knight like like that and the turk would take his moves back like it knew the rules of chess how a robot in 1770 know this i mean we didn't have you know we didn't even have electricity yet how could this be a thing right so i think so right i'm pretty sure electricity was invented in the'30s anyway embarrassing pawn to e5 and napoleon bonaparte tried to scholars mate the turk i mean you can't make the stuff up i'm not even exaggerating he went for a four move checkmate against this robot that was supposed to be destroying people at chess yeah that that's a bold strategy but but black defended with the two knights i i do wonder if in the year'09 when this game was played if napoleon had played this move maybe the turk would have blundered pawn to g6 but no queen f3 and like this and now napoleon played knight to e2 preventing knight to d4 pretty ridiculous by the way that that even in'09 200 and 14 years ago they were they were still trying to scholars mate each other you are not really any different from napoleon bonaparte i mean seriously you also tried to form of checkmate your opponents the circ developed the bishop pawn to a3 and now instead of castling the turkplay pawn to d6 just making sure that it can develop its light squared bishop like this and and and i mean this is really good good stuff here from from the the self-programmed chess robot that was invented in order to impress a lady queen to d3 and now again instead of castling black plays knight h5 now remember this is'09 nobody really knew how to play chess in'09 like let's just the average eight-year-old in 2023 would be the world champion in'09 they knew nothing knight h5 is a weird move but but what they like to do back in the day is they like to take things and attack and of course the best move here for black is just simply to castle the king but we only know that you know 200 years later white plays h3 inviting this capture and in this position there is a fork but it doesn't quite work you can't take this because of this but there is queen f3 re-threatening the checkmate like that and also threatening the knight so actually knight g3 believe it or not looks like a tactic but they were good enough not to miss things like that but as you can see the turk is already taking over the game not castling superseding concepts in chess this is trying to threaten this queen to g5 will threaten mate as well as knight to f3 which will be a fork and napoleon is completely pushed backwards okay it it is destroying a world leader bishop back to to b3 and in this position i don't really know why the turk did not play queen to g5 i mean queen g5 is essentially ending the game on the spot but like i said nobody actually knew how to play chess in'09 so i mean i mean the only way to protect against mate is to move the pawn which then proceeds to lose the queen but i feel like maybe the turk wanted to keep the game going a little bit because maybe if you beat napoleon too fast he would kill you i'm not even exaggerating i can totally see that happening so yeah napoleon you know knight takes h3 sacrificing the knight you can't actually take because knight f3 is a fork so the king moves here napoleon did spot that although probably with some help from a cabinet advisor queen to h4 bringing in another haymaker you still cannot take because of this napoleon plays g3 which allows this but the queen is still hanging king to g2 but unfortunately now that's a check and napoleon is doing his best but he's losing all of his pieces and now he's going to lose the head of his king which you know the french did a lot of beheadings so bishop d4 queen g2 captures the king is hunted back and napoleon succumbed to the ai in 24 moves it wasn't even close let's be honest i mean napoleon did go for a scholars mate and that's basically where his chest knowledge sort of ceased and and black just absolutely brutalized them all the turk needed was these pieces they just danced around the white king the queen came in and he never even moved the roots he never castled he never moved the rooks he made a total mockery of napoleon right okay great well dessert one nearly every game it played it it did a world tour it didn't just play the the french leader it went to london it went to new york it went to a couple of other cities like i think it went to vienna austria for example that traveled around europe this is a game played in new york some 15 years later the story of the turk the the ai the robot that they hauled around to play chess lasted over 80 years and and the the it was in a museum after and everything but it it's world tour was also about 20 years long i mean it had a longer world tour than like touring musicians and it also had a crazy rivalry it had a rivalry with a guy named john cochrane and they played a couple of games against each other i will show you those in a moment and you will notice that it actually it when it played john the first time it started with no pawn this ai was disrespecting chess players even in the early 19th century they would make it play without the f pawn the most important pun it's the pawn near the king like you could lose games just simply on this diagonal so white already get you get to play white and you get to remove black's most important pawn the pawn that that safeguards the black king it's ridiculous stuff so the turk against john cochrane would play like e6 c6 and back in the day they loved pushing pawns they loved taking space that's not the best move as you can see from the computer in fact it loses nearly half of the advantage because this pawn over commits and kind of locks the center kind of closes up the center and then black can fight on the light squares the computer prefers to keep the tension here it prefers not to lock the position it actually wants to do something like this because just the pressure here makes it very difficult for black to play c5 and since you can't play c5 you can't actually develop either of these pieces so white is going to have a permanent advantage but by locking the structure like this you now enable black pawn play and even though black doesn't have a pawn here black can always play pawn to g6 knight e7 knight f5 and and just sort of close up the position so that's exactly what it did i mean it's basically just playing a french defense but with no f pawn which is bad but it's not as bad as it could have been against other things so now in a locked position the turk plays queen b6 it's it holds everything together and it keeps its king in the middle for now because it's just trying to create pressure on this pawn it plays knight f5 look at that beautiful coordination the advantage for white is nearly gone let's not forget that white is up a full pawn so white has a plus one advantage but the position is so good for black it's removing over half of that advantage and here queen d3 was played knight takes d4 knight takes d4 knight takes d4 and you can't actually take this because of the pin on the king so king h1 and and that's it and now the turk is just better it took just 16 moves and it started the game down a full pawn but it's managed to come back i mean it's literally like a modern day ai modern day chess grandmasters can get a game against stockfish and they can't win they cannot win despite having a one point advantage in the opening sometimes even a two pawn advantage and the move knight c3 bishop d7 and now it's just about the end game we're we're in that late middle game early end game stage queen g4 and now rook f7 in this position however cochrane played the move knight takes d5 which is a nice tactic he spotted that it's not about taking the bishop but it's about e6 and all of a sudden for the first time ever the ai was under fire the ai might lose a game and keep in mind this ai has beaten napoleon bonaparte it's it's beaten the likes of benjamin franklin a game that i couldn't even find online i feel like ben franklin just threw out the score sheet he didn't want that game published anywhere and we got into a queen and rook's end game right there's queen rook and five pawns each it's very complicated black does have a past pawn but white but but white has a lot of activity putting pressure here also white has a majority of pawns so they could try to advance and attack the king black played pawn to d4 and white immediately took over by mobilizing the rook so the turk in this position had to play queen b5 or queen f8 the idea of queen b5 is that if this you you just play defense and then you can also trade the queen but unfortunately for the turk it played queen to b4 and cochrane just got in utilizing this pin rook to c8 is devastating it's also defended by the queen of scoring and and black is just going to lose material black could try to escape checkmate but rook c7 queen f8 and then i'll play something like this and i'm just going to win so h6 rook c7 and that is exactly what happened and in this position the turk resigned so it was a good chess ai it wasn't a perfect chess ai and it did lose every now and then chess ai in 1770 was supposed to lose the chess ai has only been better than humans since 1997. but some of these games were utterly ridiculous like for example this is a game that the turk played in new york so they traveled to new york they set up shop there and they said hey any of the strongest local players in new york you can come play the circ you can come get it too this was a game against augustus zerega or zerega which just said which sounds like i don't know kind of last name italian maybe sicilian maybe south american i don't know it was a petrov defense and the players got a totally symmetrical position early on and we we've seen different looks from the turk like sometimes it plays very aggressively sometimes and there was no odds in this game by the way at this point the turk begins playing some of the most bogus chess i have ever seen knight to h2 the idea of knight to h like look any normal person here plays bishop f4 i mean and then queen d2 and then connect the rooks knight to h2 to try to play knight g4 and not just knight and now black copies augustus was like i'm gonna do what the what the bot is doing back to the bot that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna play c6 h3h6 knight i'm copying the bot because whatever it does i could do too f4 f okay bishop to f3 taking a little space black plays knight d7 developing the knight now now this knight comes back and goes to the king side what is happening what is even what now black plays d5 to take a little bit more central space and in this position the the turk plays bishop h5 which which is a deranged move like you i told you in in the early 19th century nobody knew how to play chess why are you just giving up the bishop the bishop is better than the knight but probably not back then they didn't know how to use the bishops properly i mean you're just gonna kick the knight out and then you're gonna go here and then and and and now you know black just has two bishops and black's gonna give a check and win control of the center and be in good shape yeah but but instead of that they allowed the bishop to go to g6 why would you allow that he gave you the bishop i don't understand he gave you i why would you allow the bishop to sit here now it's just going to restrict the oxygen of the black position here here comes the queen here comes white's bishop that they haven't moved yet and now white plays a move that i don't understand at all like you haven't moved the rooks yet obviously you go to the open file you play rookie one or rookie one what is pawn to c3 like what are we even doing here what is the turk doing this is the dumbest ai i've ever seen in my life and now augustus blunders upon like i said they they really just did not know i mean this is like supposed to be the best player of the you know and no disrespect to the living or those to those that have passed but augustus what is bishop f7 brother like the bishop can just take i mean this is this was supposed to be the best representative of chess against ai anyway he lost the pawn and now you know again you play for the center you take the file no the ai plays h4 i i don't know where it's going but that's not the point and my man my man augustus must have been paid by the maker of this ai because not only did this dude blunder one of his pawns he proceeds to push the pawn in front of his king my brother what are you doing you do not push pawns in front of your king if you're the one being attacked white is not under attack here this is a deranged move white can now completely white has six pieces that are ready to go six and two pawns that are just gonna bulldoze everything maybe his idea was pawn takes bishop takes g3 i got news for you that doesn't even work knight takes g4 queen g4 the attack roars forward hg hgg like the game is anyway g5 and the turk took because duh now he took and now we just played knight g4 i mean he's just he's gonna lose one two and three defenders of his king i don't know what my boy augustus was doing pawn takes f4 bishop takes bishop takes queen takes queen takes rook takes everything has fallen except the attack is still there and why does it clean pawn up now you could you could fight on here you you could try to not lose immediately he played knight to h5 the turk removed this and now a very nice and classy move the bishop defends the knight who sacked the rook and you get two nights and that's all you need that is all you need because two nights are gonna beat a rook go here plant the knights advance the g pawn and and the game will be decided within this rectangle because the rest of the board is exactly the same and in this position black played rook f8 white played rookie one rookie seven check and this was a nice way to finish the game off because if the king takes then there is pawn to g4 which augustus must have thought that the ai lost its knight because the alternative to knight e5 was going here and then he would have not lost anything and then the game would have proceeded but instead he was like oh stupid bot hung is not and then he hung a fork and then in this position he resigned because i think he was very confident in the fact that he was going to lose to this thing down tonight yeah that was a good game until it wasn't you know but i got news for you like i said you know the turk did lose a game or two but oh boy did it get revenge oh boy i mean john cochrane he he did a good job he you know he he beat it once he managed to beat it with odds even though the bot completely fought back to an equal position and was actually even better but and and and you know he did manage to win but they got the same exact game going john cochrane a couple years later still same situation turk is down a pawn and after this i will do i will reveal to you the big dark secret f4 d5 this this bozo went for the same thing it's been two years he's had two years to prep no c5 bishop b5 bishop d7 castles i i can't recall if it was two years or if it was a little bit shorter but he loved i told you back in the day players love taking space with their pawns it just felt good until the early 20th century when aaron nimsovich and the kind of modern school hyper modern school of chess taught everybody you don't actually have to take the center with central pawns cd knight d4 c5 knight f3 knight h6 and for the second time in a row black is going to have dominant control of the light squares white slides the king out of the way black starts firing away on the queen side the turk is coming in hot a4 c4 d4 rook b8 bishop going to b5 a4 pawn to b3 and there it is the arrival of the night knight to e3 knight to f2 here i would play queen e2 which is exactly what but now but look at that i mean that looks absolutely terrifying however it's not you can just take because after knight f2 check you take you take and after black takes you just play e6 if queen takes you win this if bishop takes you play f5 or rugby one or bishop a3 and you have a very nice position but in the game we had h3 knight f2 c3 and it looked like black was taking over in this game by sealing in the white pieces over here but no no it was anything but actually cochrane had a great position put his knight on c4 position looked nice and confident and it looked like for the second time he was actually going to defeat the bot rook f8 take take knight d6 queen e4 i mean look at this position he's threatening a checkmate he's gonna go there and take the pawn and he's gonna win but suddenly the turks started defending pretty well and john was like you know what i beat it in an end game once let me go take it to an end game again and he he just hung a pawn with check and lost his knight so this game was apparently played in le cafe de la regence i think that's how that's pronounced regions the regions cafe in paris where a lot of chess masters played back in the day so you know i'm just gonna assume that john just had a bit to drink and he was playing the turk and he was like queen c4 and then you know we're gonna trade and then i'm gonna win the end game yeah no queen takes c5 and that that unfort yeah he did he just he just lost queen g2 e2 e1 put the rook behind the pawn pawn to d3 make a second but so the turk was able to get revenge on its on the one person who according to the recorded games of the turk was able to beat it jean cochrane was the only person in the games that i found that was able to consistently beat this thing now here's the thing as the turk did a world tour people started hypothesizing about it right you may remember that when i went full screen mode i showed you this right that's what it looked like i mean that's what it was and here you know he here it is in on a website so i have an article here for you from from from slate all right the mechanical chess player that unsettled the world that looks great right i mean wow how that's incredible well here's what it was this is a photo of the turk and it was a gigantic box with a robot where a human-sized chess player could slot in there were all sorts of theories because people said there's not enough room in there for arms and legs people were saying a war an army veteran could have been in there you know somebody who tragically lost like a limb in the war i mean they were there was all sorts of crazy theories but some of the players that apparently would sit in there and and randomly play were for example johann algeier who was a who was a strong chess master of his day aaron alexander william lewis jacques murray william schlumberger so this was basically just a contraption where a person would get into a box and they attached magnets to the chest table that the turk played on so inside you could track the magnets and go oh i know the move and then you would control it you would control the mannequin like that that's how it knew illegal moves the first ai of all time was a hoax it existed for 80 years until'54 when it was tragically destroyed in a fire in the museum it was being kept probably by somebody that had defeated and embarrassed what a story a guy named wolfgang von kempelen literally is just known for this this wasn't like a side project if you look up wolfgang von kempelin this is what he's known for this is his life's work he carried around a gigantic wooden crate with a with like a wax statue of a chess player and there was just people inside how did they not suffocate how did they fly this thing how did they get this thing from europe to america on a ship this dude just sat in the i mean that's they didn't fly this thing there's no planes invented idiot gotham that's the story of the chest turk the very first chess cheating device and and unfortunately it's gone it was destroyed in a fire but people have been cheating at chess for over 250 years yeah now you know now get out of here
