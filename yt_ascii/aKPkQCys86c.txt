the best thirty two football teams, soccer teams, in the in the world are gonna be meeting up in in russia this summer. not only do we obsess on the world cup but many of us also have this obsession about this panini world cup album. so this is the sticker album, i'll show you the one from four years ago. this is the one from world cup 2014 in brazil. you get to see all the different countries that are participating, all the different players that are participating. it's kind of sad i couldn't fill it, like i was not able to get all the stickers but the idea is that hopefully you are able to get all of them and you get to learn a lot about the players and and just be more engaged with, with what's happening. so when you just buy it, like i just did this morning, it looks like this and it's it's completely empty and you can see for example colombia, this is a team that i'm excited about, and so these are the names of all the different players and then you get these sticker packs. so there's five in a- you know five little stickers in a little pack. to anybody who's been doing this for many years we even know what this thing's smells like. it's like, you know, the smell of childhood right here. you'll be excited about this one, i just got massimo luongo from australia. you know i take these stickers and i, and i stick them on the album. i've been asking myself how much of my paycheck am i gonna be spending on this? because, you know, i'm a mathematician. i can do the calculation and i know that this is not a great idea - gonna be costing a lot of money. but i kind of want to think about how much is it gonna cost? the sticker album this year has 682 stickers, the last one had 681, but for some reason they decided that the first one should have number 0 so there's 682 stickers. each one of these packs cost $1.00, there's 5 stickers in each one, and so that means that each sticker is 20 cents. the difficult thing is that i don't get to choose what's, what's in here. so you know if i got super lucky and i got all the stickers that i wanted with no repeats then there would be 682 stickers, so when i multiply this this would be the cost of filling the album - 136 dollars and 40 cents. but of course there's no way that i'm ever gonna get that lucky. okay i'm gonna, you know, if anybody has done this before they know that you keep getting repeats and repeats and repeats. and so what i'm asking myself is how many stickers will i need to buy until i get all of them? actually this is something that people have tried to do before. so the most recent story that came out talked about how it would cost about $1,000 to fill the album. and i see where they get that, but i want to i want to give us a different way of thinking about this because the the problem is that that estimate of a thousand dollars assumes that you're just buying and buying and buying and buying stickers, and that's not really how it works. how it works is that many people around, around you are buying stickers and so whenever you get repeats and they get repeats then you're able to swap with each other and that way you're able to lower the costs. let's say that we're trying to find this number n, which is the number of stickers i expect to buy before i get every sticker at least once. this is the lonely sticker collector version, i'm in, i'm in the us, i have nobody to trade with and so i'm just going to imagine that i'm that i'm buying and buying stickers until i get them. let me try to define ni to be how many stickers it took me to get between the ith new sticker and the i plus one new sticker, okay? so for example n0 will be how many stickers until i get the first new one. n1 will be how many times until i get the second 
new one. you can imagine, for example, what is n200? that means that i've bought a lot of packs, i have 200 of the players and now i really want to get the next one. so i'm looking for for some new one that i that i don't have in my album yet. and then i keep i keep buying and buying and buying stickers until i get one that i don't have yet. and however many stickers it takes me, i'm going to call that number n. the total number of stickers is going to be basically, you know, how long did it take me to get the first new one, plus how long did it take me to get the second new one, and so on; until i get the last new one - this is how long it's going to take me to find the very last one. and so if i want to find this number n, how many stickers i need to buy, what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually try to find each one of these numbers. and let's just say we want to compute n200 for an example. what i want you to imagine is this: i have 200 stickers and now i'm going to buy a new one. so you can imagine i i open a pack, i grab one of them, and this is this is what i get: jonathan dos santos from mexico. and then what i do is that i i have to look and see, do i already have jonathan dos santos? is he one of the 200 that i already have or do i not have it yet? and of course there's there's 682 possibilities of which one this could be. this is number 461, but you know it 
could be anything between 0, 1 - - 681. let's imagine that i put a circle around the ones that i already have. so let's say that i already found sticker number 1, i haven't found 0, i haven't found 2; let's say that i did find 461 already and i haven't found 681. so i pulled another sticker out, and i want you to imagine that this is- 
- (brady: who's this?) andreas christensen from 
denmark - number 257. and now imagine that i open my album and i find that andreas christensen is not one that i have already, so i get i get to stick him right away. and so it only took me one new sticker to get one new player, okay? so if this was the first one that i drew, then it would take me one new sticker. you know, if i happen to draw this one out then it takes me one sticker to get a new one - here it takes me one sticker to get a new one. but now let's just go back to the reality where i actually pull jonathan dos santos and i did have jonathan dos santos already. and so now the question is how many stickers is it going to take me from now on? well this was a waste, you know. i already had jonathan dos santos, he's not useful to me, so i need to draw again. how many new steps is it going to take me to get the next one? well this is precisely the definition of the number n200. so i wasted this step and and it's like i have to start over and it's still going to take me n200 steps, because that's what that number means. so if i draw jonathan dos santos it's actually gonna take me 1 plus n200 stickers before i get a new one. the same, for example,
if i draw number 1 - it's going to take me one plus n200. so basically depending on what i draw here it's either gonna work right away, i just draw one sticker and it's a new one, or if i already had it then it's going to take me 1 plus n200 stickers. how many stickers did i already have? i have 200 stickers already. so in 200 of the draws is going to take me this many steps to get the next one. whereas, for the stickers that i'm missing, which is a lot, i'm missing 482 of them, is going to go right away. and so when i average these numbers over the total number, which is 682, well that average is going to be how long it takes me to get that sticker. so i get this nice equation; and now if you look at this equation you're going to find that 200 plus 482 is equal to 682, so this equation is just saying this is equal to 1 plus 200 over 682 times n of 200. what i get is that the number of stickers that i should expect to buy before i get the 201st new one is going to be this. so that's one computation. now, as you can imagine the same argument will work for any one of these numbers, okay? and so what i want to do now is generalise and do this for any one of these numbers; and i think the key thing that we should realise here is where did this 482 come from? well you saw what happened - it was 680 to minus 200. ni, which is how many stickers i need to buy between the ith new sticker and the i plus first new sticker, is going to be 682 divided by 682 minus i. and so if i combine these two what i'm gonna get is that n is equal to 682 over 682 plus 682 over 681, 682 over 680-
- (brady: you can see) (when you opened your first pack you were) (definitely gonna get a sticker you) (didn't have.)
- exactly. so this is, this is the number n sub 0, how long is it gonna take me to get the first new sticker? for sure no matter what the first one i get is, that's gonna just gonna come right away. and as you go on it gets harder and harder and harder and harder to get a new one. what is the last one? and so i get 682 divided by 682 minus 681, which is equal to 1.
- (brady: that makes sense as well) (because when you- when there's one sticker) (you need you've got a 1 in 682 chance of) (getting it.)
- and it's so hard to get it. and i think it's worth delving on this point a little bit. this is how long it takes you to get the very last sticker, okay? and anybody who's collected this, who's collected anything, knows that this gets so much harder and at the very end if i already got every single sticker, and i'm only missing one, and i ask myself how many should i buy until i get that new one? it's gonna take me a whole albums worth just to get that last sticker. so i think at this point there's two kinds of people; there's one kind of people who will be like, oh this is so beautiful let's explore the mathematics of this, and there's other people that will say well what's the answer? let's talk about what the answer is first and then we'll come back to the beautiful mathematics behind this. what is this number? i compute, i computed. i went to a computer, i worked it out that this number is about 4844. so this is the number of stickers that i should expect to buy, that's a lot of money. i'm not about to do that, i don't have that kind of paycheck. what if you use the service that panini offers, which is that once you have 50 stickers that you're missing then you can just order them from them. just send me those and then i'll fill my album and i don't have to trade it with anybody. i basically have to do this computation, except that instead of going all the way from zero to 682; i want to do it from 0 to 632. it's about 1775 stickers, okay.
- (brady: what a saving!) so we're coming down from a thousand to 355 and i think that's pretty shocking that to get the first 632 stickers cost you 355, and to get the last fifty it's like over six hundred dollars.
- (brady: do we have to) (pay panini for those fifty though?)
- we do and i have to be honest that i i think they do it at face value, but i'm not totally sure. but that's not fun. i mean the whole point of this is to buy stickers and trade it with other people and so on. and so i think we should go for a little bit of a more realistic scenario where we have a bunch of people that are trying to fill the album together. so thankfully there's this nice model that that donald newman and lawrence shepp came up with. let's say that we want to buy stickers among a bunch of people, in this case n is 682, that's
the number of stickers, and f is just however many friends are part of this game. (brady: so federico the model that
you're about to) (talk to me about isn't how hard it will) (be to fill one album, it's for everyone) (to fill their album; all the friends will) (fill their albums?)
- exactly so it's a. it's a collective goal, everybody wants to fill the album, we're all gonna help each other out. and so they came up with this amazing formula; i should warn you that is kind of an ugly formula. it's a big formula, it's messy, and i'm not even expecting that everybody will understand it, but the whole point that i want to make is that there is a formula. okay so let me show you that messy formula. number of stickers divided by number of friends, so far this is fine, and now this is where it gets messy. so integral from zero to infinity of some very big expression - it looks like this: 1 minus, and big 
parentheses, 1 minus, it's a quotient here, here i get 1 plus x plus x squared let's say x over 1, x squared over 1 times 2, x cubed over 1 times 2 times 3, and so on. until the number of friends minus 1. and i take all of that and i divide it by e to the x; i warned you this was messy. now you take a parenthesis here and you take this whole thing and raise it to the n, which is the number of stickers, and then you close the parentheses and then this is an integral with variable x and so it's integral here dx. (brady: it's a monster!)
- it's a monster; i think is beautiful but you have to have a taste for these kinds of things. what i think is beautiful is not that i see this and i think it's 
really beautiful, what i think is beautiful is that i just need to plug in n for the number of stickers, f for the number of people and i'm gonna get the answer for how many stickers per person we 
expect to be buying. (brady: how much of a 
saving is it to be a sticker) (swapper?)
- so what we need to do is figure out how to plug in this thing. one thing i will say is that if if the number n and the number f are pretty small, then this expression is actually not too bad and if you've taken a course in integral calculus you will have the tools to compute this, for n and f small. but the problem is that we're looking at n is equal to 682, we want to do this for various values of f, and so really we're going to have to ask a computer for help. and so we're just going to plug into a computer and we- i did this ahead of time, and i'll show you some of the results. so for example for f equal to 1, i got no friends i'm doing it by myself, then we should get the old answer that we got when when we were just buying and not trading. and you find that the answer is 4844. 969 dollars. now let's say that it's just you and me brady, and we're gonna we're gonna do this together and so now we have two friends. and as you can imagine is going to be a little a little bit cheaper. then the answer that you get is 3219. so in total we're gonna buy like 6,400 stickers but it's 3,200 each. so this is not what we want to do either, we should probably find some more friends because i don't know about you but i'm not about to spend 644 dollars on this, okay?
- (brady: no? i bet you would.) no i'm not, i'm not that crazy. you'll see i've, i've never filled an album. let's try five friends. so if we have five friends the cost starts getting quite a bit lower, so now it's going to be two hun- 2050 stickers per person, which is about 410 dollars per person. 
- (brady: wow so if i- if i'm) (trading with four other people i'll halve-) (i will better than halve)
what i have to cost?) yeah, that's right. and and you can imagine we probably shouldn't stop there right? of course the the the more friends this is gonna keep going down lower and lower and lower, okay. and so i actually just ran this for ten friends, twenty friends and fifty friends. i should say that it wasn't me running this. so i got the wonderful help of my student viviana marquez and i want to give her credit because she's much better with computers than me. so that's looking much
better i think. (brady: where's this heading towards?
you know if) (i live in colombia where everyone's) (obsessed with these stickers and there's) (a population in the millions like, how) (low can this go? does it bottom out) (anywhere? 
- so, so there's something called the law of large numbers which says that basically once we, once we have enough people then it kind of costs each of us essentially the cost of an album. 682, so if i multiply that by 20 cents i get 136. of course it can't be lower than that, because i need to buy all the stickers. and so, you know, basically however whatever price you're willing to pay, that's kind of how you need to figure out how much you need to trade. and i think this is a good argument for really using the panini as the social experience that it is and actually going out and seeking out friends. and and the more that you do it the lower that the price can be, and it can be down to pretty close to that 136. one thing that i wanted to do is that, i don't know about you brady, but i i find this formula absolutely amazing. you know, i sat down and i understood it and i read the proof and i, and it makes sense to me; and yet i have trouble believing it it's so magical. and so one thing that i did is that i reached out to viviana marquez again and i asked her, hey you're amazing with programming can you just run some simulations that will take ten friends and will buy stickers for ten friends and figure out how many stickers they spent, and run it a hundred times so that we can get some kind of average of where it'll be. and so i'll show you viviana's numbers. i think that's good that not only do we have a proof of this that i, that we understand; i think sometimes it's good to just run some experiments to make sure that the formula also holds up in reality and and and it really does. just like i don't know which stickers are inside this pack, i might open this in a minute,
i also never know what the problem of the week is gonna be over at brilliant.org. so let's have a look today. the basic one says, every green square is one quarter of the square it's inscribed in. if the pattern continues infinitely what fraction of the total figure will be green? d'you think you know the answer to that? how about we have a look at the intermediate. if a plus b over c equals 6 over 5 and b plus c over a equals 9 over 2, then what is the value of a plus c over b? i think i'm going to need a pen and paper for that one. but brilliant is not just about the problem of the week, although that's one of my favourite things about it, they also have an incredible number of courses you can try covering all sorts of things: physics, computer science and mathematics of course. and more and more people are signing up of all ages and backgrounds because really this is a place that encourages you to change the way you think, think outside the box. how am i going to solve problems? it really gets your brain working in different ways and a lot of people like that, a lot of people want to be better thinkers. that's why they're going to brilliant. you can go there too, go to brilliant.org/numberphile so they know you came from here. and if you use /numberphile you can also get 20% off a premium membership at brilliant. ooh i've got the french national team, special one, oh also got the colombian national team! that one's for you federico. anyway brilliant.org/numberphile for that twenty percent off; check them out. and thank you to them for supporting this video.
