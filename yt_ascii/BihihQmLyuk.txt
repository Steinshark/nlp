alright guys welcome to ten of the most beautiful android games that you probably haven't played ones that your eyes will probably thank you for but your phone probably won't first up is arcs of ival evolved a game present on current gen consoles as well as pc so you can probably imagine with the right hardware the smartphone version has a lot going on the most impressive aspect here though is that you've got a full open world most places you can see you can also get to when you combine this with dynamic lighting and shadows and a dense jungle packed with moving creatures this could be considered the crisis of mobile games infinity ops is a multiplayer sci-fi fps which kinda reminds me of call of duty infinite warfare grunted that wasn't the best game but this does become a whole lot more impressive when it's playing on a phone the game uses smart compression to keep texture sizes low which actually makes the game run okay even on lower mid-range phones now this name might ring a bell monster hunter stories used to be a 3ds game and a brilliant one at that hundreds of hours of gameplay and loads of rpg elements to get stuck into well it's finally come to android and nothing is missing not to mention your phone is a massive upgrade in power from the 3ds the game was originally on and so it will run at 60fps on most devices with fewer jagged edges the game isn't cheap but at the same time you could look at it as half the price of its 3ds release and better i'm always skeptical when people tell me that a 2d side-scrolling game has great graphics but in the case of altos odyssey the clean lines these soft changing skies and the subtly animated layers make for a serene viewing experience the fact that the art is simple has the flipside of also meaning it'll run well on pretty much any phone life is strange is another one of those games that's available on nearly every other platform and you notice character models and animations are console like but i would say resolution isn't the best on android and it doesn't look like this anyway to tweak it i would guess this is a lazy port from consoles and so whilst it looks great it does lack the option to pick your own settings to suit your device return from planet x is a bit of a weird one you can tell this was made by a small team because the framework the storyline and the menus could all do with some work but from a technical standpoint this is one of the most advanced mobile phone games out there we're talking bloom effects motion blur and up to eight times anti-aliasing to eliminate jagged edges even the galaxy note 2 9 can't play this game on max settings smoothly mobius final fantasy is a beast of a game it might seem a little overwhelming at first cuz it doesn't exactly hold you by the hand but if you stick with it you are rewarded with satisfying combat and a well-written story as you come to expect from the final fantasy name the character and enemy models are super well animated not to mention the visual confetti you see every time you use one of the game's over-the-top spells and attacks it's also refreshing to see a game of this caliber that plays in portrait feels natural i wasn't blown away by cover fire as a game it's a neat little shooter but borders on generic having said that in terms of visuals you've got slow-motion kills you've got depth of field when you focus on near objects and the option for 60 frame per second gameplay now for a game that has a slightly less vanilla approach father rio or father rio i'm already sure is a game that's really on this list because of how brilliant its concept is it's a shared augmented reality experience the idea being that you and a bunch of friends could all install the game connect to each other and battle out in real time the actuality though is a little less impressive the single-player mode is pretty uninspiring and the multiplayer requires you to buy a $30 attachment which of course is a pretty chunky investment but when you do this essentially becomes full-scale laser tag anytime anywhere one game that you're a little bit more likely to have heard of is iron blade but it's jaw-dropping high-res real-time shadows and the devs have also added an option to increase the framerate cap to sixty frames per second so providing a phone can keep up this has the potential to be one of the slickest mobile experiences out there alright guys as always really hope you enjoyed the vid and if you're new around here don't forget to smash that subscribe button would really mean a lot to me my name is erin this is misty who's the boss i look at you guys in the next one [music]
