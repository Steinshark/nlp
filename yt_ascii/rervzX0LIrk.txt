a certain extent web 3.0 is back to the future when we started looking at a lot of the value that was accumulating around the internet was around usual contributed content so it was about what the users were creating now again to many of us the what academics were doing with the original early in the early internet was sharing our papers which is you know we're sharing our content that's what we do we write papers and do research and we were using it we were the suppliers of the service and then big service providers came along to provide news and other things but then it was realized that a lot of the content was arising from the individuals out there but at this point it was not getting aggregated into these large platforms and so web 3 arises as a reaction to that and in one way as i say it is back to the future it's how do we for many of these systems take back control so there are many variants of this there's obviously tim bernstein himself talking about his work at mit and solid and that's one vision it's a line of research that we've been pursuing for some number of years and in a previous video more talked about some of the principles of human data interaction which is sort of the theoretical framework we're looking at but the instantiation of that we're looking at is thing called databox we don't need to know your shopping history we just need to know whether you are a big spender medium spender or a title and that's maybe that's all we care about but i think we need to look at why databox so a lot of the concerns are in web3 is people are monetizing the data that we're giving them and we're not getting fair value and that's one concern i think you know each facebook user is assertively worth 35 to facebook in terms of advertising revenue essentially and people are going well can i get my fair share of that well it's like well what's your fair share of 35 you know is it going to change your life right so at an individual level the monetizing of the data i find as an economic incentive a bit spurious those who make substantial money on the internet by being influencers are getting paid for it they will continue to do that and by their very nature they're essentially producing curated content and they're getting paid for it and that's fine it's not their personal data that's getting monetized so i'm always slightly dubious about the economic argument about this and i actually come at it from a different set of angles and one the first and foremost one is privacy and actually we just start with the law we don't have to get into ethical debates the law and data protection regulation being the most recent in europe lays out the basis on which data should be processed so i want to take an example if i have a fancy new internet of things light switch in my eyes to control a fancy new internet of things bulb then you would think that while they both talk the internet protocol which is what i want them to do why on earth do any of these packets need to leave my home that's the simple question is why do they need to leak my home and the answer of course is they don't now if i want to be able to switch my light on from remotely from on my mobile phone when i'm out and about then then the question is how does my mobile phone send iep packets to that whilst it looks like an ordinary light switch we've actually got a pro tune there which goes to the right web page to turn the lights on and off in data box we take the view while you might want to have a server that's looking at that data and get to why in a minute then it should be in your house and that there is no need for the data to go beyond that and then under data protection law we're supposed to do privacy by design and by default and that means that you know my view is that if that means you can build a thing without sharing the data then i think the law says you're supposed to do that now at this point those big companies will say we'll get your consent to share the data because actually we need we want the data for other purposes so the fact that they can get when light switches switch on and off well what can that tell them well i can tell that tells them when you're at home start telling them which room you're in especially if they start doing correlations across devices so we start getting into inferences about people people have been worried about this with their online web habits and shopping habits this is nothing compared to being able to know every time you go to the toilet or something and it's unclear what companies will try to do with that data so i would just start off by saying they don't need it there's it's not like you're gonna get paid a lot of money for this so why don't we just build architectures in the future in which we keep this data in the home where we can so and that there's a fundamental privacy argument there the second one again comes about due to the law i am entitled to take all my personal data and process it however i see fit whereas a company it actually can find itself getting into difficulties if it has too much personal data it gets itself into a regulatory morass so any company that holds that engages in financial transactions has to not just comply with data protection laws they have to apply comply with financial services laws as well so you imagine a company that tries to hold all your data it's got a regulatory nightmare of what it can and cannot do with that data so actually in data box we view this as a places where if the data exists online you can pull that data in so you can bring it down through the apis that are available it's generated in the home from from iot devices or you type it in you know you give it the data it has access to your calendar and your address book and other bits and pieces and it can communicate with your phone then it can start to mash up data from different sources imagine i could take where my phone is the readings from the pir sensors the little passive infrared sensors that many people have in their homes as part of a burglar system lighting controls heating controls any controls in the house and start to understand and build a model of that user in that house within the within the data box within the house privately a private model and someone might say well if we could process that data it's very important here if they could process that data then we might be able to provide you with some value so say for example someone could supply an application that would run on the data box which would be a burglar alarm application which is right we'll take your pir sensors and everything else burglars will go around the house and not switch the lights on and so we can build a really smart burglar alarm that could really understand what's going on yeah it's probably going to get me going to the toilet in the night but aside from that well you know it's the are they downstairs wandering around but then the flip side of that is exactly all the same data assets could be used for an elderly care app today people are thinking of internet of things services with a cloud at the center and a device in the home and they limit themselves to the functionality that uses a reasonable amount of bandwidth because they can't absorb all the bandwidth on the internet connection out of the home they often assume far too much i have a one device that does a tcp connection every second it just sits there and polling the cloud service to see if it's so i should say it's on a separate network which i know prevented accessing the internet but it tries to do that and actually doing that on my local area network i don't care because it's not a problem but if those if all those connections were going up and down over my broadband link it's like harming those devices before i start it starts impacting my life and that's pretty trivial example so people are limiting what they imagine iot devices can do in the home because of the oh but not used too much bandwidth but on the other hand taking video from multiple cameras processing it in a data box which you know could be a raspberry pi doing this it's not talking about high-end computes here could provide new functionalities that people are currently not thinking about so there's that as well and finally when it comes to looking after the home i'd like my light switches to work when the internet's down i certainly want my burglar alarm to work when the internet's down because the first thing burglars hit is the power and the telecommunications coming out of the lives so i really would like it not to rely on the cloud service for all sorts of reasons and more so when we get into these applications for looking after lg in their homes so let's relate this back to this web 3 movement i think web3 is about you know getting control back of your data and understanding how to process it for your own value and publishing what you want to publish and i i is a good example where the raw data that i have i might not want to publish but i might be quite happy to publish some statistical data that's derived from it so you know for advertising purposes if someone wants to know whether you should advertise to me you know tea or something yeah then i'd be perfectly happy if they supplied an app which used my electricity monitoring to notice how many times i boiled the kettle in the day but what i don't want to do is share the data of what time of day and how long i bowled it for and everything else but i'll happily share that on average i have four cups of tea a day i mean that's not really a concerning personal statistic but sharing exactly when the kettle got switched on and off every day publicly with possibly others could get hold of it that then gives an occupancy pattern to the household so the data can be reused for purposes that it wasn't intended for and that's i think where a lot of the uneasiness around the data in the world is at the moment is that we're giving we engage in these transactions and sometimes we hand over data and all the data gets monitored as we use a website all sorts of things are monitored just as we move around the website and while we have to share some data to get the job done it's got the point where we no longer have any idea what the data is being used for and it's not clear it's being used to our benefit and so we really want to get control of that but as i say i don't quite believe the economic argument of my data will suddenly be worth you know i can't believe off my data i might get a few beers out of my data or something but i'd much rather open up much greater value in this data ecosystem by completely transforming it to be more of this web 3 model of applications you know send the code to my data i might share some statistics from you but actually it may just be your code running on my data and that's the transaction i get something i want and i pay you money for that and it's a product remember those things products before we just had services everything's a server we have all sorts of marvelous apps on this right all sorts of crazy things that are really useful to us and they are remotely managed and they're remotely updated and all of the problems that people talked about oh you couldn't possibly run your own email service at home it's like well no because the usual way of running it is become a linux systems guru and start from there right whereas in fact if any of these companies applied their knowledge and experience to you know actually providing privacy preserving solutions in the home they could do it and they could make it just as easy to use we have now moved to a world where we can support very complex technologies you know whatsapp for example is one of the world's most complex crypto protocols you can imagine whatsapp signal and co have decided this is a bit of a problem do you know that do you care no it just works right because all of the complexity of the double ratchet algorithm and all the way in which it does privacy protection you didn't have to engage in it you didn't have to assist the administrator you didn't have to generate public keys it was all just done and the bringing of the the automation and the digital that the digital has given us to provide these technologies known and so web 3.0 is exactly that there's the argument that we can all just run a linux box at home it's like yes we could but we would all have to become linux box experts but actually there's no reason why we can't do what we do with the phone apps today which is remotely support them and have all of this great technology and our own homes and actually providing new functionality take social media well actually most people they want to do social interaction you want to talk to like 30 or 40 mates and find out what they're doing again that doesn't require the publishing of things on walls so we've seen that even within the facebook family of people moving from facebook to whatsapp for a lot more of the discussions or snapchat and these other more things where by default you talk in a smaller social group and supporting those sorts of technologies between in a web 3y by building a peer-to-peer network you know well actually we did do that quite a number of years ago and it was called skype so we had it and then it got acquired by microsoft and turned back into a centralized service now if you're truly paranoid at this point you would identify that of course at the point that they did that they also allowed government agencies to get access to it as well so for the truly paranoid out there one of the reasons and lots of people have advocated moving to a peer-to-peer network is for those who are very worried about you know state surveillance so we don't need to know your shopping history we just need to know whether you are a big spender medium spender or a tight board that's maybe that's all we care about right and this is not how they're going to do it the next thing we could do is we could say well why can't we use the same kind of protocol to establish keys
