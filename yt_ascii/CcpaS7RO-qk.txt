if you need to get around in america there's no better ride than a pickup truck think about it what other vehicle packs so much potential into a single package need to rip some sand dunes no problem need to haul extraordinary amounts of cargo need to tow 30,000 lbs need to crawl up a rock wall for a truck it's no problem because someday it's actually possible that you might maybe think about doing one of those things i mean you'll at least consider it so you might as well be prepared that's why i bought myself the ultimate pickup truck the ford maverick sorry 1 second hey that's not a truck buddy what do you mean it's not a pickup truck it's not a pickup truck i'm sorry to tell you but it's probably the same length as a honda accord okay but does the accord have a bed or that square thing that you find on the back of trucks okay let me put it to you this way buddy there's a ford raptor behind me my own ford raptor it's got a 5 1/2t bed what about yours yeah i mean i don't know it's at least a couple feet 6.2 l naturally aspirated v8 what about yours look i don't want to talk about size but it's only four cylinders and i'm the canadian jason yep nope i don't need this i get enough negativity from the comments i don't need it from my friends too so maybe it's not a ford raptor and clearly as an automotive youtuber i could probably pick a way cooler vehicle with more hype online but to me this is one of the the coolest automotive products that has come about in the past decade and i mean that genuinely we used to have tons of small practical pickup truck options in the us now it's down to just this and the hyundai santa cruz logically the hybrid maverick could easily be the perfect vehicle for the vast majority of people and it starts at $25,000 in the days when yeah you can basically spec an f150 to 90 grand and if you genuinely don't need all-wheel drive the front wheeel drive for maverick hybrid gets extraordinary fuel economy and one of the most practical vehicles you could possibly buy you have to give ford credit for creating a practical fuele efficient and in my opinion greatl looking truck all at an affordable starting price now this is not the hybrid i waited a couple of years before buying a maverick because i was desperately hoping for either an all-wheel drive hybrid or a plug-in variant but it doesn't seem will get either so this is the 2.0 l all-wheel drive lariat with just about every optional box at a price of about $440,000 wow once again sorry about this look who decided to call back so are you ready to admit it is a truck what no i just wanted to know what tires you're running ah okay yes i i see where this is going what is the continental recommended tire for the ford maverick did i get that right ah well done i see what you did there i'd recommend the continental cross contact lx25 hey common ground what do you know looks like us truck guys get each other jason jason what please don't ever say that again jacob he hung up on me real talk though i am stoked to announce today's sponsor continental a company that maybe just maybe loves tires as much as i do and we're going to be working together for 2024 and have some really exciting stuff in the works this of course is the cross contact lx25 which is a premium all season touring tire for crossovers and suvs wait wait and and trucks right it's not just this isn't this is not a crossover it's it's also for trucks anyways this is an awesome yearr round tire with excellent wet grip great tread life low road noise and it has wear indicators that disappear as the tread decreases so you can quickly check if your remaining tread is good for dry wet or snow i've looked at third party test results and it's actually really impressive in the snow considering this is an allseason tire you can run year round and not a dedicated winter tire big thanks to continental you can find a link in the video description okay and can we just take a moment to appreciate these beefy sidewalls i love that in 2024 while the majority of car makers are going purely for aesthetics and tiny sidewalls you can get 17-in wheels on the maverick with plenty of sidewall it's more comfortable they're less likely to pinch and thus get flats and you can run into curbs all day long and not worry about messing up your wheels wheels so thanks for it on the subject of wheels i think they're fine i think they look nice but the blue of the truck is actually a little darker than i would have hoped for they actually dropped the old brighter blue and now this is the only blue available so i kind of feel like i need to get some bronze wheels so that the truck has a bit more pop okay so i feel like there are a few questions that i need to answer first what spec maverick did i choose and why second why did i sell the cross treck the greatest vehicle of all time for this and third what are my plans for the truck so starting off as mentioned of the three available trims xl xlt and lariat this is the highest trim the main reasons why you'd want to go with lariat over the other trims and i did highly consider the xlt because it seems like the best overall deal for the money but the lariat comes with adaptive cruise control you can only get that on this trim it comes with a much better sound system so i was excited about that and it has a cooler interior and i like cloth seats i have no problem with the xlt's interior but i really like the brown and blue color scheme used inside it's quite a good look in my opinion and it's a super functional interior spacious cup holders plenty of storage options wireless phone charging you've got apple carplay first vehicle i've owned with carplay how exciting and the first time i've ever had a heated steering wheel now i realize my physique is not the norm lean and lanky the problem is is blood never makes it to my fingertips so my hands are always cold especially in the winter so i am particularly excited about having a heated steering wheel and speaking of wheels don't look at this one i am embarrassed to admit i have purchased my first automatic transmission vehicle look if ford had offered a manual in the maverick i would have bought the truck the day it came out they didn't instead it has this wheel yes i feel shame i wouldn't even say it's a particularly great automatic transmission it's an 8-speed it's fine it's fine but look what we have here an abundance of actual buttons for climate control really easy to select where the air flows dual zone capability and you can use auto climate control at various levels i love the ease of use of the climate controls here as far as interior space i have the front seat adjusted to my driving position i'm a little over 61 and if i go to the back sure it's not super spacious back here but i still have room in front of my knees plenty of room there and plenty of headro as well so overall considering how small of a truck this is it's fairly spacious in the interior the rear seats also fold up and there's a clever storage compartment underneath moving to the front i tend to do quite a bit of driving in the mountains in the winter so i wanted all-wheel drive and that means the 2.0 l turbocharged inline 4 cylinder 250 horsepower 277 lb feet of torque that means it's going to be way faster than my old cross trek because everything is faster than my old cross trek but actually there's another vehicle you might be surprised that it's significantly quicker than so i met up with the straight pipes for a simple game of match the truck to the 0 to 60 time but jacob figured out what was going on pretty quickly got to say though i'm impressed with the whiteboards build quality and yeah the 2.0 l ford maverick is quicker to 60 and quicker in the quarter versus a 6.2 l ford raptor now at the back of the truck okay look i know what you're thinking jason you don't need a truck for just a single bag of mulch well it's not just one bag it's three now show me an suv that can fit that in the back which leads us to two very important packages optioned on this truck 4k tow package and the fx4 off-road package and you're thinking wait a minute fx4 package comes with a sticker on the side of the truck well you're right but i had that sticker removed when i had ppf installed because i think it looks much cleaner without yes i had the whole truck covered in expel ultimate plus 10 paint protective film so it's ready for the adventures ahead without worrying about scraping up the paint or getting rock chips i've used expel on my s2000 my other s2000 my cross trek and my model 3 and 5 years after it has been installed on my tesla it is still incredible how well it has held up and how easy it still is to clean i love this stuff so a big thanks to expel for helping out with the install on the maverick as well as elite window tinting in beaverton oregon it was immediately obvious these folks really take pride in the work they do and take a ton of care with the installs with the ppf window tint and ceramic coating there is such a beautiful glossy pop to this very real truck guys truck-sized truck so a huge thank you to the folks at elite for doing such an incredible job on the maverick i'm feeling as confident as ever or at least i was so with the 4k toe and the fx4 packages honestly for the price you get a lot of added features it's certainly way cheaper than if you were to try to make these modifications yourself so in my opinion you might as well check the boxes most notably with 4k tow you double the standard mavx tow rating to 4,000 lb you get the brake controller and both four pin and seven pin conn conectors with the trailer hitch receiver and better cooling for both your engine and transmission and a slightly higher final drive ratio now with the fx4 package you get unique wheels drive modes heel descent control skid plates and a performance suspension it's worth mentioning that if you do get the trimor which would further improve off-road capability your max tow rating is just 2,000 lb so for me the lariat 4k tow made more sense all right so it's not that big of a bed at just 4 and2 ft long but there are some really clever features i got the optional trifold topper which keeps everything secure and if you're hauling larger loads you can fold it up and secure it in place against the rear window so you still have full use of the bed and if you need to haul long awkward shapes well you have several options of course tailgate down is one option you can also raise the tailgate slightly and lock it in at an angle or you can use a bed extender and not worry about your stuff falling out you've also got these sliding tie downs so you can adjust them for whatever loads you're carrying there's good lighting for the bed there's a 400 w outlet and a nice little storage compartment so while it is small it is well thought out and super functional and underneath my oh my what is that a fullsize spare yes indeed that is more spare tire than a tesla cyber truck comes with and without taking up any bed space okay so you get it i think the ford maverick is super cool but why why would i sell my cross trek perhaps the greatest vehicle of all time and with a manual transmission for this well i'll be honest if i didn't have a youtube channel i probably wouldn't i realize an 8-year-old cross trek probably isn't the sexiest thing to talk about on the internet so don't worry i won't anymore i definitely still will but they say as consumers you should vote with your wallet so consider this to be my vote for what i truly believe to be one one of the best vehicles on the market today again if you don't need all-wheel drive or the higher tow rating the hybrid really is an incredible do everything machine okay like almost everything okay so what plans do i have for the truck well this is really just the machine that is going to take over for my cross trek for adventure purposes long-distance driving remote destinations and finally having a bed for home projects is also really exciting much like my cross trek it will likely remain mostly stock and serve as a reliable do anything vehicle okay and i also must admit i'm pretty excited about just how many tires i can fit in the bed of this truck as someone who definitely doesn't have a problem it's not a problem so again a big thank you to continental for feeding my addiction i'll be testing out these cross contacts in all kinds of conditions you can find product links in the video description and of course thanks to the wonderful folks at elite window tinting the maverick is looking absolutely stunning if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching it's definitely a truck
