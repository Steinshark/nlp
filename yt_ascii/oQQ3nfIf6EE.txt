hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by hyundai we are looking at the differences between manual and dual clutch transmissions now for the 2021 model year hyundai is introducing their ndct to the veloster n which means now you have a choice of transmission so i thought it'd be interesting to compare the two options and talk about the advantages of each and the veloster n is a fantastic vehicle it's the first and only car i've ever driven on the nurburgring and it's also the fastest i've ever driven in a car legally i might add at 155 miles per hour on germany's audubon so we're going to take a look at a very basic example of how manual transmission works versus how a basic example of a dual clutch transmission works then we'll look at a more realistic real world example looking at hyundai's six-speed manual transmission versus their ndct and then finally we'll get into the advantages of a manual transmission versus the advantages of a dual clutch transmission so how does a basic manual transmission work well you will have your engine right here and it will connect to your transmission which is what you have right here through this clutch which is what we have here in purple and so when you press in that clutch pedal what you're doing is opening and closing releasing and clamping down on this clutch disc right here and so when you press the pedal in you release that clutch disc and then when you release that clutch pedal you clamp down on that clutch disc thus engaging the clutch and so here we have our input shaft and we can see our gears one two three and four again a simple example we don't even have a reverse on this example right here and then you have your output shaft here in blue and so each of these gears is rotating on a bearing and so it's not actually forcing this output shaft to rotate and then we have this collar right here which is splined to this output shaft so it is rotating with the output shaft and so that's what we're actually going to use to transfer torque through it so for example if we were in first gear you would have the torque coming from your engine passing through this clutch disc over to first gear you would have this collar select mesh up with that first gear and then from that first skier it would transfer the torque to the rear wheels through this differential and then out to the rear wheels now let's say you want to shift to second gear well what you're going to do is you're going to press in that clutch pedal thus you no longer have power transferring from your engine to your transmission and then you now use your gear selector and move this collar over from the first gear over to the second gear then you release that clutch pedal meaning your engine and your transmission are now connected again and then you're sending torque through that second gear and across down to the differential and finally to the wheels all right so moving on to a dual clutch transmission and actually these operate very similarly to a manual transmission you can see you know you've got your engine it'll attach to the clutch you've got your input shaft and your output shaft just like we had previously except now as the name implies we have two clutches and thus two input shafts one for each clutch and so you can see that this input shaft here drives along to this blue clutch right here the our clutch disc and then we have this red input shaft with our red clutch disc and what you do is you split your even and odd gears among them so one and three are on one shaft two and four have their own individual clutch and so then just like we had previously you have your gear selector with these collars but the beauty of having two clutches is it means you can actually select two gears at the exact same time because you can have one clutch open and one clutch closed so for example let's say we are in first gear well this collar here is going to select first gear this clutch this blue clutch here is going to be engaged so we're going to be sending our torque through first gear through that color right there and then to our wheels now while this is happening second gear can be engaged with this collar right here and instead of a manual shift selector this is just being controlled electronically now or you can use paddle shifters but essentially you're going to have both of these then engaged so when you're shifting from first to second all you have to do because both gears are already engaged is just switch which clutch is engaged so first gear is engaged that means this clutch is clamped down this one's open and then we switch to second and all we do is transfer that clutch so you never actually lose torque completely and you don't have that delay of switching gears you're just switching between one clutch to the other so it's a very fast shift and you maintain torque throughout okay so now let's look at hyundai's specific six-speed manual transmission used in the veloster n and so the biggest difference you'll notice between that and the basic example is that we now have an additional output shaft so this is a front engine front wheel drive vehicle of course packaging is a concern and by having these two output shafts you can package this in a very compact way and make sure everything fits up front another thing you'll notice is that because we have two output shafts we actually have two final drive ratios so gears one two in reverse are paired with the more aggressive 4.333 final drive ratio and then gears 3 through 6 are paired with a 3.25 a final drive ratio and so actually this differential here is sandwiched between these two so both of these outputs connect to this differential and thus split the power between the two front wheels now as far as the power flow for each gear we start off in first shift gears torque then flows through second gear next we select third gear then fourth gear then fifth gear and finally our top gear sixth okay so what about reverse well you'll notice that if your engine is spinning one direction and then you pass that rotation to another shaft well now that shaft is rotating the other direction and then if that shaft is then connected to our final drive well then our engine and our final drive are now rotating the same direction so in order for those to rotate in opposite directions we need to add another step and so that's what they do so for first gear you come across this shaft right here this passes to an idler shaft that idler shaft then rotates the reverse gear and then from there you go to the final drive which then rotates your differential in the opposite direction thus driving your vehicle in reverse and finally we get to the veloster ends latest transmission which is the eight speed and so you can see some similarities with this basic dual clutch transmission in that you have a split you have two input shafts you've got the red clutch here with the even gears and then you have the blue clutch here with the odd gears on a separate input shaft and then like our six speed manual transmission we have two output shafts which also means we have two final drive ratios in this scenario so gears three four seven and eight paired with a two point seven one four and then gears 1 2 5 6 in reverse all paired with a 3.800 gear ratio and so again this differential here is going to be sandwiched between these two so that both of these can drive it and as you can see you've got you know a split where you can go odd gear even gear odd gear even gear between the two clutches here and one of the differences between these clutches here and our basic example is that with the ndct they're using a wet multi-plate clutch and so using that wet multi-plate clutch means that they have a lot of clutch discs and those are all bathed in oil so it's great for performance applications ensuring that you have durability and can also send a larger amount of torque through the transmission and so let's run through the different gears to see how the power flows through to start in first the blue clutch closes the red clutch is open and we send torque through first gear next second gear selected blue clutch opens while red clutch closes and we send torque through second then third gear is selected blue clutch closes while red clutch opens and we send torque through third gear fourth gear is selected blue clutch opens while red clutch closes and we send torque through fourth gear and this process continues as we select fifth gear then sixth gear then seventh gear and finally eighth gear now for reverse just like we did with the manual transmission we have to add in a step so we can counter that rotation from our engine to that differential and so here coming in on this red shaft it will then pass along to this output shaft where this gear is spinning just on a bearing so it's not actually influencing this output shaft and then transferring from this gear to this gear which then you can use a color to select reverse gear and then drive it through that 3.8 final drive ratio and switch the direction so your car drives in reverse so what are the advantages of each style of transmission starting with the manual transmission one of the common advantages of a manual transmission is that they tend to weigh less and so that is in fact true for the veloster n with the manual transmission weighing in at 3 106 pounds versus the ndct vehicle weighing in at 3 247 pounds so about 140 pound difference and that's a difference you know that's going to benefit the manual transmission as far as efficiency as far as acceleration handling benefits i mean they have made some tweaks to the dct vehicle in order to compensate for that additional weight and also help improve the handling by changing the negative camber switching to some stiffer springs and using a larger front stabilizer bar additional benefit of the manual transmission simply comes down to cost and complexity i mean just looking at it it is a simpler device a simpler transmission and there is a cost benefit to that for the 2021 model year in the us market that's a 1500 option to go with the dual clutch transmission another benefit of manual transmissions is that you can bump start them start your vehicle if the battery is dead simply using the clutch to do that rather than using a starter motor so a cool little trick that can be beneficial if you're out in the middle of nowhere and your car dies and your battery is dead a way to get things going again manual transmissions are often very efficient you don't have major you know power losses going through them and you don't have a torque converter so you know so efficiency benefits to manual transmissions and finally you know really the biggest advantage of the manual transmission is just the engagement it's much more engaging for the driver to actually have to shift these gears and that can be fun for certain people i find it fun i like driving manual transmission vehicles because of the engagement and if you actually want to drive quickly and you're a little concerned about your rev matching and say you want to go on a track and not be concerned about upsetting the balance of the car or executing the perfect shift hyundai does have rev matching with their six-speed manual transmission in the blaster end which is a really cool feature especially i think for track driving if you don't want to upset the car and you want to make sure you have perfect shifts and there's so much to think about during track driving so it's one thing that can kind of make it easier for you if you don't have that heel toe dialed in perfectly all right moving on to the advantages of a dual clutch transmission well one of the ones here is simply that it has more gears and you know it's just a bit cumbersome to start adding in a ton of gears on a manual transmission and these kind of passenger car daily drivers but with the dual clutch transmission it's easy and the gear shifts are so quick that it just kind of makes sense to do it's all packaged very neatly here and so the advantage of having more gears is that you have a wider spread of your gears and you can also keep those ratios closer together so in this case gears one through three are more aggressive with the dual clutch transmission versus the manual transmission yet eighth gear is taller than the manual transmission stock gear sixth gear so there are advantages there of having more gears and having the space to play with there also more gears just means you can optimize your power output because you can keep your engine rpm as close to peak horsepower as possible which is what you want to do in order to maximize power output and then also a huge advantage of dual clutch transmissions is simply their shift speed so they shift way faster than a human ever will less than 200 milliseconds for this hyundai ndct versus you know half a second to a second for a manual transmission gearshift another big advantage that dual clutch transmissions have is that because you're switching from one clutch to the other clutch and you do that simultaneously you're never actually losing positive torque so you're always accelerating versus with a manual transmission the second you push that clutch pedal in you are not accelerating in fact you're decelerating because you have forces pressing against your vehicle like aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance and so with a dual clutch transmission in that example you shift gears you're always accelerating so that's a very cool thing about them and helps them be quicker better performance efficiency also is a benefit of dual clutch transmissions they tend to have low power losses going through them when you're not slipping these clutches there's no torque converter so efficiency can be a benefit there but really dual clutch transmission comes down to performance this is the track star you're going to get better lap times because you have you know those shift time improvements you have continuous torque and so for example looking at the veloster and with the ndct using launch control 0 to 100 kilometers per hour or about 62 miles per hour in 5.6 seconds versus the manual transmission 6.1 seconds so half a second faster to 100 kilometers per hour thanks to a transmission that's pretty cool so whether you're looking to maximize driver engagement or just go all out as far as performance both of these transmissions can be very fun options thank you so much
