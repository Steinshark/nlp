[music] what's up guys mkbhd here and part of being a creator not just a youtuber but a creator is creating for multiple platforms so i happen to make videos i put them on youtube and that's the number one place to go but obviously i'm on twitter i'm on instagram i'm on facebook there's other places that i talk to you outside of youtube and that's for creative reasons but also you just don't you don't put all your eggs in one basket that's never a smart thing to do so you don't own your audience on any one platform so you diversify but i've always been thinking just because i get asked in like every interview pretty much ever like what would you do if youtube disappeared tomorrow or what would you do if youtube fell off like right now where would you be but like i never really had a good answer to that because it always i mean youtube has just been massive i would say too big to do that too big to instantly disappear if it ever started failing there would be a trajectory and i would see it and i could do something about it so i've never really had a good answer to that but the answer i always gave was just look there's no better place for video creator right now in 2018 as it is than youtube and as long as that is still true then i will still upload my tech videos to youtube they have it all they have all the tools they have all the videos they have all the stats they have all the eyeballs they have all the monetization they have every feature you could want as a youtube watcher and as a youtube creator all in one place so if you want to grow yourself as a creator and get eyeballs on your work you go to youtube if you want to look for a video online you go to youtube.com it's just that simple but you can never be on top forever so as this whole online video thing just continues to blow up everyone wants a piece of youtube's pie everyone wants a bite of of that massive pie youtube has right now so you might have seen it in the news there's company after company just takes a shot at youtube's throne and it may be called like the next big whatever or maybe they're saying youtube's falling off and it's getting replaced i've seen the story a million times like periscope for example you remember that right live videos they got bought out by twitter and they still do their thing but it's it's very niche there's no search for like an archive of stuff it's not really a youtube competitor snapchat there as a creative person there have been plenty of plenty of creative people on snapchat but for the longest time many many years snapchat didn't really focus on those creators i mean what did you see in the discover page year after year it's daily mail that kind of stuff so eventually it started leaving and there's no real monetization option for snapchat they kind of turned the page a little bit too late on that vine vine we basically saw the whole life cycle of a youtube competitor through vine it grew up through 100 percent just creative people there were no like tv talk show hosts or i mean no offense to tv people but really what we went to vine for was the people who just made stuff that was what vine was built on but even with all these creators they couldn't find a way to financially sustain it the monetization was never really secure and vine crumbled it couldn't last so r.i.p vine those vimeo they've kind of just been around for a while sort of in the background vimeo exists i think as the most complete possible competitor to youtube as a video site you know they have monetization they have search they kind of have this focus on high quality you can find short films there and things like that but there are like 10 000 times less eyeballs on vimeo than youtube so if you're picking where to upload your video if you want it to get seen or you want to get feedback on it people are going to pick youtube every time that's what creators mean when they say the word platform it's almost literally like a platform for your work to be visible above the rest because of things like search and then even facebook video is another one that's come up recently that's had a lot of people talking and i think they even understood that creators are a big driving force behind making a successful video platform but still somehow like 90 of the videos i see on facebook are stolen from youtube so even if they do get monetization right search is kind of a dumpster fire on facebook i have no idea how to search to find a certain facebook video and yeah the copyright stuff is kind of a big deal google plus do i even do i even need to say more than that so still through all that for the last decade through all of these companies taking their shots at youtube and trying to get a slice of that pie some of them with more success than others still at the top remains youtube.com is the place to go to make videos and to go to watch videos so then a couple weeks ago i was at wwdc which is apple's event and while i was there in san francisco had a quick meeting with instagram where they wanted to show me a video app they were working on okay interesting i've seen videos on instagram already but this is a whole separate thing and they showed it to me and it was it was pretty intriguing and it kind of came with like this silent like you in and this is now what was just announced today instagram tv or ig tv and it honestly feels like it has the most potential or what i would say is the most complete set of factors to potentially be like that second place big video platform for creators like the eyeballs first of all yes they have it people use instagram definitely people can just do instagram and have their work found through that they just rolled over a billion monthly active users on the platform so the the platform is big and that's not a problem and then search they kind of have the beginnings of search they have i mean there's hashtags as we already know but they have the explore page and they kind of have their algorithms in place to help people find content so they don't do search great yet but i feel like discovery will also not be a problem and then the secret sauce that they've nailed that i think you have to hit the nail on the head with is a creator focus and they've had that everywhere if you look in the app store listing for this new igtv app it's creators it's it's not like like i said again like the tv late night hosts or anything like people who are like a-list celebrities it's actually people who create no offense again to like jimmy kimmel or whoever i don't whatever they have obviously live video on instagram which people have been getting more into on youtube even twitch as another competitor but twitch feels like its own separate like dedicated to live streaming type of site which is why i think it's a solid second place right now but instagram also has stories too which youtube has been also awkwardly trying to get into which i don't even think they should so it seems like instagram has it all the only real question mark is will they be paying creators and while i can't definitively say that they will monetize the platform just like youtube i can be pretty sure they are going to be doing some sort of monetization that will benefit creators so yeah i'm on igtv now i'm on instagram tv i have uploaded my first video we'll be messing with it more very shortly but there's a desktop uploader i can do red footage it's all it's all there for me so we're gonna i mean the 1.4 million people who already follow me on instagram are already there they're already subscribed to the igtv channel so if you're not already subscribed or following on instagram make sure you do that but it's it's getting rolling and it's getting started basically i'm excited for what's to come i'm excited the whole point of this video is i'm excited about the competition to youtube actually taking a step up competition is good for us users of the services if there is no competition to the iphone as much as you love the iphone it would never get better if there was no phone that's coming up and chomping on the bit and trying to steal your customers that's the kind of stuff that benefits the people who are using it so that's why i'm happy about youtube competition obviously the biggest complaint about igtv is vertical video which if you asked me a couple years ago i too was staunchly anti-vertical video because i make youtube videos so here's the thing instagram's pitch is all about the mobile experience first and we all hold our phones vertically and there's been snapchat stories and periscope and instagram stories and all this vertical video hello we've had square video on instagram for a while now and nobody was really complaining so i feel like if vertical video is the biggest complaint about igtv then that's actually probably a pretty good sign i am willing to experiment with and work within the confines of nine by 16 video there as i've already started messing with and it's actually kind of interesting so yeah we'll we'll see how it goes i'm over there now the point was competition's good that's about all i had to say for this one it's kind of a rambly video but i hope you enjoyed thank you for watching catch you over on igtv but of course catch you in the next youtube video peace
