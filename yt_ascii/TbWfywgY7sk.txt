at the end of our last video amd and intel had 
signed a global settlement in 1995 that put to   rest there are many outstanding legal battles 
amd celebrated with a satirical movie poster   depicting co-founder jerry sanders as indiana 
jones the title proclaiming the incredible   adventure continues but while the legal court 
battle might be over for now the market clashes   between the two fairchild descendants plowed on 
in this third video of a trilogy we continue our   tale of amd struggles to compete against 
an intel at the very peak of its powers   but first let me talk about the asian armature 
patreon early access members get to see new videos   first as well as selected references for those 
videos early access helps a lot and i appreciate   every pledge thanks and on with the show in march 
1993 intel released the pentium intel introduced   the pentium as the successor to their 386 and 
486 cpus they chose to call it the pentium rather   than the 586 in part because the old number names 
cannot be trademarked and also in part because the   pentium offered a brand new micro architecture 
capable of handling larger memory transfers   with 3.1 million transistors fabbed 
using a 0.8 micron process the chip   performed two to five times better than 
an intel 486 chip of the same frequency   so by the time of the global settlement it 
had been already in the market for over a year   facing this time lag and intel's iconic intel 
inside marketing promotions amd needed a hit   product of its own to compete amd needed 
to fire back with something groundbreaking   back in 1987 the company produced a risk 
microprocessor called the am 29000 it sold   well and amd built on top of that to produce 
the k5 amd's first entirely in-house design chip   the k in k5 stands for kryptonite which hinted at 
amd's ambition to take down intel superman and it   was indeed an ambitious chip adopting many of the 
pentium's innovations at a more aggressive level   producing a new design was way harder than 
reverse engineering and intel chip in order   to run the dominant windows os the k5 had to meet 
certain standards but those chip standards which   have both physical and software aspects were 
designed by intel who obviously was not helping   nevertheless on the surface the k5 looked 
promising at the 1994 microprocessor forum   amd presented simulation showing that 
the k5 ran 30 faster than the pentium   and 250 times faster than a 486 that's 
great now to get it into people's hands   from the very beginning amd's people knew that 
their biggest challenge was in production by the   mid-1990s leading edge semiconductor fabs has 
started to get extremely expensive amd wanted   to fab their new k5 chip using a 350 nanometer 
process in its new 1.3 billion dollar fab 25 in   southeast austin 1.3 billion dollars is a lot of 
money for a company that only made 2.46 billion   in sales in its 1995 fiscal year amd struggles to 
raise the funding necessary to build and operate   these fabs would be a constant thorn in its side 
unsurprisingly amd struggled to produce the new   chip the original release date was in mid-1995 
but fab 25 didn't finally ramp up until march   1996 a year late so the first k5 chips had to 
be made using an older 500 nanometer fab process   this made them run at slower clock speeds and 
at hotter temperatures than anticipated and   then the new billion dollar fab 25 sat idle as 
engineers worked on a plethora of uncaught bugs   computer makers like compact have put their 
faith on amd to deliver as a counterweight   to intel the k5's failure caused them to buy 
pentiums or cyrix's 6x86 amd's microprocessor   sales fell 60 percent in 1996. it had to lean 
on its other businesses its flash memory and   mock line of complex programmable logic devices 
which are kind of like fpgas to find growth jerry   sanders a crow at the 1996 annual shareholder 
meeting saying by now it is well known that   we underestimated the enormity of the challenges 
associated with bringing this new product to the   market with no apologies for setting ambitious 
goals and no excuses for our failure to attain   them i must concede that in hindsight our 
target turned out to be a bridge too far   the k5 didn't pan out as amd hoped it would 
the company had spent all of its efforts in   getting k-5 back on track so much so that they 
did not put much time into the next generation   k6 luckily there was a solution in october 1995 
amd paid 850 million dollars to acquire a small   fabulous company called nextgen next gen had 
debuted a very fine x86 microprocessor design   the nx686 at the microprocessor forum but did 
not have a fab they went to ibm samsung and   texas instruments for foundry services but 
no dice not sure why they didn't go to tsmc   they read about amd's struggles in the newspaper 
that the austin fabs were sitting idle and called   to propose a merger amd accepted and essentially 
adopted next-gen system architecture for their   own to make the new k-6 microprocessor the 
first version launched on schedule ahead   of intel's pentium 2 launch it was a home 
run the k6 microprocessor and its enhanced   sibling the k62 offered a compelling price 
performance ratio against intel's pentium 2.   they were an especially great fit for cheaper 
computers less open to intel's premium pricing   in august 1998 amd proudly announced that k62 
powered pcs captured 31 percent of the pc retail   market in the sub one thousand dollar pc market 
they had 54 market share their highest to date   intel correctly recognized the strategic 
problem in allowing amd to have free reign   of this fast growing segment so in april 1998 
they released a low end line of chips celeron   these 300 megahertz chips were based on the 
pentium 2 design but did not have an l2 cache   which meant that if the processor needed some data 
they had to go to the slower main memory rather   than the faster cache memory this significantly 
compromised performance and they did not sell well   so then in august 1998 intel introduced a faster 
set of celeron chips running at 366 and 433   megahertz which sold much better for the majority 
of the decade intel had little serious competition   performance wise in desktop microprocessors by 
the time someone had caught up to one of their   chips intel was already moving on to the next so 
everyone was at least one generation behind this   finally changed in august 1999 when amd released 
the 22 million transistor athon originally named   the k7 amd renamed it to the athlon to avoid 
it being linked to the cheap k6 focus groups   like the name athlon short for decathlon the 
most and apparently no deeper meaning than that   for the first time amd's chips can match intels in 
certain performance metrics the first athlon could   go up to 650 megahertz compared to the pentium 
3s 600. but the athon chips also cost almost as   much as intels about 600 dollars per chip a big 
change from previous years jerry sanders said at   the time this is it there is no tie it's win 
or lose in 1998 amd struck a partnership with   motorola semiconductors trading their own memory 
technology for the use of the newly introduced   copper interconnect technology i covered copper 
interconnect technology here in the previous video   the first k7 to 1999 used the older aluminum 
interconnects but in 2000 they started shipping   copper interconnect chips codename thunderbird 
fabbed out of their new 1.9 billion dollar fab   30 in dresden intel of course was not to be denied 
in 2000 they released their pentium 4 which took   the crown back from athlon so a year later in 2001 
amd then released her athon xp chip and so it goes   in 2000 sanders recruited hector ruiz as amd 
ceo ruiz was born in 1945 in a small town in   the northern part of mexico he went to school in 
the american town of eagle pass texas just across   the border after earning a phd at rice university 
he joined texas instruments and then motorola his   first job was to go around the world fixing yields 
at semiconductor fabs in scotland and arizona   over 22 years he climbed up to become president 
of motorola semiconductors overseeing a large   restructuring effort in building partnerships 
with other large players in the industry   motorola semiconductors was later spun off as 
freescale the private equity group blackstone then   bought them for a staggering 17.6 billion dollars 
and then merged them with nxp semiconductors   after 29 years jerry sanders was 
looking to retire and the board   urged him to pick a successor he 
liked ruiz because of his strong   operations experience as well as the 
fact that they both had poor backgrounds   so in 1999 he took ruiz out to a steakhouse dinner 
in austin ostensibly to discuss their company's   ongoing alliance and while casually cutting into a 
steak said what you need to do is you need to get   a real job come join me and i promise you that 
in a year or two you will be ceo of the company   going to amd might have seemed like a step 
down they only made about 2.5 billion dollars   in revenue in comparison to motorola's nearly 8 
billion but ruiz was attracted to the notion of   transforming the scrappy company after his 
introduction in january 2000 rui served as   amdc-00 for two more years before finally taking 
the top job is a critical very trying time for amd   intel's product strategy was the browbeat its 
competitors with leading edge products in the   industry the buyers have a lot of power especially 
large oem buyers like dell or hp who use cpus for   their pcs and server computers these make 
up the bulk of sales in the cpu industry   whenever they bring in a new more powerful cpu 
they also cut the prices of all the older chips   in the product line a single cpu in the 1990s 
might experience three price decreases per year   because they have the highest performing 
chip intel can reap the highest profits those   profits can be reinvested into their products and 
manufacturing allowing them to push the leading   edge yet further and forcing everyone to spend 
to keep up second place is not where you want   to be in such an industry and with the cost of 
fabs steadily intensifying the next dresden fab   after fab 30 would cost well over 2 billion 
dollars amd was again walking the tightrope   in april 2003 amd announced the opteron the 
opteron was amd's first high-powered processor   for servers and workstations it stood out for 
its ability to support both 32-bit and 64-bit   computing meaning that it can process data in 
larger 64-bit chunks rather than the standard 32.   intel on the other hand only had its 32-bit 
server chips the xeon there are 64-bit chips   called titanium had not yet quite met expectations 
intel had perhaps planned out a bit too far ahead   a few months later amd released the athon 64 a 
64-bit consumer level desktop cpu together the   operon and the athon 64 were strong offerings 
which should have done well in the market   particularly in the lucrative server market 
which would have very much liked the backwards   compatibility but around this time amd started 
to find it increasingly suspiciously difficult   to sell their products to the big oems because as 
it turns out intel was threatening those customers   against doing business with amd amd started to 
lose market share especially in japan a later   probe by the japanese fair trade commission found 
that intel's japanese subsidiary was providing   rebates and funds to guarantee market share with 
the five japanese pc oems here's how it worked an   oem like sony needs to buy 100 cpus in year one 
they buy 90 from intel and 10 from amd in year   two amd bids for 20 cpus they can't bid for all 
100 because they don't have the capacity for it   but this obviously is a loss for intel they just 
have ad cpus so they tell the oems okay you're   paying 90 dollars for your cpus in year two but 
if you buy more than 80 cpus this year then you   get a rebate and the rebate is structured 
in such a way that the oem is essentially   getting those 10 incremental cpus numbers 
8290 for free as a result intel's market   share in japan rose from 73.2 percent in 2002 
to 87 in 2004. amd's japanese market share in   turn suffered their share in sony computers 
fell from a high of 24 in 2002 to 8 in 2003   nec's agreement with intel dictated that amd's 
market share must be held to single digits   there were other shady practices too toshiba was 
reportedly receiving 25 to 30 million dollars a   quarter in market development money from intel not 
to use amd cpus their executives found that money   to be very addicting amd and others complained 
of this anti-competitive behavior intel replied   that it was competing fairly amd's products 
just sucked in 2004 japan's ftc rated intel's   offices and they later recommended against these 
practices though there was no teeth to the ruling   amd started to see other things back home there 
was unspoken intimidation conveyed directly to   oems right from the top ceo craig barrett 
warren acer ceo of severe consequences if   acer supported amd's athlon 64 launch ruiz 
recalls in his memoirs hewlett-packard ceo   carly fiorina telling him about a less than 
friendly visit from barrett warning her that   intel was capable of destroying hp to amd 
this was how their x86 market share declined   from a peak in 2001 of 20 to 15.8 percent in 2004 
despite their products as technological advances   for his part the now retired jerry sanders 
advised against any court action saying that   you had to fight them in the marketplace but 
ruiz pushed forward thus in june 2005 amd filed   another anti-trust suit against intel accusing 
them of coercing customers from dealing with amd   they combined this with a broad pr campaign 
which included a website amd.com break free   this was just one of a series of new 
legal actions against intel the next   month a european commission raided the offices at 
intel as part of their anti-trust investigation   but unfortunately for amd such lawsuits like 
the intimutes in the lord of the rings last a   very long time amd's suit would not be resolved 
into 2009 four years when intel and amd settled   their legal disputes for 1.25 billion dollars that 
was that with the amd stuff but intel still had   anti-trust woes in the u.s asia and europe most 
significantly the european commission eventually   found intel guilty of illegally excluding rivals 
like amd from the market intel was fined a billion   euros in 2009. intel then drag things out in court 
like the ending of return of the king the latest   development happened as i was scripting this in 
september 2023 when the eu watchdog reimposed a   fine of 400 million euro not kidding when i say a 
long time i would say in the end sanders was half   right half wrong intel was indeed not playing by 
the rules the court cases opened a window for amd   to make ground but with that window open in front 
of them they then shot themselves in the foot   in october 2006 amd acquired the graphics card 
maker ati technologies for 5.4 billion dollars   i discussed ati in a previous video amd had 
a variety of reasons behind their acquisition   intel was winning customers by selling complete 
chipsets to oems including the graphics chips   so amd felt that charging into graphics would 
help match up with intel they first went for the   leader amd brought up the idea of buying nvidia at 
around 2002 or 2003 but the price was too high and   also co-founder and ceo jensen huang wanted to run 
the combined companies ruiz had to step down and   he didn't see that as an option so reese and amd 
reached out to ati the number two player instead   they appreciated the canadian company's wide 
range of industries and its graphics expertise   with ati amd could produce cpu gpu hybrids 
to compete against intel's complete chipset   products these later hit the market as amd's 
fusion apus and as i mentioned my other video   ceo david orton and the rest of ati were 
concerned about rising competition and a   stagnating market graphics cards didn't have 
the growth they had back then so what was next   at the time nvidia was on its way towards 
generalizing the graphics card pipeline   and bringing about gpu programming a road that 
would eventually lead them to far bigger things   but nobody knew that at the time and lastly 
ati did not have a fab ruiz saw synergies   and possibly bringing their product line into 
the amd fabs which would add volume this would   come in handy for strategic initiative ruiz 
was cooking up we will come back to it later   anyway despite all of these reasons the ati 
purchase was immensely damaging the price that   amd paid was questionable thanks to a last-second 
surge in the ati stock price md had to borrow   some 2.5 billion dollars from banks to pay for 
it sending debt to new highs at the time ruiz   thought that amd could handle it and it probably 
could but two years later would come 2008 in the   global financial crisis pc sales cratered during 
this global recession and amd's heavy debt left a   teetering on the brink ati selling itself to amd 
caused damage to its own business right off the   bat 60 to 70 percent of ati's revenue came from 
an integrated graphics partnership with intel for   intel based motherboards obviously that was not 
sticking around and nvidia soon took that spot   many of the businesses that amd had wanted 
to enter through the acquisition did not pan   out resulting in big costly write downs 
dealing with the culture clashes of the   two organizations caused distracting headaches 
for years divisions like those for the mobile   phone graphics business had to be sold off 
sold to qualcomm for 45 million dollars   today amd's expansion into graphics and eventually 
gpus has put it in an interesting place in the   deep learning revolution they're arguably one 
of nvidia's closest competitors in this space   in addition their hold on the console gaming 
graphics market continues to pay off dividends   today custom amd soc chips help power high-profile 
systems like the playstation and the xbox despite   these benefits the ati acquisition distracted amd 
for a long period of time and took it to the brink   of bankruptcy its effects would be felt in amd's 
lackluster execution in several crucial products   the next generation of opteron chips 
a quad-core design codenamed barcelona   fabbed on a 65 nanometer process was scheduled to 
launch in the middle of 2007. but they discovered   that the chip had a problem translating between 
its caches and discovered it at the last second   ideally you would implement a fix in the silicon 
itself but since it was so late in the game they   implemented a software workaround so barcelona 
languished has amd frantically worked on this   bug it finally launched on september 2007 
ish with wide commercial availability pushed   back to the next year furthermore that software 
workaround compromised performance so barcelona   failed to hit the clock speeds amd promised 
back in march 2007. customers were promised   2.2 or even 2.8 gigahertz they got just two 
these issues also seem to have affected the   launch of amd's quad-core phenom consumer desktop 
cpus too a double whammy of misery in the market   intel for their part was already a full generation 
ahead in late 2007 they had a 45 nanometer node   going utilizing the interesting high k metal 
gate innovation but amd managed to strike   back the r d partnership with ibm allowed 
them to insert immersion lithography into   their process firstly they quickly released a 45 
nanometer operon code named shanghai in late 2008.   but amd knew that they needed some deep 
pockets to challenge intel and they went   abroad in search of one this had been pretty 
tough since few investors met the right criteria   but then they went to abu dhabi ruiz 
pitched the crown prince sheikh mohammed   bin zaid and nayan in a five-minute 
meeting that stretched into two hours   ruiz pitch nyan the idea of this global foundry 
centered on amd's factories in texas germany and   new york this foundry would have the new 
fabulous amd and ati 2 as its cornerstone   customers but it would also produce leading 
edge semiconductors for other fabulous companies   2008 was an incredibly difficult year for amd 
simply releasing good products consistently had   been difficult the company pulled seven straight 
quarterly losses including a staggering second   quarter 2008 loss of 1.19 billion dollars after 
this we stepped down as ceo but remained chairman   the semiconductor industry was going through 
another downturn and amd stock had went to just   around three dollars per share the debt from the 
ati deal was dragging them down they needed money   to invest into leading edge factories to stay 
competitive with intel but there wasn't enough   money to do that unless those factories are able 
to service more than just amd even with ati in   the fold so it was an incredible relief in october 
2008 when the deal was finalized amd got 1 billion   dollars in cash through new share purchases by 
abu dhabi while at the same time offloading some   1.2 billion dollars of debt cash flow went from 
negative 1 billion to some 600 million positive   the deal birth the company now known as global 
foundries currently the number three standalone   foundry company amd struggles to survive the 
2000s is an indication of just how difficult   and expensive it can be to catch up to number 
one in the ruthless semiconductor industry   the ever-present thread running through 
amd's story has been the suffering overhang   of constant capital expenditures the 
company was barely financially viable   in the mid-1980s and 1990s going into 
the 2010s it started to become untenable   the abu dhabi deal forever changed amd one 
of silicon valley's oldest and most iconic   semiconductor companies the one that popularized 
the phrase real men own fabs now drop their own   fabs what happens next a few years ago i did 
a video discussing how tsmc and amd came to   do business together you might consider it to be 
a soft sequel to what happened after this video   go watch it all right everyone that's it 
for tonight thanks for watching subscribe   to the channel send me an email i love reading 
your emails and i'll see you guys next time
