- hey, mrbeast here. today, we're gonna buy
every item in this store. let's do it. - i don't think you can do this all by yourself. - i don't think you should speak anymore. - i don't think i should either. - so you get the gist of the video. we're basically buying literally
everything in this store which if it was just
chris, me, and chandler would take forever, so
i brought some friends. - make sure you get everything. don't leave a single thing on the shelf. - look at all these people here. i just like, literally
went down my contact list, and i was like, "hey, you wanna help me
buy everything in a store?" and surprisingly, everyone
was just like, "sure." here's some mint thins here. let's help connor fill up this cart. - there we go. - here, you want some carrots? - oh, sure. - there you go. have fun. - oh, man. we got all kinds of juices over here. - oh, here. let me help you with. - thanks, jimmy. - all right. - all right, your cart is full. take this credit card. go pay for it. - these are my favorite. can i have them? - no - wow. - but i would like to
get some groceries too. is that okay? - yes. i got you a cart, whatever you put in it, we'll pay for. - okay. - have fun. here, grab some pickles. - okay.
- on us. - hey, this is my second
time in the line. yeah. shopmrbeast, thank you. - i ain't never gotten
nothin' free before. - what did you get, sir? - everything i could get my hands on. - here you go. go check out. here you go. all right,
here's your credit card. - awesome. - you might be wondering why
are we buying all this stuff. well, we're buying it because
we want to give it to charity. like a food bank, a homeless shelter, or if a random guy on
the street wants beans, we'll just give it to him. - did you know they made beans about you? thick and rich. - hey - dustin, what do you have right now? - big corn guy. - all this corn. do you have a lighter? - a lighter? - yeah. - why do you need a lighter for? - so, we can make popcorn. - aah. - aah. - i can't even see you anymore, dustin. - we have a customer
who has a cart up there. - oh, really? - but it's not full. - so, they need more stuff, and it needs to be paid for. - they're a real custumer? - a real customer. - yeah, you don't want anything else? - no. - we'll pay for it. we're gonna buy everything
in the store so... - anything you want, just grab it. - yeah. a cheese balls. yeah. - we need cheese puffs.
- cheese puffs. - let's go find it. we need
some cheese puffs right now. - you got the cheese puffs. he gave her cheese puffs. okay. we're good. we're good. - she's taken care of. there's one thing chris is good for. it's cheese puffs and lard. - i got a tub of lard. - i'm upset.
- why? - i was hiding those cheetos for later. - oh. - my balls dropped. - this isn't even our store. we have like a full scale operation. all these people i'm paying to do this. - what is he doing? where did you get that? - i don't know i got a lot of potatoes
and one can of beans. - one can of beans? - how much have we spent so far? - $850.02 - okay. - mostly of mashed potatoes. - mostly mashed potatoes. we're only up to $800 guys. what are you doing? let's do toilet paper. - all of it? - yes. well, that was not efficient, but one thing a toilet paper
filled up the entire cart. all right. you want some cosmic brownies? - yeah, i'm doing my part. don't throw 'em again. every time. - your cart's empty. - no, it's not. i got cosmic brownies. - can i just like, i mean, since we're like buying everything. - yeah, go ahead. - nah, i'm trying to be
healthy eating brownies. - so, we're having a
little bit of a dilemma. we filled up every cart. now, what? - what is happening behind you? - what is going on? - stop. - excuse us. - beep, beep. - don't mind us. - yeah, we don't wanna interrupt this. - enjoy your cereals. - here you go. just in case you want some. - thank you. what was that?
- i don't know. - how are you? are you guys really eating cereal after the last video we did? - uh, yep. - can i get all these in one bag? yeah. so, here. - in the past we did a video where we gave $1000,000 worth
of stuff to homeless shelter and it was really unorganized,
and hard to unpack, and hard to like put away for them. so, now we're putting everything in boxes. like, this is a candy box. so, it's easier for the food bank that we take all this supplies to like, sort it and store. can you guys subscribe? this is probably gonna
cost me a lot of money. i mean, look at how much
stuff they're grabbing. - look at all this tea! - what are you, james charles? - hi, sisters. - like we've just literally been putting stuff in carts, and i have no idea what i've spent. but i do know that we got some lard, and i'm very happy about it. - they're delivering more
food as we're buying it. - wait, really? - the food truck's backing in. - we don't need it. - we don't need it. go away. we're spending too much money. i need you guys to go to
shopmrbeast.com and buy some merch because i was not expecting
another delivery. so, yeah. - all right. that wasn't my fault. - i'm buried by snacks. it's my dream. - chandler, you having fun? good, that's all i got it. - garret, i'm proud of you. spending my money, this
is what i want. thank you. - you're welcome. - this is what i want. empty shelf. when we say we're buying everything, we need everything, except
for maybe some bananas. - imagine having such a useless skill. - we are up to 14,279.03 all right. that one's doing good. and on this register,
we're up to 6,261.70. so, far we've spent about $23,000. - aren't we supposed to spend like $100? - yeah. - so, we're like 23% done? - basically. - all right, i'll see you later. - chandler hates pickles. so, the only logical thing to do is to fill this cart with pickles and give it to him. where's chanchan? - chandler. - where's chanchan? - he's actually pooping. - leave it to chandler to be pooping in the middle of the video. - chandler, we got a surprise for you. - coming back. - your nuts dropped. - like, a year ago. - oh, okay.
- duh. - we're almost done with this aisle. - we still have like five more. it's all right. - it's fine.
- that's 20%. - oh, that's a lot.
that's a lot. good job. - i need cuidado. i'll be right back. safety first. - i feel like you guys shouldn't be boxing in the employees. i feel like- - yes. - nice. - got tomato sauce, we got tomato paste, we got dice tomatoes. - i called them tomatoes. - oh, you call 'em tomatoes. well, i guess we can't hang out with them. - and, it's good. - oh my god. look at all these carts. it's like an apocalypse up. - what? we bought more
than i thought we bought. i mean, this is like a full
skilled military operation we got going on here. - oh, yeah. - good thing we have more. so far, we spent 25,000 and on that one over
there, we spent 8,000. - where were you guys when the siege of save-a-lot, went down? why did you not come to the rescue? - i think they need some zest. - some zest. - and everyone needs zest. - oh, yeah. - why me? - so, yeah. we literally cleared this entire row. chandler, we're trying
to clear all the aisles. stop sleeping on 'em. - i'm tired. - i can't say i bought
everything in the store if there's a chandler for sale - come on, chandler, we
got to get this bread. - there we go. now, we cleared all this row. - come on, wipe my back. - i got you. - invest in beast so we can give stuff to
homeless people more. - shopmrbeast.com. - right here. - so, things weren't moving fast enough. so, we actually ended up just hiring random people off the street. so, at this point, i don't even know how many people i'm paying
for an hour, probably like 25. i don't know, but we have
a lot of people working. - hey, what you got there? you got twinkies? all right, look. i'll give you guys one if
you don't tell anybody. - are you okay? - was that necessary? - oh, we're over 10 grand? - yeah. - perfect. - how do i say you're welcome? de nada. - okay. - arigato - it's japanese. - thank you, thank you. - thank you, mrbeast. - thank you, mrbeast. - yeah, i appreciate that right here, man. we gonna shout out mrbeast for looking out for the community. - it's your lucky day. this is all free.

thank you so much. - business is booming. - business is booming - show them your dance. - hey. - oh, wow. look at that. - subscribe to mrbeast. - look how much stuff we buy. how much money have we spent? - i don't know. - i should probably know. shopmrbeast.com, become an
investor by buying merch. i can do stuff like this
and pay my cameraman. - he just wants one thing, he wants to ask you- - oh, no. don't buy one thing,
buy like a hundred thing. whatever you buy will pay for. - okay. thank you guys, man. - no problem. you got it, boy? - this is for all the honey buns. - hey, dustin. - hey. - we need you to get more chips, man. - i got it. - you got it. hey, taylor, i'm gonna
need you get more ketchup. - i think they're out of ketchup to rake. - hey look, that's you, extra virgin. - dude, that looks beautiful. it's gonna take forever. - it's gonna take a while. - ooh. - see what happens when you help? you drop everything. - well, the box was broken. - uh-huh. - all right, let's go for a little stroll. as you can see, empty. aisle number three, as you can see... what is it, chris? - empty. - this is aisle number
four. it's almost empty. - put on the back- - and aisle number five, almost empty. got a little bit of soda left.
we're still working on it. - this is really tight.
that's like a bomb. you wanna open it? - why'd you point at me? why'd you point at me, jimmy? - taylor, i will give
you $100 if you open it. - $100. - all right. - the camera. - all right, he gets $200." - attention, clean up on aisle five. chandler spilled some soda
'cause he's dumb. thank you. - you're doing a great job. - can i get a dust pan? - that's not how you
clean it up, chandler. - what? - that's a liquid. - this is a broom, not a liquid. - stupid. - how long you guys been doing it? - for four hours. - four hours. i can do it in five minutes. pop, boom, boom, boom. you guys a loser. - that's my new dad. - okay. - i'm scared to see how much we spent. it's been like two hours since
i check the cash register. - these are the last non-perishable items, because the food shelter didn't want perishable
thing in the entire store. - how you doing? - fine.
- yeah. - how's everybody? - great. oh, you look good. - thanks. - well, we just gutted this whole store. - this aisle is empty. chris, what is this aisle? - it is empty. - wow. this was full of stuff. oh my goodness. and
this aisle is empty too. - and so is your bank account. - sadly, yes. all right, let's go give it
all to a homeless shelter. - let's do it. - so, it took quite a while, but we ended up paying the full bill. it was like $70,000.
we got it all covered. plus, whatever we spent
on the other people. so, we end up spending quite a bit. she's about to print the receipt. this is gonna be interesting. thank you so much. - hurry up, hurry up. what are you doing? - how long it is? the receipt. - $70,000 worth of groceries. - go make me a tie. we buy $70,000 - $70,000? this is the most expensive tie i've ever seen in my life. - that is insane. you like it? - you guys should try this. just go spend 70 grand and
you can have a receipt tie. look how big that is. that's probably like a 20-foot receipt. $70,000. - all right. so, we're at a food bank, and we're gonna give them food. - so, they can bank it. - all right. - wow. this is stacking up, jimmy. - it is. like college debt in america. - hey, got 'em. - military operation delta c-9. it's going according to plan. - very nice. - oh, look at these. - oh, whoa, whoa. these are mine. - oh, vikings like. okay. all right. - all right, this one already open. you already know what that means. - come here, what are you doing? - we got a feed everybody - yeah. i think there's
somebody over there that needs... i'll be right back. - did he just take the honey buns? - i think he just took a bunch of honey buns and like- - chandler, those are for homeless people. give them back. - oh, god. - i'm confiscating these. - can i have one?
- no. - honey bun man. this just fell outta his pocket - can you just like, not? - not what? - steal from homeless people. - all right. i wonder how full this... oh, who would've thought? more food and more boxes. wow. - i give up. - juggling right now. - jake on juggling competitions. - hold on.
- right now. - oh, no. little jake is so good. best team out of three. - all right. so, this is all the stuff
we had in the u-hauls. i guess people are probably curious, what is it gonna go towards? - well, we serve anywhere from
1000 to 1500 people a week. it couldn't have come at a better time 'cause y'all see that some of the shelves were completely bare this morning - i'm surprised that we could fit all that stuff we did in there.
- we're probably- so, it's going to people that need it. - we really need it. - yeah. i got it. i appreciate it. - all right. - thanks for allowing us to help people. - yeah. - all right guys, this video
was actually really expensive. i need you to go invest in merch, because if you don't buy merch, i just can't afford to do
stuff like this in the future. see this frosted beast hoodie
in this off beast hoodie they are sexy. this company that i didn't
make up named my merch the sexiest youtube merch
three years in a row. coincidence? i think not. head to shopmrbeast.com, buy a bunch of stuff, so i can afford to keep doing things
like this in the future. love you, guys. and there you have it folks. every single thing we bought will go to help low income families or just people who need it in general. so, i'm really happy about that. oh yeah, and we also bought a lot of people's groceries at the store. i did forget about that. anyways, i hope you guys enjoy it. i like making videos like this, and i hope you have a good day. - we're at the animal shelter where we're donating the last of the stuff that we got from us save-a-lot. this is all the dog
food, and the cat food, and stuff that we got that we
can't give to homeless people. - now, where does all the food go to? - we process about 3000 animals a year through the shelter, dogs and cats. so, it supports all the dogs
that come into our care. - that's awesome. well,
i'm glad we can help you. - thank you so much for sharing. - no problem. - thank you, mrbeast. [music] mrbeast, oh [music] [music] mrbeast, oh [music] [music] mrbeast oh [music]
