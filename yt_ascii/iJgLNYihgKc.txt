meaning you live your lives inside the apple ecosystem but i want to switch my entire life over to samsung's want to ask them to sponsor this video they said no instead i spent $7,000 of my own money buying literally every single samsung product that i can find boy hello there welcome to the joys of the samsung lifestyle with my galaxy bud and i watch my laptop oh what a wondrous world it is we have the vacuum which you think is going to be a lot of fun we also have some of the stupider things like the microwave which where's the microwave where do you hide a microwave well we have all the other stuff well you wanted it to work at big speed so find it with bixby so the smart things tracker is unique because unlike a tile which uses bluetooth this is not only wi-fi and gps as well but it also has an lte connection it has a year of service included which means that it should theoretically be able to track something anywhere in the world you've gotta be kidding it's on bixby drive you hit our microwave on bixby drive what's wrong with you you got any kidding me kept like this is it this is my tracker well i guess we learned one thing today nataly's this microwave big and heavy but the smart things tracker works even when you take it to bixby drive you better help me move this thing i'm not carrying this all the way back this is dumb it's really dumb so if you're not familiar sensing smart things is their smart home ecosystem with things like smart bulbs and smart plugs and door sensors and the hub which i guess we need for some of this stuff so now i'm just going to remove what is probably a pretty hot bulb and that's okay whoa whoa okay well that works so we have the light turn on permits okay that's simple enough ken has had the wonderful idea to create the world's first smart fan and by world's first i mean that world's first at all so i am starting to run out of outlets here a little bit i'm just gonna unplug everything that i don't need after turning it on and off three times it worked so now we have the fan plug so if i press this button magic it sounds so smart so it actually does tell you the energy consumption of the device you have plugged in which is legitimately nice to see so you can see if your fan is eating up lots of power yes so obviously it's a mess in here but with our brand new samsung smart life tm trademark copyright 2020 we have the ability to clean it theoretically while this charges what's set up our speaker i will direct you to the big bass button so if you're all about that bass it's that a reference does anyone get that is that song too old didn't point out this thing actually is not only where the screen is but you can also use it as a phone mountain oh word that's pretty smart it also it's wide enough for a samsung galaxy tab haha why are you doing this is so samsung i love it alright next step let's get all this working with big speed gauge meet your voice so i wake up when you say hi big ste hi bixby hi bixby hi bixby hi bixby vacuum the floors you have devices in two locations living room no room aside which one would you like got it turning on the living room devices oh wait no not everything wait wait no no hi bixby turn off the fan plug you know what big space definitely seems to be a little bit behind i think the idea that you have to say the wake word wait and then do something is a little bit annoying but no but why don't we see how it works on a tv the very first thing you see i already went through it but it's like hey do you agree to like all the advertisers in terms of stuff never do that ever they just advertise it to you based on what you watch on tv don't hit agree to all play linus tech tips on youtube just the tips line of tech tips oh look at that a wonderful video all about the galaxy z flip available at youtube.com slash this is you know also talked about the galaxy flip on my brand new podcast the test driver is available at relay dot f m slash test drivers you know i've done many many episodes with my wonderful co-host mike all about the wonders of the galaxy z flip which for real is the entire reason why i'm doing this video i love the z flip in a way i haven't loved a piece of technology in a long time so if that's interesting to you if you want to hear me try the weirdest the ladies and graces of technology definitely be sure to go check out the test drivers available at the link below it pretty much any podcast viewing place of your choice to me bixby is a little bit of a tough sell now if you were a lunatic like me and you've completely committed yourself to the samsung ecosystem it's fine the problem is it's no more than that it's fine i think most people would be much better served with something like the google assistant or even something like siri which will work and pretty much all of these scenarios right almost all of these devices will tie into it the very least the google ecosystem most importantly better yeah it is a better experience so alright bixby maybe not a huge win we have many many more samsung products this bed tied with this big is gonna take like all week our journey into the samsung lifestyle continues with some of the computing devices that i'd be you recently and let's start out with the galaxy tab at six this is a very good piece of hardware it's got an excellent animal a display super sharp it's got a very very thin build quad speakers good performance from a snapdragon'55 there's a lot to like here but this cover is done right the fact that i've had to glue this on and i have to hide the s-pen on the back which it is nice and this is included it's not nice that i have to do that to put it on the back i'm not even kidding that was me trying to do it as fast as i could the thing that really lets the tab down is the fact that it's running android android is great on many devices like the z flip board it is not great on is a 10-inch tablet now to be fair a lot of apps do support full screen as well as windowed mode - yeah ok ok hold on i'll talk about that in a second a lot of apps do support windowed mode which is nice right and that's a largely i think thanks to the fact that chrome os is support android app so a lot of apps certain kind easily be resized however is you astutely noticed this also takes advantage of dax just let me use it so the thing with dex is while when it works on a phone is very cool the idea i can take my z flip if it supported dex if i had my galaxy s 20 ultra i could plug it in with a single cable to a monitor have all of my stuff immediately there and available is really nice but the issue is is that that same experience while it works on the tab it's slow right i'm willing to give up some performance on the s20 because it's my phone running a full desktop style operating system that's fine when this is sort of your primary use of this tablet when you're putting it into dex mode and really trying to get the most out of your google docs experience and your web browser and everything the fact of the matter is it's slow not all apps work it just is not as smooth an experience as i'd like so samsung's laptop lineup is confusing to say the least is if you go to samsung comm and go to the laptop section we're gonna see the samsung galaxy book flex alpha chromebook it's all very confusing however the galaxy book flex is as far as i'm aware highest end model they sell now there is a lot to like first of all the blue color looks phenomenal right it's super thin this laptop has an excellent display so you see the display right here it's qulet now it looks probably fine as is that if i press the outdoor plus button it gets ice searingly bright like i've never seen a laptop get this bright in my life that's a very cool feature it also comes with the s pen not something that i'm gonna find myself using all the time but unlike the stupid tab where i have to like magnetized it to the back this is a sort of more traditional s pen that you'd find in the phone and it has its nice little silo where it will recharge it works really well has a fingerprint on the keyboard not a huge fan of positioning because it basically means that you have a smaller shift key but it's kind of understandable under charging my z flip on the trackpad this is a wireless charger built into the trackpad i mean yes it also means that i can't use the trackpad while i'm charging but that's awesome right i mean sure the z flip might be a little bit of a weird choice but if i'm in a pinch i need a little bit of power or more specifically if i'm taking advantage of something like a pair of bluetooth earbuds like the galaxy boats plus that have a qi charger built in that's an awesome feature find the right angle find the right angle there you go where i was charging okay this seems like at estimate this is like a temple for samsung and weird dumb samsung things but this is so cool right there's a couple of nitpicks i have so i will say that it is a very thin bezel except on the bottom where it has this huge bezel especially after using devices like the xps 13 which with a 1610 display i like a little bit of a larger panel there but honestly there's so much to like with this laptop if only it wasn't almost $1,400 with eight gigs of ram like it's 2012 again or something so we've been using samsung tss ds for a very long time in fact the video you're watching right now was edited off of a t5 now the thing with the t7 is it brings faster speeds a slightly new redesign but also it has a fingerprint sensor now this is not something that i think is that useful personally because i don't really care if someone steals my drive but if you put your finger on it once you've provided the app on windows mac or android you can unlock it do whatever you want and as soon as you won't plug it it will be password / fingerprint secured you may have noticed i am wearing the incredibly stylish samsung galaxy watch active - it's actually very interesting so look if i'm being real as someone who's been using an apple watch for like five years now this feels like it's 90% as good as the apple watch i mean they just pre much straight-up have like the circles stolen so instead you have your little heart which on as you can see i just put the watch on so i have no heart filled the thing is it's nice there's certainly features that i like about it so the fact that it has the round display so i can just sort of scroll through things just by going around the bezel generally speaking the design is nice but there are a couple of things that sort of bother me first and foremost the way the notifications work you'll see that essentially i can get one notification per when i have lots of notifications like i unfortunately don't right now you have to swipe through them it just feels kind of slow and outdated but ultimately this actually is the best non apple watch smartwatch i've ever tried but honestly the apple watch still feels like it's got a lot of polish especially a lot of the design stuff like i don't like a lot of the samsung like artwork and the stupid little people's faces the pop-up it's just it's fine i don't like my friends - it's okay what friends here's something that actually is legitimately very good are the galaxy buds plus so i've actually already been a galaxy buds user for quite a while so i have an original pair of the black buds the buds plus are very similar so they have a slightly better sound profile so unfortunately unlike something like the air pods pro for example they don't have any active noise cancellation but when i put them both in the passive noise cancellation isn't bad and what i really like about these is if you look really closely you'll see it has this sort of like wingtip design so that for me fits really nicely in my ears and the thing is when you put these in obviously these are kind of a very bright blue but they do a good job of not only staying put for me and obviously you have different ear tips but ultimately i think they look nice right especially with the black ones for ear pods i'm always very self-conscious when i'm wearing them there's sort of this big like it's a statement you're wearing err pause everyone goes yeah era pots these however these look a lot more low-key and i like that it also helps that they work really well between pairing different devices it's quick to jump between my laptop and my phone and my tablet and i'd like to think that they actually sound pretty decent so what have we learned today well some of these samsung devices like the galaxy z flip that we're using to record right now are really quite solid but i think but a big sort of takeaway is unlike something like the apple ecosystem which really does encourage you and sort of lock you in pretty much all of these samsung devices that we've used work well with the samsung device but they also work well if you're using an iphone or some other android device i don't think there's that same level of lock in and then sort of by that same token there's not as much advantage in sort of going all in on samsung stuff as far as i'm concerned i'm glad i tried this i'm glad i tried some of these products we're going all in just doesn't make sense as does this video
