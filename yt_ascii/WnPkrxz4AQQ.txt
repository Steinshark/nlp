hi everyone today we're going to be modeling this character based on the front inside reference images which you can download from a link in the description so once you've done that let's open up blender and press n to bring up this properties menu and near the bottom here we have the background images tab which we can just toggle open and let's say add image and open up our image let's just navigate over to where these are saved so i'll load in the front image first now in order for a background image to be visible in the scene there are two criteria which need to be met first of all we need to be an orthographic not perspective mode so let's just press 5 on the numpad to toggle latch and then we also need to be viewing the scene from a specific angle as opposed to just some random rotation so let's press 1 on the numpad to jump into front view and we can now see our reference image let's add in a second image just go down and open that let's head over to the side image and bring that in so currently that is just overlaid on top of the front image so let's go and set up the view axes for both of these images so for the front image let's go set that to front and for the side image i'll set the view axis to right so now we can switch between our views by pressing 3 to go into side view and 1 to go into front view alright with that done let's close this properties menu such as press n again and don't really need this menu on the left here either and press t to close that now i don't really want to be able to see the light or the camera for the moment so in the scene view here we can just toggle the visibility on both of those now going into edit mode on this object by pressing tab it should be very nice if what we did to one side of the cube was mirrored over on to the other side since our character is symmetrical so we're going to want to cut this cube in half delete the one half of it and then add a mirror modifier so let's press ctrl r for the loop - and hovering over the mesh we can just left click to insert that you can see we can move it around by just dragging the mouse but we want that to be set right in the center so we can just a right-click to cancel the movement now to select one half let's press b for the box elect to look and just left-click drag to select all of the vertices under that selection box now we have to be careful when we're in solid shading mode because it hasn't actually selected the vertices which are not visible so we can fix that by going into wireframe mode or the shortcut for that is just to press z now when we box select you can see it will select all of the vertices not just the ones that are visible so we'll want to delete all of these faces we have selected here so let's press x and delete faces now to add in the mirror modifier we have to be in object mode so just press tab to go to object mode and then let's head over to the modifiers panel and add modifier nura modifier that's mirroring across the x-axis which is exactly what we want and we can see if we go into edit mode now that what we do on one side gets married over on to the other side now one slightly annoying thing is that these central vertices can be torn apart and the reason that's irritating is just that it means we have to be careful when we're moving or scaling the cube because they will not stick together and so we can end up with a whole away overlap in our mesh so to avoid this let's just enable the clipping option on the mirror modifier here and now you can see that when these vertices get brought together they're now stuck together and they can't be torn apart very nice so let's begin actually shaping this what i'll call the hip area it'll press a to deselect everything and then b to rock select these top vertices here just drag this down and then drag this vertex in and we'll want to see this from side view and just thin this a little bit then we're going to want to add in some more loop cuts to make this a bit smoother so let's add in a loop cut right around the front here and then to just smooth this out we'll want to select this entire face let's just go into face mode quickly select this face and then we want to scale this in on the y-axis so s y and just scale it in like so i'll press z to go back into solid shading mode and we can see what we've done there so back in front view and we anxious to go back to vertex mode and add in two new loop cuts so with the loop cut tool we can just scroll up on the scroll wheel to add in multiple loops at a time or maybe add in three actually and then we can just start shaping these just like so that looks good from side view as well i want to bring these in all right just something like that should be okay for now so what we can do to create this chest area is just select all of this and then press shift d and just drag it up alright so we've essentially duplicated it there and then let's scale it on the z axis to fit the shape better and then we can just go through and drag these individual vertices to get the shape how we want it always remembering to check it from side view as well of course go to solid shading mode and just look around that's looking fine i'm going to save doing the head for a little bit later let's just add in a new cube for the arm here so a mesh will always be added at the 3d cursor so let's just left-click to position that over here and then shift a add in a cube and we can scale that down to the right size then maybe scale it along the x-axis to fit like so and from side view to make sure that's positioned correctly and then let's round this out by adding and say to horizontal loop cuts like so well maybe want to move those apart by scaling them on the z axis and then let's go to face mode once again and just select this top and the bottom face and then scale those in on the y-axis to just round this form out a little bit from front view then let's go back to vertex mode and just add in a few loop cuts so we can get the shape a little bit more precise just match this up to the reference image just like that looks okay so once again we'll select this whole thing shift d to duplicate it over for the lower on and then match these up all right and then i'm going to left click once again to position the 3d cursor and just add in a new cube for the hand scale this down and stretch it out a bit on the x-axis and then from side view let's just line that up and maybe widen it a bit by scaling on the y-axis and we can add in a loop cut over here to select the stop face by selecting the four vertices and let's bring that in on the y-axis just to round it out a bit and then from the front view maybe add in two loop cuts just we've got some vertices to play with so that we can match this up to the reference all right that looks good so now to create the leg i'm just going to select the upper arm here shift d to duplicate that and then rotate that 90 degrees scale it out a bit especially on the z axis all right that's lined up pretty well you can just adjust these last few vertices and then from side view as well just move this over it's not too far off all right that looks good we can just select that whole thing duplicate it down for the lower leg it's a little bit too fat so we can press alt s for the shrink fashion tool and just shrink it a tiny bit then maybe scale it up on the z axis just like so that matches very well actually from side view just adjust a few of these i'm going to select this whole thing here it's a little bit messy and just press s z 0 which will just flatten out completely along the z-axis alright that looks pretty pretty good so let's create the foot quickly i'm going to left-click over there add in the 3d cursor and shift a add in a cube now you can see that the vertices on the left side of the cube here have overlapped our axis of symmetry so because of the clipping option when we scale these down they're going to get stuck together so we want to quickly disable clipping when we scale it down and then we can re-enable it immediately afterwards and let's just scale this to the right size both on the x-axis and from side view on the y-axis i want to add in a little loop over here so that we can start getting this curve and then let's just extrude this out so selecting this front face here you can press e to extrude it out and then just bring this down and then from top view which is 7 on the numpad let's start scaling this in so that's on the x-axis just let the toes get a little bit narrower alright like that and then from front view let's add in two loops over here so we can bring these in to form a a bit of a curve like so now you can see these two are jutting out weirdly so let's select the two of them press s x and just scale them together on the x and then to just sort of have this some curve outwards we want to select this central face here and just move that forwards on the y-axis all right got a nice little simple boot shape so let me just make sure that this matches up with the reference image a little bit better all right that looks decent so let's go ahead now and start adding in these joints so can start with the elbow joint over here i'm going to make these out of subdivided cubes so shift a add in a cube we can then press w to bring up these specials menu and we can just say subdivide smooth which we'll start smoothing this towards a sphere can then just scale this all the way down let's see if this aligns from the side all right and then we can just duplicate this over for the wrist joint screw need to be a little bit smaller we might want to stretch it out of it on the x-axis so that it bridges the gap properly you can maybe make the hand a little bit closer to the rest of the arm so to easily select this entire hand shape you can just hover over one of the vertices and press l to select it let's just move it in a tiny bit something like that looks fine let's then grab this one shift d to duplicate that over it's going to need to be bunch bigger and maybe stretch this out on the x-axis a little bit as well all right that looks nice we can now duplicate this down for the leg just like so from side view make sure that that is a line and then duplicate down for the knee joint very good and once more for the ankle joint okay i just want to actually adjust the foot here from the side it's a little bit low down that looks better i might just make this face here a little bit wider so just scale it out on the x-axis and just want to adjust over here as well then okay just so that the joint fits in and attaches a little bit better now we want to make the joint i'm not really sure what to name this joint but we want to make this one as well as the neck joint so let us select this duplicate it and we're going to need to delete half of it so wireframe mode let's select one half delete those vertices and then just bring this together to the center those vertices have now locked and we can scale it up just something like that and from side view alright that looks good let's duplicate it up for the neck scale that in just like that should be okay all right so it's about time that we made the head so we're going to be using a circle as the base shape for the head and when i add that in i want to make sure that it is perfectly centered so let's just press shift c to reset the position of the 3d cursor to the center and i also want to be able to pretend that the mirror modifier doesn't exist for the moment so let's just toggle its visibility off and we can now press shift a add in a circle and let's immediately then press f6 to bring up the circle properties i just want to reduce the vertices down to say ten all right so we have this little circle here with ten vertices let's press f to fill in the face and we can now bring this up on the z-axis to the base of the head scale it down to roughly the right size all right and then let's just extrude that up and scale it out to the right size as we go so that starts coming in now maybe just one more after this all right that looks good so then before we re enable the mirror modifier let's quickly select one half of this and just delete those vertices and we can now re-enable the mirror modifier and that looks good so let us have a look around our model we can of course go through and smooth things out and make the shape more accurate but for the purposes of this tutorial i think i'm going to leave it here before i end them i'm just going to press n and disable the background images and i'd like to get this to a reasonable scale so i usually consider the default blender cube to be about two meters tall so if we add that in to the scene just an object mode here and then select our character let's scale it down so that it looks like it's roughly 1.7 meters which is about the average height let's then delete the cube and i'd like for the character to be standing on this red ground plane here so let's just move it up on the z-axis so at the feet on the ground plane and then we also want the origin which is this little orange dot here to be positioned at the feet so we can just press ctrl-a to apply the object's location which will reset the the origin point and then you can see if we go into the object dot over here the scale is about 0.174 i want to apply the scale as well so control a apply scale and that will set this to be it's a new default scale i just realized now that when we deleted one half of the head the bottom and top faces also got deleted so there are now some holes in the head so to fix that let's just all try to click on one of these edges to select all of these vertices press f to the lemon and do the same for the bottom all right now that the character is patched up i think we can call it quits so i'll see you in the next episode which will be on rigging until then cheers
