- we have 10 grand and
some really hot peppers. let's see who wants the 10 grand. - there they are, right there. there's the lucky people. - so these are the first
random people we bumped into. so we have 10 grand and
a really hot pepper, if anyone wants to eat it. - wait, do you have to eat the whole thing or just take a bite? - i mean, like at least half of it. it's a ghost pepper though. - wait, that's for real. if we both eat half, can we split it? - sure. - do you want to?
- it's up to you. - all right. - dude, it's like incredibly hot. half and half. there you go, five grand each, you wanna do it?

it's gonna hit me in the face. - wow, she ate that quick. so yeah, those weren't real. but here's five grand
and here's five grand. normal youtubers would make
them eat ghost peppers, but we don't like torturing people. i mean, i do like torturing people, but not that much torturing people. all right, let's go harass other people. so we don't have any more money, so now we're just gonna
use a check for $10,000. whoever wins will write their name in, and i see people over
there, let's go do it. i have a check for 10
grand and a ghost pepper, if you eat it. - is it really that bad? - yeah, it's literally the
hottest pepper in the world. - on a scale of one to the
hottest, it's the hottest. - [participant in black shirt]
