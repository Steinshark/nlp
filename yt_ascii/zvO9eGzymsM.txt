ladies and gentlemen it's currently may 7 2023 and about a week ago the chess world crowned a new world champion by the name of dingley wren now normally that's the end of the story you win a one-on-one match you do some press and then you move on with your chess career onto other tournaments that you could potentially win but that's not quite the case with ding loren you see what many of you may not know is that the journey that dingly ran took to the throne was maybe the greatest comeback story in any sport there are three distinct parts to the jingler end story and in today's video i will be taking you through this arc it was something straight out of a movie and i made some videos about his journey as the journey was ongoing little did i know that ding would ultimately triumph as the world champion of chess all right this video will have three parts it'll be something like 20 25 minutes long let me take you through what arguably is the greatest comeback story in sports we begin in 2020 the pandemic danger lives in china there are severe difficulties traveling in and out every country has a different set of protocol in terms of quarantine and even though ding is a top five even top two player in the world he's unable to play many tournaments at all in fact he almost plays no chess 2020 2021 yes he plays online everybody plays online right but he doesn't play any live events this is important because on march 21st 2022 this happens and this was the beginning of the dingley run story fide ethics committee issues a six-month ban on sergey kariakin mostly for pro-war tweets now i'm not going to get into what you think of the decision i'm not going to get into all that but sergey kariakin around this time was very active on social media in support of russian operations that were going on in ukraine and he suffered a six-month ban for this which removed him for competition in the candidates tournament what is the candidates tournament in chess the candidates is an eight-player double-round robin everybody plays each other twice 14 rounds and the person that emerges out of that tournament will play for the world championship so karyakan loses his spot so who is it going to go to well it's obviously going to go to the second highest rated player in the world who is eligible dingly ren was not eligible this is part one of the dingly run saga he was ineligible to play because he had not played enough games so what did he do dingley ren played about 30 rated games in about 20 days in china which is allowed that's not that's that's allowed but he has to get the organization he has to get other players to play against and that's where this absolutely unreal story begins he has to play 30 games of chess in 20 days he hasn't played in a while he's got to play other players and one of his early games i mean it was topsy-turvy he played a young player also from china named lee d and i covered a lot of these games ding was playing different englishes and openings and one of his early games against lee d was a very very tense affair where lee d actually had probably a better position early on and was doing a great job dingley wren had to take massive risk in this game opening up his king bc ding takes the knight lee d plays d5 hammering away at the center of the position you know how much you got a wager in 30 games against people 200 points lower than you this is hardly easy ding plays knight g3 takes takes and i mean look at the complexity of this position dingley ren is losing he is losing in his qualifier games all right lee d has found himself in a dominant position against the man who back then hadn't had no spot in the candidates he needed to win enough games and even just play enough games to be eligible all right and ding was suffering lee d build up a monstrous position against him and and and this wasn't i mean this wasn't the only game where where ding had various difficulties right look at this bishop takes b1 he's lost the rook in the corner of the board but he's fighting back bishop to b3 hitting the pawn on f7 captures a rook sacrifice from lee d and when everything was said and done we got a rooks and knights end game and lee d was in a great shape past pawn he's gonna win this he's got the pawns coming down the board obviously both sides in a bit of a time trouble but then ding started coming back brought his knights forward pawn takes and lee d trying to promote both sets of pawns and in an absolute like catastrophic race to the conclusion knight c8 was the dagger knight c8 is a move that facilitates the passing of the bee pawn but also knight e7 check and rook f8 made on the back rank and if not for that idea i mean black is getting in here with the rooks and the pawn so yeah lee d must have must have been very very concerned with back rank mating ideas he did have to be brave and run but he ends up succumbing to the pressure of ding and well ding played his 30 games ding managed to play his 30 games he was in trouble in some of those games but didn't qualified to the candidates tournament now let's keep something in mind the candidates tournament was in spain it was in madrid so ding had to travel from china to spain he was only able to do that that there were select flights back in the day in and out of places like china i mean you couldn't just get on a flight like they had to charter a plane maybe there was just one trip every week so ding made it to madrid that time difference is massive it's like a six hour you know six seven hour time difference not as big as new york and and and china but it's a time difference and he sits down to play game one of the candidates and keep in mind he's got to win the candidates to make it to the world championship right he's got to win the candidates to make it to the world championship to play magnus carlson quit the time as the world champion so first game of the candidates dingley run sits down he's playing okay i know it's a deja vu all right ding plays a very sharp english jan has black janus coming off of a world championship already right queen e5 and ding plays this kind of unique weird idea to push on the queen side and then plays h4 and from the early opening it was yan who established a very strong center and jan brought his knight back ding played knight c4 and jan very made it very clear that he has very bad intentions for ding's king and ding did not react accurately he played a bit too slowly he let jan get a very strong bind on the center of the board and a few moves later jan went g5 and ladies and gentlemen game one of the candidates tournament i know this is the world championship match i know ding ding played his 30 games ding made it he made it to madrid but knight takes b7 and it was this was the this was the start of ding's tournament all right ding rookie four not only lost round one he lost round one by basically getting mated with bishop h3 check and if you take this bishop queen h1 king g4 h5 king g5 and it's just a set of unstoppable mates all around the king dingley ran in game one of the candidates tournament got crushed he got crushed he got crushed with white against the guy who just played for the world championship jan had just played magnus carlson so ding barely is even able to make it to the candidates and everyone was like oh he barely qualified and he loses he loses in i mean it was not close it was not close jet lag maybe illness right maybe he got sick maybe it was jet lag maybe it was just a lack of form because he hadn't played in top events for two years this is how he starts the candidates getting completely crushed 2806 was his rating gets crushed and he was up and down throughout this tournament he was up and down he managed to put it together and then we fast forward to the final game last game of the candidates now this game is important this game is important because the big cloud hanging over the candidates tournament was whether or not magnus carlson would play the world championship match it was not clear there is a number one player and the coveted number one spot is if you win the candidates and yanyuponushi was winning the candidates so ding lyron was not going to play for a world title yan was winning the tournament jan wins the candidates yan gets a rematch against magnus magnus had said he was maybe not interested in playing for the world title unless ferrugia who's a young player originally from iran now in france kind of like the young talent of the next generation magnus said i probably won't play unless ferrugia wins and maybe hikaru right so this is the final round of the candidates tournament it's for second place essentially if hikaru draws or wins he gets second place on the candidates if ding wins and only wins he can't draw he gets second place on the candidates and maybe he will play for the world championship does that make sense magnus winner of candidates but if magnus lee you need two people to play right so first and second magnus on one side winner over here or if no magnus first and second place so this is the game and ding is playing white and hikaru plays an opening that he's never played over the board and by the time the opening was finished hikaru had completely and i mean really completely and totally neutralized dingly red the queens were traded and it's a dead symmetrical position there is nothing here hikaru plays a perfect opening probably one that ding was not expecting this is an unwinnable position they have the exact same pawns they have the exact same pieces there are no queens on the board and that's it ding's window of opportunity is simply running out and hikaru is going to centralize his pieces and he's going to trade the knights and the bishops that's it i mean one by one he is going to trade off the pieces right and ding's got nothing i mean he's trying his best he's trying to hold hikaru e5 very accurate move by hikaru bishop goes back to d8 knight f6 trading pieces one by one the pieces fall off i mean ding has three pieces left you get king in six versus king and six you ain't winning this game rook d1 hikaru goes back to f6 bishop d6 the car plays knight that's it ding's window is gone i mean it's over hey karu is gonna get second place in the candidates tournament and that's it ding is fighting all right not only that now hikaru is even better hikaru's got a potential to be better here but he makes one slight in accuracy all right he plays a slight in accuracy and he tries to bring his bishop back to reroute it but then rook b7 and something was misevaluated by hikaru and ding is suddenly alive and his pieces are coming alive and all of a sudden he's he's removing hikaru's defenses and he's gonna start mobilizing his pawn majority with f3 and his rook is gonna go hunt some pawns and wait a minute wait a minute dingley ren actually alive yes dingley wren is alive and well his reports of his candidates exit are greatly exaggerated and rook a2 is trapping the bishop the pawn is an advantageous member of this end game and when all hope was lost dingley runs stunned everybody and took down hikaru in the final round of the candidates but keep in mind getting second place at the candidates means nothing it doesn't mean anything the winner of the candidates plays for the world title this is the guy who got second just got second place in an eight player double round robin unless magnus carlson doesn't defend his throne dingley ren was not even supposed to be in the candidates dingley ren was not supposed to be in the candidates when he had a window to make it to the candidates he wasn't eligible he managed to organize tournaments locally to get the requirement to go play he made it to the candidates he got demolished in game one it was one of the worst games that he had played in years but he bounced back he stabilized the ship and he won the last game of the tournament that's not an exaggeration that was the final game of the entire tournament that game ended there were no more games he won the game to get second but second doesn't matter because first place is the one that plays for the title unless magnus carlson doesn't defend his throne and now dangly ren is a contender for the world championship against yanyupomnishi he was never supposed to make the candidates he wasn't even supposed to qualify to get second place because of the game that he was playing he managed to power through and overcome and beat hikaru in a 60 move end game he wins that game he's still not supposed to play and then he gets a shot and the match against i'm not going to re-summarize the match in this video but we know how the match went if you don't know how the match went it was the best of 14 games and ding never led ding never had the lead he trailed one nothing he trailed 2-1 he trailed 3-2 dingley ren trailed in every single stage of this match the one time he could have broken through nerves got to him he froze up at the board he ended up not being able to win that game folks dingley wren was on the verge of defeat at some point in this match there was a 95 certainty that it was over this was one of the penultimate games this was game 12. dingley run is already down a game okay it's game 12 so 11 game it's six five all right and i've already covered this game on my on my channel but folks by the 20th move of this game dingley run had taken massive risks and this was the position didn't we rent was was done he would have lost this game and been down two games with two games to go he would have been down seven five in a 14-game match he would have had to win the games to even tie the score and this was the position and ding played c4 and queen c3 and jan stabilized the position and that's it jan was moments away from becoming the next world world champion ding tried to complicate matters and it paid off jan could have played knight to f5 at some moments here you can't take because of the various sacrifices so bishop b8 and both sides were missing opportunities queen b4 was played by ding queen d8 by yan and then the catastrophic error heard around the world pawn to f5 and ding who fought and fought and was on the verge of pure defeat i mean he he did what he could he sacrificed the pawn to try to open up the lines to the king jan played b5 and maybe here jan could have instead of playing beef b4 he could have played a6 he could have not allowed any of this stuff but jan could have just gone for this queen c6 91 queen here rook g8 the queen would have come back and jan in the ensuing position would have just been comfortably better queen h4 f5 and so on but the blunder heard round the world pawn to f5 didn't capture it on e6 and his nerves outlasted yawns as he marched his deep on into the position bishop d5 the diagonal to the king the diagonal to the corner the opening of the rook in some positions and ding was on the verge of being down two games with two games to go and he tied the match and it was 7-7 he didn't lead in any portion of the slow games it came down to the final game of the rapid tie breaks and this game was a whole bunch of nothing it was a spanish opening that they had played about 15 moves of already this was the final game this was game'. the score of the match was eight and a half eight and a half 77 in classical slow games and three draws so seven plus one and a half eight and a half eight and a half they have played 17 games nothing to choose between them all right and this game was very similar to one that we had seen earlier that in in the pre in the tie breaks but there was nothing and jan in fact did an excellent job of waving a red flag in front of the bull and made ding sacrifice a pawn jan was playing fantastic chess stabilizing and getting into an end game that looked like this in fact yani punishi is a pawn up and six minutes six minutes and a pawn if yanyupomy she manages to stabilize the position and win this game he wins the world championship rook to d2 was the preferred move disconnecting the queen and the bishop here to get queen d5 king h8 and some sort of little queen infiltration various ideas like this but instead of that he went back and the game quickly became a draw and both sides look at the time two and a half minutes is all ding has he has two and a half minutes versus six we have queen d7 and now perhaps the most gangster move of dingly wren's entire career as in this position when the players started repeating moves dingley ran with one minute and 46 seconds on the clock played the move rook to g6 in fact when he played it ding had one minute and 20 seconds with 80 seconds remaining in the final time break game of the world championship ding declines a draw everything has culminated to this the 30-game circuit that he had to go through in china the devastating loss of round one in the candidates the final glory of winning the final game of the candidates the back and forth battle against yan everything has led him here and in the ensuing struggle with just minutes on the clock combined 50 seconds ding stabilized his king traded into an end game and pushed his pawns both of them made it inches away from promoting as he monitored the safety of his king and dingly ren against all odds defeated yanya bomnishi in a 68 move battle in game' of the world chess championship the first time he led in the match he won he did not lead for three weeks imagine playing the same guy in chess for almost a month and you never lead and the one game that he decided to lead this match it ended he won the match he almost didn't play in the tournament to determine who makes it to the world championship he lost in that tournament when he made it he then got covered while in spain i'm pretty sure i saw reports of this he then beat hikaru to get second there was no guarantee of a match he then made it to the match because magnus stepped away he didn't lead in the whole match and when he finally led it was over how do you not appreciate this man how do you not appreciate the journey that it takes to get to the zenith of the 64 squares this is the insane story of dingly run greatest comeback story in chess i i good lord wow i guess i gotta say it get out of here
