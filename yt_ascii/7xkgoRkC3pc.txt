mark cuban's nft company has just been caught promoting scammy nft projects there's a surprise in exchange for millions of dollars in payment shocker and it has finally caught up with them and they lost everything everything except the money they still have that guys thank god but the 1.7 million followers on their at nft account was just nuked into the metaverse they don't have that anymore and now several people are looking for a job now all of this literally happened overnight one day they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars on autopilot and the next the account has been banned and mark cuban has been accused of scamming people how did this happen i'm here to tell you guys today it all started with a twitter user who goes by the name of topshot fund and he actually did what no one has ever bothered to do with nfts before he did his research he took a look at all the projects that mark cuban's company has been promoting in the last few months and checked if they actually made money or not now before we get into the details of this for those of you who aren't fully in the loop mark cuban and a partner jason falovich bought an instagram account called at nft a little while ago and almost immediately started using it to shield the absolute scummiest projects imaginable as long as you are willing to pay the right price sort of rug pull promoters for hire if you want to look at it that way now i covered this on my show before warning you guys about this page okay i dm'd the owner and i was told i could promote an nft project that i didn't have on his page if i only had twenty thousand dollars per post and he said the only way this would work is if i bought the five pack deal which was a hundred thousand dollars and part of the appeal of doing this is that they don't mention that these projects they promote are ads so it looks like they genuinely have hype now i told you guys at the time this was super sketchy and you shouldn't trust these people and it turns out i was right because our buddy top shot fun analyzed the performance of these nft projects that they were promoting for cash and found that 70 of them fell in value lost money 10 percent of the projects were outright rug pulls and only 25 of mark cuban's company's picks actually appreciated in price you would have made money on them what you're seeing right now is the spreadsheet that was put together about all these projects they promoted now basically this means that the 1.7 million followers were probably losing money while the people getting rich on these picks were obviously mark cuban in the gang as if they needed more money i mean i guess there's no such thing as enough money but anyway this was called out and almost immediately this post went viral the team behind at nft immediately started to do damage control and set up a live twitter space claiming that it was all a big misunderstanding and that they were big on doing due diligence i'm you know i'm not going to say every project we've ever promoted is terrible that couldn't be further from the case there's been a lot of fantastic projects that have come through you know we are doing due diligence on these projects now all i really can say to this is my own experience with talking to these guys behind the scenes as a pretend nft project promoter and i can tell you that i think the only check they were interested in was the type you give to a bank teller i mean they didn't ask what the name of my board a penguin project was they were like hey give us the money now baby check or we don't care that was the entire vibe of their thing it was like a copy paste like if you don't have 25k per post five post minimum what are you doing here right now obviously no one actually believes this but this is kind of what they have to say because you know you have a big name like mark cuban involved he's got this huge brand and you can't have him promoting a scam right and so a lot of work has been done to say mark cuban what mark cuban what we had his name on the instagram account he was a co-founder what he had nothing to do with this apparently rolling stone asked him if he was involved and he said no he wasn't involved at all in the operations basically he didn't know anything didn't see anything didn't do anything his co-founders were just running around without him and you know maybe there's some truth to that i'm sure mark cuban's a busy guy i'm sure he's not dealing with the day to day but my thinking is he was probably happy to sign the checks when the money was coming in but all of a sudden when stuff blows up all of a sudden mark cuban is nowhere to be found he disappears and basically everyone involved in this is acting like that no one responded to my requests for comment nobody responded when you know it was asked why they didn't say these things were ads when they actually were you know all of a sudden nobody's running the ship right nobody nobody's in charge when it's making tens of millions of dollars i'm sure things are fine even the guy who's sort of the face of this whole thing jason falovich the guy who told me i would need to pay 25 000 per post on his page you might be shocked to know that he's not in it for the money and if you do what you love and like i don't do it for the money i just [ __ ] loved it yeah i want to work every day and do that love that's right guys he has a passion for this this is he's got a passion for asking for 25k per post he's not in it for the money he's in it for the love of the game the love of nfts guys either way the page has now been nuked by instagram by the the holy angels at zuckerberg's hellhole i really find it disgusting the way every time every time it turns out it was always about the money and the price was you the price was you guys getting scammed so i hope you guys learned something about trusting influencers and please pump the stock zilla if you want to get ahead of the game as i said
