- that was dope. - [tyler] i pushed the button, i mean. - things are about to get crazy. this is a $40,000 firework. i could have bought a car. i coulda put a down payment on a house. i coulda give chandler 40 grand. or i coulda bought 10,000 copies of shrek, but i did none of that and i bought a $40,000 firework. this $40,000 firework is literally gonna blow your socks off. - no pun intended. - it is over 9,000 shells. that $10,000 firework was 4,000 shells. this is going to be four times bigger. $40,000 is a lot of money. there's a lot of stuff
we could do with this. - three, two, one-

- speak for yourself! what's he talking about? - that was $10,000, a
second of flashing light. but that's $40,000. imagine $160,000. - it doesn't get better than that. we just peaked. - we'll see. - bro, are you kidding me? look at this one. i can fit inside that. do you think i could
fit my head in this one? i wouldn't tell you to
put your head in it. - why not?
- it's a safety precaution. - it's not even on. - ready to see the
world's largest firework and light up the sky! - it's supposed to be freaking nuts. - we are about to launch
the largest firework anyone in mankind's history has ever seen. literally, a world record. $160,000, 4,000 pounds, 15 feet deep holes, we literally needed a forklift. first things first, you have
to turn the control panel on. - oof. - you then turn the key.
