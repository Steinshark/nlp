compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to who someone else is today you know if you get the comparison right you can say well here's where i'm headed and it's worth going to you have to ask yourself that is there a place i could head to that would be worth getting to and that's a question right it's a question like you might ask your wife it's like okay if i could give you what you wanted it's a good thing to ask during an argument by the way really really it has to be an honest question it's like you're arguing with me i i don't know who's right neither of us cuz we're both clueless and confused it's like if you could have what you wanted in this moment and i could deliver it what would it be the general answer to that is something like if you loved me you'd know which is not a helpful how come you know that answer it's not a helpful answer it's like no i'm i'm too stupid to know what you want that's for sure you don't even know what you want so how in the world am i going to figure out but it's a lovely gift to offer your partner by the way the conditions for your satisfaction but then you have to allow yourself to know what they are and you have to be acting in your own best interest and then that exposes you to all these potential calamities that we just described and that's a big risk but it's not nearly as big a risk as never getting what you want and need and that is definitely the alternative and that's a pathway to bitterness and cynicism and a wasted life and and bitterness and cic ism that's just where that starts it gets way worse as it compounds and so it's very useful to treat yourself like you're someone you're responsible for helping and it is very useful to compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to who someone else is today there's no way of interacting with someone including yourself that's more productive than to give targeted reward where credit is due to give credit where credit is due and you might say well how can i treat myself well given that i'm nothing but a the embodiment of serpentine what would you call it errors and sins and the answer is well if you're a little better than you were previously that's something really and maybe that's what you want to see in your kids right i mean you don't want to push them too far you you don't want to pun them if they haven't made huge leaps forward developmentally what you want to see is incremental progress that requires some effort and that's actually what your kids really love too you know if they're playing hard they're they're on the edge they're pushing themselves to develop their skills maybe they're playing a sport they're pushing themselves to move incrementally at the optimum rate that's another thing that play indicates by the way that's and that's so cool to know too play signals that you're pushing yourself forward at the optimal rate cuz you can't stay static and you can't absorb too much change at once how do you know when it's right well it's engaging it's meaningful but at the highest level it's something like play you know when kids when you're when you're playing a sport you want to play against someone who's approximately the same level of skill as you or maybe a little beyond right if you're playing a game with someone who's approximately your equal and you're pushing each other exactly enough to facilitate optimal movement forward and that's actually a very good conceptual scheme for apprehending the nature of a marriage so i found out from ben shapiro interestingly enough that there's a there's a there's a translation in the king james bible of of god's description of eve before he makes her says the king james version says that god says he's going to make adam a help meat and that's a archaic word right no no you don't call your wife your help meat generally or you're going to get a probably if you do but my point is it's an archaic term the the biblical language means something like beneficial adversary and that's very nice you know it's it's very nice because a beneficial adversary would be someone that you're pushing against and that's pushing against you exactly the right amount and there's this phenomena phenomenon that's known neurologically called opponent processing and a lot of the manners in which we make difficult and calibrated decisions neurologically involves two systems working in counter position to one another so imagine i want to move my hand smoothly as smoothly as possible that's pretty smooth but i'm shaking a little bit and it's a bit jerky so i'm using voluntary systems to move my hand and they're a little imprecise if i want to move it perfectly i go like this and then i can calibrate it unbelievably precisely and that that dance that you have with your partner that's what that's supposed to be optimized opponent processing so imagine why it's it's like it's the same as free speech in some real sense it's a manifestation of the logos that optimized adversarial process why well think about it this way imagine you have a child and or you have three children they're all quite different cuz children tend to be quite different even if they're born in the same family and so then you might ask yourself well how should we treat our children and the answer is well they're different so is there a rule and there are some guidelines and principles i had one in my book don't don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them that's a good rule to turn to how do you know if you're not being a tyrant you know your children act up and they annoy you maybe you're just mean or maybe they never annoy you but they annoy everyone else in which case you're not mean enough and i mean that definitely because if your children never annoy you but they annoy everyone else then they won't have any friends and then they're in real trouble but your children are different so how do you know how to calibrate your response to them and then answer is well you push back and forth against your wife or your husband and you you know maybe want to use a bit more encouraging and one of use a bit more sheltering that's often the masculine versus feminine roles al although that can intermingle you know but generally those are associated with justice in some sense and encouragement with masculinity and mercy and tenderness with femininity probably because women have to care for infants and so they tilt more towards that end in any case you have to calibrate that for each kid and the only way to do that is to push against each other right because how else you going to do it there's no rule and it's a dynamically changing situation and you're too clueless and blind on your own to do it properly but maybe the two of you ironing out each other's kinks in some sense in this constant dance oriented as you might be to the optimal development of your children who you hypothetically love maybe you can calibrate a moving target by pushing on each other back and forth and maybe if you do that optimally then you then it manifests itself as something like play and you know that happens because you take your kids out hopefully this happens at least sometimes you take your kids out to the beach or something like that you have a great day and what does that mean well it means you got the balance right right because there's some freedom and there's some principles there's some rules it's a game and everything comes together in the right place at the right time and you think that was a good day and you think yeah every day could could every day be like that and maybe that's too much to ask for every day but it's something to aim for and something to try to foster and it's something to know consciously you know that that that playful engagement that's a marker of the highest form of being [music]
