so hello everybody i am very excited to be here with rod dreier rodriguez is a best-selling author he just finished he just published a book called live not live not by lies and he is also the author of the bestselling author the benedict option which many of you might have heard of but he's also written several other books rod and i have had some conversations before and i was really excited to to read his new book because i feel like it just puts its finger right at on the right place in terms of the cultural discussion the cultural war and also a vision of what is coming towards the future this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world and so rod i have to say i was really happy to read the book we've had we had some conversations a little bit before about your plan for this book and i was really happy to see how it came out you know people don't know this about me but my wife is from slovakia and she immigrated when she was 11. her parents left the communist regime there and her own grandfather who was actually in from prague was tortured to death in the in communist prisons he was just a shop owner that fell you know fell into the wrong grass and was brought into was tortured in prison and left was was released just before he died so that they wouldn't have his body to deal with and and so to see people tell this story and to help us understand how close it is in history but how close it is even on the horizon of our of our possibilities that something like this could happen to us again for me was i was really grateful to see it and i was grateful to see you weave in just all the right people you know to re weave in dostoevsky and kundera as well i was really happy to see you weave some of the threads that he puts out and so tell us a little bit about what was the impetus what what it is that really kind of drove you to write this at this moment yeah it's it's astonishing to hear that your wife is from slovakia this by the way is a country that i never thought about at all until i happened to go to bratislava to an ideas festival and my host introduced me to people who have been part of the underground church and as you know i ended up dedicating the book to a priest by the tomas love kolakovic who had prepared the slovak church underground church for this persecution and i really think that we are in a kolakovic moment in this country maybe we can talk about it later anyway the impetus with the book jonathan was a phone call i got back in 2015 from a physician in the at the mayo clinic here in the u.s his mother was living with an elderly mother she was an immigrant from czechoslovakia she had spent i think four years in a communist prison for practicing her catholic faith and was eventually released came to america and married her fa his father and the old woman was saying son the things i'm seeing happen in this country now remind me of what it was like under communism when it first came to my country and it scared the physician you know and he just he reached out to me because he one of his patients was a friend of mine and he wanted to tell a journalist so i thought that was really kind of out there you know america is like communism come on but the more i started talking to people in this country who had come from communism whether it was russia or one of the other eastern european countries the more began to realize that they were onto something and if you talk to them at length they would get really angry that americans just don't take them seriously solchenitsen said in the gulag archipelago that one of the biggest mistakes we can make is to think that what happened in russia can't happen here he said it can happen at any country in the world given the right set of circumstances so what i did with this book is i took their alarm seriously i started to the first part of the book is about explaining what it is they're seeing precisely that reminds them of communism it's not stalinism 2.0 but it's it is the total politicization of society and that is the essence of totalitarianism part two of the book is practical advice from people in those countries christians mostly who had been dissidents i asked them what do we need to know now here in north america to prepare and that's the book yeah and i really it was interesting that you right away at the beginning let's say differentiate a dictatorship from a totalitarian state and it's important because it helps us understand how the totalitarian the totalitarian state can actually creep in on us without there being a dictatorship yet because it ends up taking ends up infecting our minds and ends up creating let's say totalizing spaces of what is acceptable and what is it acceptable to think or to talk about and then methods of finding weeding out people who think differently and actually excluding them from society in really radical ways and you mentioned some of those some of the people that have lost their bank accounts and it's still just a handful of people and it's people that we would still maybe think are despicable people who lost their bank accounts are not allowed to use paypal a lot of not allowed to engage in society but the fact that the mechanisms exist is already a frightening a frightening prospect for the future yeah it really is and i think jonathan that the fact that our idea of totalitarianism when we think of that we think maybe of nazism or we think of stalinism we think of gulags secret police that sort of thing official censorship from the state we don't have that in this country and or in north america and your country and so we think that it must not be totalitarianism augusto del noche is one of the great political theorists of the 20th century in italian and he pointed out that the essence of totalitarianism is the politicization of all aspects of society and therefore it can exist in a capitalist liberal democracy that's what we're seeing happen here and it's coming so fast i mean the the letters i get from people every day not only you know people from within academia but also within corporations who are talking about how suddenly this ideology is arriving out of nowhere and they're terrified to say what's on their mind they don't know you know when they're going to step on a land mine and the fact that people just so many of us north americans just are walking through life thinking that oh this is not a problem or this is something on the right that a problem we have on the right they think that if we just elect the right politician that's going to solve the problem it's not no it is really is a creeping up of a totalizing totalizing way of thinking and so there have been some even to me there have been some alarming signs in the past few years of course four years ago there was the kind of jordan peterson moment who he warned us about this coming because he could see it in the universities and now we're seeing it you know it's only four years later and of course the election cycle isn't is accelerating this because it seems as if you know because it's a crisis and people are afraid of what's going to happen in the future the process is accelerating but during this election cycle the fact that we saw journalists like glenn greenwald and matthew clasius quit their own publications to to go freelance because they were feeling censorship within their organization these are not like right-wing people these are just kind of regular liberal types and it's it's it's accelerating and we just see it people don't they see the individuals it happens to individuals it happens to individuals and this is of course the problem is that as it creeps in and it kind of becomes a pattern there are even things right now that people everybody knows that if you say certain things at work you could lose your job if you say certain political ideas at work you could lose your job and we've almost accepted that as normal we all accept it as if this is this is a normal thing but it's not a normal thing no no it's not and this is the you know the proverbial frog and the pot of boiling water that is exactly what's happening and what's interesting too is when you talk to young people like millennials and gen z especially they have been raised in an atmosphere in which this is normal and i just about i guess it was last month i went down here in louisiana where i live it's pretty conservative part of the us i went down to give a talk at a state university down on bayou lafourche now this is deep cajun country it's really conservative and i i'm just giving a talk about my book live not by lives a few days before i arrived there was a huge controversy on campus some members of the college republicans had chalk on the sidewalk there trump 2020 maga right completely ordinary stuff this caused such an uproar the social justice warriors on campus they had a three-hour student government meeting it ended up where the head of the stude of the college republicans and his girlfriend had to go had to be escorted by campus police to class because of death threats now here's what's so interesting about that this was not in overland and this was not at berkeley this was at nicholls state university in south louisiana and i went to college here in south louisiana back in the 1980s and i was more or less on the left in college the idea that we would have appealed to authority to silence our opponents much less make death threats against them would have been completely unthinkable but now it's happening and it's happening as i said not just in super liberal parts of the country but here in really conservative parts and what will also accelerate and it seems inevitable that it will accelerate this pattern or the the fear and the the frenetic energy to bring about this system is that those people that wanted that made death threats against someone who wrote trump 2020 on the sidewalk now have to deal with the fact that that 50 of the voting population at least near 50 of the voting population voted for this person that you are afraid to even see his name written on us on the sidewalk so so in their perception like this isn't this is an evil they have to defeat like this this is an absolute evil that they have to defeat and things line up politically for them even though trump is barely is not a conservative he he's he's actually quite liberal in terms of his his own values but he they just it just lines up in terms of a narrative and so everybody and i i've talked to even someone very close to me who said who talked about how you know the trump supporters and trump is anti-lgbt and i was like trump is not anti-lgbt like where did he even get that like there are pictures of him holding a pride flag it's like it's like but it's just because they line it up right they just line it up on the line and it all falls in place and that's scary because it's it is it's a narrative thing that's going on well you're right and this is one of the things that i think is key to understanding what's happening now a lot of people think of the social justice movement as a political movement deep down it's a religious movement when i studied the bolsheviks and how they came to power and what they were about that became so clear to me jonathan i you know they they couldn't get any traction in russia in the 19th century until the the'90s there was a terrible famine in russia and the tsarist regime did a very poor job handling it that event was a triggering event that caused a lot of the middle class to think maybe these marxists are right and the marxists had been the bolsters have been preparing for that moment when the czar exiled them all to siberia it was actually kind of admirable what they did they came they weren't living in jail they were like living in exile colonies they came together to study their holy scripture marx ingalls and to talk about what they were going to do they were willing to suffer for what they believed and and because they were willing to suffer they had a certain cachet and a certain authority when they came back into mainstream society in the early part of the 20th century and they started evangelizing the factories in the factories of russia you had so many because russia was starting to industrialize in a big way you had so many peasants men mostly who had come out of the villages and they were disconnected from their families they were disconnected from their churches and everything that gave them a sense of structure in the world and because of that the they were desperate for something to give their life a sense of meaning and there were the bolsheviks preaching marxism i think we're in we're in a very similar situation now and so many of these young people who have been alienated from the church alienated from institutions in our society they are susceptible to this totalitarian movement that gives them a sense of purpose a sense of meaning and a sense of solidarity with others their age and we see in the manifestation of the of these groups the religious elements and they're not they're not you don't have to look very far to notice that a lot of the protests which happened you know during cobit after the death of george floyd were religious in nature you know they were using sacred iconography they would even represent him with halos with a with wings and the people were kneeling they were even self-flagellating i saw people actually whipping themselves and so they're there and the washing feet and there so there was and there was it was like this catharsis of of course it was exacerbated by the fact that we had been kept apart it was almost like we were we were fasting during the first part of kovid and then all of a sudden this event happened this like death of someone happened it was almost like a mock easter and everybody joined came into the street to process and to to to to cry and to celebrate you know this thing which united them which is totally understandable it's like i understand it but there's something in it which is obviously it's off-key and it's a it's this is what i keep trying to help people understand that the kind of normal liberal is freaked out to see how religious these manifestations are and they're saying no i thought we're supposed to get rid of this religion thing but you can't you just cannot it just will keep coming back you have to be deliberate about it not accidental about it well you know one of the key moments in in our recent history that that revealed it was an apocalyptic moment that revealed what's really going on here came in 2015 in the fall of 2015 at yale university you might recall that there was this big controversy over halloween costumes erica christakis she and her husband nicholas both yale professors and masters they don't call them that anymore the masters are like house parents at silliman college she sent out a note to the student saying you know yale is telling us that you better be careful what kind of costumes you wear at halloween because you don't want to offend anybody but erica christaka said you're grown-ups you know come on this is this is ridiculous the students jumped on her and her husband for for being racist and not caring about them and hurting them because they they rejected this authoritarianism from the college that there's this great moment captured on the internet where nicholas christoph is her husband these are baby boomer liberals he goes out into the yard at silliman college and tries to engage this woke mob in reason discourse about the issue they don't want to talk about it you can see them shrieking at him and cursing and wailing like this man is a heretic reason is completely impossible with him and of course the yale administration collapsed and and gave in to the mob erica christakis ended up leaving the university this is an important thing for people to understand that this is not about reason we're dealing with religious fanatics yuri slickem who is a russian american historian he wrote this great book in 2017 called the house of government about the bolshevik revolution and he describes the bolsheviks as an apocalyptic millenarian political cult you know and and he goes and talks about the religious aspect and it's so interesting to see the parallels between them the bolsheviks and our social justice warriors in particular the bolsheviks saw good and evil as going the lavatory good and evil going right down the middle between social classes peasants workers good bourgeois bourgeoisie the wealthy aristocrats evil and it was the sheep and the goats and there was an apocalyptic bloodletting there that is what i'm seeing happen now when you see and every day are somebody right and sends me more more data about this where you see the line between good and evil being being laid down between races and identity groups and i cannot imagine anything good is going to come out of this yeah because it's dealing with identities that you can't change like in terms of let's say a christian ideal where you move into the church and you enter into the into salvation there's at least a door for you to kind of advance where here there isn't what's interesting about the halloween example is just how perfect it is to manifest the totalizing aspect one of the things i've been telling people about is helping them understand these inversion festivals and how there are festivals in all cultures that manifest a a breakdown of order and an upside down aspect to them and halloween is one of them that we have where you dress up as monsters you dress up as ghouls there's there's this whole kind of becoming a monster becoming an exception and manifesting the exception and so it's it's in those like the the king's fool or all of these they had feast of the fools in the middle ages all of these festivals are there to point to where the system breaks down and it's important to keep that you need to have places that point to you where the system is in total and so the fact that they would attack that place is perfect in terms of showing how they want to totalize and it's also the the attack on humor as well right you can't tell certain jokes you can't all the places that are there to poke at the system are being attacked by a totalizing system so it's interesting to notice and to to see that it's happening there first and then it's going to start to grow and take over because like you know totally there's always this saying that you know the totalitarian can't handle a joke can't handle humor because there's no room for it right because irony is not possible in a totalitarian society and you know i we were told when trump won in 2016 we were told and i think it's true that a lot of people voted for him because he was against political correctness and it seemed almost trite at the time when i remember hearing that but i the the more we went on the more i began came to believe that's true trump was the only way that a lot of people could could flip the middle finger to the ruling class and whether it was wise or not to choose him as the avatar of rejection of them is another question but there's no doubt that you know he was it yeah yeah so i want to i want to shift gears a little bit because one of the things i don't want to talk about the problem the whole time is what's wonderful about your book is that you also propose some solutions to the the question one of my favorite chapters in the book is the one where you talk about about memory and then the need to participate in communities at different levels of reality and so you you do point to the church as being the highest version of this but you also point to all different levels of places where we can come together and join to to manifest a a group a kind of a common purpose a common goal and something which is extremely connected to our daily lives so maybe you can tell us a little bit about that sure one of the the people one of the families i feature in live not by lies is the benda family of prague they're catholics they the late vatslav benda spent four years in prison for his human rights work and they were the only catholics only christians in the inner circle of bots love hovel and the charter 77 dissidents back in and under communism and i interviewed them about the the their modes of resistance they're in their apartment in prague they have this great apartment tall ceilings i mean this is the eastern european intellectual apartment books everywhere it's messy it's just wonderful camilla bendava the widow of botswab she still lives there she welcomed me into her house with some of her adult children and just because i wanted to find out what is it like for an ordinary family to deal with this all we read about usually is the demonstrations on the street that sort of thing but how do you raise a family of resistors people who not only know how to resist the political oppression but who know how in their in their lives to be faithful to their religion in a very atheist country well one thing they did there and roger scrutin was part of this when he would go over there during under communism got arrested for it in fact they would hold seminars where they thought it was so important to bring people together to talk about literature to talk about art to talk about history because all the stuff being taught in the schools was bunk it was ideological garbage people went to those seminars and in apartments like the bendas and there were others so they could remember who they were what it meant to be a check what it meant to be a christian what it meant to be part of the west the communist regime depended on erasing that memory from the minds of the people so they could be molded that was a big part of the resistance botswana bender also talked about something he called the parallel polis he said that the communists depended on complete atomization of the population and and making people afraid of each other for control so what benda tried to do was just bring people together for non-political things like picnics anything to get people to come out of their houses and realize that they are part of a community and so that was something as simple as having a picnic or having a lecture about art was a political act there to try to rebuild a sense of community another thing that the benders did was to show films they showed a high noon for example that was a big one in their family because they they wanted to demonstrate to their children and to others this is how a brave a brave man behaves you know like gary cooper in that film and in this way art and telling stories reading literature to the kids that it was it was important that you not only point outside the house and say this is where the evil is but you also give their children and people who are lost and build up their inner their moral imagination camilla told me that she would read to her kids two hours every night even though she was working right and her husband was in prison she still read to them said what did you read she said i read myths i read the classics i read a lot of talking why tolkien i said she looked at me straight in the eye and said because we knew that mordor was real right and and to this day 30 years after the fall of communism in one of the most atheist countries in europe all the adult bended children are still practicing catholics and so are their children yeah it's pretty amazing i was really i mean i think that one of the great things about the book and i really recommend everybody reading it is both inspiring and humbling you know to be inspired by these characters and humbled by the fact that you know how much they're willing to put into this and how much energy and will and also how it paid off like you said that despite their suffering despite people people dying people being imprisoned you can see this this kind of spark of life and continuing on and in their generations and one of the problems that you point out in the book which is which is real for us is that we seem the system that is coming towards us seems to be a strange it seemed impossible but a strange mixture between 1994 and a brave new world at the same time it's as if we have these systems of total surveillance which are appearing on the line and also mechanisms of exclusion and of total marginalization but at the same time we have this decadent society of of pleasure and of fanciful you know whatever fanciful thing you can imagine has more weight than let's say normal family normal society right so it's hard to deal with because it's not the same thing so how do we answer this this because it makes us lazy right we don't have it's not as we don't have an easy target to kind of say we're going to resist against that we have netflix and porn and and things kind of dropping in on us that just make us lazy and oh my gosh yeah just this week i had coffee with a man an evangelical protestant who does a lot of ministry with youth and and he was saying to me we were sitting there having coffee and he had just discovered my book live not by lies and was amazed by it and wanted to talk about it and he said he held up his phone he goes this this is the the problem and he talked about the kids are so obsessed with their phones and their xboxes and their social media blah blah blah and yet he gives his kids access to it all and i just couldn't the cognitive dissonance there i couldn't figure out because i for what i understood from talking to him and this is a good man right who cares about kids who is engaged with the youth is that it seems so overwhelming to him that it's best just to let it happen and just hope your kids do do well with it camilla bendava the the woman i was just talking about i remember sitting in her apartment in prague and notice that she had a dumb phone on her coffee table i asked her about that i said why don't you have a smartphone and she said that if you've lived through what we have lived through in this country you know that there is no way that information can be collected about you innocently and of course she knows as as we all know or should know that companies are constantly collecting information data about us and building profiles to sell us things well camilla said sooner or later this is going to be weaponized against us that's why i talk about the book how i think what's coming here is something as an american version of the social credit system that china uses it is perfectly compatible with a capitalist society right but they have the the the ability to control people and manipulate people is greater than even mao zedong and stalin had it is actually possible in china to cut people off from the economy completely because they don't they're moving to a cashless society you do all your you're buying and selling with your phone i talked to a guy in nashville the other day who an american who said yeah it was amazing to me to get toilet paper in a public toilet you have to use your phone to pay for it if the government decides to cut you off you're done it really is a matter of you can't buy or sell unless you have the mark of approval from the government now this is coming here too but we don't see it because it makes this technology makes our lives convenient yeah and also because there is this strange it's a strange place where because it's happening mostly through corporations rather than through government for now the it's disarms the right leaning people it disarms the conservatives because they're all libertarians and so because of that they have no weapon to tell google or to tell twitter they their only answer is to say well don't use their platform right that's the capitalist answer and the and it's it's like okay well i don't see how this is going to get better but it's tough like i suffer with that baptist pastor because our kids had no phones and no almost no access to the internet until covid yeah and then they had then for months they were alone and they couldn't go anywhere and we couldn't go anywhere and we were we were in total lockdown and they couldn't see their friends and they couldn't and so they and then the school said well they need to have a phone or else they can't go to school so they we did school online and so since then we've had the exact problem the phone has taken over yeah now we're like what do we how do we deal with this because without a phone the kids don't have friends it's like it's a it's a it's a scary scary place we did the same thing with xbox with our teenage son we didn't have any of that in the house but because of covet i mean it was really really hard for them and for him especially and so yeah you have to make some compromises and i'm not i'm not sitting on my high horse criticizing this pastor so much you know our kids we're a little tougher on them with the phones but look i mean i've got a phone i'm on the internet all the time but ultimately this is undermining our liberties and i'll tell you something else too in the book i talk about this conversation i had with a young hungarian maybe she's 29 30 years old she was my translator and budapest we were on the trim going to one of the these interviews and she was talking to me about how difficult she finds it as a young married person and a young mom to have conversations with her friends she said as soon as i tell them that you know my husband and i are having some problems or boy it's just exhausting raising my kid because they cut me off and they they say oh just put your kid in daycare leave your husband go back to the workplace you be you you do do what you need to do for yourself she said i want to tell them no no no i'm happy being married i'm happy being a mom a stay-at-home mom but but it's difficult but they don't under she said they don't understand the importance of suffering they don't understand even mild suffering the kind of suffering that all of us do is we're getting used to being married getting used to being a parent she said they have been so acculturated to the idea that anything that gives you anxiety or is hard should be pushed away and run away from and rearrange your whole life to avoid any kind of suffering or anxiety and i looked at her and said it sounds like you're fighting for the right to be unhappy she said that's it that's it where did you get that well i pulled out my phone and went to chapter 17 of brave new world where the the the guy the savage yeah john savage john the savage yeah he is unlike in 1984 when winston smith meets o'brien the torture or o'brien is like really giving torturing him to make him conform mustafa man the world controller in brave new world he said to john the savage why do you want to stay on the outside of our society you can have so much pleasure you have christianity without tears that's what he says and john the savage chooses suffering because it's real it's real life well this is why the this revolution that we've gone through in the last 50 years and that is accelerating is so hard to resist because we have to choose to be unhappy or in other words to choose the the the conditions under which unhappiness is possible suffering is possible because it's real those who would want to control us are offering us you know no suffering at all yeah but it it it's a trick because we see and we just have to look around us that people are miserable and that people who try to avoid suffering end up taking you know pills to fight depression they they just end up wandering meaninglessly and and accumulating stuff and being miserable whereas people you and you know them people who have kind of taken up a hard life to take care of someone who's sick who who who have lost a child and have kind of dealt with it in a in a healthy way you can see that they come out of it shining that they have a brightness about them that we don't see very often anymore and you know i have to tell you that under covid you know it was really tough for us at first your listeners may may not know that i'm an orthodox christian and we here in louisiana we couldn't go to liturgy for a while and i got really fed up with that and a lot of christians were too like why we're not doing this you know but then i had to stop and think about the people i just spent time talking to who couldn't go to church because if they went to church they would be thrown in prison or christians who were thrown in prison they still had to hold on to the faith even though they were suffering vastly worse than than any of us were simply by being told we couldn't go to church and i had to fall back on the things they said about learning how not to feel sorry for yourself because if you felt sorry for yourself then you were done and not to hate their torturers i mean this is incredible the testimonies some orthodox christians from catholics or protestants who went through that it was possible to be broken by that experience but if you were willing to offer your sufferings to christ and suffer as a christian then it would refine you i tell the story and live not by lies about this slovak photographer teemo krishna who was raised in the fir he's the first generation after communism in slovakia and he had freedom and success and material wealth that his parents generation could only have dreamed of but he still wasn't happy he decided to go do a project a photo photographic project of interviewing elderly people who had been political prisoners for their catholic faith under communism and he said that just being with these people some of them are still quite poor today and to talk to them about what they went through and how even in prison those are some of the most joyful times of their life because they knew they learned to be close to god in ways they wouldn't have understood before it changed timo's life entirely and he realized that he that wealth and liberty can be a prison too yeah and it's interesting because i've had my moments during the because we are still in a kind of semi lockdown there are some churches that have small liturgies you have to reserve in advance you have to wear a mask and there are other churches that just don't have it at all and so to be honest i haven't been to church since the beginning of copen because then they opened lockdown opened up for a few weeks and locked down again and it's just been very frustrating and so i've had these moments where i kind of feel that frustration but then i i think that reading your book also helped me to to ask myself okay well then if i'm so frustrated this and i'm frustrated at this stage because they want to prevent me from doing this like am i getting up in the morning am i doing litany's am i reading the psalms am i like no i'm not i'm a lazy you know it's like i'm doing my barely my morning prayers and then it's like i go on with my life but if i really did care about this and i was really suffering that i'm not in communion in church then i would be compensating for it in my daily prayer life but i'm not and so it is more this kind of just laziness and easily blaming you know this this but i still think that that all of this at some point is going to have to end but i think that it has to start with my own discipline rather than wanting the state to change their rules right now exactly and this is why i really do believe that kova that god has allowed this to happen as sort of a severe mercy for us to prepare us for what's coming in the future you know if we as christians whether you're orthodox or whatever if if you can't handle this sort of deprivation without falling apart or losing your discipline or you know just being filled with anger then you're not going to make it through what's coming that's one thing that i have really a lesson i've tried to take to heart through all this that don't don't look at it don't get angry from covet i mean we're all sick of it maybe we're angry at the government angry at our bishops whatever and that might be justified but that anger is going to destroy us if we hold on to it and we don't we don't instead use this time in this trial to deepen our repentance and deepen our conversion i'm just like you i'm i have not been not added more more prayer disciplines you know and it's it's so stupid because i know where this is going but it's really it's a matter of the will less about the mind than about the heart and so i'm curious though because the book came out i imagine that you were finishing up editing it as kobe was kind of coming in and so you do mention it a little bit in the book but it's not it's not like a pervasive thing in the in the narrative and so have you seen because one of the things that people are perceiving and i have to admit that it's hard for me not to perceive it a little bit especially now with certain language being used you know this idea of the great reset and certain phrases that are used by all world world leaders at the same time and so there is a sense that somehow kovid is at the least an opportunity to accelerate this system of control and that we're that it's going to happen faster because of this this pandemic i don't know if that's something that you've meditated on yeah i think it's true and the the difficult thing here is realizing that the pandemic is real you know it's not like they've invented this just so they could can figure out how to control us but i think they are using the the fact of the pandemic as an opportunity it's like their reichstag fire right and i think that one thing i've noticed here where i live in baton rouge is that most places i go now they prefer that you use the the card the debit card to pay for little things things that you would before hand over cash well it's it's safer it really is to use the card but we get accustomed to that and whenever you make a purchase with a card that data of what you bought is saved yeah and so a profile is created of you by these companies by these banks what's going to happen when the workstars in who are running these banks decide that as they've done in england you mentioned earlier that your politics are so appalling that they're not going to allow you to have an account with them well go find another bank what happens when they all decide that and what happens when no stores will take cash anymore i mean this is a trial run for this sort of thing and also contact tracing it makes perfect sense to do contact tracing this is how you fight a pandemic but at the same time you know what happens when they start seeing the fact that you're a christian or you're a conservative are you in some way or part of the deplorable community and they want to contact trace where you've been no i it seems like at least the mechanisms are there and it's it's even though it's not happening now it's just a question of time before someone starts to use these same mechanisms to trace people for political reasons and we know it's true because we are watching the companies that are using the data becoming politicized at this very moment they are they are politicized and they're acting more and more in terms of politics taking political stances taking value and ideological stances and so there's as this accelerates it's going to become more and more of a reality yeah and here's what's so interesting in china the social credit system there you would think the chinese people would be appalled by it by the fact that the government government computers are are using this data to give everybody a social credit rating and if you do things that offend the government you get a lower rating and your privileges are reduced you think they would all hate that it's not true a lot of them love it because communism the experience of communism destroyed social trust there and a lot of chinese people just don't know who they can trust their society has been so and so much turmoil as capitalism has taken over that they feel like they're gonna be taken advantage of at every turn so if you look at a social credit rating you know that person with a high rating is trustworthy it gives them a sense of security to have the social credit system similarly in this country i think especially with the millennials and the gen z who becomes are becoming more politicized culturally they're going to look at this as some as a tool that helps them stay pure and not do business with the bad people yeah and i think they're going to welcome it james polos the cultural critic he had he says that we are headed to what he calls a pink police state what he means by that is that we will be a people who will sacrifice important political liberties like freedom of religion freedom of speech in exchange for safety and health which is to say a society in which the state guarantees that we're never going to be troubled by by people who believe destructive things and things that make us feel unsafe and they will continue to give us our porn give us our pot make this stuff available to us the only price is going to be the surrender of political liberty and polo says that this is coming that people are going to welcome it yeah and it's to me it's it's a strange fascination because i remember when i was young i was kind of in i grew up in a evangelical culture and apocalyptic culture there was a lot of that stuff going on and i remember as a young person reading to being told about the mark of the beast and thinking why would anybody accept that like why would a society like i i was trying to figure out like okay so there's this thing this mark and then people are identified and then they if they don't have it they can't participate and i kept thinking okay but why would anybody accept that like how could it happen in a society and it's just been very strange to watch it happen and to kind of watch the idea that we that this notion of of being identified and being let's say man not managed but being identified as pure being identified as as part of the system is something which we are actually welcoming quite quite easily and it's a weird upside down thing too because the the thing that will make you excluded in the end is you not being open so it's actually it's actually you have to ex to you have to accept completely those that are supposedly excluded in order to be part of the system and if you have some kind of hierarchy then like any kind of hierarchy then you're going to be excluded that's what it seems to be yeah yeah you know hannah aaron the the great 20th century political theorist she wrote a book called the origins of totalitarianism and she was a refugee a jewish refugee from nazi germany but she set out after the end of the second world war to understand why it was that germany and russia had both surrendered to totalitarianism though very different systems and one of the things she found was that in both countries the elites were willing to surrender and allow the the the pillars of civilization to be destroyed for the sake of allowing those who had been excluded in the past to come in we see that happening right now especially in our universities you know the idea of diversity and inclusion these are just words used to as a cover for destroying the things that make a university a university destroying the ability to have freedom of thought freedom of expression within the university to debate ideas yeah now if you bring up if you contradict anything with this new ideology then you're being accused of being against diversity and against inclusion and you are therefore a heretic yeah and so one of the things that has been one of my motivating factors in the past few years has been to help people understand marginality and to understand it in both positive and negative sense because the two aspects of the totalizing systems let's say the fascist system and the communist system it's a caricature but the two sides of the total totalizing system is that one of them wants to cut off the margin completely to remove it burn it right and the other one wants to include it completely in a way that it is normalized and both of those are just the wrong they're just the the danger of not letting the margin be the margin right not letting the fringe flop in the wind like not letting the edge of the carpet have tassels and the idea that if you read in scripture it talks about leaving the corner of the fields on you know that that aren't you don't reap the corner of the fields or that you leave the the fringe on the vestment you need a fringe on your vestment and so this or the the narthex the gargoyles on the outside there's all these images of of the fringe in in a traditional society and carnivals are part of it and all this and i'm trying to help people understand that someone's someone mentioned this on on twitter and tagged me on it said that we often think that it's dangerous to bring the dragon into the city because of the city that it'll destroy the city but we don't think how dangerous it is to bring it into the city for the dragon because for a dragon to remain a dragon it has to stay outside the city and some aspects of society are have power in their marginality like they have a they have an effect on the world because they are questioning the system so the fool you need the fool to stay the fool but if you start saying stop saying that the fool is a fool and stop saying that he's a fool he's just like you he's like well yeah but the fool is part of this you need the fool to act like a fool and to be the fool and to have the advantages and disadvantages that come with it right yeah in the orthodox tradition as you know we have the holy fool that comes out of russian orthodoxy where people learn to pay attention to the fool they don't try to domesticate him they don't try to you know bring him in and make him respectable they they listen to his voice because he's a prophet yeah and that's that's exactly the right way is to say that the fool has to remain raw if you try to domesticate the fool you're damaging you're you're damaging the system and you're going to damage the fool on on both sides you know just before we came on to this this interview i saw on twitter that the muir woods out north of san francisco it's an incredible place it's a redwood forest i've been there it is like you go there and you understand where the druids came from right that you could see why you would want to worship trees yeah but they they now have a thing they put up there the park service talking about mirror woods queer woods they talk about queer ecology and the forest and it's the craziest thing it is the most blatant example of trying to force this ideology into places where it doesn't belong it reminded me jonathan of what happened i talked about this and live not by lies too about the after the soviet revolution the bolshevik revolution the soviet chess society was trying really hard to keep politics out of chess to make it a pure place where we just came there for the game and they put out a statement saying we want to keep chess for chess's sake well accommosar wrote to them and said no no no comrades after the revolution everything must be brought in under the umbrella of the revolution we can't have chess for chess's sake that is a mentality that is so destructive of everything and we're doing it here now the idea that the that the freaking mural woods is now has to be queered oh man i wish they would have gone to the end of their making chess communist and then made all the parts move the same yeah then see how far that goes in terms of maintaining your chess club you know it's nothing against lgbt folks but the idea that you have to bring this woke consciousness whether it's race or sexuality to just walking in the woods you can't walk in the woods and clear your mind and get away from the revolution the revolution is always with you now i would feel the same way if this were 50 60 years ago and they were putting patriotic propaganda there and trying to make the woods a testimony to the greatness of america it's just the woods have to be the woods yeah especially the wild spaces especially those untouched spaces that are they actually represent the idea of non-civilization or non id they say they're now an analogical to non-ideological because they're not there they're left wild like the corners of the field they're like so just leave them wild you don't have to you don't have to constantly yeah you don't have to colonize it's it's interesting because it's actually a way of it's a kind of reverse colonization of nature like a form of colonization but done from from the from a certain ideological perspective and you know when i was in poland last year in warsaw doing reporting for this book i talked to polls two or three polls who work for the polish branch of western that is american and european multinationals and they were talking about the cultural imperialism that is coming into the polish workspace from big business for specifically they were being compelled to participate in lgbt pride celebrations even though they were catholics and this violated their conscience but they said that it's so hard to get jobs this good here or our families are struggling what should we do and it made me really angry as an american that this is that these people they had to suffer colonization by the soviet union and now they're suffering colonization by you know colonization by world capitalism i mean it's just anyway sorry i mean it's but it's a it's a i think it's good to understand the moment and it's also for me it's good to see the upside down moment because it's as if that which is marginal is trying to become king and trying to then impose its its weird kind of marginal identity on everything but and so that's why in your book what's wonderful about the book and what's wonderful about the possibility at this moment is to actually take the dissident position and so one of the the kind of fascinating double ironies of your book is that you use that kind of early russian style on the cover of the book where you're you're actually using this yeah because i have the audio book so i don't have a copy of it and so you're using this kind of early modernist style which was revolutionary to now talk about resistance and dissidence to this new system and and it's a i like pointing to the robin hood story like this weird robin hood moment where everything becomes upside down and the illegitimate becomes legitimate and so then the normal person ends up looking like a rebel and ends up looking like a like a dissident and the babylon bee does a lot of that on that where they talk about the rebellious family that decides to stay married and have kids and how they're totally flaunting the rules of society you know and so there's a position to take which is actually which is a consistent position which which also has some motivational power in in knowing you're kind of a strange upside-down rebel just by being normal yeah yeah the cover is it is soviet constructivism i deliberately chose that design to be to flip things because as you say that was the artistic style associated with the revolution well i wanted to make christians christian dissidents out to be like revolutionaries and there are some older people i've heard in orthodox parishes in the u.s who are really bothered by that because it is associated with communism but i can understand that but i'm trying to flip things as you say in an ironic way i think that for me as an orthodox christian it has been helpful because if you are an orthodox christian in north america you are on the fringe by definition you know and it has been really good for me to accustom me to being an outsider and to be okay with that living in that outside space because it's going to have be more and more the case that not just for orthodox christians but for any christian or any traditionalist you are going to be already on the outside but increasingly persecuted for being on the outside but we have so much in recent church life in the life of the church in the 20th century of that persecution and sure and showing that it's possible knowing from lived experience that it is possible to survive it yeah well listen i first of all i really appreciate this conversation and i want to encourage everybody to get live not by lies you know you can get i listened to it on audiobook twice while i was carving and so there are different ways you can get the book it's definitely worth it it is both humbling and encouraging and it gives us some solutions little solutions to put in place as we kind of move into this strange soft totalitarian space so thanks rod for talking to me oh it's my pleasure and i want to end jonathan by simply saying that this is not an optimistic book but it's a hopeful book what's the difference optimists believe that everything's always going to be great don't worry about it well that's not really true that's not realistic things may work out well but they may not we may have to go to the gulag but people who are hopeful believe that in the end good will triumph god will triumph and we may not live to see it but as long as we unite our sufferings and stay faithful and even if it cost us then we will be part of the redemption of the world that god works so hope christian hope is the thing we need not false optimism all right thanks rod it was great to talk to you great talking to you too so if you enjoyed my discussion with rodrigo make sure to check out his book live not by lies a manual
