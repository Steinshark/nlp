today i'm going to solve a mystery right on par with the da vinci code how i went from this one year ago to this from soyboy beta to alpha chad how i went from a bedroom crappy studio to having a 10 million dollar beard ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and today i'm going to tell you my secret guys the secret to getting the lambo in the garage right because believe it or not i'm a lot like you i eat my veggies i put on my pants one suspender at a time right i take my vitamins but there's one important difference i have 10 million dollars you may not which is fine actually that's why i'm here you might be short a few million dollars but i have an answer for you today how you can get the lambo without having to lease it and it's a secret that's gonna change youtube forever i feel like no one knows about this except for me and i keep trying to tell everybody but nobody's listening so i'm making this video so i never have to explain myself again it's called virtual production and it's basically well it's basically green screens and you might be saying steven what's new about that well mr know it all kind of a lot the game has been changing in the green screen world you might not know about it and it's been changing the money production problem on youtube in a way that basically i feel like nobody's figured out yet it's just me and i'm trying to tell as many people as possible about it when i can so story time when i was starting out on youtube much younger than this i quickly noticed there was a problem on youtube well there's several problems honestly i had a lot of problems on youtube right you know some of them were easy to solve you know i had no personality that's easy just make up a bunch of bad jokes and fake laugh at them but there are other problems that are harder to solve one of them the money production problem because you look at a lot of like big youtubers today i don't know if you've seen them lately they're insane like gone are the days of low budget sets and bad webcams there's still a few og gyms out there but these guys are the exception not the rule nowadays you look around you got people like mkb hd linus tech tips and they've got these like million dollar sets going on with staff and all these things to make these videos that look well they look great they look super high quality but if you're just like a regular guy starting out that's super intimidating how do you get to that level it feels like it's an uphill battle like at one point this youtuber linus tech tips was describing how after he bought his like six figure seven figure warehouse he then had to build a house inside of the warehouse just to make it look like a youtubery so we realized we're gonna stop trying to build sets and we're just gonna build a house so we found a condo floor plan and we just built it in our warehouse and this is the problem most new youtubers face and the old answer to this problem was we'll just get 10 million dollars and invest it in a 10 million dollar studio the new answer ladies and gentlemen which i myself do not use but you can is green screen the answer is cgi yes like computer generated graphics right homegrown cgi ladies and gentlemen it's come a long way in the past decade i mean you remember the terrible stuff we used to make back in the day wait a second when was this movie made sorry ladies and gentlemen bad cgi actually still does exist just got word but the ability for individual creators from their basement to make amazing cgi now has come a long way it's gone from something that nobody but the biggest studios in the world could consider or dare invest in to something that indie youtubers like ian hubert are doing now and it looks awesome they're even working on tech now where you don't even need a green screen to even do it to prove it here's a buddy of mine vikas showing off some new tech he's been working on i'm filming this for my beautiful home definitely not my crappy basement office that was hastily arranged in the pandemic and is next to a hot water heater are you guys getting it yet like this is without a green screen and with a green screen it looks even better maybe even i don't know indistinguishable from really being in an office i wouldn't know that personally i'm just trying to tell you guys that this is gonna change what it means to have a professional set instead of buying a warehouse where you spend a million dollars and then have to build a house inside of your warehouse there's gonna come a time where you can throw up a green screen and look better or even not have a green screen and look better with more creative sets than you could do for millions of dollars in real life but okay that might sound interesting to you but you're wondering stephen this newfangled attack why now why is it coming around now weren't weren't we always able to do something like this why is the tech just now getting this good well there's been some pretty exciting stuff going around you may have heard of like the mandalorian v tubers have been exploding mocap suits are getting good but i think in my opinion the biggest shift that we've seen is in realism with something called ray tracing which is like a way to mimic how light works in real life graphics have like taken a quantum leap forward you've probably already seen it like minecraft with ray tracing on like looks like a work of art but if you have stuff that doesn't isn't just blocks it starts to look like literally real life and at some point it's gonna be hard to distinguish computer-generated graphics from real graphics and i'm not talking like from a movie studio not a big budget i'm talking about small youtubers are gonna have their hands on this stuff there's already huge communities in things like blender and unreal engine which are both free to use that are coming up with insane results from the comfort of their own home like here's an example of a car chase scene by revvy music and if you didn't know any better you'd think this was real so let's put this together the secret that no one knows about on youtube yet is that two things are intersecting and i want to tell you guys about it i keep trying to tell my friends nobody's listening to me so i'm just going to make this video in hopes that i can inspire somebody on the one hand you have youtube pushing towards higher production content where creators are spending more and more money to make themselves look more professional on the other side we have this new technology that's enabling same or better looking visuals for a fraction of the price those are going to intersect and the conclusion is that virtual production is going to be a game changer and what i'm telling you guys is get on the ground floor hey if you want to pump the stock zilla you can be a part but also still early into the party if you want to make your own content right i believe that this is going to revolutionize the way people make video content the way that cgi revolutionized how people made movies 30 40 years ago and you can be a part of it with very little money which is awesome and you can do that or you can have 10 million dollars like me and just make your 10 million dollar studio the old-fashioned way your same as so you're choices no you're not
