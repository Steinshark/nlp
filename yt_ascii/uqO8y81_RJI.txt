okay so welcome to today's event it's about improving hiring in c plus plus versus meeting z plus plus what meeting z plus plus offers to you for hiring and especially targeting folks that have open positions and that are looking for secret plus developers so i also want to say that you know to see today of course it's also interesting if you are looking for a position more about this later so just quickly want to just point out why me c plus was right i have an incredible reach into the community i have reached in like in 28 days because that's how social media performs usually measure this of like almost 300 000 like then almost 450 close to 500 000 on on twitter and there's a lot of untapped possibilities here for hiring in the community house outreach which i can give you through meetings plus meetings online etc and this is what i'd like to talk about now and you've probably you know already seen it and i've been hearing it for years that c plus devs are hard to find and you know you you kind of wonder why that is right and [music] one of the big reasons i think it's like everyone is looking okay so people have open positions and they're just trying to you know to find the right programmer for that but it's really hard because everyone wants an advanced c plus plus programmer and so there's a lot of competition and in today's world of the the good programmers are you know able to choose their positions they have like you know lots of companies to choose from where they want to employ and on the other hand it's like the the way we do recruiting that alienates people we as a developer you get on the social media platforms like linkedin these these examples are focusing you get a lot of spam from recruiters that just you know write messages to everyone and you know they kind of find the candidates through that but they alienate the rest of the community and that's not okay and also like you know of course they write in their messages that they look at your profile that's i'm always amazed at that because and seeing in my profile i explicitly state that i'm not looking for a job okay so then i kind of you know wonder where did those folks look not not really a lot right and then i want to point out that yes i've been misgendered which you know that's not a such a big problem for men because most copy pasta is for men but for women it's a big problem and doesn't make them feel welcome in our community that even like you know this is a side effect of that copy pasta and everything which goes around another neat thing is like they mentioned here in this message that they have this global player and austria's fine and i kind of i'm not sure but i know a few people from that area which work with c plus plus and i think i know the company right this is like i'm so well connected in c plus plus that if you mention like where the company is if it's like munich where a ton of companies exist i probably know which company you're talking about and no i'm not looking for a position also when i was a freelancer and i was currently not looking for a project and i changed that to my status i got like literally offers for projects from from people using the search function and having search agents which trigger on projects and people which are looking right so the whole model we are we are trying to recruit folks with right now is like you know more like a shotgun and not really precise so i asked the superplus community for this presentation in spring of this year and in fall of 2021 so last year i've been specifically asking people if they're not looking for a job how many recruiters companies have contacted for a job in the last three months okay and the numbers and fall get a bit better but and spring is a bit worse so you see kind of there's a problem there is some people which you know are lucky that they're not from the recruiters they're probably not on those platforms they're probably well hidden but there's there's a ton of us which you know that have kind of get to spam and i often hear from other developers that they find it annoying and it's of course if like if you're coding and you're in the zone and your telephone rings because the recruiter found your number or just some something like that possible that's extremely annoying and can lose your work which is also visually you know that's really bad and those people don't understand that i also asked on linkedin and of course on linkedin it's a bit worse than on twitter because on linkedin there's a ton of recruiters right and that's kind of what you would expect on linkedin right and again the trend holds that it's and spring seems to be a bit worse than it was in in the fall of last year which could be a seasonal thing could be a statistical thing you know i don't know but it's a big problem for for people working in our space so when i started the online user group i was thinking about what what can you do with it what formats can you offer and so i've been playing around with various formats in one of those formats and events that came along is the job fair a fair where people can come to and meet employers that are looking for c plus plus programmers that have open positions and that is basically where both sides can just join and find each other and that's so far a great success and we're gonna look a little bit more into this how this works [music] so originally i had planned to have five events in this year four events but we have five events the next event is next week we had an extra event in june because some companies wanted to host that one and so the way this works is it also attracts a lot of traffic of for people that do not come to the job fair because not everybody has time right there is a cv sharing form and folks can share their resumes over this it creates a live profile so folks can choose their country like real equation and remote what what the options are which they are available to and they give the c plus plus skills the field of work and the years of experience and this allows to share with the companies that are either in the sponsors of the event or with the employer listing which by the way is now kind of the same thing if you be at the event now you will be for half a year in the employer listing more on this later for 2021 all of the year this is the candy dates which from those countries they came we always have a lot of candidates from india and we have some candidates from other countries which then total up to this for one year i wanna explicitly mention that this graph has been misread by some companies some companies look at this graph and say well there's not enough developers from other countries it's kind of a chicken neck problem why should people submit from your region if there's no company available to them like and if you know a company from italy joins i can communicate that i have no companies from italy i have less people from italy or turkey or united kingdom you know serbia spain wherever you are located lost your company right so it's kind of a chicken leg problem i also asked for the skills which gives us kind of an overview like what candidates are mostly interested in or what they feel relevant to have as their skill visible like as their top skills and so those skills are chosen by the candidates and you see that c5 11 is the most popular one amongst those the most common one same with linux 14 object orientation modern cpr 17 and so on you know so that gives you a light candidate profile together with which fields of work they have chosen again here we have a huge influence by the companies attending yeah the the the labels on the on the graphs are a bit small so here it's from left to right desktop is the most popular others always popular embedded developers we attract a lot we have server finance automotive telecommunication image processing mobile gaming gaming is a black one aerospace is the gray one then cloud ai hpc audio and robotics and there's a clear effect no i cannot zoom this is a this is a slide and this is like clearly also affected by the companies attending if we have companies from finance attending then we have more finance developers and if we have like companies from the gaming world then more game developers will show up right similar with the use of experience which here starts with zero so we have you know at the beginning of the graph a lot of companies are interested in like you know juniors and more experienced developers we have both of that and then we also have like developers which have been 10 or more years in the field and this creates a light candidate profile which for you as a company you may filter on and you also are able to search for it later because that's an important feature for companies that have like a lot of positions they might have a position you know where you need to filter for a certain standard or a certain library like youtube boost the next step for the candidate is then because it's like a two-step formal form to select the companies they want to share with and upload their cv resume and add a general coverage not every candidate does but that's fine so it's up to the candidate to select the companies they are interested in okay so it's not like that every company gets every cv no it's like the candidate has to choose the companies they want to share with and usually per event we have more than 50 candidates submitting and this is like still like you know i'm still planning this as a long-term strategy so more companies will join us over time and as i mentioned already the attending companies of the event have a strong influence on the candidates showing up here you see a comparison between the skills of the first event in 2022 and 2021 in total the biggest difference is that in 2022 we see that c plus plus 17 becomes more popular with the candidates the other things are just statistically innocent and certainly confident i think but c plus 17 becoming more popular with the candidates is definitely a trend i can see quick word on how the event runs so the event has tables or booths you can sponsor them in that case you get all the things which i just mentioned you get to be in the cv sharing form for half a year you're listed on the website with your logo and your logo is visible on the job section you have access to the recruiting tooling which i'm going to speak about in the next few slides and it enables me to you know do advertising and driving guided tooling together with your needs there are three tables which are limited to two visits they are in the event below the sponsor table so they don't get as much traffic it's for companies that are unsure and they also have half the seats it depends on how many companies to the event come usually we have like eight seats for sponsor tables and four for free tables but if we have a lot of companies attending we are usually switching to a four and two seat model just to have a better use of space in in the event itself this is a quick view like those graphs you just see you also get them for the candidates that submitted to you so if you have like 30 to 40 candidates admitting to you you get to see like an overview what are the skills those candidates share what are the fields they're coming from the years of experiment and and from which countries and those graphs might be you know useful to to do to use for you in a presentation to you know you know to to have your internal results presented and of course there's also a listing of the candidates which you have some influence on also i forward the candidates per email to you and the cb then i already mentioned that there's a search form and this is a search form you can filter for certain properties and that's like you know for certain positions important like one branch of your company uses cute and then there is a back end department which is not based on cute they use boost and you have two positions and you want to filter for for the candidates that you know you know that use boost for the one position and for the other position that you execute as an example and that's kind of you know i see that for some companies receiving 30 to 40 candidates is too much so they need to kind of have a way to to further through this and look at candidates that are more what they're looking for and all of this you know has come a bit through the pandemic through the experiments with the online world it's still a bit on learning mode but we are like you know this is basically now a well versed and very successful project in hiring and i'm looking for employers to join the the effort i want to thank to the companies which have been active in this last year which are those companies and i know that the kdab and airplane have hired through the scaly abs very often at the events because they find it very very good and they are very interested in having their contact to the developers through this and also may and september last year are those companies and november and if you count that together you get to 15 companies in total for last year but i've also launched last year the recruiter another look at the employer listing and there are three more companies listed in that which are then 17 companies in total and we had eight companies in the first event on this year and right now we have three companies currently listed in the upload forms if you want to share your cv that works today but you might want to wait until next week if more companies are coming up and are you know part of the effort and you can then submit to more companies so just does it i quickly want to go through the submission model candidates fill out the submission form choose their employers and that gives you an application state which is present on the website for you but also emailed to you there's a filtered search which you can use and has the same result and then you know there is some interaction required with a candidate the submission form gives you an overview on the skills the field of work where a candidate is coming from a region which is in this case continents and the years of experience they have and you can filter or search on these also you can set a pre pre-setting that you're only visible to folks which have a certain experience level or experience with that is that works very well but companies should be careful not to filter out too much i've removed some settings from filtering for that reason because companies were yeah basically filtering too many candidates out of that without like really knowing so and we as a community get out of this that there is a better hiring and an easier way to connect with the community and to include employers in an inclusive way i do get some funding out of this so i can run on the online platform free and paid events hubido costs money it's licensed platform and it's you know still serves my goal to build a platform in a network for cps plus and of course i'm always looking for employers and companies to work with though feel free to contact me and many thanks to the companies that joined in last year but also this year of course if you have any questions you can reach out by email or of course here on linkedin thank you very much for listening let me quickly tap back to the event okay
