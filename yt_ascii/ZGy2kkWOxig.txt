wow look at the size of this computer okay the ndt from hd computers isn't quite that big but it's like nothing i've ever seen before it's tall statue-esque even and it is packed with top tier components to the point where you might kind of wonder if they're compensating for something regardless of that though it's a really cool concept for a case layout and they were kind enough to send it over so we can tell you guys is it a complete hunk of junk or is it the next big paradigm in case design maybe both r showed up with kind of a unique feature that gives it some serious room to breathe here oh well there's your problem right there they glued on the side panel when we reached out to customer service they told us they're using a high grade specialized structural epoxy from the aerospace industry and let me just put it this way i'm sure that that was the right call so dr linus is here to fix it up glue gun how do you know i was going to ask for a glue gun i need 20 cc's of hot glue stat foreign oh boy this is not aerospace adhesive at all but then again the aerospace adhesive didn't work very well either so best of luck everybody [music] oh crap okay oh boy jump extra on don't peel it off another patient saved all in the day's work now all we need to do is fire this puppy up and see if all of these vents can give us enough airflow for our high-end hardware that is this not the power button oh wait there's the power button and there's this message from our sponsor zoho1 zoho one brings together sales marketing finance analytics and support in a single unified platform like some kind of business voltron it's amazing try zoho won today for 30 days using the link below wait the script calls for me to show them the internals why did i close up the computer if we're going to show them the internals right away now i just want to make something clear this is actually how it showed up with the side panel no longer adhered to the side of the tower we reached out for comment and they mentioned how disappointed they were with the adhesive failure but bass but they reassured us that the computer should still run fine more on that later i'm not sure that i entirely agree with them the rtx 49d now that the adhesive has come off the side panel seems to be just hanging here anyway there is this bracket that's no way how do i even unpack all the levels of fail here the bracket is screwed on to the graphics card even if it's only adhered to the side panel but instead of being made of something with structural rigidity like steel or even aluminum actually made of acrylic acrylic guys at least use two acrylics also these screws either weren't screwed in all the way or they are not loctite and they've come loose is this as shipped this is as shipped we have done nothing else after the fact other than to test it with labs i think the power button was in place but they moved it because the panel kept falling off so that's why the power button is you know just off to the side there to their credit and their aerospace adhesive does seem to be better than our hot glue aerospace these are terms that get thrown around a lot but don't be fooled they're not particularly meaningful velcro is a fastener developed for use in space but it's just velcro i don't want a velcro side panel now you want a velcro side panel the all velcro pc you do it up like this and it has a pump all right here we go this one kind of just slots in on the one side with fuzzy tape i guess that'll keep it from rattling at least and then screws in on the other side this appears to be the side panel that's actually intended to be removed why is that middle section damaged ah that's not damaged that appears to be welding marks so rather than having these run the entire span they're welded here so that they don't rattle all over the place very hand crafted feel to it what are we looking at here basically top of the line in terms of spec it's a 13 900 non-k probably just so that they can actually cool the bloody thing it's on an itx motherboard the rg strix z790i gaming wi-fi it's got 32 gigs of kingston ddr5 5600 apparently that's been updated to 6000 and they're running a thermal right axp 120-x67 i guess we'll find out if this is enough for core i9 and then this power supply almost certainly is that is an 1100 watt sfx power supply here's some more handcraftedness it looks like the housings on these usb connectors had to be shaved down in order to get them to fit under the front panel that's not in anything but what is is the fact that this pcie bracket on this gpu seems to be oh no the bracket seems stronger than the case the bracket seems fine it's actually the case that's moving around here i'd be lying if i said i didn't love the concept overall though i mean look at it it's not much thicker than the gpu itself the footprint is tiny if you're the kind of person who's got a monitor arm for example and wants to save space on your desk can you 4090 in much less space than that and it's imposing it's really cool i actually have a lot of hope for cooling too all of our fans are aligned so our intake side is all down this side and then they've got these nice wide open vents both at the front here and then all along the back here that are going to allow all that hot air to come out in theory only my gpu was attached to the computer oh and if only my power button was attached now labs took the power button off for some reason i can't fathom the y oh what no hey ploof this power button is still in here did it just break oh yeah it kind of looks like they added a new one yeah this is a completely different power button this seems to just not work anymore well that's probably why well there's your problem thank you for that probably broke off from here although this is cracked too well that might have been frustropping it i'm not sure from no no it dropped itself that's not on us yeah this is a broken power switch it's hot glued in which means i can remove it it just takes a little bit more time and it does seem to be the exact same style of switch that we have so yolo oh man this is one of those products that really has a very diy vibe lots of good ideas here though check this out for example you can get at the screws for the gpu by just sticking your screwdriver through one of these vents lttstore.com did i mention the low back force on the ratchet one two screws holding in this graphics card that's what i said yeah okay there's a lot of glue coming this up the ltt screwdriver is neither a chisel nor pry bar minus media group and it's associated companies take no responsibility for any accidental damage to your screwdriver or personal injury got it no no no no no no no it's bent how did the case get bent ah hey this is probably good enough where's my glue gun at yeah that's an aerospace quantity of regular glue while we're in here there's a couple more things for us to appreciate though they're using a pcie gen 4 riser clearly labeled as such and these look like pretty cool low profile displayport pass-through cables these may be custom made as well looking at how they're both slightly different lengths to account for the different displayport ports that they're plugged into on the card these are there so you can have the gpuio facing down but still access it at the back one curious choice though is that they only run two even though there are three displayport connections on this gpu and they totally had room to put an hdmi cut out here and instead i get no hdmi at all displayport can be adapted to hdmi 2.1 but that's like 20 bucks for an adapter 25 bucks it's not cheap and i already spent this computer we'll talk about that in a bit you guys want to know something what this isn't at an angle you see that yeah okay i think that might be why the screws aren't done up all the way in this so that this can be at an angle to sit flat on the side panel as for why that's at an angle i can't tell if it's intentional or if this was bent in shipping but it does seem to be intentional based on how this screw goes in here like it seems like it's supposed to kind of sit at an angle yes it's definitely intentional because they got to make room for the riser here yep that's why it sits at an angle so cool though but it is really cool maybe we'll talk about performance in a bit here i don't know how to get this power button working i can't find exactly the the spot where it's supposed to sit i think we're just gonna have to kind of hope for the best here all right so imagine if you took like four of these and then you put them in a server rack imagine if you took an xbox and you put it in a server okay yeah i've imagined it now what but it's small and then you can just like pull them out like imagine if you took a ps2 slim and put it in as much as we've dunked on these guys for their hot glue we've given them this feedback and they have expressed an interest in improving this through the use of screws i'm out of glue we have lots we have lots of people so if they can't find a better adhesive which they won't please don't try they're just going to put screws in this panel please do that yes thank you okay go for it oh no that's so crooked so crooked dude dude oh it's not that bad what are you talking about it's so far off okay good enough look you can't even tell from here turn it around look at this it's great just leave the side panel off well no we gotta test it thermal test david no i am putting this side panel on are you gonna put it on straight this time i'm gonna try okay okay please stay on all this can be yours for just was it six thousand dollars fifty seven hundred we did some price comparisons and if you were to pick up a similar machine from the likes of a main gear you're looking at about eight hundred dollars less and if you were to head over to pc part picker you're looking at about say eighteen hundred dollars less don't judge them too harshly though they're very small company and like i said before they're you know looking to improve i would say we've given them a few things that they could work on it's also very unique all those other boutique sis are using like height y60s and stuff like standard cases i'm not saying that costs a thousand dollars to make the case well i don't know with how handmade this is it just might yeah and you look at how many people don't i think we gave and use the cable times or we could add duct tape around last attempt i mean i have another novelty sized glue stick please oh my god we've used that much glue yes with more glue i am quite sure that we will win the day okay all right we ready oh yeah that's the right amount of glue okay oh too far too far yeah oh my god it up we're good [laughter] put around the base too yeah really really you know let's not let this fall off again if your case isn't smoking you must be joking i just gotta hope the 40 90 doesn't get hot enough to get the glue okay i think we've succeeded test success does the power button work oh you pressed it no i didn't you did what it's one of those things where when you plug it in just turns on oh yeah look at that wow if that doesn't intimidate your enemies your porsche will it's a penis extension car i know i own it midlife crisis mobile halo infinite not that my results really matter we had the lab test this thing ahead of time and the cpu maxed out at around 80 degrees which even though it's a non-k actually pretty impressive i guess that's what a completely fresh supply of air that's basically unrestricted is going to do for you and our gpu managed to hit absolute max turbo topping out at 68 69 degrees nice as for loudness i'm going to give it a little bit more time but man especially with the fans facing the other side with this solid chunk of aluminum and all that glue caulking that we've got on it acoustic glue actually does a lot to deaden the sound how am i only getting 70 fps did this game absolutely crank itself by default is that a 4k screen yeah it's a 4k display not only is it quiet but the airflow scheme really does seem to work getting lots of hot air out the front kind of coming out this way pulling cool air in the side and blowing a ton more hot air out the back and actually we're getting rid of a fair bit out the top as well just coming off the cooler for this gpu and it even looks like a radiator can you even hear this computer nope it's freaking quiet you know what else is quiet to our sponsor squarespace you want
