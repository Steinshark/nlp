inside this absolute monster of a computer is amd's threadripper pro 5995wx it packs a redonkulous 64 course 128 threads and a quarter gigabyte of level 3 cache it runs at a whopping 2.7 gigahertz base and turbos up to 4.5 gigahertz just look at it it uses the same zen 3 cores as amd's ryzen 5000 consumer chips just four times as many of them making it absolutely rip tastically fast hello new fastest cpu what the actual hell is this but what would you pay for the privilege of owning the fastest cpu in the world amd figures it's a lot so much that instead of representing it in dollars because the number is far too high we're going to put it this way the 5995 wx costs 4.6 3090 tis or 13 xbox series x's 15 iphone ses or 216 high quality insulated circuit board water bottles from lttstore.com and the wildest part they're not totally out to lunch on their pricing don't get me wrong i don't like it but this cpu came out five months ago and i'm only getting one now which means that someone is buying them all let's talk about who and why and our sponsor origin pc the corsair voyager origin edition features built-in s keys with elgato stream deck software and amd advantage tech with the origin pc edition you can upgrade and customize the look with your favorite designs to learn more at the link below the most obvious reason to shell out for a threadripper pro 5000 is performance we compared it to amd's own epic milan 7763 which also has 64 zen 3 cores and representing high-end consumer cpus we included intel's core i9 12900k and if it doesn't dunk all over both of them amd is going to end up pretty embarrassed here a quick note about our testing we don't have some of these very expensive epic chips to test ourselves so we've got wendell over at level one text to grab some results for us shout out wendell this video wouldn't have been possible without him so go subscribe like his videos buy his merch the team over there is amazing anyway benchmark time in cinebench while single core performance is nothing to write home about compared with the 12 900k the multi-threaded performance is ridiculous and compared to the epic 7763 our threadripper pro shows a 10 improvement on single core performance with a 16 uplift in multi-threaded performance and amd continues to flex those rippling bulging rendering muscles i mean look at this blender render it's competitive with an rtx 3090. when we're talking raw compute i repeat this cpu competes with a gpu now obviously once you start using things like optics to render that's no longer true but the idea of a cpu even approaching a high-end gpu and rendering performance is nuts and while the improvements over the epic 7763 don't seem that huge at first when we zoom in and just compare the zen 3 cpus that 20 improvement in gooseberry becomes much clearer but we don't need to zoom in at all to see the massive 7-zip performance uplift look at how this thing absolutely wipes the floor with its zen 3 server sibling and the 12 900k it's lucky to even show up on the graph for context the 5995wx puts out more mips than some dual socket epic configurations the decompression rate on this thing is confounding literally we looked at other outlets results and we don't really know why our results are so high but clearly threadripper pro is making the most of zen 3's improved memory controller that's the extent of our epic data thanks again wendell the rest of our results will just involve the 12900k and the new threadripper in our mozilla compile well things don't really improve compared to the 12900k only shortening the compile by a minute clearly this compile doesn't take advantage of all the threads we have available but you'd think in creative workloads this thing should slay right paired with two gpus and a threadripper this workstation should make easy work of the adobe sweet puget bench tests which unfortunately actually ended up quite underwhelming in all three programs this eighteen thousand dollar workstation actually performed worse than a twelve nine hundred k and a thirty ninety and this is a great example of how not all workloads are necessarily going to benefit from just throwing more money at the problem looking closely at our results from puget bench for premiere pro we can see that intel just destroys when working on h.264 files thanks to their quick sync which boosts performance but then pretty much everywhere else the threadripper comes out ahead however when we replace the included dual gpus with an rtx 3090 we see our behemoth pull ahead the reason well despite having two gpus in the system when you're editing adobe premiere only uses a single gpu with the second relegated to rendering only so the more powerful single 30 90 with its end bank encoder provides our threadripper pro with more opportunities to stretch its 64 legs wait a second yeah it's faster than a 12 900 k but it's not 10 times faster how does this make any sense how does anybody buy this okay no one sets pricing for their product in a vacuum so the first thing you do is try to understand your customer and since you know that nobody is going to put one of these in a freaking bang for the buck gaming pc because that would be stupid and unnecessary amd can rationalize this pricing by observing that well workstation customers are already used to spending 10 20 even 30 thousand dollars on a single machine i mean this one sent over by supermicro big thanks by the way guys super micro is the only reason we're even able to cover this thing because amd didn't send one is worth about' 000 us dollars and only about a third of that is the cpu itself it also packs closely water cooling 256 gigabytes of 3200 mega transfer per second ecc ddr4 memory three terabytes of high performance kyocera gen four nvme ssds in raid zero and two amd how does this come off i'm sure it comes out somehow two amd radeon pro w6800 workstation gpus i mean the thing's an absolute freaking tank so it kind of makes sense that it would be priced like one the second thing that you do then is you scope out the competition i mean odds are someone else is going to be gunning for a piece of your customer's wallet especially if the wallet is 10 20 30 000 big except that in the workstation pc space that competition has all but dried up apple couldn't even be asked to update the mac pro from its 2019 era xeon w's and if they had intel's closest competitor to threadripper pro which came out about a year ago tops out at a mere 38 course and costs a whopping 4 500 us dollars so this utter lack of other viable options gives amd effectively carte blanche to charge whatever they want but i can hear you thinking hold on a second linus no it doesn't i could just buy 16 core ryzen or core i9 chips for a fraction of the cost i mean you just showed that they're basically as fast for most things anyway yeah that's true enough when the applications that you're focused on are multimedia or gaming but look at the areas where the threadripper pro is a lot faster it's professional applications rendering simulations financial calculations and in a professional setting time is money it really is think about it when the time of the engineer who's sitting at that station is worth let's say 50 an hour for the sake of argument if they spend just 10 minutes a day doing this sitting idle waiting for a slow or an unstable machine it easily costs more than if you had just shelled out for an absolute beast spec top of the line system in the first place and that doesn't even factor in the quality of life improvements for your staff from having good computers and the opportunity cost of delaying whatever project that they've been working on you got to spend money to make money right maybe if we'd given kyle a threadripper pro we'd have our screwdriver launched by now sign up for a notification by the way the launch is coming very soon lttstore.com if anything i would say the price is kind of too low hold on let me explain amd's announced retail price for their top spec 64 core zen 3 server cpu the epic 7773 x is about 8 800 us dollars now that cpu does have some benefits over this one it uses 3dv cache to pack in a whopping 768 megabytes of cash and it's compatible with dual socket motherboards allowing data centers to pack a whopping 128 cores in a single system but individually in spite of all of that cash its performance is actually lower than the threadripper pro 5995wx that means that if amd dropped the price of these workstation chips too much they would risk competing with their own epic lineup which they super do not want to do according to their latest earnings call epic has been largely responsible for the 83 percent growth that they've seen in workstation and server sales in q2 2022. this is exactly what happens when a company has no competition there's no incentive to compete if the only one you're competing with is yourself which also appears to be the reason that enthusiast threadripper like the non-pro one got absolutely scrapped this generation remember when amd justified the socket change from threadripper 2000 to redripper 3000 by saying well we really just need the updated design and more power for the extra cores fair enough we said and they promised to make it up to us by ensuring that trx40 wouldn't be a dead platform with zero upgrade path well i'm still waiting amd i know it's a champagne problem but it's very obvious that this was a business decision rather than an engineering decision because the chips freaking exist here's some guy in taiwan benchmarking the 5990 non-wx presumably it has some drawbacks like fewer pcie lanes a lower system memory limit and no official support for ecc but it's clearly functioning well enough to overclock the snot out of it and break world records rent aside by the way if you must overclock high spec chips thankfully amd offers that on the workstation threadripper pro lineup or do they amd's website says that the 5995wx is not unlocked for overclocking but then in a june blog post they state that it will support cpu and memory overclocking but the boards that are currently on the market don't allow for it but then dr ian cuttress received an asrock board that allowed him to crank the cpu to a tdp of 400 watts so it seems like overclocking is on the table which means we might see some pretty wild benchmark results out of this chip in the future especially if it means we can overcome the default boost behavior while amd reports a 4.5 gigahertz maximum boost they are only talking about a single core which on a 64 core chip is kind of like saying that your car goes 350 miles an hour but only if like most of it is over here and the wheel is rolling down the road you know what i mean so in our benchmarks we noticed that once we started running a load on more than just one core our boost was limited to just 4 gigahertz and then quickly declined to 3.1 as we loaded up more cores i can only imagine how fast and how hot this thing will run with every core pegged at 4.5 gigahertz for now though we'll have to sit and wait maybe watch some exclusive behind-the-scenes content on floatplane to pass the time now i know that you high-end desktop nerds are chomping at the bit for something anything to fill the void in this ever-shrinking product segment in between workstation and consumer desktop and i'm with you usually i'd love to have something like this in my rig but it's just massive overkill and it costs way too much and frankly it's a little late to the party i'm going to do something i don't do that often i'm going to say guys just wait if the rumors are to be believed the generation of cpus coming at the end of this year from both amd and from intel are going to bring some massive improvements and since we still don't know when this threadripper pro chip is gonna hit retail it might just be better to
