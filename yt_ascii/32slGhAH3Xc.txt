this is the just announced samsung galaxy z flip 5 and when you first look at it it doesn't make any sense compared to samsung's very highest end phones which can be had for like the same price now every camera is smaller and less capable you can expect your battery to take longer to charge and deplete about 20 faster there's less room for calling so the chip won't perform as well and yeah this is more compact it folds right well not really i mean it is shorter but it is also thicker so the actual volume being taken up is about the same and yet even with all of this why am i drawn to the z-flip 5 so much why is it that my curiosity was so sparked when i saw that first one or that i very nearly switched over to it when i tested the z-flip 4 last year and that now we have the five i've decided that i'm actually going to try and use this thing on a day-to-day basis well let's start with what's new the storage has doubled from 128 gigabytes to 256. although the price has also gone up too so that's not really a perk the build though is a win it's thinner for starters about two millimeters thinner when folded up but the best part of this is how they've achieved that thinness it's a new hinge one that for the very first time on a samsung flip can praise the lord close without a gap well there's a tiny little hole here but it's basically gapless and this big deal because it's not just that it looks better and it's a less weird shape and it takes up less space but it also creates less room for rogue particles and pocket dust to just find their way inside which trust me use any folding phone for a period of time is a problem and it's probably also one of the main causes of you just ending up with a scuffed inner screen no matter how careful you think you're being speaking of which this inner screen is now 25 more resistant to scratches and the outer body is protected by armor aluminum and gorilla glass victus 2 which i'm told has the strength of ceramic which is pretty cool considering that ceramic has long been reserved for the highest end luxury phones because of its scratch resistance the only thing i don't like and this has kind of been an ongoing pet peeve of mine is that when you open the phone it doesn't snap into that fully open position it's still just like a tiny bit flaccid which also means a tiny bit bent they really should make it so that opening it feels just as tactile and satisfying as closing it because that is fun but then the screen is i would say not just a big but the biggest jump since the very first flip specifically this cover screen i mean just compared to samsung's last phone it is 278 bigger it now looks like a folder and it can do a lot more used to be able to have a peek at your notifications check your calendar and make a quick voice recording but we're talking like 10 20 of the overall functionality of the phone now i'd call it 50. there's 13 different widgets available at launch and they say there's more on their way and essentially each one is its own home screen you swipe between them and if you want to move quickly you pinch out and you pick the one you want plus you can swipe to the left to check your notifications and down to fiddle with quick settings it's all very smooth and slick for what is effectively a secondary custom operating system on the same phone and the other thing that i'm noticing about the way this whole thing is being framed is that it's all about the personality samsung's not really trying to pitch this front screen as a way to quickly check things it's more as a tool for self-expression and that it achieves i actually cannot believe how much you can customize it everything from the battery percentage indicator to how to display notifications to the exact shade of color that you want and in what way it fades to another color you could absolutely lose yourself in it and i plan to do exactly that side note you can also see how much samsung is pushing this whole fashion angle here with the sheer number of cases being offered including these rather fancy smart ones that when applied will sync the wallpaper on your phone and even your galaxy watch to match plus you can now use apps on the front not all apps which samsung could have allowed you to do but i guess they want you to only use the apps that have been specifically optimized to make the most of this strange folder-like shape so there's only like 10 at launch the screen is now big enough though to get a full qwerty keyboard on which means you can also message it's a little fiddly but completely usable with one hand which is a luxury that i almost forgotten was even possible okay there's a couple of things that i do don't like not you i'm so sorry milo's been replaced by his chunkier london counterparts there's still a crease on this main display they say it's improved but it's still very noticeable and i just think doesn't exactly scream hey i'm a market leading fifth generation product and then while this inner panel is a 120 hertz display that can ramp its refresh rate all the way down to one hertz the cover screen which is my other gripe is locked at 60. and so what this means is that even when you're trying to use it in this super low power always on state this screen is refreshing like 60 times more than it needs to so it wastes battery there's an upgraded chip the snapdragon 8 gen 2 4 galaxy which is basically the same snapdragon chip you see in all top end android phones this year but with a little boost to how fast it runs i'm actually quite excited about this not because the phone necessarily needs it more because these flip phones feel so perfect for game emulation which i plan to do a lot of and is super demanding and then this chip also has a slightly tweaked image signal processor which allows the phone to take the data from the camera and process it in a way that samsung likes and that is the final key upgrade the cameras not so much in terms of hardware i mean there's a new lens that's a little bit clearer and reduces sunflowers but it's more the software you can double tap the power button to bring it up immediately you've got new portrait modes and better quality portrait modes you can mess around with zoom when you're on the cover i couldn't do that before plus you've just got more space to see yourself and frame your shot properly so while the z-flip 5 might not feel as ambitious as motorola's razer 40 ultra and its edge to edge cover screen or the crease-free folding design of oppo's n2 flip at the same time you can't say samsung's resting on their laurels doing nothing this is a big upgrade and this company is still widely regarded as having the best foldable software with this launching on android 13l the very latest with a promise of four full years of major android updates and the most seamless integration of foldable features into third-party apps like just for example this thing has a camera feature that tracks your face to always keep you in the middle which is already cool for making like an instagram reel but then the feature can factor in when you fold the phone adapt around it so that you can still see yourself in the top half and then even work natively within these other apps like instagram so you can even go live using it so you have a level of continuity here that others are still catching up with oh yeah and the flex mode is updated so when you fold up an app that supports it everything adapts so that you can control your entire phone using just the lower half all of this stuff is cool it makes the most of what the phone is but none of it really explains why the phone even exists in the first place why is it that people keep paying this premium to compromise on specs for a phone that takes up basically the same volume according to samsung's 70 of the customers buying foldable phones are choosing this flip style over the technically higher end fold style are they crazy well no but what is crazy is that we overtook samsung and subscribers a long time ago and we're now this close to overtaking apple so this hub to the channel would be it's ambitious quite proud of though i would say there's five key things that make this flip as surprisingly appealing as it is the first and the most obvious is the style i'm not gonna lie to you this is fun flicking it open for something important snapping it shut to end a call there's a big part of it that feels almost toy like and it's such a unique prospect that if you like it there's a good chance you're gonna love it and if you love it you're gonna be willing to overlook a lot of other things to make it work and thankfully while the cameras are one of those things that you will have to forgive because there's no way you can fit a modern large camera sensor into the depth of one of these halves they do also benefit from the ability to fold in that you can use the same set of pretty good cameras for both the rear and the front so if we say that the galaxy s23 ultra has a 10 out of 10 camera system on the rear then its selfie camera is about a five whereas with the z flip you're getting a seven on both with full 4k 60 frames per second video plus the ability to use the bass as a sort of baked in stand to prop the phone up at whatever angle you want but it's the mindfulness that this phone can give you that is what really interests me the fact that you can just keep the phone folded up and you know that you're reachable but still distance from your distractions is for me a game changer and so i really like that here even though the cover screen is now more capable and can do a lot of technically full screen phone things samsung's done this with an understanding that the objective is not just to make the front screen like the inner screen because i mean if they're the same thing then what would be the point in unfolding it so instead what you can do here is decide on the inside which apps you want to allow yourself access to on the outside this is brilliant so the way i'm going to set mine up for example is to allow maps and whatsapp and anything i might need but keep away anything i might want as you know a lot of people like to have two separate phones one for work one for pleasure this one flip phone is kind of like having both of those but folded into one it creates this really distinct separation between a device that is simple and functional and not distracting when folded up to advice that when you finish your work and you just want to chill out it's expansive and enjoyable and indulgent it makes it feel like a window into your social medias and your connected life without being a door that you can just stroll through and get lost in before you've realized what you're doing plus i actually like the fact that when someone calls while you're in this folded position it'll automatically go to loudspeaker which really suits this whole hands-off vibe and that if you want to silence it you don't even need to pick the phone up if you just place your hand on top kind of like suffocating it the battery also benefits from this being a flip phone i mean it sounds bad on the face of it this is a 3 700 million power cell in a market full of phones packing five thousand but thanks to efficiency improvements you can get an extra hour versus last year's flip 4 and if you are actually planning to use a good mix of both the inner screen and the outer screen then because the outer screen is so small you'll save a lot of battery there and finally there is the compactness which as i've already said i think is a little overrated i mean the volume difference between this and say this is negligible but there is one distinct benefit to being short and stubby like this women's clothing it's anyone i met my fiance a few years ago that it dawned on me just how little depth there is in women's jeans and women's workout leggings so it fixes that let me know if you have any burning questions about this phone i'll answer as many as i can and i will catch you in the next one
