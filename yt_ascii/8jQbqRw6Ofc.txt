this is the oneplus 60 and while it's been one of the more heavily leaked phones of 2018 there are actually a few interesting surprises here and so we are here at the oneplus sixty production line where i'm going to show you not just how the phone is made but also some of the secrets hidden inside plus i can physically show you why the headphone jack was removed so production of the 60 starts with something called the mid frame the middle layer of the phone and one of the first components that is fitted is the display which actually comes pre fitted with all the display connectors needed they use these behemoths machines to scan the frame and lay glue to exactly the right places and then these cages to press them right up against the screens for four hours each and then what surprised me was that every device is tested there and then they make sure the screen is on securely there's color calibration and checking for white or black spots and they even put each phone under a microscope to check the edges and to be honest there's a lot more to this whole production process than initially meets the eye every single worker has to wear this wrist strap which is plugged into the worktop and it keeps them grounded and prevents static shocks you'll notice there are machines dedicated to checking the oneplus 60 at every single stage and deciding if any given phone is a veil or if it's a pass and humidifiers which force dust to settle on the floor and not on the phones then you've got the camera module in fact the same dual camera set of a scene on the oneplus six the new and improved battery and the mirror black finish which is placed on by machine and then pressed against the mid frame just to ensure a good seal i think the thing that surprised me the most about this entire factory was just how many machines there were and how specialized they were for such minut tasks the other really interesting thing was that about half of the factory floor was dedicated to testing the phone's sixties would be wobbled around in front of this x to make sure of camera stabilization works phones were flipped around in all directions to test the gyro sensors and that even created artificial environments to test camera distortion of all parts of this process to be done by machine you'd really think that packaging would be the one but most of it is actually done by hand this was maybe the most satisfying part of the entire thing to watch and these guys had clearly done it a thousand times before i'd got there and they had the speed you need as one-plus would say but also the precision of a machine really crazy to see it in action once the contents were all in they'd add this little sleeve around the box and then a machine loosely covers it in film and pushes it inside what i can only assume is some sort of heater after which they emerge finished products and ready for shipment and on that note well let's crack one open so i managed to get one device put aside for me and the glue was already loosened here so i could pretty much just pull the back off and take a look inside the first thing to do here is to pull off the connections and remove the daughterboard which is a name for any board that extends an existing circuit and you'll see it has this big hole in it which is where the vibration motor sits i then took out the usbc connection which goes underneath the battery and then this is where it gets interesting the oneplus 60 is using a second generation optical in display fingerprint scanner and so if we take out the module you'll be able to see the camera by which it works this tiny sensor has a super short focal length so that it can detect the ridges of your fingers when you place them on the display and so what's really cool is that now that we've removed this part you can see through the phone where the camera previously was you've now got a transparent circle you could turn on a flashlight shine it into the back of the phone and see it coming through from the screen on the front and speaking of the screen the 1 plus 60 is going to be one of the first if not the first devices with gorilla glass 6 fitted which gives 2 times better drop resistance than gorillaz 5 there are a couple more things to point out here if we delve a little further we've got the dual cameras up top and the new larger 3,700 million power battery which is up from 3300 on the 6 and this leads us to the question of the headphone jack the reason it isn't here is a space limitation if you look at the inside of the one plus six the headphone jack takes up a fair chunk of room and now with this larger battery and the industry fingerprint scanner to worry about that just isn't space unless they made the phone thicker i'd be curious to know your opinions on this decision because personally i'm not a massive fan i'm someone who sometimes uses the headphone jack and when you factor in that this new fingerprint scanner is only about half the speed of the original one on the 1 plus 6 i'm not sold on the compromise but then again you could argue that having a scanner on the front saves time spent moving fingers so yeah let me know ii think i've got a pretty massive one plus 60 video dropping tomorrow so if you want already subscribed it'd be amazing if you could smash that button and with that being said i'll catch you in the next one [music]
