hey what's up mkbhd here okay so windows xp was great then windows vista was not great but then windows 7 was great then windows 8 with the tiles not great windows 10 great and now windows 11 no pressure microsoft but this is your chance to break that cycle so today we got a windows 11 reveal the newest next version of windows coming as a free upgrade this holiday season to a pc near you now it's funny a lot of you probably know me as a mac user most of the time just because i've used a lot of macs here at the studio but that's not actually because of mac os i switched to mac os for the most part at work because of an app because of final cut pro so i'm perfectly happy to spend time in windows all the time and so watching their unveiling event today actually felt more compelled to react to this windows unveiling than anything they've done over in apple camp lately in the desktop stuff at the end of the day though it's just an operating system and you're gonna have to run apps on it so we'll get to the app situation in a minute but there's plenty of interesting stuff now that they're doing here in windows 11. so first of all the whole aesthetic is refreshed pretty dramatically so we got this new design that i would describe as very glassy like there's a lot of shininess and transparency and glassy translucent elements things happening through here as much as it's probably cringe to say it it kind of does remind me a little bit of the hype around windows vista when we had that super flat windows xp and then vista was all this glass but of course now it's much brighter and lighter and i'm just gonna stop mentioning vista now there is a new start menu in windows 11 which might make you a little nervous if you're familiar with them messing with the start button and the start menu in the past but it's pretty good it's actually centered now by default to keep with the theme that windows 11 should be the center of your ecosystem but you can always move it back over to the left if you want but yeah it has the glassy look it also now has suggestions for apps and documents to open that you recently used makes a lot of sense here and then similar to how on android you could swipe over to see a google discover page or on ios how you could swipe over to see a bunch of widgets with information or even on the mac you could do this now on windows 11 you can swipe over and you get a pane of widgets with information customized by ai so it's this glassy pullover and i assume it'll get better over time as it learns you but it has some level of customization and so you can see things like weather and news stories and social posts all over here and you can fully swipe over to go full screen with this if you want to just live here for a little bit it's pretty cool then here's an interesting no doubt pandemic inspired feature microsoft teams is now built into windows natively now okay here's the thing so microsoft teams i get it it's their communication app they want to use it as much as possible but also microsoft owns skype and they bought skype for 8.5 billion dollars so when i when i think of what microsoft could do to like make communication easier in windows that's just what came to my head but you know they're trying to promote teams and make it the default messaging app and push it more among regular people so the demos they were showing in this event were just people having chat conversations with friends and family and just hopping on casual video calls and microsoft teams now i don't know about you but i've always thought of teams as a business app like a corporate video conferencing app because that's the only thing i've actually used it for it's literally called teams so i kind of wonder if building it into windows will actually have the intended effect like it's coming out during the holiday season which is in a couple more months so again we'll probably want to be mostly done with video calls by then but even for casual video calls like zoom definitely broke through from the enterprise to like being the default video calling app for the world microsoft like i said owns skype but also now facetime from this recent ios update will allow you to send links to people on android phones and and web devices and windows users can jump on facetimes now so yeah i don't know if microsoft teams is going to be that thing that hard hitting standard default but we'll see i do love though the new window management controls this is something windows has been ahead on for a while and they're still great at now in windows 11 you hover over the maximize button i believe and you get all these new multi-window snap presets super dope for people who work with multiple windows open all the time like i do and also joanna stern has an awesome exclusive piece over on the wall street journal right now that posted today you should definitely read it i'll link it below and in that she mentions there will be a windows like memorization basically with external displays now so if you've ever had an external display with a windows laptop in the past it's kind of annoying when you have a bunch of stuff nicely laid out on that monitor and then you unplug it and things all just appear on your laptop not anymore now they will memorize their location on that monitor when you unplug the monitor they'll all minimize and when you plug that monitor back in they'll all go back to where they were that's pretty dope but the biggest new thing the biggest most headline-worthy new feature from windows 11 that caught my eye the most has to do with apps so so this is the headline ready this is what can be printed up at the top super simply android apps can now run natively in windows 11. so right off the bat that is pretty cool they're showing it's compatible with the window management controls and it can potentially give you access to a whole new suite of millions of apps that we all know and love working perfectly on the desktop or the laptop or the two in one that you carry whatever runs windows you got to bring the most popular apps to windows to get people to use windows right but there are some more details behind that super simple headline so this is made possible through a collaboration actually between microsoft and amazon so actually what's going on here is it's loading up the amazon app store for android apps into the microsoft windows app store and this is all going to be run through intel bridge technology so again from joanna's piece she notes that you'll be able to search through the windows app store like normal and when you find an android app in there and you click to download and install it you will have to be signed in to an amazon account because it's coming from the amazon app store and actually the first time you ever do this it'll have you download and install the amazon app store app for windows which it's going to haul it'll it's just the first time but it'll work and then from there you'll be able to download all these amazon app store apps it's not a hundred percent overlap with the google play store from my experience it's pretty close but it's the amazon android app store loaded up into the windows app store that makes sense so maybe the headline should really read android apps that are in the amazon app store will work natively kind of on windows 11 as long as you have a microsoft and amazon account basically it just feels like a super official side load it doesn't quite feel native but they'll try to make it feel as native as possible the move to do this by the way makes perfect sense like meet the people where you want them to be with their apps that they already like it's the same reason you can run android apps on a chromebook and you can run ios apps on a mac it doesn't mean they're going to be good like there's a bunch of bad examples of them not really working great they might suck for non-touch input they might just have functions that are broken or just don't work as well when they're on a computer versus when they're actually on a mobile device so it's maybe the most convoluted version of it all but at the end of the day you can say you offer android apps on windows sure so those are all the big new changes the huge bullet points windows 11 is looking fresh and clean with this new aesthetic and i for one am definitely on board with that part it feels modern and there's lots of other behind the scenes and under the hood changes as well i'm sure it's 64-bit only for one and there's also a couple other more interesting new system requirements so there's a compatibility tool that people can use now to check if their pc they currently have will work with windows 11 but i think we'll learn a lot more as the betas start rolling out people start using them about graphics improvements and security and privacy and optimizations and all that fun stuff but in the meantime that's windows 11. so not bad i'm impressed i think they might have just broken the cycle the on off i don't want to jinx it but i kind of like this update we'll see let me know what you think in the comments section below if you have any strong thoughts on the new design or any of the stuff we've talked about here let me know if you also actually care about running android apps on windows i'd be super curious thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
