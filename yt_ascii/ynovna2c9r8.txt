hello everybody i am back here with richard rowland one more episode of our universal history series which has been really bringing up so many positive comments people are excited about it so it's fun for us because we are so excited about universal history that we're both surprised and overjoyed to see that people are following us down this rabbit hole and so today is going to be our last episode on ethiopia i know it's we've been talking about ethiopia a lot but it is so relevant to the situation of kind of the beginning and the end joining together and all this kind of eschatological vision and so today we're going to look at ethiopian several ethiopian practices and how they kind of manifest the two aspects of ethiopia one which is this idea of the container or the ark and then the other aspect is the idea of the edge and the extreme and how all these kind of traditions come together to to manifest a very specific and particular particular version of orthodox christianity so richard i hope you're ready for this because i'm excited [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [music] i am i'm also excited and yes i'm ready i've been reading i think i told you this i've been i've been working my way through like an 800 page ethiopian the their cinexarium their geographical text i haven't made it quite all the way through this week but i've read i've read just a lot of pagiography and it's all sort of bouncing around on my head so i'm i'm ready all right and we're deeply confident i'll let you throw the ball in there and start the conversation and and we'll we'll go along on it yeah you discovered i think you're probably the only person in the world that i know that has read like i know about the nine saints but i've never heard of this more extensive kind of hagiography ethiopian hagiography yeah well they have a in in the orthodox church we call it the cinexarion and i think the word that they use from the coptic tradition is the cenexaryum but it's the same same word same thing right which is basically just like the daily commemorations the the daily lives of the saints and so they have they have a book like that very much like we do maybe equivalent to like the the western like the roman martyrology or something like that although i don't fully i would just confess like i don't fully understand how how like that book that set of liturgical books actually works in in the latin tradition so you know please don't add me or actually at me and and tell me why i'm wrong but anyway so what i wanted to start with the reason i'm talking about hagiography other than the fact that it's just something i'm deeply interested in and it's one of the main let's say source materials for legendary history or universal history and certainly the most popular genre of literature in the middle ages last time we talked and we kind of ended on this note in our in our previous video that this about the the fact that the saints uphold the world now i believe that to be literally true it's like you know i do believe that there are people right now in this world praying for us that are that are holding back the judgment of god that are you know and and that you know whose prayers we're we're joining we're participating in especially in the in the liturgy but i also think that this this saying the saints uphold the world provides a very important interpretive key or symbolic key for understanding the way that a given principality manifests itself so something we talked about i think it was last time is is this idea that the way that the thing the thing that sort of symbolically ties stuff together is always going to be a person it's like you've got everything in the cosmos sort of moving towards personhood and you have and and you have so you have the way that a the way that a principality manifests itself that it's going to be most strongly tied together is going to be in in a person usually in some kind of a a cult a cultus of veneration and i don't mean like guys with dark hoods around pentagrams like cult in the like the anthropological sense people where where cultures you know which is a latin word that means you know worship or veneration it's that's the that's the root of our word culture right so the way that you have a culture is that you have you have a culture of a veneration around a common point and the common point is usually a person yeah and it's really important because we we have a kind of neopl we have a kind of platonic under you know strata in our understanding and we tend to think of ideas or these abstract principles as being the thing which binds us together but in reality in terms of human human reality things are actually bound together by people you know remembering and celebrating our common ancestors our heroes our politicians our saints this is actually the man in which we recognize unity much more than you know the idea of liberty or freedom or this these kind of revolutionary abstract idea ideals we we remember napoleon and you know the french remember napoleon and unite themselves under napoleon much more than you know fraternity equality you know and freedom whatever in english you say it however you say it yeah and and to talk about that period for a moment you know because you had the american revolution the french revolution all happening right there at the same time and one of the things that they would do especially in the iconography of that time and you know over the same course of maybe the next 50 years as they start building buildings and painting murals and things like this is that they do really try to to depict the like the let's say the genius of a particular country you know liberty equality fraternity or or uh victory was a really important one at that period and then you know like colombia as this you know in the new world like colombia as the as like the goddess of the new world and there's a lot of art especially like in a if you go to like the united states capitol building or some of our other um yeah shrines yeah i was trying to think of a word that wasn't that but that's the right word if you go there you'll see you'll see these figures depicted you know these female figures often like nude or semi nude you know depicted in the same way as as greco-roman uh greco-roman gods and the interesting thing is that this was this was a conscious attempt to tie back to greco-roman civilization and personify these things these abstract ideas as gods and goddesses and the interesting thing is that it did not work nobody in the popular imagination like in the popular imagination if you said what's the personification of america most people who instantly go to george washington yeah you know like most most people most of the time and i'm not trying to make like it's it's stupid that you know like like there's a whole political thing right now about whether or not that's a good thing but i'm not trying to make a statement about that i'm just saying like most people most of the time if i show you george washington's pick your picture on a one dollar bill like that's that's the most that's the most immediately recognizable icon so the interesting thing is that is that we tried to create these symbols artificially and that did not work yeah the exception i would say lady liberty like the statue of liberty because it's so big yes i think that that right it was able to kind of imprint itself on on the imagination and act as almost like a like a kind of goddess figure for america that's as close as you get yeah but it is it is not the it's not the rule it really is the only one all the other figures are our people right if i showed most people like a picture of the the goddess victory you know nike you know and was like who's this people don't know even though she's on the the the ceiling of the rotunda at the u.s capitol building so so this is so this this is all to say the symbolism of a nation with a symbol being understood as something that holds two realities together rests most fully in its saints and that includes those nations which are not overtly christian like the united states for instance but which still have what a mulch and what amounts to a cult of veneration and a hagia hagiographical tradition and i'm just gonna say a quick thing again about like abraham lincoln because that got a lot of people very excited or very salty last time it's funny because i saw you know the clip and i'm sure you're too seasoned of a youtuber to go and like read the comments on your own videos but i went down and looked at the comments on the clip of the stuff that we were saying about lincoln and one guy was like oh typical americans you know they're they're they're only focused on you know what happens to their own country and i was like dude this is from a video about ethiopia like come on come on pedro's canadian come on but anyway but but the i just want to i just want to like i want to give an easy example since most of our viewers are americans so we can understand that actually we do this and then we'll go and we'll talk about ethiopia so so this is gonna this this idea of a cult of veneration a hagiographical tradition this includes both biography but it also includes legendary material right george washington chopping down his father's cherry tree or the legend of honest abe are just as important maybe more so than anything either of those men did which is historically verifiable that's super important to understand because it participates not only in the identity of george washington but like you said that legend as its frame becomes a kind of a frame for how americans perceive themselves right right we're honest we're forthright we sort of you know the the way that we want to think about ourselves whether or not we live up to this right the way that we want to think about ourselves is that we're honest we're forthright we sort of do the right thing no matter what the cost is right so when lincoln died his body was moved or you could say his relics were translated across the country to be to be buried i think in springfield and there was at every stop along the way there people came on pilgrimage to see and to venerate his his body this is very religious thing when his body reached you know the the there they're in now where he's buried in illinois i think it's illinois i i've actually been there a couple of times but i was i was pretty young so my family went on essentially a pilgrimage to the tomb of abraham lincoln my dad it was really into lincoln when i was a kid i read this massive multi-volume biography of lincoln's life and that was one of the things that was you know like i was encouraged to read as a young person and and like and i want to make it clear like i'm not really down on lincoln or you know i and a certain part of me like i don't feel like this is necessarily like a huge problem this is just the way that this is the way that america is like if you want you got to understand like this is part of our our identity but so this is you'll just get a kick out of this okay so there at at lincoln's tube there's a large copper as in the penny bust so i don't i'm i'm just assuming you know things about american money so lincoln is on that one is on our penny our one cent piece right he's on our penny we have debt presidents on all of our money lincoln's on the penny and he's on the five dollar bill and and so there's a a massive copper bust made of lincoln's head and the whole thing is tarnished except for the nose and the nose is bright and shiny why because people rub it because as you enter the tomb of lincoln you are supposed to reach up and rub the nose wow for good luck yeah it reminds me of that statue of saint peter at the vatican there's a statue of saint peter where his foot is almost completely worn down because people walk in and everybody rubs the foot yes so so it's like it's like you're here's a here's a statue of lincoln i'm going to venerate it for a blessing and then i'm going to enter his tomb right so that i think it's mostly to understand like you said right we're not we're neither criticizing or celebrating this we're just saying that this is how it works exactly this is actually how how any identity kind of holds together through these act of celebrating and venerating and remembering the the those that that were that marks our history marked our story and also participated in our unity so so this is just how it works and so it can help americans understand like you said why religious practices look the way they do because they're they're not just they're more than religious in a strict sense they're just the way that reality reality lays itself out to quote my my friend jonathan pajot it's not arbitrary no it's not i'm sorry this idea like of having even the picture of the president in all official buildings like they i don't know if they do it but i know they did it they did it before you know this kind of idea of having the image of the emperor the image of the king or the image you know in all these public spaces to mark his presence and as you enter you kind of see who the principality is that's at this moment holding all this together is something which is which is very religious and it's in the way i once i once organized a an event at a protestant very like reformed baptist protestant seminary and when you get there outside the building that we're in they have this this this area called martyrs walk and you walk along and it's got the names of all of the you know these different baptist missionaries who have been killed doing overseas missions but then you go inside and you go inside and the the main auditorium there is wall to wall with the pictures of each president and dean that the seminary has ever had in its you know history and so it's you you walk in you know there's like names of the martyrs along the outside you go in and the room is full of icons i was i was i was with a a friend i was an orthodox at the time but i was with a friend who was and i he and i just sort of looked at each other and grinned a little bit and he said and they say protestants don't have icons anyway and again like like my point is i'm not trying to keep any kind of criticism on anyone about this i'm just trying to say like this is this is the way that things cohere this is the way that things hold together so with with that being said the best way that we can understand the symbolism of ethiopia i think is by reading the lies of the ethiopian saints and if we do eventually i know a lot of people want to do like ireland and celtic stuff and if we do that then then we'll we'll eventually do the same thing there because when we do this we're going to see and notice certain patterns which are going to manifest themselves over and over again in ethiopian hagiography and like if you read a a large amount of ethiopian hagiography what you're going to see is a lot of the stuff is exactly what you would expect from from any christian hagiography pretty much anywhere right it's the same religion yeah same jesus you know holiness is not radically different in ethiopia than it is other places but then if you're attentive you'll also notice that there are certain things certain patterns which might be present other places in very small amounts yeah but which are central to the ethiopian experience of holiness so that's what i want to start start out by looking at today all right so the first one of these which should be surprising to absolutely no one is the prominence of the idea of the ferta sakura the ferta sacra which means the the holy theft or the theft of the sacred right so the story usually goes something like this you have a holy man who dies before he dies he leaves instructions to his disciples that he's supposed to be buried in a certain place and then for whatever reason often because there's a ruler who has other plans in mind his orders are not followed because they're not followed various calamities ensue until someone steals the body and buries it in the appropriate place and then the calamities stop so the idea is the saint is was actually willing you know desired the stuff to take place in some cases what they actually do is they they put an empty they they they make a replica coffin and they switch them and they leave the empty coffin in place of their original and they they they take the original and they they bury it wherever the saint wanted it buried sometimes there's a trick in in the in the translation yeah yes yeah yeah you know and that's i mean it's obviously most people will right away see that this is just a a kind of playing out of the original right taking of the arc and then now it's it's as if like you when your foundational pattern has a certain form then if you fractally play itself out through your society like it it's inevitable because that's what you're looking at as your model and as your first memory you could say and then it just plays itself out through through through the history so it's very fascinating and you do you do find this other sort of thing you know i've never encountered it i've been reading a really massive collection of welsh hagiography recently like this is just like if you could see my desk right now there are just stacks of printed out pages because none of this stuff is published but you can still find it online um i actually got a new book of oh yeah right here i just i just got a new book of of of the irish things irish hagiography volume eight the volume two this one's one two sorry yeah i ate there yeah there's a lot though there's a lot yeah there's a lot a lot of these saints are really wonderful nobody's heard of them but anyway so so i've never encountered the fur to sakura thing in in really almost any lives of irish saints you do find it a little bit in in byzantine hagiography two examples that i can think of off the top of my head there there might be a couple of others though again it's not very common one would be the translation one of the translations of the relish of saint nicholas which are stolen but then because they're stolen they're able to be saved from the turks just like a few days later and and so st nicholas appears in a dream to basically tell people listen it's okay like this is this is how my relics are being preserved another example and every year every year like when we come across this and we read this with our kids from the saxarian kids always ask me questions about it because it seems so obviously wrong to their little minds and that is the placing of the robe of the mother of god at the at her church in black carinae in constantinople do you know the story no i don't so essentially the story is that her her robe was kept by one of her maidservants who was not a christian was she was a jew after her death i think this is commemorated in july maybe on like july the 2nd but it might be a little bit later in the month i forget now but and and so it's passed on from one woman to another and they have this tradition that the woman in the family that holds it has to be a she has to be a virgin and so it comes to this woman who's like the last one in the lineage there's no one after her to take the the keeping of this of this robe which even though she's she's a jew she's not a christian but like the the road works so many miracles that people are always coming to our house to be healed and all this different stuff and then one day these these two byzantine nobles who were passing by passing through on their way back from a pilgrimage to the holy land like they're they they hear all these miracles happening and so they go there and it's divinely revealed to them that this is the robe of the mother of god and and so they're they they sort of like debate what do we do about this what do we do about this and and eventually and it sort of seems that this there's like divine sanction for what they do they make a replica coffer like reliquary and they switch them out and they bring the robe to constantinople and place it in the very famous church of the mother of god at placaroni so that's a that's a clear example of what you're saying that's a crazy story and of course it should be less crazy if we understand the the association of the mother of god with the ark of the covenant right but so that's that's a really clear example of the the ferta sakura so that that sort of thing is i would say rare in byzantine hagiography at least what from what i've read of it it's very common in the ethiopian high geography i would say it's one of the defining one of the defining patterns another one would be and this is really interesting maybe something to mention and i'm not sure that i like fully understand the symbolic resonance here but one of the interesting things that i've noticed is that in ethiopian hagiography the focus on relics always tends to be on the whole body whereas you know in like other other christian cultures like relics could be like a little piece or like a hand you know like the left hand of mary magdalene or the head of john the baptist etc but in in in ethiopian practice it really does seem to be the whole body in fact there's an example of one saying i can't remember his name now but like at some point his left leg just fell off and people they just sort of like tossed it like it was very very strange like like so it's like there's this focus on the the whole body and relics really mean just the body not so for instance this is to be con the contrast to this would be in like the celtic tradition where the relics of a saint can mean their bones but they're just as likely to mean things like a bell or an altar or a vestment or something like some holy object yeah that belonged to the saint so it's it's a it's just kind of a different approach and then there's the something called the kidan and this is in essentially every single ethiopian hagiography that i've read at the end there will be akiran and the kidan ethiopian people like i'm probably saying the word wrong i actually i think i'm saying it right in this case but but tell me if i'm if i'm not so the kidan is a is a pact between the holy person and god that is made before their death and again there is very interestingly something like this and saint maximus the confessor's i'm looking to see if i have the book but it's over there i say maximus the confessor's life of the virgin there's actually a moment like this like right before her death she she asks you know her son that that he would honor her intercessions for those who call upon her name right and so but but but this sort of thing like this sort of comment doesn't show up very often in byzantine's saint line saints lives but it's it's in every single ethiopian saints life essentially and basically it is what will happen is that either christ himself or sometimes the virgin mary or saint michael the archangel will come to the holy person shortly before their death and make a promise that god will answer the prayers and come to the aid of those who observe the saints memory like the annual commemoration of the saints life although some saints were actually commemorated like monthly which is apparently i mean can you imagine yeah and so you know one example says whoever invokes your name whether inside or outside in a desert or wilderness on every path in his walking or his sitting in all of his suffering i will heed his prayer and demand immediately so this is this is like a it's a promise to reassure the people who who venerate the saint that their prayers are going to be heard so this is this is another one of the really interesting one of the really interesting patterns and if you think back to all the stuff that's going on with with solomon and his ethiopian son you know you've got like the theft of the ark but then also you know solomon says well you stole the ark and nobody died so this must be from god so the idea is that it's a theft which is kind of an ambiguous thing but then it's something that something that god seemed to have willed yeah and there's also there's also something at least in the the image of the theft of the ark there and even in this image of the theft of the the vestment of the mother of god of her robe there's something there is a pattern in like that between identities you could say that sometimes the the relationship or the translation between identities happens through tricks because it's not within it's not within an identity and so you can see that obviously in the story of jacob quite often you know with with laban and then you can also see it with moses and the pharaoh there's all these these stories especially the old testament of when you're in the stranger's land sometimes the the interaction with the stranger will happen through a kind of trick yeah and so you see that in the story and it's interesting that you mentioned for example that the the the taking one of the only swords in the byzantine tradition is the taking of the robe of the virgin and that this is very much related to the idea of the ark itself you know as this container as this kind of outer shell it's kind of outer feminine shell yeah so it's interesting to see that that these patterns actually kind of make sense especially if we kind of understand and even if ethiopians understand themselves as being you know kind of this extreme this extreme of the world let's say and the relationship to the rest of the world you know it seems to kind of fit together you know yeah and i think you know even even in this promise right whether you're inside or outside you know whether you're a a desert or a wilderness you know it's it's like the was the ability the capacity of the saints and of their intercessions to go to these really extreme places we're going to talk about more in just a second but i think there's something interesting about this too because one of the things that you see in ethiopian high geography is that the the veneration of the snails is very much a two-way street and what i mean by this is there are all kinds of stories about you know so and so was a wealthy farmer who decided to skip the commemoration of this local saint because he had a plow was field and so the saint shows up and blights all of his crops so i mean this stuff this stuff i mean this stuff it's tough man that's tough story those are tough stories giving you know john calvin just the heebie-jeebies right now but i mean i mean that that's and you actually find this thing in english high geography too like this is very common you know basically but but the idea is that the the relationship between the patron and the person is it's very much it's supposed to be a two-way street but you and so it's easy for people to dismiss it as a quid pro quid pro or like this kind of this transaction or whatever but if you want to you can understand it more generally yes even secular people you can understand it in a in a in a larger context by understanding that if you don't remember your principalities if you don't remember those things that bind you together then yes you're going to be cursed that is the if you don't remember that which binds you then you're going to fall apart then your world is going to break down so if you want to destroy a country destroy its heroes right attack attack you know attackers for columbus attack george washington attack uh all these you know all these figures that are meant to be the these pillars that hold society together if you stop to remember them and to celebrate them then you're going to actually see a blight on your crops or a blight on your country so it's not it's not just like a magical transaction but it is an image of how reality actually works as well yes yeah that's that's the thing i wanted to key in on is that there's a you you can you can even just imagine on like the most boring and mundane level right like what happens if you use this analogy might come back to bite me okay but like what happens if what happens if you stop paying your taxes right what happens if you if you just stop doing the things that you need to do to to exist in a in a civilized society like what happens if you just decide listen i'm not gonna even very simple things like keeping up your lawn so that your neighbors don't hate your house every time they look at it you know very basic things like this like the and so stories like this what they do is they extend that reality into the realm of the spiritual and they say actually you know there's there's there's a there's a spiritual neighborhood as well right that there are these spiritual principalities and that yeah if you don't if you don't honor them i mean the thing is like if if you live in an ancient or a medieval society and you decide i'm not going to let's say you live in 14th century england you say actually i'm not going to show up for the corpus christi procession i'm not going to go beat the bounds right well what's that saying it's saying i'm not part of this community yeah right you're not just turning your back on christ and on the saints but you're actually also turning your back on your neighbors i'm saying is so it's so it's saying is saying wealth you know i'm gonna i'm gonna go plow my field instead of instead of taking an offering to the church in memory of the saint right then that's going to be used to feed the poor right so i'm i'm actually like i'm i'm being greedy i'm hoarding i'm refusing to to care for the poor i'm refusing to venerate the same like all of these things go together and it's one of the weirdest things about our society today i think that that essentially the idea of care for the poor yeah and and then also the idea of veneration have been completely separated yeah i think it's one of the things that's really destroyed our ability to to like to do charity in a like a really traditional and a christian way but you can understand how there's something frightening also about a world that that that works that way completely let's say if you think of of because it can also in an excess like if it goes too far it can create a world of fear in a world of you know you're constantly afraid that if you don't do the right thing if you're not you know if you're not celebrating this thing or that thing then you know your world is going to collapse and so i can understand also how sometimes it can become too far and become almost like this rigid this kind of rigid system that is impossible to without flexibility yeah but i think it's also important for us on the other extreme in a world where basically nothing matters and everybody just does what they want and you know there are no relationships between our us and our neighbors that we we can understand how the world works and how remembering and celebrating the saints and the things that bind it together is actually a necessary part of of existence yeah so that's that's why i'm trying to point this out is is to say a couple of things one is that these these three patterns that we've just talked about the the the sacred the holy theft the the kidan and then this idea of of the sort of like the saint as punisher right that all three of those things show up to some small degree in the hagiography of let's say the calcidonian churches but not to this degree so what we're so this is a good example of like where we see you know once we get to ethiopia and we get to ethiopian hag geography we see like the more extreme patterns manifesting themselves but also in a way that that does sort of serve as a container yeah right yeah so with that said last time we talked a little bit about the nine saints yeah and the nine saints are these they're also sometimes called like the nine roman saints or the nine righteous ones and essentially this is a group of saints i think they're traditionally supposed to all be from syria which is of course part of the roman empire at this time but but i think also like looking at the etymologies of names and various other things now people think some of them might have come from syria some of them might have come from as far away as rome like in italy so but essentially it's this group of nine saints that come to ethiopia within about a hundred years of after the conversion of ethiopia and and they come probably because of the council of cal state on and with the they're they're they're basically they they have to they're not willing to adopt the they're not willing to accept the the decrees of the council so they have so they're resisting they're resisting the the the calcidon the calcidonian definition right and they're looking for a place to how can i say this to to contain their knowledge or to contain their their their experience right so these were these were all monks they're all scholars and they brought with them quite a number of texts and manuscripts which ended up not surviving anywhere else for instance there are additional clementine letters i won't say clementine letters because that means something else down here in the south but we have the song anyway but we have these like additional clementine letters we have actually a number of texts that are like sort of quasi new testament they're like kind of part of the larger canon of the new testament in ethiopia and that that don't just don't survive anywhere else and so the the traditional belief is that these manuscripts were brought by the nine saints with them and they also did other things like translating a lot of liturgical texts and a lot of actually geography and other things into into guess into the language of the ethiopian people yeah so they're very very important they're part of this you know really in fact if you look up like any just like top 10 list of ethiopian saints of which there are i think at least two on the internet there that they'll they'll feature there in the timeline right it's sort of like them and then after them this hypnographer named jared who's really interesting because he seems to have at one point he left ethiopia because of kind of a schism or a scandal and he went to syria and while he was in syria you know he came into contact with other you know with with other forms of eastern christianity and at some point he composes this beautiful i mean really beautiful acrostic poem to the mother of god you can go out and look up the text and i think saint vladimir seminary press has a translation of it but if you read through it it's got all of these very similar ideas and phrases that to those that we find in the activist him to the mother of god which is also an acrostic so i think the two are probably related but in any case so the nine saints they they're responsible for basically they're they're more extreme theologically as opposed to the rest of the the church that say the imperial church but then they bring with them these they bring with them the the these texts and become this repository of knowledge and so because it's the book of enoch these are where we first discovered them let's say i think was in the 19th century'th or 19th century this is where they first reappeared on the horizon people knew about them but then all of a sudden here they are these books yeah and it's a tricky question i think as to whether jubilees certainly seems to have been preserved in ethiopia because it was already a holy book of the of the jewish community in ethiopia before before they converted to christianity but but enoch and enoch and then also just a bunch of other stuff i mean if you just go up and you look up like the the the wikipedia page on the on the ethiopian canon there will be there will be books on there that you would have never heard of before yeah like there's some interesting but like was it the book of adam and eve or whatever that that that book is there's some really f it's really interesting to read these books because yeah and and like the ascension of isaiah in some in some yeah which is very important christological text for some reasons like things like that is it's a it's it's it's just it's really interesting it's really really interesting they divide up proverbs differently and they have you know some extra like i said some extra clementine books they also have you know like some collections of apostolic cannons and other stuff that's that's all sort of part of their larger canon of the new testament and that seems to date back to kind of this this infusion let's say of the the more extreme pieces of of learning and tradition in the imperial church that then become preserved in ethiopia yeah and that's where again we keep coming back to this image of ethiopia and not just having the ark but acting as an ark in itself as a nation and as a church being a place where things are preserved including some extremes that have been kind of pruned off in the in the imperial church let's say all right so let's talk just a little bit about the nine saints and a couple of their lives because they're super interesting and then we'll talk about some weirder stuff yeah so i'll just read a short little commemoration here from their cynics our room for this is aragawi i hope i'm saying that right who's also surnamed mikhail of michael this holy man became a guide to the servants of god on the road and he went up again the guide to the servants of god on the road so he's supposed to be the leader of these nine saints and of course they're on the road right you know not in a stable or fixed place and then he comes to one it says he went up to the holy dhabra damo this is a very high mountain holding the tail of a serpent yeah and there he fought countless noble fights and god you have to see the images of this they're dramatic because you see them sometimes actually like coiled up by the snake and being pulled up this pillar you know this kind of high pillar and so it actually looks like the snake like not around the tree but there's this verticality and then there's the snake pulling up the saint up the up to the up to the the top of this pillar so so two days ago three days ago from when we were recording this was byzantine new year and also the feast of saints in me and the skylight and i posted that picture in the symbolic world of this sort of same image right where you have that the serpent coiled around the pillar and then sort of like poised to strike and you have st simeon there standing at the top of the pillar and then that wonderful you know open clam shell with it with a pearl in it yeah oyster oyster yeah with a pearl in it at the at the top which that's a wonderfully mysterious image yeah it's a very it's a very powerful it's a very powerful image and in this story also the snake kind of carrying this saint up this ethiopian saying up you can really see this whole image of the bronze serpent and this image of the idea of death turned against death and how kind of asceticism is also even that death turned against death and also also moses moses taking the serpent by the tail yeah so becoming a staff which is of course the wrong way to grab a snake but he takes the serpent by the by the tail and then the serpent solidifies and it becomes a staff it becomes a rod of authority and of you know miracle working yeah what you have to do is fixing change it's like so you have this changing thing yes fix it if you grab it if you're able to grab on to to to to variability then you can transform it into hierarchy and it becomes a it becomes a staff so that's the image that you see in this you know also in both the image of saint simian and the image of and the image of this saint that gets ascended up the cliff yeah and i don't know there there's we were talking about this a little bit earlier but i think there is definitely like a a kind of more extreme person let's say who the only way forward for them the only way for them to sort of ascend is to take the serpent by the tail and and there's there's like a there's a paradox in that it's a dangerous it's an inherently dangerous thing because there's always this danger the serpent's going to double back and bite you but the person who can do that becomes he becomes a guide to the servants of god on the road and yeah i don't know like this this particular image has really been i won't say bugging me but just really stuck with me the last the last several days yeah so then you've got this is a weird one okay you've got garema or isaac and he's he's a a roman prince in fact in in this particular hachiography it says his father was the emperor of rome and i don't know yeah yeah pretty intense i don't know like like like historically which emperor that is supposed to be it doesn't say they had geography it's probably not that important but yeah but but he's a prince that's important yes yeah so he's he's a prince of rome and he's a sort of a miraculous conception his mother was barren she prays to the mother of god she's given this son she names him isaac and and he's he he grows up and he's he's made a deacon and then he's made emperor and then and you know again like it's a little it's a little tricky to figure out is that supposed to be some historical emperor seems like not right but but that it says that he sat and judged justly and righteously for seven years and then saint abba pantaleon of the cell this is another one of the nine saints heard of him and he said my son isaac let the dead bury their dead come and seek the kingdom of god so he he abandons his his robes and his wealth and his power and everything and he he leaves and becomes a monk he leaves and becomes a monk so there's and and it talks about you know all of his different miracles like one of the things that he seems to do is be able to plant plants where they shouldn't grow like he plants a grape seed in you know into a rock with this thumb and a grape vine grows out and and then this is a weird story i'll just read this bit to you it says one day certain columnators went to abba pentaleon so that's his spiritual father and said the priest isaac consecrated the offering after he had eaten so he's being accused of basically of not fasting before liturgy right and ava pantaleon having gone to him caught him on the road and he said to him and these guys are always on the road said to him wait man so that i may tell thee a secret and saint isaac said to him let men shut me in and remove the stones from us and they turned aside for his distance of five stadia and abba pantaleon said unto him oh my son isaac thou has terrified me and thereupon he was called abba garima and having finished his good course a redeemer appeared to him and promised him etc right so i don't even think i understand it's really hard to follow okay but what it seems to be and somebody you know write in and correct me on this but what seems to have happened is that he is accused of a sin a scandal and rather than defending himself he requests to be shut up like to be like walled in right and then and and then that's that's it like whoa yeah so basically he lives he just ends up living like in a little waldo cell for the rest of his life but that's how he becomes the same basically right and that this is this is and you know it does not say whether or not he really did this right now it does say that he was a great faster that his flesh cleaved to his bones and all the stuff so it seems unlikely yeah he really did this but he doesn't defend himself and it definitely seems like pantaleon his his spiritual father you know that he's scandalized you know and wants to you know like doesn't tell him why he wants to talk to him he's like hey come here i'm gonna i'm gonna talk to you about something tell you let me tell you a secret and and so then his his solution to handling this this is to basically make himself the secret it's too to wall himself off so i mean this is some of the stuff like you read this stuff and it's like man there's something really important here and i'm not sure i know what it is yeah yeah so and then pantaleon i'll just mention him quickly he was called pantaleon of the cell and the reason for this is that he he goes to the top of a mountain and he cuts himself a cell out of the rock and the cell is five cubits long three cubits wide so not very wide and then three cubits deep and so it's it's all a single stone no door when opening and if you work out the dimensions basically the point of the cell is that it's a cell in which you can only stand you can never sit or lie down yeah so he's like sort of protected from the elements but he's very much like kind of a skylight you know yeah where he's just like and basically that's where that's where he is and he he blesses one particular ethiopian king caleb who has a war with a local actually jewish king and and so that's that's kind of his story so those are the three of the nine saints that we have like the most detailed lives about at least in the synaxarium that i could find now i think that if you i'm sure there are some ethiopian people out there who know more stories i'm obviously there's some of the images i forget which name of the nine saints are but that when you see the actual images they're very extreme the iconography itself is extreme so i remember in ethiopia one of the images of these nine saints was the saint that in imitation of christ had thrown himself from a cliff and had died on these pointy rocks and so you actually see an icon of this saint being trans trans transpires by these pointy rocks at the bottom of of a cliff and and there's another one of them who has wings like like a seraphim and has these like nine wings around him so it's like when you see these saints in the church it's just like all these saints next to each other and you have this image of a sand being brought up by a snake there's another one who fed of dying birds by his tears and so you can see him holding a bird with its beak in his eye so you see all these ex so when you go into the church you don't even know who these saints are but you can know that they're part of these the nine saints and you see all their images next to each other and all of them are engaging in very kind of extreme iconography you do get this sense of really like a magical fantastical world one of the one of the images that really struck me the most like in some of these underground churches that exist there's one church which is dedicated to saint mercurious and so you go into the church and then there's this icon of saint mercurius on a horse and next to him there are these two dog-headed men right and and it's the legend that these two dog-headed men had killed mercurius's father and mercurius ended up converting them and then they become like his companions but also these fierce warriors that can be kind of turn against the pagans when you need to you know and so so you can see these extreme images all over the place yeah the saint bartholomew the apostle bartholomew in the ethiopian hagiography has a like a legion of cannibal sinocephalites right cannibal dog faces that's that's how they're translated in this english translation the the dog faces which obviously like if you're just like sort of scanning a page like dog face is going to jump out at you but but he has like he has he has these you know this legion of cannibal dog faces that that sort of like that he converts and then like you know other people try to try to kill him or try to do him harm the dog faces actually turn and defend him become guard dogs yeah they become yeah they become guard dogs like it's it's exactly the symbolism of a dog right you can have a wolf or you can have a guard dog right and that's what they that's what they become yeah and you see this yeah it's basically the same as saint mercurius it's just that and it can help you then understand these images of the dog-headed saint christopher as being a soldier like these soldier images of the dog-headed saint christopher also when you understand the other legends of of xenocephaly that existed in the world you you you can kind of see why these images kind of glue come together and and manifest it the way they do yeah i'll just read this a little bit here after this our lord jesus christ commanded him that it's bartholomew to go to the city of barbar that is the city of the barbarians nice the city of barbara right well yeah bar bar is yeah yeah yeah right because that's what that's what non-greek speakers sound like to greek speakers and he sent him to with andrew the apostle and by the way say andrew has lots of encounters with dog-faced men in basically every geographical tradition it's definitely there in like the anglo-saxon uh there's a there's a poem about it yeah the story of abominable like abominable who then becomes christian it's a that's a beautiful little story about the dog so he goes to the city of barbara and he sent him to him andrew the apostle with his helper to help him and the people of that city were exceedingly wicked and they would not receive the apostles who were working before them signs and wonders and god commanded one of the dog-faced cannibals so they're cannibals as well to submit to the apostles and not to resist them in anything which they ordered him to do and they took him with him to that city and the men of that city brought out wild beasts against the apostles to eat them up and straight away that dog face rose up against those wild beasts and rent them asunder and also slew a great many men of that city and of course everyone in the city converts it's this stuff is gnarly man this stuff is really it's really incredible yeah but in terms of understanding kind of the symbolism of the barbarian and the symbolism of right it's like it's the same symbolism that the emperor the byzantine emperor used in taking the viringian guard around him you know like having a foreign guard around you that is only you know is only submitting to you and using this kind of foreign power as a way to defend yourself against the foreigner like it's the same as the as the french king giving normandy to the to the scandinavians so that they would have this inner these inner barbarians that would act as guards for the outside and so but it's just a more fairy tale or more kind of mythological telling of this pattern which is a real pattern in the world that you that is important to to understand yeah so i think that i think so there are there are a lot of cannibals actually as it turns out here in yes in ethiopia the ethiopian tradition and the craziest story this is the craziest story is the story of a bellai the cannibal and this is one of the things when i went to ethiopia marked me the most because the iconography of the light of cannibal is often on one set of the doors which moves into the sanctuary which moves into the holy place and so with the story is that there's a man who received guests very similar to how abraham received these three guests these three angels but instead of giving the angels food instead of feeding the stranger he receives food from the stranger so he actually eats the stranger's food and it turns out that these three guests are demons and what they're giving him to eat is human flesh and so in when he eats the human flesh he becomes obsessed now with eating human flesh and then goes out and starts to like eat eat people and just kind of becomes a crazy cannibal eating human people until one day he's wandering through the desert and he sees a an ascetic who who is kind of there in the desert and asked the lie for a glass of water in the name of the holy virgin and bellai gives him water and then continues on his life and then when billy the cannibal dies he comes to the judgment of christ and as he is being judged and going to be sent to hell the mother of god comes and tips the scale to his side because one day he gave a glass of water a couple of water in my name yeah exactly and so there's still and so what's crazy is that the image that you see on the door to the sanctuary which you have to remember is where communion is coming from so the body and flesh of christ is coming out of the sanctuary but on one of the doors of the sanctuary you have this image of a of a man sitting eating pieces of human flesh so it's like this extreme manifestation of one aspect of the scandalous aspect of communion being represented but then if you look at the story completely it's also a testimony to the universality of of salvation and just how far the salvation of christ is able to reach even beyond our our own judgment and on our own understanding of what is possible you know in in the name of god so it actually shows two extremes one is the extreme scandal of communion the extreme scandal of the most abhorrent behavior of cannibalism and the extreme of of a man who is completely lost and saved for a very small gesture done you know in in the name of the virgin so it's it actually is just we talk about this manifestation of extremes it's hard to go any further than that yeah there's there there definitely should be something scandalous about salvation and i think that when when it stops being just like when the cross stops being a little bit scandalous to us then we've sort of forgotten what it was about right yeah and it's interesting because in in western christianity in particular you know you go and read like scholastic authors i mean aquinas is a whole long discourse about why is the eucharist not cannibalism right and so he really wants to distance probably rightly so right he wants to distance like the two things yeah but then also also like in the ethiopian tradition like also i think probably rightly so like there's there's there's a a willingness to a willingness to not like shirk away because i mean it was a scandalous thing when christ told told it to the jews you know tell people hey do you want to be my disciple if you want to live with me and and have my life you just all you have to do you have to eat my body and drink my blood yeah that text is saying john when you realize that he's actually just talking out in the public it's so crazy yeah and he keeps using you know like this word that specifically means chewing like you gotta you know and and like and he's just saying these things to people and and you know and they're like well this is a hard saying you know like i feel like i feel like if if the way that you're describing communion like is not a hard saying then then you're you're missing something right and so so yeah this is a this is i think i think that's maybe like the ultimate example like to put that on the holy doors like i can't you know i can't imagine right we had this we have this father fodia savant who i think sometimes watches these videos so yeah if you do hey father podius we love you yeah he he had this new iconostas carved for his church here in allen it's beautiful it's one of the most beautiful iconistas that i've ever seen and on the on the holy doors there are a couple of you know they could be sort of dragons or cockatrices you know on top of the holy doors sort of guarding the entrance to the sanctuary made instant intuitive sense to me i was like that is awesome that's medieval i'd love it i've had so many people so did you did you see the pictures of father fodius's new economy like i helped unload it dude and he's like and and they're like they're like yeah um i'm just i'm just not sure about like the the monsters on the doors like what's that about you know so like even that little bit like we know that we know that it's not like your bishop has a staff with two snakes right oh why are you so bothered by that i get that question so much and i always just send them your article and then they read it and they're like oh that's really cool okay good to know and then it's all good but but that's that so that's the you know but the thing is like we know because it's in the church because we're used to the idea that everything like within the church especially in the sanctuary has this deep symbolic resonance like we know that it's not well it's not arbitrary right it's like it's it doesn't it's not neutral so then you have to ask the question what it's doing so i explained you know well it's the the idea of the guardian right like that this is what a cherub is right is a monster who by the way the the four the four beasts the cherubs have their own feast day in the ethiopian church and they have their it's got its own entry in the san xarian and it's super cool super super great that's awesome yeah so i couldn't tell you what day it is because i don't i don't know the ethiopian calendar it's they have different months and stuff but but but it's it's really cool and so you know like you start to explain like okay but in the bible god's throne is guarded by monsters like we're used to thinking angels these are nice that you know but like yeah well god rides the cherub across the river right and it's it's like it looks pretty much like a bull with wings you know with like it doesn't it seems like it's more of a something you mount you know so yeah so that said i don't think father fordius could get away with a cannibal on the on the holy doors yes yeah that would be a little much that would be a little much you know although you say that but although there is a tradition of putting the good thief on the on the the northern door of the you know of the of the entrance into the sanctuary which is not as scandalous but it shows us the scandal very similar to the scandal of bellai which is this like this like one moment of contrition that the right that the the good thief has and who makes him makes him the first in paradise basically right so we have these these verses in uh holy week in the orthodox church where we sing about the good thief stealing paradise and in in some eastern churches not in not in the orthodox eastern orthodox church but in some eastern traditions i think this might be like a syrian thing but there's actually on holy friday they actually have a liturgical tug of war between like one of the deacons and one of the priests what where where yeah would they have like this pole or like spear and they they do like a like a ritualized tug of war at the you know right on the on the on the the entrance to the sanctuary and this is the it's basically it's like the the guarding cherub trying to keep the thief out of paradise and the good thief stealing his way in that's amazing so that there's that that kind of stuff is there man and and it's it's interesting because like in the orthodox church on on and i know this isn't quite ethiopia but it's still relevant on on like sundays the verses that we sing the sticker of verses that we sing with beatitudes if your church does the beatitudes they're all about the good thief right and so it's funny because you'll you'll you know like talking to our evangelical friends love you guys there's somebody's there's always going to be somebody who's like okay but why do i need to do all this stuff because the good thief dot dot like that somehow like proves their point and and and and you know like oh well no one no one has ever thought of the good thief before you know but actually if you look at eastern liturgy especially holy week is one of the most important stories for us because the you know there's a bunch of things going on there right that the the the love and the clemency of god right but also like this hope you know like the you know that prayer that we say you know i will not you know speak of your mystery i want to give you a kisses to judas i will not speak of your ministry mysteries to your enemies but like the thief will i confess thee remember me o lord in thy kingdom so it's to basically say god i don't really have anything to bring to the table at the end of the day but if if he could get in then maybe you'll also have mercy on me right and and so there there is there is that embrace of a scandal that's at the heart of the heart of our salvation yeah which is really beautiful so for me one of the other things i wanted to bring about to kind of balance out our discussion was to to maybe help people understand also the way in which the ark kind of participates in the structure of the ethiopian liturgy because now we talked about the extreme the extremes in the sense of really the extremes right of these fringe behaviors and these kind of fringe moments of sanctity that exists a little bit in in the orthodox tradition but seem to kind of fill up you know the different ethiopian traditions but then you also have the idea of containing which we talked about in terms of the holy text but we also understand the ark is present in the liturgical life of the the ethiopians through what's called the tabot and so the ark of the covenant is in this chapel you know in aksum but there are replicas they're symbolic replicas they're not like actual replicas but they're symbolic replicas of the ark which are present in every single church in ethiopia there are very few people supposedly at least this is what i was told by an ethiopian man that there are very few people that make these that it's a very kind of it's a very tight group of people that have the capacity to make these these image these these these little they're like wooden boxes not boxes like wooden blocks that represent the tablets really more than the arc in the sense of even that name yeah they they represent the tablets basically of of the of the law and they're placed in the altar area of the church like in the altar or under the altar like in the in the the table let's say and so you can on you can see how this idea of the container of the sacred kind of just reaches all the way down into the everyday life of all the churches and what's fascinating about a lot of these tabot is that they're icons actually that they're they're they're relief icons of of of christ on the cross or different they're not always sometimes there's some text on it or sometimes there's actually abstract symbols on these on these but often there are they are they are icons and so the image becomes also this kind of container for for the sacred so it's it's just important to see how just permeating all through the imagery of ethiopian christianity there are these elements of the extreme edge as both extreme and as container for everything and that's why i always go back to the the image of the nest which i like because the nest is a container that's made out of remnants you know like you know there's little bits of string and fur and twigs and whatever birds can find like and then it's but but then it's brought together into this this place it can actually shelter and protect something and by the way that that symbolism of having like the little the little replica of the ark or the tables of the law in your sanctuary is the same thing that we do in the orthodox church when we put the mother of god in the apes over the altar like symbolically it's a very similar function right the understanding that she is she is the new arc she is the she's the the warm mercy seat right was one of the phrases that's used of her right so the idea is that she's the yeah the seed of wisdom the mercy seat all these types of images of the mother as the container as the the resting place of of of the presence of god in the in the church and so then so then maybe just to like my last comment on this you might want to finish with something else but is to remind people of also this what started our discussion on ethiopia was an eschatological vision that was present that that's present in the apocalypse of of of pseudomethodius which is this idea of the roman emperor you know joining with the edge or joining with the end and coming out in the end out of this edge and so you have this idea of the beginning and the end which is manifested in the story of the nine saints as well that is you have these roman saints that seem to come from all over the roman empire who go into ethiopia to find an ark and to find a place where christianity is preserved and where you know to act as this kind of last resting place for all these traditions and so in their tradition they have this image of the roman coming towards ethiopia and then in our tradition we have the same vision in a different form but of the roman emperor in the moment of crisis hiding in ethiopia so that in the end ethiopia will stretch its hands out unto god and the last emperor will rise out of ethiopia and kind of manifest this last glorious moment before the end of the world yeah the thing i would say to cap this out is is also to remind people why are we looking at why have we spent you know this is was this ethiopia three or four i can't even remember now i was about like three i've just been living with it like i have a stack of books and stuff like i've just been living with it for a while now so i really have no idea how much of this we've done but the reason we've done so much in ethiopia is for two two reasons i think one is because it's a it's a great proof case like it's a gate a great case study that's the way to say it it's a great case study for showing how the stories that people tell about themselves how the saints that they venerate and how even like the sort of dark or ambiguous parts of our histories right that that all of these sort of contain the meaning and they contain the the the identity and the framework that that people uses to engage with the world which is really what universal history is about so we are gonna you know er people keep asking like okay but what are what are you gonna do you know like this or this or this you know the reason we've been doing ethiopia is because you know a lot of people don't know about it so they don't know all the cool symbolism but also because because it's what you know if if i'm if i'm gonna sit here and talk about you know what's the symbolism of america which is the one we get asked for the most like in those comments like people just you know and i've hinted at it maybe one of these days we'll do it but the the the problem with trying to do the symbolism of america is that is that because we think we all think we know it so well right and our audience is primarily you know americans right we think we know it so well there's always going to be there's there's there's a we're just not as attentive to the weirdness or the the you know the these traditional shapes and structures that are still met that are they're still manifesting themselves today again like rubbing lincoln's nose for a blessing you know that's something i've done as a child right i didn't think anything about it at the time because everyone was like like and that's the thing like when you're participating in like a cult of veneration most of the time you're not doing it as a conscious thing like most of the time like this is just you know like you go to a concert and you get really amped you know because everyone else around you is also really amped and it's just it feels like a natural way to be so so by by going somewhere that's like a little a little bit different it allows us to sort of like look at these patterns with fresh eyes and so then maybe when we we turn our gaze to parts of universal history that are going to be a little more familiar to us we'll be the pump will be sort of primed and we'll be sort of ready to to start thinking in these ways yeah and i think also looking at at an extreme version or looking at kind of the the edge of the universal history in terms of christianity you know can also how can i say this it can also help us say how see like i said how these stories cross over and how even like the way that people talk about themselves often even though the stories are different and the way that it's presented is slightly different ends up strangely connecting with the way that other people tell stories about about those same people and so there is a way in which we can kind of look through the idiosyncrasy and see that there is a pattern that there are patterns of identity by which we recognize each other as kind of all participating in this grand in this grand narrative so so we've talked i guess for three videos now kind of with an outsider perspective on some of the stuff and i know it's your goal to hopefully get uh some clergymen from the ethiopian orthodox church on the channel and so i'm really hoping i if they're i mean if there are people out there that you know that you know the bishops or priests or deacons you know and you would be willing to talk about ethiopian tradition from an insider perspective i'd be very happy to hear from you and i'll be trying to at least have one conversation with someone from inside the the ethiopian tradition to kind of explore it from the inside let's say yeah we'll see if we work that out so yeah yeah thanks jonathan this has been a ton of fun and you know i guess people want to keep hearing universal history i definitely have more things to talk about so that's great i'm excited there's so much i mean there's so much to talk about that we could just we could we'll just keep going yeah as long as people are paying attention are excited about this we'll we'll continue so everybody thank you for your attention don't forget to check out rich all of richard's projects like amon sewell and what about what's happening with this book that you mentioned a few episodes so finding the golden key it's gonna be an essay collection on this recovering sacramental imagination i'm still hoping you're gonna going to contribute we've gotten i would say about 14 submissions ish so far and a lot of them are pretty great there's definitely one that was written by somebody dropping some acid so you know who you are whoever that is i don't know it's it's wonderful it was like oh i'm gonna just save this because this is it was just like this long crazy stream of consciousness but other than that we've gotten some really great submissions so i want to i still want to hear from more symbolic world people so if you go to findingthegoldenkey.com you can submit an abstract for a paper and there's there's an outline of the kinds of things we're looking for if you don't hear back immediately do not panic you have not been rejected but the deadline is through the end of this year so you still have about as of this recording about three months to get the abstract together and then you'll have time after that to
