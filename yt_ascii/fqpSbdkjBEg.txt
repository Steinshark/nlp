this is what 9 000 can get you or at least it could you see i bought this 28 core intel xeon platinum 8176 on ebay for just 999 and it's not only not a bad deal for the cpu on its own but it's a reflection of an increasingly favorable cpu market for buyers that is if you're willing to get your hands a little bit dirty digging through the archives of cpu history and if you're willing to take some risks like the risk i take of you skipping this message from our sponsor seasonic never skimp on getting a quality power supply for your current or your next computer build check out csonic and their wattage calculator at the link in the video description to find out which one will suit your needs intel's first generation xeon scalable cpus launched on july 11 2017 and the reception to them was lukewarm largely because amd also launched their first generation epic server cpus around the same time see the problem for intel was for nearly five thousand dollars less you could buy a cpu from amd with more threads and more cash if you were willing to overlook some of the growing pains that came with it being an all new platform so amd's return to competitiveness could be part of the reason that we were able to get this cpu for just 12 of its retail price four years later but it's definitely not the whole picture those of you who follow closely the secondary market may know this already but for the uninitiated there's kind of a pattern to the availability of cheap powerful hardware like this you see many data center and enterprise customers upgrade their hardware on a schedule this helps them stay more secure by ensuring that their servers will be actively supported and patched by the manufacturer and it also allows them to take advantage of the better efficiency of more modern processors well that retired hardware has to go somewhere so instead of just e-wasting it a small amount might be given to employees to validate and use personally while the majority will go to refurb server sites like bargainhardware.co.uk or more general auction sites like ebay because even though it's older gear it's absolutely still useful and can be cumulatively worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars and these sales are great news for enthusiasts because even a single large data center dumping a bunch of cpus onto ebay can have a profound effect not just on the models that they're selling but the used cpu market as a whole so let's take a closer look at our chip on the surface i would say there is absolutely nothing out of the ordinary about it and in fact if you had told me when it arrived that it was brand new i would probably have believed you but this isn't quite an ordinary chip and that is why it is so cheap if you look closely at the listings for this kind of server gear you're gonna see that they fall under three general classes let's start with the most expensive chips listed as retail were validated by intel for end user delivery and then probably sold in fully built systems for large customers they are going to perform exactly as a brand new processor of the same specifications other than that you are very unlikely to get any form of warranty support now those chips are still going for less than their original price around eighteen hundred to two thousand dollars but given that you could buy a threadripper 3970x with more not to mention faster course for that kind of money i wouldn't recommend it now for the cheapest haha this guy this is an engineering sample xeon platinum 8176 we happen to have this one lying around it's got 28 cores just like the retail one but you can buy one of these for under 200. wow notice how it says intel confidential on it this is because this chip was intended to be used by engineers to develop their own accompanying products so dell or micron might get large batches of these prior to the official launch as they work to make compatible motherboards and compatible memory and all that kind of stuff which leads us to a couple of small problems with es chips like this one first is performance you know how the rumors about upcoming cpus often get the clock speeds wrong well that's because intel is actually changing the clock speeds based on what they learn as they ramp up production so early chips can run at sometimes drastically lower clock speeds another big one is compatibility remember how i mentioned intel sends these out before the product launch well if they're not done designing the product yet depending on how early the sample was it's possible that it won't even boot in a normal retail motherboard this 169 xeon nice for example only works in a specific subset of hp proliant servers and then some of the 400 to 500 versions are only supported by some super microboards and some hp boards so can we still get a good deal here yes that is where our original chip the one that cost us 999 dollars comes in this is a qualifying sample and in most cases a qs is just a regular production xeon platinum 8176 that reports in software as an engineering sample it suss like that ours for example has an identical stepping to a regular retail chip meaning that everything from compatibility all the way to performance should be exactly identical to a retail chip though of course there is only one way for us to find out first we should put it in the socket correctly big boy chip we're gonna go with the thread ripper application method draw the little x on there now because functionally the cpu should be no different from a retail chip we should be able to use it on any c621 platform motherboard these boards can be had for as cheap as 200 if you're lucky but they can be significantly more expensive going as high as around five hundred dollars but even at fifteen hundred dollars for our cpu and motherboards we could still be in pretty good shape here if it performs one thing you might have a little bit of trouble with though is finding a compatible cooler that's not kind of stupid there's two different ilms or hole patterns so there's a narrow one and a square one you can see the board that we have you see this is a square ilm because the socket is more square if you had a narrow ilm it would be more narrow hey there we go all right chips showing up all that good stuff we've got our 96 gigs of memory this is a six channel memory controller something the writer brought up that didn't even occur to me is that it uses like a non-user-friendly style non-graphical bio so i was like just a bios you mean but yeah it occurred to me that you young whippersnapper kids might not be familiar with navigating those as for kenneth game the answer is a resounding yes siree bob we're running at anywhere from 100 to 120 fps and do maternal oh wait what the crap why would it default to this how is this game so bad at just running at your native resolution okay so running at native res the answer changes somewhat hmm that's unfortunate we are dipping down as low as 40 frames per second on this puppy is the cpu cooling like working one moment please these things don't actually run that hot which is kind of crazy when you consider they've got 28 flipping cores in them yeah well there's your answer david how many cores this game is using the answer appears to be a big fat i don't know a couple of them look at the frame rates they're all over the place like okay yeah we're at 100 and whatever but then oh man look at it just tank or 40. okay so not a great gaming experience for a thousand dollars ah there's your problem while we're getting cores boosting up to 3.1 even as high as 3.5 gigahertz that's plenty for modern gaming the cores on average are running anywhere from 1 to 1.1 gigahertz which tells us that this particular game anyway is jumping from one core to the next which might explain why it's running really well for a bit and then choking on its own vomit in the next moment what we can maybe do is pin a handful of cores to this process and see if that helps ah that's a big fat no as soon as i have to look at anything in the distance it's not the gpu though because it's not about what the gpu has to render it's about what the cpu has to because it just it must be a draw call thing then which in vulcan is theoretically like really well optimized for that but as soon as it needs more draw calls as soon as we go off into the distance over here and it has to be like oh yeah there's a bunch of stuff over there it's like oh interesting we're up to like 150 200 now what the heck is going on here why is our fps gradually climbing it's really choppy though this frame counter here is not representative of the smoothness of this gaming experience like you can see it probably david right so yeah we're running well in excess of 200 fps and it smooths out sometimes this must be just kind of the same issue here what a bad gaming cpu and not only is it bad for gaming but if you needed to do say 3d work or high resolution video editing in premiere the cpu wouldn't be ideal for that either that's because many 3d engines greatly favored gpu rendering thanks to gpu's vastly superior performance in parallel applications also programs like premiere tend to disproportionately favor single core performance versus having as many threads as you can cram into a socket that's not to say that a mini core cpu like a 5950x is a bad idea for premiere it's just that the 5950x also has strong single core performance and this one just doesn't where you might see some benefit would be in anything that involves complex parallel computing so maybe you want a personal server that can do everything like host a few minecraft servers and some websites and act as a media server and do all of it simultaneously well now we're talking even then you can also get a lot of other cpus for around the same price or less that can perform those functions take for example the xeon e5 2670 v2 with a board and cooling you can get a pair of those for around 250 us dollars that's 20 cores and 40 threads and definitely all that you need for some home automation and nas and media transcoding duty
