but first we want to focus on the technical speaking aspect which is today about and as not everyone probably knows everyone here very assistive panelista the panel was an introduction round so as our new guest maybe in the can you get started with an introduction sure i'll be happy to so my name is imba levy i'm the amateur for the israeli national body in the standardization i'm working 21 but you've mentioned my relation to conferences and truth is our israeli conference is happening next week and i'm really looking forward to it and excited and of course you know stressed and and busy with everything that needs to be you know making sure everything is perfect and we're really excited as well because we have approximately half of our speakers are people you know international speakers and we have the arna starstruck the creator of c plus coming over even keynote so of course it's going to be our largest conference yet yeah i think conferences are a great opportunity to meet you know the international community and that's actually i mean how i started my first exposure to international c plus world was by giving a talk in our local conference which was organized by adi and michael which i still owe them a lot for that and and i think it's amazing and and the the path i did since and how i got involved in a lot of things that that i care a lot about so i just want to tell people if you're unsure that you want to take this step i i think you really should and i really think it opens a lot of doors and a lot of opportunities that's my experience at least good luck with the conference symbol thank you so you want me to go next games okay so hello again everyone i'm phil nash do you may remember me from the from the talk area but i'm also a developer advocate at sonar which means i get to do this sort of thing a lot which is one of the reasons that i've racked up over 170 talks now i also run a conference c plus plus on c which is actually going to be in about three weeks so that's coming up soon as well that's all going pretty well as well it's nice to see all the conferences actually coming out of the the pandemic times now i'm not quite back to where they were but we're getting closer so that's nice to see yeah i've also got my fingers in lots of other buys co-host of cppcast now and also around the c plus plus london so if you're in the london area you can come to our meetup oh and i i used to be the well i still own the original author of catch now catch two i haven't really been an active maintainer for a few years now but you may know me for that as well so yeah the chance you may have come across me before yes and i also may i need to introduce myself hey i'm your host i'm jan speller i i started more than 11 years ago meeting c plus plus i also have been running a user group for some time that's let's just use that group here now but also the user group and just sell it off and generally work a little bit in the last years as a conference organizer community manager etc so let's see if we have any questions also yeah so see underneath and yes there seems to be the normal quietness at the beginning of the panel so what questions did i had prepared let's maybe talk about what talks are missing from your conference what talks would you like to see i think by conference we probably lacking some of the the beginner material we got a little bit but not enough nice to see that cpp con about the the back to base extract keys now that seems to be going well always really popular with the the attendees but we don't get enough submissions for those tracks so i think we need to do a bit more as organizers to get that that sort of content in your meet again yes as i mentioned already i think that gamedev is like one of those areas which is underrepresented at our conferences where we definitely could see that you know we have submissions on it would be nice embedded is something which was meeting embedded joining my conference now as a track will probably be but more prevalent at my conference and as i said yeah beginner talks tutorial talks talks which are not as high level people often like to talk about the things they they work on and so naturally if you're working on something interesting that is always a good talk and especially if it's like in a field last year meeting c plus was a very popular talk about from the finance sector i actually not yet the most viewed talk but it's on the way to to become the most viewed talk probably within the years at my channel already has wrecked up i think over 100 000 views it's pretty good so there's a lot of things like if you look at the programs from the last years of you like yeah has this been covered with this if you ever thought about that and of course yeah i want to hear invite thought on this sure so i i would be really happy to see more tooling talks in our conference we actually have one that i'm really looking forward to anastasia from jet brands is going to give standard sql plus toolset talk which i'm really really looking forward to see but i think that the debugging sanitizers you know and and and even like even a nice talk about compilers and you know how do you recognize how do you you know maybe for beginners how do you feel more comfortable with compilers errors which is something that i find you know challenging for beginners i think those things are are really important we don't have any talks about gaming that's also unfortunate because it's also very fascinating territory so maybe next year we'll get two more and and as you've mentioned the beginner's track is also something that i mean we were always happy to get talks aimed for beginners but i really think that at that stage that we only have four tracks this year which is relatively large for our conference maybe next year would actually split it into a different track and i agree that the cpp con you know having back to basic i think it's it's a really important part of a conference but yeah there's there's a lot of topics i'm very interested at so we'll see we'll see what happens so which are common mistakes that should be avoided during a talk i think there's two mistakes where one leads to the other and i mentioned it in my talk actually which is trying to put too much material in for the time allowed and then speaking too fast because you've got so much material to cover at least that's a common mistake for me you technically took my i was gonna say that i mean yeah for extra emphasis i had too much material in my talk today that happens i i think like i had my machine reboot on stage before the talk just because i connected to the to the projector so everything will be fine until you actually connect your machine to the technical things to give you a talk so be prepared to have like an earlier version or the current version if you can of your talk on a stick to be able to you know switch laptops think a really big mistake as a speaker is to be late to like show up on time because if you're on time you're already late especially if you're giving a talk on site online we're trying to get around this problem this pre-recording so your talk will be online on time but if if you're on site it's really really important that you have time to to pre-check some sometimes you can do that like the day before but mostly if you've done it before if you have experience with presenting on various projectors with your machine you're presenting from it's mostly enough to like be like 15 minutes 10 minutes already there to be wired up and to connect your laptop and now project your sites and send to be ready for that yeah 101 repeat the point you made about having your talk saved somewhere else as well whether it's on a usb stick or i always keep all of my talks in dropbox so i've actually got all my talks going back to 2004 in there it's only a couple of times i've had to fall back to that ironically the first time i was actually giving a talk at displaylink to the company that actually makes the display connector technology couldn't connect my laptop to their screens so i had to fall back to my dropbox copy and use somebody else's machine but i had that option so yeah so definitely something to do it well exactly yes probably a good idea to to have your talk also on the internet and this time you know where we're living in let me see if there's a new question yes i need to copy this over and click add manner and then click show i also like if linkedin wants to answer and wants to have an answer to a question etc okay you can post questions to the chat and i'll be able to also put them in here so this is a question like about format we are looking for the standard format is a talk with slides this is unfortunate sometimes but i find this is a good question like are you only looking for talks or so like learning sessions which include coding exercises you know yeah some some chinese have laptops other stuff but yep so would something like that be welcome let's discuss this so i can i can say for our conference for example we have our conference is technically on june 6 and 7 but we have a pre-conference workshop day on the 5th on which this is you know a workshop in a small class with you know attendees coming with their laptop and actually doing the the the exercise coding etc we also have more of a open and this actually caused some money like significant amount of money because the instructors are are actually giving this workshop and they're professional that this is their living hood we also have post conference workshops that are more open and they're designed to introduce the topic not necessarily go that deep into into it but still introduce a topic to people that are new to it for example gpus and also we have a workshop about intel technology i think this is really great to be part of a conference i think i mean personally i love i love those you know i love to try things by myself it may be like for you know a whole full of people of 200 people or or 150 people it may be a bit harder because it's enough that just one or few people are you know missed link that you just posted or whatever and and it's kind of harder to do this but i think that most cases the most conferences should at least have some kind of ability to to allow also workshops and me personally i'd be happy to get you know we'll be happy to get more workshops for our conference so if you're interested in that it doesn't have to be like a full day workshop it's usually the the the the framing but you could also do like a one hour two hour workshop and that could be awesome as well yeah we have a similar arrangement with c plus plus on scene pre-conference workshops which are typically all day during the pandemic we did experiment with a half day workshops during the main program as well that actually worked out really well although we're experimenting with a few things at once and overall it wasn't a massive success but everybody there really enjoyed it i wanted to do that again now we're back in person but because the numbers aren't quite high enough we've actually gone down to three tracks instead of the four that we had before i feel like we might be displacing too much of the the normal content that way but once we get a little bit bigger again i want to give that another try you could also do workshop style presentation in a normal 60 or 90 minute slot if you're if you're very focused i think one of the problems starts to be expectations if people are not expecting to sort of go in and bring their own laptops and actually do something then you know and everyone not everyone's going to be along with you there may be a lot of extra disruption there's people getting set up which takes time as well so i think you need to have that format established and people know what they're they're expecting beforehand so definitely not out of the question i think it's something to to experiment with but there are some things to take into consideration before doing so shall we say there's space for that and there's space for submissions which are on auto docs and which don't you know fit the usual talk with slides setting we have had workshops that being c plus plus i don't have them this year i think because in my experience with workshops has not been that great from the audience take up that it's not like an automatically given that there's a lot of audience coming to the workshop and also i find it sometimes hard to to get the right workshops and to to get the feeding like which workshop is actually being taken on by the audience that's why i as you know you need to rent the room you need to rent the technical things for it there's a costlers you need to recover as a conference organization and the overhead ads to to having these people in the workshop so for medium c plus plus i have found that it's sometimes hard to do that and that didn't opt to have that this year maybe you have that again they have some some ideas there but generally on this question i think like yes this would be great to have something like a coding dojo okay if you want to moderate the coding dojo if you want to give anything in an interactive format where you actually you know make it clear from the beginning that you know the audience will interact with you and that you had to do like a coding quiz or something like that this can be fun and people are open to that to join you in the session at a conference so yes there's space for that and you can definitely submit something like that and just very unusual to have such a submission and you'll probably will then have at least a conversations so it was a conference organization to get a feel like are you able to host this session and how do we want to make this part of the program because maybe we just put in a normal stock maybe put that in the evening program there's other options one thing we're doing this year mu c plus plus is we were having the launch back and so we're going to put a track in the launch where people just meet up parallel to the normal talks and have like a user group meeting user group organizers we're going to have a meeting on probably on boost or cute depending on who's on the conference who can you know share that then so people just meet up and discuss their their issues and their experiences with the library was a standard it was a committee we probably have some committee members so maybe you have you know i meet the committee session in the launch it's also very possible and i'm very popular and at vgc plus processor the launch session let's see there's new questions i think you actually segued nicely into oliver's question in a way talking about other alternate formats that could very well be let's see we are always talking about the workshops why don't we modernize a little bit and have also a hackathon to attract the younger generation which is hopping unrest python but laughs again those alternate formats whether it's a more hack upon like or more workshop like if it's a an established part of the program there's a definite it's basically like a track or or a day dedicated to that then when people know that they're going for that i think that can work really well i think my my concern is when you have it just as like one or two like spread its sessions it's not cohesive enough and people are not going to have the right expectations going in so yeah you need enough submissions to to make that work and maybe you know planning ahead of time to say this is so be interesting to to know how many people really want that sort of content in in our communities maybe we just need to step up to it yes so i'll definitely it's actually upgraded and be very supportive of that i love hackathons it's it's kind of and it's kind of a hobby so yeah are a bit different in the sense that i mean at least the formats that i'm familiar with is that people are expected to stay awake through the night and you know and sometimes people are not like that's not what they're looking for in a conference but i think we could definitely do this and you know for some smaller group or whoever is interested of course and i think it could be really really great so i'm actually i'm actually really i actually really like this idea remember we'll try it next year especially thinking about it c plus plus now they do the the library in a week thing which sort of like a background hackathon in a way but not quite the same thing but a similar similar idea group of people get together and work on other projects by the end of the week they're going to show off what they've come up with we actually had library and language in a week this year we also yeah so people are also working on on language feature but yeah i agree it's a it's a great part of cbp now in my mind so yeah it's a hackathon which has right now happening or which not not right now happening but which is planned i think for july from cpp india which has been announced so they have a website about that and they're organizing that i think like yeah it's a nice format to have if i find someone to to organize this right you want to run a hackathon be our guest on the other hand conferences always have a lot of the problem to to know as their audience wanting to have that or not we do this with the launcher we can host things which is very popular but like creating new space for things like that needs like folks which take on the organizing the hackathon from cpp india is sponsored by undo and that's probably also an opportunity for sponsors to step up and organize something add something to the conference which we sometimes have had that some sponsors like run a coding a contest or something so generally other formats and new formats are very welcome to the conference world it's just often a lack of submissions or people wanting to do the putting in the work which is the other part of organizing you know that you have people that get to be the ones which organizes this and some conferences have that there's like an acc or the c plus quiz which is one person organizing this and we probably also at municipants request which probably will return this year in the evening so sometimes we have that hackathons is now obviously being maybe starting and maybe we get some people together to organize a hackathon for the conference next week for inval that's gonna be a close call yeah we do have we do have a quiz so we at least have that yeah diego it's gonna it's gonna do a quiz in our lightning talk meetup but yeah i agree and i just wanted to say and it also relates to the previous question i think that the sessions that involve audience participation is usually it turns out to be the best ones so i definitely want to see more of those and hackathon or an interactive workshop are both great examples for that okay so one question i probably want to cover in this like what kind of technologies do you prefer or have seen for giving and preparing talks like tools like i know like various formats access powerpoint etc can we like quickly discuss this point like what do you use to prepare your talks what what have you seen from other folks speaking personally i tend to use keynotes on my mac for the actual presenting mostly because i know it inside out and i can make it do pretty much everything i want i would like to actually move to something maybe more browser-based because there's a lot of things i'd like to do that would be easier that way but none of the existing tools that i've seen actually do things the way i would like so i keep thinking about writing my own because that's what we do i haven't got around to it yet so i keep going back to keynote which is fine preparing the talks like they usually just outline stuff in apple notes but any any good note taking tool would be fine for that i've done my maps in the past as well but i found that there's not a big difference between my maps and outlines for for talks but you can you can write more sort of long form notes in a notes app doesn't doesn't suit my maps quite so well my first ever talk i did at the accu conference in 2004 the whole talk was a mind map just sort of zoomed around that actually was quite effective and i've sometimes tried to reproduce that in a slide format but never quite achieved the same thing yeah so my first presentation was in pretty so i was very excited and one was you know looking for something unique but i have to say that since then i've just fell back to carpoint i i just i think that in a sense like i have i'm i tend to put a lot of effort on how things looks and i i sometimes even too much like i i'm a bit obsessed with you know things are being in the right place and all of that so sometimes just doing the simple thing would be easier for me because otherwise i'll find you know waste all my time in the fitting colors and and caring about the sizes of things but yeah i know that people really like as you've mentioned the web-based um things that based on javascript i know one person who writes javascript programs from hannah for her presentations and he chose because they're amazing literally amazing yeah but you can do really neat things with powerpoint as well i really like very rasmine's presentations this is doing like transforming friends like changing code using some powerpoint features that i've that i haven't had a chance to to check and i think the most important thing is that you know feel comfortable with the flow of your presentation but it's also great to explore new tools so those are the ones that i know yeah i i studied us openoffice that's on the one on the one hand i i like that it limits me so that i can focus on on the actual content and on the other hand as phil said and yeah javascript or like the css and html based slides systems are quite nice where i've been looking at and the other promises as a conference organizer you have it's not like your new talk it's like also all the talks or presentations you always like you know try to maintain for the conference like the welcome message or for the user group the welcome message so changing over that would be a lot of work but maybe it's worth it to you know just have css available to you css transitions and do a lot of things in css would be cool to see if that works out there was a question about let me copy that and we can put that in the banner which is actually a good question on how much time does it take to prepare a talk i can give an answer to this a precise answer actually it's exactly how much time you have if you have six months it takes six months if you have an l it takes an hour maybe an hour's a bit of a push but an hour is just enough for him yeah i agree it's i have i find myself fixing both large and small things last minute as well sometimes it's just like you constantly it's it's like you're think when you prepare talk you're constantly iterating over the topic you want to talk about and it's not even technically necessarily but also how do you want to present it how do you want to pass your you know emphasize your points and things like that and and and it tends to take to take over your time so yeah i think yeah it depends on how much time you wanna take up with that and often you know have in mind that stuff you're speaking on already has taken up time right you learned that maybe or maybe you use your motivation is to to work on the talk because you want to learn something like you want to learn about that feature and then that is a different approach and it depends on on how much time you want to spend on it i usually take some time per like every week i have like an afternoon where i work on the talk or i'm supposed to work on the talk and then what what has helped me a lot in the past is that i'm a bit earlier at the conference because of jet lag when i go to into the conferences in the us or because of travel opportunities and then when i'm in the hotel i often use that time to finish the talk and that's also very common that people you know work on their talks during flights or in the hotel or in talks where you know they let's also often why speakers are not able to really provide the slides in front of the conference because they're still looking on the slides and then just doing your talk starts to finish with this bad stuff that's very common that's why it's worth to be scheduled at the end of the conference because then you're going to miss the whole conference because you're going to be in your hotel room preparing your slides that's a pro too i found it actually yeah but i will mention that for newspicker if you're a new speaker i think that around three months at least from you know the time of the conference start working on gathering the ideas is is the minimum because you don't want to like you could technically prefer a talk in a month but me personally at least from my experience especially as a new speaker you want to iterate over it as much as possible and and make sure you feel comfortable with the presentation so i think i've you know suggest to try to aim for having three months or so in advance since you're submit the abstract or they start working on your talk there's a really good chance you're going to get accepted so and if not you can always give it in the next conference so yeah i really i really think that's like optimal minimum time for new speakers and you should try to factor in being able to deliver the talk ahead of the conference to in a small group of colleagues or even family friends or at a meetup to have a good opportunity to give a driver under the talk before the final version and you'll get some feedback and the talk will be better because of it but also because it forces you with that deadline to say right it's got to be complete end-to-end by this this date then going back it's just polishing after that whereas otherwise you tend to polish it before it's finished and that also helps you practicing your talk right yes i have i have been rewriting talks because i was like yeah this is this interesting set of slides but you know when i give the presentation it doesn't line up it's not what i want to do all right so i i i i give the talk i practice the talk and i like this slide when i wrote those slides it was logical to put it here now when i give the talk when i'm in the floor i i kind of find this difficult so that i have to move it somewhere else i have to refresh that so i think that's that's the other point it's like part of preparing your talk is also practicing your talk and like envisioning what's the topics you want to say and that's why i think it's important to kind of you know have an outline of your talk to like have actually start titles like you know and what what you want to do in that hour and i think we are a little bit on the end with questions so it was almost two hours online i think that's also long enough so i am quite happy with tonight so if you have to have any questions maybe post them here but maybe also fill or in the have a question in their mind which they'd like to ask us or the audience and they don't you know final things they want to say question for the audience if you're if you thought about doing a talk but you've never done it yet what's holding you back the perhaps we could help with or maybe not interested to know either way and we have to wait for the the streaming delay for them to actually hear this yeah maybe you get a reaction in chat okay so someone says thank you do you have a question in mind for us or the audience or something to think about yeah i mean again phil stole my thunder but but i will i will say that [music] i think that it's more of a comment i think that giving lightning talks is also a great way to start because you get used to standing in front of audience so maybe my my question would be if you are too intimidated by given a full-length talk what would hold you back from giving a lightning talk which is and i'm not necessarily saying this is easier you have to take this under consideration when you prefer lighting talk shorter talk can be even harder sometimes in the sense of you need to manage your time but it may be less intimidating so yeah so i'll continue phil's question with same thing but for lightning docks in our conference and this is exactly targeting newspapers so so i'd be happy to so i stole your funders they went for lightning talks i i find the lightning talks are a bit of a paradox for for new speakers i think they're easier to get into because you've only got five minutes to fill for experienced speakers they're harder because how can i compress all this material into five minutes but it's just the way it is so yeah rena in the chat says mostly constrained time so lightning talks might be a good yeah good way to to go there so i i know that i've heard all kinds of opinions on lightning talks i've heard that they're incredibly hard and they're the most advanced thing you can do and on the other hand if you think about the work you have to put on your slides it can be so much less like i've seen people do sweating talks with one two three starts and they were good and the other thing is like when you want to start speaking or want to you know start like presenting things if the user group is near to you actually we had a user group at at least one user group organizer in the audience today and we have i think three on stage here also which are connected to user groups user groups also always look for material they even sometimes for lightning talks in front of their program and that is also where we you know can host a content like lightning talks and yeah what do we talk about just saying yeah quizzes and other content you can hold some music too so let me quickly see if we have any more questions but i think we are getting to our time limit yes i think roberto just had a suggestion yeah so right right let's just put that in here that i can put that on screen for technical purposes so could be like preparing a job interview could be that a good talk and i think yes it could be yeah we sometimes forget about the non-technical talks that are still going to be interesting to the particular audience so job interview is a great one for people that are new to the to the community that's exactly the sort of thing they need to hear but we've got to talk c plus plus on c on on burnout as well that's another thing that can be very relevant to a lot of us yeah and yes you did your thoughts on this yeah so i mean everything that is related to the development world can be a great lightning talk i think in our pre conference we had a meet up to prepare people for giving lightning talks in the sense of like encouraging them and giving them some tips and things like that and i think that there was a topic of how do you educate your your team or your group with something new like how do you propagate the the knowledge how do you you know make a larger contribution in your in your in your company everything that is relay related to this world i think is very interesting and the special thing about it is that by bringing your experience to stage you you're making your talks unique because this is your experience so i mean no one else have the same you know background as you and i think that just by bringing your your personal experience is is making your talk unique and worth worth watching so so yeah and to get back to the question on job interviews i think there's multiple language you can cover here either your experience as an interviewee or like what tools and what other things you as a company use i have and i do complete talks on hiring i do them on linkedin to you know make a little bit of advertisement for my job fair so i've started presenting data which we have through running the job fair and to do other angles on that so yes that'd be a great topic and other non-technical topics can be welcome at conferences as phil mentioned talk on burnout is something which i saw that's on your schedule it's kind of interesting that you hosted on your your technical conference and in that case just be prepared that some people will give you negative comments but i don't think i can drop interviews you would get that but like you know a complete non -related talk to c plus conferences i've seen all kinds of comments even like for keynotes like whoa as this wasn't like related to to to c plus plus enough or wasn't wasn't what i expected and that's it it's if you give a keynote or just a general talk some of the feedback will be used for some of the feedback will be just thanks for giving the talk and some of the feedback will be just people sitting in the wrong room he always have a choice yeah and with that i think we're gonna bring us to an end i want to thank phil for preparing the token for actually you know caring for this and preparing lots of materials and covering an interesting topic which we didn't have yet covered so we will be able to cover that for the coming weeks and months and years yeah it helps and thank you for coming for the panel and also for having getting this kicked off last year and well so we're happy to get new talks and new speakers always and thanks everyone who asked questions and contributed in the chat it's a great crowd thank you for the questions and thank you for coming thank you jans for organizing this is great topic and i'm always happy to i think it's really important that you keep doing this thank you that's maybe i want to that's i want to probably at the end now you know it's been a bit more difficult to organize this this year because people are really busy and i think in the coming years maybe it gets easier for me again because i attend conferences too and then i can like if i would have been at c plus personnel this year i probably would have been able to find more speakers don't know if i want to say that but kevin henny unfortunately didn't have time he was very very pleased about knowing that this event exists and would have loved to to take part in it but he's busy today so and we had yeah in bar wanted to prepare something but she's busy with a conference also understand that and then we had another speaker drop out which is david sanker and he's having a fever that's also a good excuse and i hope to see some of them next year and yeah cpp cast always awesome to to listen to that we would have had almost because teemo also was very excited about that but timur is on holiday right now so that's maybe also you know i see a lot of speakers knowing about this now and so we're going to continue that that's a plan to do that every year and we have a lot of good content from this year and last year which is recorded and which i can play for hours and hours and hours and we're gonna see what fresh content we get and then mix up this and this will be an awesome event and one of the motivations is just to a help the existing speakers to give better talks and also to this if the new speakers and and i think a lot of the talks and some some things which has been mentioned today or last year has helped me and has helped other people and there's always some very very positive feedback about this event has been a lot of positive feedback about this last year and there's a lot of positive feedback coming for this program is on youtube later and also going to write a blog post about it so it's gonna find its content so and now we're going to stop talking and take us offline thank you for coming i want to thank phil and inboard again for hanging out here and if you want to hang out with with us again then you're welcome to do so but tonight we are now going to change into the launch to you know just have a casual conversation there if you want to join me there you're welcome to do so is that final words to linkedin i know some of your questions have not been covered because they were technically off topic today i see that some people have come here to discuss in the chat like sleepless bus questions which is kind of fine but also so part of the event so i cannot cover that on stream if you like ask me what's the best c plus plus framework i don't know but there's that i think it's a good time to go offline now so thank you everyone let's wave
