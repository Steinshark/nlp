[applause] [music] [applause] [music] hey what is up guys i'm pbhd here and welcome to the first q a of 2019. now you may notice or you may look back and see that i didn't do the monthly q a for december of last year or november i think maybe like six of you noticed but real talk i want to focus more on more meaningful videos this year in 2019 and i feel like at the end of those months it started to feel kind of forced like we would be doing a monthly q a but there wasn't a whole lot more extra to talk about so i'm leaning more this year towards doing more more topical and more analytical videos instead of slipping those things into q and a's if people asked about it if that makes sense so that being said we are about to head out to ces but i figured before we get on that plane might as well ask which one to know on twitter and these are some of your best questions alright so shafiq wanted to know why was the mate 20 pro on the table next to the iphone in the most recent post on instagram so that top down shot of what i'm bringing to ces was actually shot a couple weeks ago as part of a collab with the verge so a lot of you guys may have seen that recent community post but theverge.com they've done this what's in my bag series with a long history of really interesting guests and things like that and they asked if i wanted to do one i said guys i've already done one and a lot of them have seen that already but if you want to see what's in my video bag right before ces that could be cool so we shot that a couple weeks ago it's on our channel i'll link it below if you want to watch it but at that time when we shot that i was reviewing the mate 20 pro so that's why it was in my bag now as far as phones i'm currently using bring the ces this is the mclaren edition oneplus 6t in all its shiny and glossy glory it's my current daily and i have the iphone 10s max of course as my daily iphone but you know i carry two and i think that's what i'm going to bring to ces i'm kind of torn on i want to bring the pixel because i know that's the best camera that's the camera i can count on for taking the best shots but i've been having some bugs with it again recently i might make a whole video on that if it gets bad enough but it was enough to get me to switch back to the oneplus 6t every day so i think that's what i'll end up with at ces but oneplus 6t mclaren edition iphone 10s max space gray all right anthony asks what fitness and recovery tech are you using to train for ultimate frisbee and honestly my time playing frisbee has actually usually been also my time away from tech usually on the weekends usually at nights when there's practices and things like that that's my time to not have tech now lately i've been wearing the apple watch a lot and getting into the whole competitions thing which is a seven day long who can get the most points and close their rings the most sort of competition in order to not lose out on thousands of points i've been wearing the apple watch while i play so that's why sometimes i close my rings a hilarious amount of times in 24 hours but other than that i really don't use that much tech or or fitness recovery related tech for ultimate that's my time away from it maria says are you going to make an auto focus video on the porsche takan yeah i hope to yes and like i've talked about competitors to tesla before but i think as far as direct competitors to tesla model s especially the p100d that i love so much the porsche mission e is i think what they're going to call it might be the closest competitor as far as design everyone loves porsche interior and the superchargers are working on so yes i do hope if anyone from porsche is watching this i do hope to be able to actually get a chance to check out the mission e and compare it against the tesla all right brianna asks will you start a podcast this year and what will it be brianna asks will you see all right brie asks will you start a podcast this year and what would it be about that might be referencing one of my early year 2019 tweets just sort of brainstorming that i should start a podcast ah now this idea kind of stemmed from two things one i've been listening to a lot more podcasts lately especially while driving i've listened to so many hours of music usually but i've been getting into podcasts and two there are just topics that you can only dive so deep into before a video gets excessively like in the weeds or too long and there are things that i'd like to talk about more or get into and research and interview about more that could be an hour long that i can't really get into in a 10 15 minute video and it's actually funny a lot of the videos have slowly i don't know if you've noticed but progressively gotten a little longer on average over like the last year or two we kind of average now like 12 to 14 minutes but that still doesn't quite cover how much we could talk about something so i like the idea of a podcast but i don't want to just jump right directly in and rush it like i feel like i could just grab a mic and just talk for an hour and upload it right now and that's episode one but i want to do it right so i want to sit back we want to get a good name we want to get a good scheme a good format and start to put things together so i'll say we're going to do something we're going to do a podcast but look out for that over the next couple weeks and months as we start to set that up and we'll get you guys feedback as we go along you'll probably have ideas for how to make it better just like the videos all right what would you want to see in the tesla model y that says 69 likes that's funny so the the model y has been teased for probably some 2019 unveiling and that would be the suv that is the model 3 of the suv world so i guess you could kind of expect a lot of things from the model 3. you expect it to kind of look like a tesla but pretty minimal on the inside geared for autonomous driving like the model 3 probably one screen in the middle probably a lower price than the model x those things are all pretty much expected i honestly don't think we'll see that many surprises with model y i mean the design is the one thing we don't know what exactly it'll look like but then past that you know it's an suv suvs are very popular i've been driving an acura suv courtesy of acura thanks to them since my car has been in the shop and when you drive one you notice there are a lot of other suvs on the road especially in america so it makes sense i kind of lowkey think model y might be more important to tesla than model 3 just because of pure volume and just getting that that size of the market but yeah i think it'll be very similar to the model 3 we all know matthew waller just says how many roadsters though i don't know exactly what it means by this but i do have an interesting update to share so if you remember way back at the beginning of 2018 i did a q a with austin where we were talking we were actually at tesla hq doing a video and i mentioned that if enough people used my referral code to buy it as some other tesla model s model x then i would get two percent off per person for a tesla roadster 2020. well in that last quarter of the year as tesla was breaking all their own records and shipping more cars than they ever have a lot of people were ordering to try to get their tax rebates in a lot of people use my referral code and now it currently sits at it says 100 progress to roadster 100 so that's pretty incredible that basically means that enough of you 55 of you use the referral code to equal 100 off the roadster a free roadster but basically there's still a lot we don't know about this program well everyone who's done this have to pay taxes income taxes or capital gains tax on that roadster which is just a massive percentage of it there's a lot of questions that still remain but i just want to say thanks to everyone who's used my referral code who has actually gotten their car i hope you love it in the past couple weeks and months because that's what's turned into 100 progress on this this program hopefully it gets actually released on time all right how's your tesla p100d surgery on apollo has been so far a success i've been tweeting and sharing occasional updates on twitter and i'm sort of keeping a timeline as things go on it's at a body shop it's getting repaired it's not totaled and it will be back now if you remember the original photos the damage was obviously more than skin deep so there's gonna have to be parts that are replaced luckily the body shop that it's gone to which is in new york has had most if not all the parts actually already in stock which is incredible so they you know they take the doors off they take the sides off they sort of inspect everything and they start to go through that process of replacing the parts that need to be fixed they've already done the suspension they've they've done the doors they're doing a lot of the cosmetic stuff now they obviously have to re-wrap the doors the same color that the car was wrapped but they've made a lot of progress so hopefully maybe by the time i get back from ces they'll be almost done concious says you got hardened for mvp this year i just want you guys to hear the the drilling that starts up whenever i turn a microphone on i just can't i can't get a silent moment so i just want to let you just listen to this with me all right so concious says you got hardened for mvp this year i'm gonna go with yes can we see you wearing your glasses actually jeff so a lot of people don't know this but from that what's in my bag video with the verge i had my contact lenses a lot of people were like whoa you wear contacts do you have glasses i actually don't own a pair of glasses anymore i lost my original pair from high school that i did my first videos in so if you'd want to see me in glasses you have to go all the way back to those nine 10 year old videos but i actually since then have not bought another pair of glasses i've worn contacts for like nine years and just stopped worrying about glasses i also tweeted i would like to probably get lasik or something in the next couple years maybe to see 2020 by 2020. why is this drilling so loud it's ruining my 20 20 puns bottom line yes you can see me in glasses but it will be it will be nine year old footage actually if you want to see me in glasses i'll link below again that commercial that i should if you want to see me in glasses more recently you can look back at that commercial i did with under armour and steph curry in 2018 those were just like fake prop glasses for me to appear more as a nerd they don't even have lenses for reflections but that's what i would look like in glasses anyway canopsy wants to know what's one thing you don't want to see at ces 2019 and actually the first response is a bluetooth hair comb that's not that far off i think maybe the best worst tech that i see on a regular basis especially at ces is the adding internet to things that don't need internet or just adding the word smart before something like smart comb you know or a smart toothbrush i don't need a smart toothbrush but it definitely exists i already know what i'm going to see at ces it's going to be a lot of pixels you know all the tvs always show up more 8k tvs than ever probably and there's probably going to be a lot of ai a lot of smart things that's so loud i get far enough away from the microphone they'll probably stop ready anyway anyway that's that's that's that's where i'm gonna end it okay yeah now i'm just i'm just gonna cut it there because i think that's all the time we're gonna get between the drilling thank you for your questions on twitter i hope to see you guys a lot at ces i know there's a lot of people heading out to vegas in the next day or two i'm about to get on a plane about to drop this imac in the bottom of the plane with me and hopefully we'll get some good stuff out of the next couple days either way i hope your notifications are on so you get videos during the wave of stuff that goes through your sub box that's about all i got to say thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace
