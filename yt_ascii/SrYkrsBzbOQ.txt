two weeks ago i received this package at my door launch rocket catapult launcher it came in an amazon box it was addressed to me but i never ordered it nothing happened for a few days i share my amazon account with my family so i just assumed someone else had decided they wanted a catapult but then this came through the ring strike pro it's some sort of archery toy completely different amazon package completely different day but still addressed to me i asked my family about it nothing actually my order history nothing what an earth is going on here well i spent the last two weeks finding out and one thing is for absolute sure it has changed the entire way that i look at and use amazon so the very first thing we need to do is to figure out where these products came from let's launch rocket catapult launcher oh amazon.com this is our listing it had 44 ratings always five stars across the board and these are verified purchases too so it doesn't seem like anything dodgy is going on what about the other oops the other product the ring stripe pro there we go wait 4.9 stars that's literally the highest rating i think i've ever seen on amazon product and the reviews are all just reinforcing how perfect everything was how it arrived on time how everything was as described how it's durable how fun it is for the kids well let's test that theory i won't lie to you i'm actually quite excited for this i never really grow out of toys to strap these to your feet this feels like a bit of a trip hazard rocket [music] so you basically hook the rocket like this oh this feels so scary i feel like the band's gonna snap any second now whoa and then for this one you put the dart through you pull it back and that should automatically create all the elastic we need really hate pulling elastic [music] that was pretty fun i mean don't get me wrong i had an extremely good time with these toys they're fun but still 4.9 stars is insane so my first thought was oh is this company sending out free samples to get reviews well worse yet are they buying reviews the answer in this case is no i was way off the mark there's actually something far creepier going on with these products but on the way to that answer i did learn something about paid reviews that i think you should know and that's just how easy it is to get them see my initial plan was to quickly make a private seller account and see if i could list my cat milo as an item and then pay someone to fake review him with five stars which would be crazy because if they actually knew him they would give him a one maybe a 1.5 however i will give amazon this they've now made sure you have to jump through a lot of hoops to be a seller like this isn't even a comprehensive list but you need at the very minimum a government id bank account chargeable credit card and your phone number it's enough measures that if you were just an amateur trying to be a very minor nuisance then it would probably put you off that's me in this instance so i decided to fake it i wanted to try and find the worst rated product on amazon pretend like it was my listing and then see how simple it would be to pay someone to change that so i decided to pick gaming consoles that'll be fun right well for some bizarre reason amazon does not let you sort by the lowest rated products first only the highest rated so i had to do that and then manually scrub through 81 pages until i finally got to this the usb retro games console which according to the single review that currently existed does not work so if i type into google right now by amazon reviews how to buy reviews for amazon proven hacks there are literally hundreds of these sites okay so i've added one of these review sellers on whatsapp they always tend to give out whatsapp numbers i guess because they deal internationally and i've just messaged them to say hi i'm interested in your services could we hop on a call to talk more one's just replied to say yes they're calling me now hi how are you hi i'm good i'm selling a video game console on amazon people don't seem to like it there's currently only one review and it's a bad review positive preview on your product wow you can remove the bad one okay how many positive reviews can you add how many units 50 or 100 yes i can do it you need a fight then you have to pay [applause] [music] to pay expensive for each verified review you have to actually buy the product yeah i did this thank you very much i'll get back to you cheers bye whoa that is far worse than i was expecting and far easier than i was expecting is just one of what feels like an unlimited number of companies offering the same services like this one here called amazon organic review services they do realize what they're doing is like the exact opposite of an organic review wait you can even buy negative reviews for your competitors products this is crazy i find it absolutely hilarious that the site that is actually selling you fake reviews is displaying how good its own customer reviews are like what are the chances that these are legitimate so this doesn't answer the mystery of the catapult launcher or the ring strike pro just yet but the point is while amazon is clamping down on paid reviews there is still a thriving market for them and it's all because of the simple fact that reviews have a high monetary value to businesses i mean the surveys that show that 80 of amazon users don't buy a product till they've looked at the reviews and so in a very real way reviews equal cash and yet they're just too easy to make all you need for a review is to have an account and you click write review so there is an oversupply which was probably why a 2020 analysis of amazon reviews which trolled through over the 7 100 million of them found that 42 percent were fake i mean in the last year alone amazon is over 10 000 facebook group admins who've been involved in coordinating and managing fake reviews which on one hand sounds great you know they're taking action but then you think man if they shut down 10 000 what's the total number of them that are still operating amazon has over 2 million sellers each with their own library of products all ever changing they just they can't keep a lid on all of it but there's a new player that's just joined the mix in the last couple of years ai we already know at this point the ai is an incredible tool for generating images and music and even jokes but with that power also comes the ability to write reviews and this changes the entire paradigm of fake reviews because in the time that it would have previously taken a person to write one you can now write 50. so i've just opened a bard which is google's ai write me a positive review about a kid's toy that is a catapult go so even though the brief i gave it gives basically no detail about the product itself the ai can just fill in the gaps for you it's a great way for kids to have fun and get some exercise that's basically what half the amazon reviews were saying this is a thing happening right now how do we know well because some sellers don't check the output there's a classic line that chat gbt often uses when it's trying to give context on where it sits on something it says as an ai language model well look at enough amazon reviews nowadays you will see this line you can find it on waist trimmers you can find it on books you can find it on maternity shorts and sometimes you can see they've even accidentally left in the part that shows what prompt they ask the ai to get the response that they got which is the epitome of a joke now don't get me wrong amazon is trying to fight back they've introduced a scheme called amazon vine a program where amazon themselves hand picks a bunch of people to become members almost like becoming a friend to amazon or as some might say primate and those members can select any product they like they can get it for free and then they can leave a review that gets labeled as fine customer review or free product so if you find a review that's labeled as a vine review you can somewhat rest easy knowing that that review is amazon certified plus they've also built an ai of their own that looks at how many reviews an account is leaving the patterns in which seller's profiles they're being left on to try and weed out the fake from the real but i mean that call i had earlier with the fake reviewer was a i mean it's a prime example of how it doesn't really work it's a minefield out there i mean the general consensus online is that if you actually want to be sure then you should paste the link of a product into fake spot which looks like it uses an ai that looks at the reviews and picks up on suspicious grammatical errors so let me try and search up these two products on fake spot to see if it flags anything you just paste the url in there hit enter it says b which according to these guys is a pass but then i guess the question becomes how does fake spot work i have no idea they don't explain what exactly the algorithm looks at and they just expect you to take their rating at face value so after this i decided to look into fake spot some more and turns out it's pretty fake at spotting it's got less than two stars on trustpilot with a lot of sellers commenting on forums that reviews the know r reel are being flagged by it as fake a lot of those sellers then recommended review meta which is a more advanced tool it looks at the number of unverified purchases similarities in the word count of the reviews even things like phrase repetition and even shows you graphs of when each review is left so you can see if they're all clustered at once and so on and i will admit this tool is pretty cool so i was looking at buying a new office chair for my editor recently i pasted the link for it in here and it managed to flag that 30 percent of the thousands of reviews left for it were left by people who'd never reviewed another product that's enough more than the normal for the site to be like hold up this is an usual but behavior there's a decent chance that the seller of this listing is asking people to review it or potentially even financially encouraging people to review it but again the listings for these two products gotta pass and review metra itself while scoring better than fake squats is still barely breaking three stars on trustpilot meaning that essentially there isn't currently a reliable tool out there for you to know for sure if a review is genuine the best thing you can do right now is just use your intuition actually read the review and check to see if it mentions features that are specific to the thing you're looking at the vega the review is the less likely it's written by someone who's actually used it but it gets dodgier because the more i delve into the manipulation of reviews the more i realize how much power the sellers have switch i've spent far too much time browsing amazon for this video but if you're finding it useful then you know we're trying to beat apple and subscribers we're really really close so the sub to the channel would be amazon anyway it's become an incredibly widespread tactic on amazon to when a new version of a product comes out or you just find yourself with a product that has a higher profit margin that you want to shift more of then instead of deleting one of your existing listings and therefore all of the positive reviews that you've accumulated through it you can just update it and change the details to those of your new product so this is what an amazon seller's dashboard will look like and within each product you can then click on edit and then when you click that you can change everything like the vital info will be the core details that you'd see on first glance like the title of a listing but you can change the description you can change the images you can add variations and here is where you change the price and you might think well of course you can that's totally fair and there are plenty of sellers who use these tools for the benefits of the customer but it's just really easy to exploit if you wanted to it creates three potential problems one the sellers can sell something that they know will get great reviews create a popular listing and then swap the product out for something that's not as good for the custom them up but that they will make more money from two the fact that sellers can freely adjust the price means that they can sell a product incredibly cheap rake in those positive reviews because naturally everything's better when it's cheap and in a review everything is judged relative to the price and then once you have the reviews pump up the price and every new customer who comes onto that page is going to read the reviews and assume that those reviews are based on the price that the product is currently at and then if you say buy that product and you think it's actually not worth the money you paid you might well assume that it's probably just you and you're less likely to make a big deal about it because well everyone else seems to like it and then the third thing is that so many sellers have been caught out trying to list multiple separate products as if they're variations of one product so you know when you're looking for something to buy the variations feature is meant to be there so that sellers can add in a few color options or size options but sellers have realized that if they sell something people like let it build up a load of positive feedback and then a good ranking they can then later on just add new products in as variations to the existing listing and make more money from it all of this is happening today and well i think amazon is trying i mean they did just sue the bountiful food supplement company for well doing this exact thing they just need to do more for example they should be making it really clear when someone writes a review what product price that review is based on like no review checking website is going to be able to pick up on these bait and switch tactics you've just got to be aware that they exist and just make sure that the reviews are talking about the specific products that you think you're buying but the single most curious and devious strategy being used by these amazon sellers and what seems like has happened here and here is what's known as a brushing scam so you know amazon is employing their own ai now which can very quickly figure out if you or someone linked to you is trying to game the system well brushing can turn a random stranger into the person who's doing the gaming on your behalf the idea is that every now and again data leaks occur your address for example that you've entered into a site will just be propelled into the public this will often collated by a broker who will then sell that data to in this case a seller or someone that the seller has hired to promote their listing armed with your details then this person can send out a product to that address using the amazon shipping program and mark it as a gift which means that even though the product hasn't been purchased it creates a real amazon tracking number and therefore technically when it gets delivered and then not returned a verified buyer who can leave a verified review you don't do anything they'll be leaving themselves the review you're just there as the object sitting in the middle to be able to prove that a delivery has occurred and because this wouldn't be a paid review or an ai generator review no external site is going to be able to pick it up this would be a human just writing the review as if they were you and here's the kicker it doesn't need to be a review for the product you've received the company doesn't need to ship you the thing that they're writing the review for they just have to do something cheap that they can do in bulk hence these things so i've been sitting here analyzing these specific toys and their listings and the reviews left on those listings to try and figure out what bakery has occurred when actually the reviews written on my behalf may well not have been on these listings at all but instead on any of 15 million different products right now and there is absolutely no way that i could find out which now while obviously there are far worse scams to be a part of than ones that get you products for free receiving unsolicited packages from an amazon seller is a pretty good sign that you've been part of a data league which is why it's so important to set up some sort of safeguard like for me surfshark alert it's a two-pronged attack it'll a check how many times a password you want to use has been breached and therefore how vulnerable an account is but then b if anything does still happen to your email your address your credit card details it'll let you know so that you can do something about it like shoot them with a foam dart alert is just one part of the total security package that you get with surfshark with one price there is a vpn the most reliable vpn i've ever used personally a proper antivirus and the private ad-free internet search oh yeah and price using the code boss you end up at less than three dollars a month with an extra three months for free for unlimited accounts and a money back guarantee
