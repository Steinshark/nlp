what is the best backend language for you i typically hate these kind of questions cuz again as we've seen earlier today you can build a 3d roller coaster in excel 2013 edition you can do anything in any language it really comes down to which language is likely pretty good and it's not about for you okay it's not it's never been about you it's not about you all right pump it up hey pump it up api can be an overwhelming task in this video i will provide some unbiased information on each of these languages to help you decide i will also rank each of these languages based on their traits and reveal the results at the end javascript has a very large community interesting unbiased results i like where this is going i like this this is this is what we're talking about this is what we're talking about also javascript does have a large community javascript has the largest community you want to see something kind of just like in general a little bit odd about like different types of communities and where they hang out on check this out so if i go on here and i'm going to have to find the poll i just did it was it was a couple days ago that was me working out i i wrote off my home gym and so part of me writing off my home gym is me taking pictures of me working out check this out twitter 27% would say they're dream job okay dream job typescript crazy right now let's go to youtube.com/ uhthe prime timeagent and go to community check this out exact same exact same poll typescript 177% go'% rust 24% isn't that weird typescript people love twitter okay they exist on twitter good bad not sure it's just real it's just a thing that's real okay it's just an observation an ecosystem it has plenty of libraries and frameworks available as well despite the misconceptions no gs itself actually performs pretty well however why why are they why are they micro benchmarking us first off i see the word redux in here there's nothing with the word performance oh i didn't even see the memory it it it runs pretty well how much memory oh this one used i assume this is in is this in megabytes or is this so that'd be 10 gigabytes versus 80 cool cool it's definitely not in bytes there's no ain't no way it's in byes is it in btes ain't no way node the node run time ain't no way ain't no way that that's true if you go here and you just go like this node right so i'm just going to go here grab that thing out and i'm going to like this vmrs that it's 41 megs just a start node just like just a just to put it on the screen okay ain't no way ain't no way ain't no way that that is bytes okay nothing in node starts in 81 kilobytes okay no the javascript isn't technically asynchronous as it runs async tasks on a single threet it is asynchronous yes it is not actually it is parallel the the runtime itself can be parallel it's just javascript the language is not parallel but the runtime is parallel you can process many network requests at once and do all sorts of different things you can you can there's many threads that come with v8 v8 has scavenger threads to be able to do background garbage collection it also has main thread garbage collection it has quite a few threads it's just javascript the running thing doesn't should to run at maximum efficiency you can use workers which are similar to multi-threading however these are limited and add a level of complexity and performance overhead javascript is a scalable language do you know that just inste do you know do you know that just you may have heard of just just spawns the amount of node processes that you have cpus if you don't do any configuration with it if you run two tests on my machine i have 11 cores i will get 11 nodes sub processed on top of jest just to run two tests on my my system takes one gigabyte one gigawatt of memory 11 skill issues yeah i know you're right you're right here just test just test you don't believe me check check it check it dog i'm goingon to go to i'm going to go to the js side i'm going to go to the ts side of things we're going to go to test i'm going like this delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete delete there we go we only have two tests running in here okay two tests easy peasy pumpkin seedy okay and then i'm going to go like this npx just and let's go no js config test yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i guess i could have just done that toss it in there we'll hit this thing it's gna oh i forgot to go like that give give me give me that we're going to grab that thing go in here okay no no no rmrf build get the hell out of here all right rerun this thing all right there we go i have two tests 40 second wait personal vmrs vm vmrs p in that boom 1.1 gigabytes look at that thing look go go isn't it wild anyways keep on going scaling is often limited by noes multi-threading capability the javascript ecosystem provides a lot of for security and the developer experience is very intuitive given you're using typescript it's nice having a front end and back you can also use js do people sleep on that all the time js do is equally as valid as typescript it runs through ts server your same lsp that runs typescript also runs js doc and then you don't have to have all that other [ __ ] that goes with it if you use ts node while you're running it you're going to get like a gig a gigawatt of memory okay just you know i'm just saying just saying in the same language javascripts of end driven nature makes writing realtime web apps a breeze c has a huge ecosystem and community as well while c did dh tell you that no dhh does not do js do either okay this is me telling you that js do pretty good okay dhh says don't use js do i say use js do isn't as fast as go rust it still has some good performance capabilities it allows for asynchronous programming and multi-threading and provides some control over memory which isn't always offered by higher level languages this provides a great opportunity for optimization c's objectoriented nature makes it highly scalable and c's frameworks provide a wide range of security i'm just waiting for ryan winchester ryan winchester i heard oop and highly scalable can we please ryan winchester can we please get something in here gave me a law good enough okay okay i mean i i agree that c's pretty good the options while c has a steeper learning curve than simpler languages it is still relatively easy to pick up it has strong integration into idees and is full of useful syntax for the developers with this said c will vs code confirmed ide haters going to hate haters going to hate hate us cuz they ain't us will require a b of boiler plates as much as the popularity of php has decreased over time it's still a relatively popular language today this may be because of its reliance on old the websites however a lot of developers appear to enjoy it php also offers a wide r i think they enjoy lamborghinis like can we all be real here they all enjoy the lambos that's really what they're enjoying okay this whole cult of making millions of dollars doing things productively in phb i mean it's it's it's it's completely a farce you know what i think that we should continue to argue over the greatest javascript abstracted framework on top of a framework throwing a little bit of redux instead of actually doing something okay i'm not about that php lifestyle okay i am about that theoretical lifestyle okay i'd rather talk about why rust is good than write code to make money you know what i mean of libraries and frameworks overall php's performance is decent being similar to nodejs php also provides the option for multi-threading it is scalable for most websites however it won't be as efficient as some of its competition a big misconception is that php is not a secure language this is due to php's early days when it had many security flaws it's not inherently insecure however due to its dynamic typing it is easier for developers to make mistakes it is also well known for being a pain to work with due to its older versions however recently they have made some big improvements this dynamic typing may be a turnoff for developers and it allows for bad programming practices as his compiler is not very strict overall fair i mean that's fine i mean you could do you can still do global variables in in in c++ you can do it in you can do it in i mean really you can make it work in rust sort of you can you can do it in node right it's not like there isn't a global this object right like you can do it you can do it what compiler got them it's called hack okay yeah typescript i mean to be fair typescript has any it's true tj typescript has any which is like the ultimate fix all of your problems because it's actually not type system it is just lint all the developer experience is down to preference of the developer goang does have many tools available for web development but it's worth noting that there are still things missing from the ecosystem unlike other languages there aren't many large frameworks that provide a large amount of features most of those web frameworks are relatively light weights goang is one of the fastest languages in can i redo that here for a second i swear they said that go doesn't have a lot developer goang does have many tools available for web development but it's worth noting that there are still things missing from the ecosystem unlike other languages there aren't many large frameworks that provide a large amount of features i wonder what i wonder what they mean by missing features i want to know what i i mean just genuinely i i i want to know what he means when he says missing features because go feels fairly complete right it kind of feels like its own simple complete lang i mean it has it has temple missing features is job security from spaghetti code si sick bird tj most of go's web framewor rel lightweights goang is one of the fastest languages in this list it provides good options for multi-threading and allows for the use of channels are so good like if you've never solved problems with channels like when you realize how many problems are solved by using channels and then you use channels for the first time you realize like wow syntax level support of channels is so dang cool i know there's problems around channels and all that kind of crap but but syntax level support is incredible because you have channels in rust as well it's just like the feel of a rust channel versus a go channel is like they're not even in the same ballpark right it's like it's pretty incredible what you get out of what you get out of k channels are like the useful part of llang without the brain labotomy of the language sh right winchester's around here point is g pointers in garbage collection have come under some criticism however this isn't a concern for most i just see piece of [ __ ] lawn mower in that piece of [ __ ] lawn mower this is like a piece of [ __ ] lawn mower however this isn't a concern for most applications unless you're dealing with as much by the way this is all outdated right like these huge spikes and stuff in go there's a lot of tuning that they're doing they're even considering like memory arenas and stuff like that there's zero allocation proto buff things there's like some really really good stuff going on in the go world and so i am very curious where they're going to go with some of these things i think they're doing a great job right i think there's a lot of good stuff this guy is like a lawnmower yeah larry ellison wait was it larry ellison right that was the lawn mower i can't remember if it was a larry ellison this guy's like a lawn mower i'm not even sure what that means to this day like to this day that that phrase haunts me cuz i'm like what the hell mak him a lawnmower why is why am i not a lawnmower was discord goang has also improved their garbage collection over time it is a highly scalable language and great for micros servicing security goang is something you need to be more careful about as go's smaller ecosystem leads the developer to write a lot of functionality on their own making it easier to write vulnerabilities by accident goang is a simple language and very easy to learn it may lack some of the quality of life features that you are used to and will naturally i'm happy they don't allow classes i think go has just the right amount right like one thing that i really appreciate about go i i think that is kind of o over underwhelmingly stated in this is is the fact that you can do like type foo is a string array and then i can do something sweet like funk fu and i can like i can attach methods to a type like to me this is one of the just like it's just like so cool right like that is super super super super nice kind of feature they're just fantastic like it's just something i really do love i don't know how else to say it because it it gets rid of some of those things that are super annoying like sometimes you just want functions hanging off of like primitive types you want to be able to alter things to the way you want it as opposed i know i dude i sorry got him all right anyways you get the idea i just love that i i i do love that require you to write more code than other languages this does come with the advantage of having full control over your application despite misconception java is still a very popular language and has a large ecosystem it has a similar efficiency to php andc sharp but is known for using quite a lots of i want i want to hear what it had to say there hold on what did it say its performance was efficient to php and c but is known for using quite lot of memory java is php and c on the same level of efficiency i didn't think they were that's cool provides multi-threading support however this isn't as efficient as traditional multi-threading java is known for being very secure and has some strong type safety and memory safety java is relatively easy to learn however it does require lot of boilerplate code and i don't know how java is any more secure than go i i don't quite understand that can become quite complicated python has a huge community and some good web frame performance is where python falls flat i don't i don't know what they're testing but this is fantastic i don't know what's going on here other than this is hilarious i also don't understand why c is slower than java by a lot okay so there's two things obviously wrong with this graph one python that's hilarious but two c being two and a half times slower than java skill issues there is skill issues like i've never seen in my lifetime going on in this graph a l slower than other options python's multi-threading also has some limitations python's biggest weakness the for loop damn got me with that for loop meaning that the cpu can't work at maximum efficiency the popular django framework has a considerable amount of security features however python people python just focus on python we're not talking about anything else right now we're talking about python fbi open up dynamic typing system makes it easier to write vulnerable code with this said the jango framework is known to be quite complex and can be quite limiting ruby is commonly i thought jango was pretty good i my my limited use of d jango was it was pretty good i didn't think that was like a thing right a good movie it was a good movie i didn't think it was complex and limiting i thought it was just pretty good like it's not the best i know it has some like pretty cool web component tie-ins jango plus hdmax plus web components can be like a pretty dang good time i've seen a lot of people talk about how good that is fast api fine yeah jango django unchain good movie django i like to call it django just to watch people get just just they flip out when people people know how something is pronounced and they feel like you're not in the club they will they will tell you about it okay specifically django the dead the dead language while it is less popular it is still a widely used language and provides a wide variety of libraries ruby is one of the slowest languages in this list and its multi-threading is also slower than other languages ruby is known for limiting flexibility and can become quite complicated to scale it has a good range of tooling what a sales pitch it's slow it's multi-threading slow and it's kind of complicated it's like oh okay to ass use this language however dynamic typing can lead to more vulnerability ruby is very easy to learn and has a rich standard library rust has a relatively small community partially caused by its complexity but the loudest community can we be real here can we be real here just like for a second maybe russ community what they lack in being big they have with the ability of their voice like they're i mean they're the loudest group on mastadon i mean just imagine what it's like like to be on mastadon like i can't cuz i'm not on mastadon but i bet they're tooting up a storm right now just tooting just tooting a storm about rust and how they're rewriting everything in it despite this there are still a good range of tools and libraries available rust is by far the most performing option on this list and is often compared to the likes of c++ its memory management is incredibly innovative and guarantees memory safety it also provides some power where is the pronunciation of in innovative where does that mean he's from i can't say i've ever seen i've never heard that pronunciation so i'm just curious is is that uk is that is that british mate do you guys call it in innovative innovative because i've heard a couple words he said that were different i was like dude where i wonder where that's tanzanian i don't i don't believe that at all i swear english are just the worst at english i swear english is just the worst at english have you ever heard the crazy theory that people from virginia speak the truest form of english right because like england's english today and there many variants is closer to like the queen's english whereas like proper young people proper commoner english is actually more like virginian yeah how great how great is that there's no true english yes there is actually a true english it's the it's the english that was spoken by the plebs for for a millennia and then the big fracture happened where america came in kicks some ass and then they're all like w get me a teammate i don't know what they sound like okay in my head that's what all english people sound like like really crappy australian accent and and so that's just that's my view of the world amen multithreading capabilities rust is a highly scalable language due to its advanced set of features it does russ does you know when they talk about scaling russ's biggest weakness and i think o camel solves this the best is that you have lifetimes as a part of the type i really do think that that's a big that's a big it's a big hard one because right now like i'm writing a little fun program right now i called it paladin i i called it paladin it's a pretty it's a pretty clever little program right now at netflix that does like a bunch of scraping of data out of our like internal test suite and one thing that i know is that i've intentionally not made it efficient because i'm just downloading for the most part but if i were to make this efficient and share references like i would explode the amount of references and everything so as as your project grows when you want to change and make things more efficient using references and stuff you leak out that abstraction really hard and so it's it's a very interesting language it's a great language i love using it but i i recognize that it's also interesting rush forces you to have good form i i don't know if i buy that either there's a lot of good things about it all for objectoriented programming as well however this is different to other languages its small ecosystem can make it harder to develop certain features as well i don't think it has a small ecosystem i think rust actually has a rust has one of my favorite ecosystems cuz when you when you parse json you use sde right when you want to do your own format you use sday when you want to go async you just pretty much use tokyo like there's like kind of like the package for everything which i think is pretty nice when you want to do csv you use csv parser by burnt sushi it's pretty good right like there's something about it that when you want to do command line arguments you use clap okay you don't go like this command you don't you don't do this this old dance command line arg parser node and then you get what top 10 command line arguments there's so many different ones that come with command line parsing there are so many different ones that come with it it's just like there's there literally is thousands of different packages to do it and they're all different and it's it's all emotionally painful whereas if you've ever used clap clap clap is the reason why i prefer rust for cli applications more than anything else clap is that good it's that good if you've never used it shocking rust is great for rightous secure applications as its strict compiler provides type and memory safety enforcing dangerous or buggy code rust's biggest flaw is its complexity and incredibly steep learning curve to learn rush you must understand a lot about memory safety and understand the borrow checker deeply with this said you're welcome for the screen tearing when used properly russ can make the developer experience incredibly rewarding and enjoyable all right before we do this i want you guys to i want everybody to say what they think is the language he's going to choose typescript c sharp php go java python ruby or rust which one oh let's do a prediction no i can't do a prediction you guys will just watch it ahead of time and then ruin it what do we got what do we got here c we got some cps in there we got nextjs typescript i bet you it's going to be typescript my guess is typescript lua i think it's gonna a lot of go and cp in there i'd love dude if it's go i would love that i think that would be really incredible i don't think it's going to be go it depends you think oh no if it's it depends i'm going to just i'm going to just be so rageed quitting i'm going to watch this later by the way doom 10th anniversary all right here we go it looks like people want go or c now here's a list of rankings i've made for each language bear in mind that these are my opinions based on my listas as the best overall language for multi-purpose back i'm in like complete shambles i'm in complete shambles right now i am in i have never been in so much shambles in my lifetime i do like what he did though i actually i actually really appreciate this type of uh idea right here can we just pause for a second this is really cool ecosystem and community javascript 10 out of 10 i think is a failure okay i think russ should have been higher i think go should have been higher i think javascript ecosystem is actually one of the worst i would have put it at like the second to bottom and i would have put python as the bottom right like python i thought i think python though it's like one of the greatest its environment and like ecosystem and how it works together is just so effing annoying it's more annoying than javascript by like this much by like that just like that much the fact just let let me have my opinion okay performance fair i'd say fair take here fair take on performance fair take i don't know about php versus java i can't quite say who's faster you know when you throw bun into the mix maybe it's better i don't know scalability fair i i would say fair here as well security i don't know about security i don't know the difference between java c and go like they all should get the same like go getting a six versus these two getting sevens i don't really buy that security is more like a a skill issue more than anything else these days like it wasn't a skill issue at one point because there's just so many open vulnerabilities in like everything but it's no longer like that's not it's not nearly the same anymore it is just a skill issue at this point developer experience 10 out of 10 for javascript i think that's true in small in small doses right i think this is true in toy projects i think javascript has a great developer experience but typescript you start adding in things like the amount of extra stuff you need is really effing annoying like if you just need to parse some file grab out a few things and add some stuff together and do all that javascript's pretty fine right like that's why i chose javascript to speedrun advent of code because i can just like split join split join join split split split join split join right like you can just like fly really quickly it's there's a lot of easy things about javascript but that developer experience ends as the project gets bigger split join right developer experience of go it's pretty good c i'm assuming it's pretty good i feel like i i feel like the developer experience one and the community one are the real ones that are kind of these are perceptual these are a bit more i mean developer experience security and ecosystem feel more perceptual these two feel probably done a little bit better so given that my opinions based on my list i think my list would be slightly different but i like this i like his style i like this development which is kind of ironic considering i've never used c for backend it also i love that ending by the way that ending was hilarious that that ending was just so good i was following him up until that part where he's like and i've never used it i was like what but i especially on developer experience to be able to rank something that you've never used with developer experience is a bit iffy but i will say i will i will i will strongly say that i'm sure it has a pretty good developer experience i also have't used it development when choosing these languages consider your project scale and your own personal preference decide for yourself which one suits you best it's also worth noting that micros servicing has made it possible to combine the use of multiple languages using each for its own use case in addition the capability of these languages is limited by the competence and expertise of the developers working with them skill issues in other words skill issues thanks for watching and if you found this video useful consider liking and subscribing i actually liked the video i actually i thought there was a lot of good parts about this video i'm actually nice look at that coding with lewis let's go coding with lewis let's go i actually there's a lot of things i really really liked about this video i think that it was good i think he chose good languages to go over ruby on ruby on rails i think ruby could have been dropped probably for elixir i'd be more curious about elixir and how he would rank these things ruby scales good ruby doesn't scale good ruby does not scale good i prefer to write my back ends in pierc okay i'm more happy with php plus larval right now yeah i think one thing that wasn't mentioned in the php p section is the sweetness of lel and how amazing people seem to say say it is c for the win rust has the most complete ecosystem and once you've learned the borrow checker you don't have to deal with stuff like jsbs i think okay i don't think it has a complete ecosystem it's a good ecosystem though it's much better and it's much reduced and i'd also say that the average person programming some of these rust packages that we use in the ecosystem are probably better programmers than some of the people creating the javascript stuff okay there i said it there i said it skill issues okay i said it i said it i said it combined iq of rust developers the on10th the size of javascript developers probably bigger you know that iq that iq measuring of a stranger thing that's what we're doing right now we should do iq measuring of a of a stranger oh my goodness that is such a mean tweet but it seems so exciting it seems so so exciting iq stranger test i'm sure you've seen this one i'm sure you've seen this one go right here let's pause this this why have i not thought about this why have i not thought about this oh my goodness oh my goodness this is so good this is a meme for iq language ranking right here look at what we're saying here look at what we're saying i want to put a super offensive language at the end too like i actually want to make this whole thing just deeply offensive for anybody that looks at it you know what i mean like i want everybody that looks at this to be super upset can we all agree that that's probably the way to do this like i don't want it to be serious i want people to be genuinely upset ruby on on rails like i want people to be hurt ruby lang there we go let's just take this one let's save image as ruby check this out we got something good going here we we're cooking okay i'm cooking i'm cooking we're cooking we're cooking so good right now so i'm just going to put ruby at the bottom because it's hilarious though i i do i like where i'm going here i like where i'm going we're going to put ruby right here all right we're going to put ruby right here and and then just to make all the rust people really angry cuz that's obviously next i mean come on that's obviously next what we're going to do here anyone that thinks we're not going to make the rust people angry you just you're crazy okay you you're actually crazy where's the color colors colors alpha where's the alpha oh they changed all the things they changed it there used to be this color to alpha color to alpha there we go perfect there we go bam bam bam maybe they didn't change it skill issues on my behalf skill issues my behalf skill issuing super hard rust obviously we're going to do this to make everybody upset all right so now this is where we get to play this is where we get to play on some good stuff here so the first thing i think about doing is throwing in not a programming language html okay this feels like the right move right here so i feel like this is this is the one we got to do is we got to take html html okay i feel like this is the move and we're going to zoom in on it they even have a stupid lo nice job with your dumb logo here we're going to do a little fuzzy select do that and then we're going to color let's go layers add alpha channel and then we'll delete this this is trust me this is like all the iq for for those that are wondering i have much iq here i'm not even this very shly done so clearly html 5 is the smartest programming language like clearly now here's ooh htm x i was thinking about doing htm x as well now here's so i was thinking about doing htm x let's see what we got for htm x let's i mean is there a good enough logo so this is what we're going to do i'm going to take this one and i'm going to save this i'm going to save this image htm x yeah i'm going to replace whatever i had before don't even care don't even care this is trust me this is this is this is meme gold okay we're making meme gold and then i'm going to put this over here right i'm going to put it over here as its own or even probably even better is just take this one move it up here and move this one right here there we go i feel like that's pretty good i feel like this is pretty good i think i think we're in a good place i think we're in a good place so now we got to think of where do we put the rest then i'm going to do what what is the skateboard ramp head skateboard ramp forehead what's that meme what's that meme i do i'm not going to do ah maybe i should do it i want to put him right here and then put typescript right there skate parkage here just just so oh that's like a play i don't want to play one all right just so i don't uh just so i can make everybody happy i'm going to go like this i'm going to take the skat park one because this will make this will make everybody happy right because no one will be able to argue this one by going over here and having this guy right here we'll just slightly have it off screen because i i don't know i'm pretty scuffed and then do javascript not typescript javascript because that you know because that's like because then people they they can't like quite disagree with it you know they they're they're they're upset and they know they're upset but they can't technically be upset all at the same time you know what i mean like you gotta it's it's all about that it's all about that artful troll there we go so now what do we put in here now the real question is what do we put in here i don't know how to be offensive here so i'm thinking that just toss in css because you know we're we're already making people angry let's just toss in css can we just toss in css and then php in there i think php and css would be great php and do a little css i'm going to put css over here you know i i'm going to admittedly not make it the top o tailwind o tailwind oh tail you who said that who who came up with the greatest idea ever of tailwind tailwind of course don't say css say tailwind oh my goodness tailwind it's so funny it is it is so funny it is so funny to do to do that that is so funny nice nice and then probably put in python i think python's probably a w all right there we go oh why am i doing that i can just copy image all right python definitely w's here okay so where did python go i'm thinking python should be below php i think python should be below php can i do that oracle squel oh that's pretty good i should put squel i should put i put i should put squeal squeal is by far just hilarious that is just so cursed to have here it's just so cursed o jity 4 jippy 4 or squeal excel that that's a good one excel oh excel i think that's the winner people i'm sorry but i love i like that one too much i like that one too much to have to not have excel i like it too much it's too funny it's just too funny to have excel in here well by the way everybody you guys get to watch me i'm gonna get canceled today programming language iq tier list boom it's just a fact just a fact tailwind off center that's perfectly fine why oh make tailwind off center oh no we're not going to do that even though that's funny it's too much work it's too nuy you know what i mean it's too nucy to do such thing but this is great this is great this is a tweet that is gonna just ruffle some serious feathers the the the feathering is going to be out of control very excited very excited well done everybody well done
