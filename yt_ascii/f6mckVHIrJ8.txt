foreign welcome back to another episode of talk tech with tiff in this episode i sat down with maria who is a chief of staff she works currently as a chief of staff at a fintech company previously chief of staff at uber but tech wasn't always in her path she actually started out in college studying neuroscience and then transitioned into chief of staff we're going to cover how she made that leap and what it took also to really diving into imposter syndrome i know i learned a lot and and how to think of imposter syndrome in many different ways from this episode also if you haven't already make sure to subscribe to my monthly newsletter i linked it down below it's completely free and features some unique discount codes job postings and career advice okay let's dive into it [music] welcome to brian sitting about their career journeys and current roles i created this series to hear from people who are established in the tech industry so that we can all learn what these individuals do in their day-to-day jobs and the type of opportunities out there [music] hi maria how's it going hi tiff it's good welcome to new york you know it's happy to have you here i know i am so happy to have connected with you in person because i feel like it's so strange the internet like i feel like on one hand i i know you for so long maybe not but then this is our first time meeting in person i know we've known each other for like a year and a half probably on instagram but similarly i'm like i feel like i know everything about you but then we just had a conversation about you're taller in person than i thought and like all of these things and so it's great to see you i know and by the time this airs other personal things will have problems yes it's very exciting though how are you i'm good i'm good it's actually it's beautiful weather in brooklyn today as you know this is like the best season the fall when it's the leaves are changing everyone has the energy so it's good and and i'm excited to just chill this weekend do some brunch perfect yes brunch is key yeah i agree so we did an instagram live a long time ago it feels like but the conversation we had really stuck with me because your journey into your current role as chief of staff is so to me it's so inspiring it's not a straightforward path which i love i love because i think it does such a great way of showing that hey you know it's so important to pivot and and to to identify what you're passionate about and where your interest lies so for those who are listening and don't know about your background and your journey i'd love to for you to share a little bit more about it yeah thanks for having me and letting me share my story so for those of you who don't know me i'm maria born and raised in southern california so i'm from orange county i moved to new york about five and a half years ago when i started my career and i come from a family of my mom's a doctor and my dad works works in computer science type stuff but i was the first in my family to really go to school like college in the united states both of my parents studied abroad and i have two younger sisters so i think a lot of where i get my inspiration for sharing my journey is is giving advice to my younger self or my younger sisters because when i was navigating it i had no role models or people that i could look up to and say what is a career in tech look like i didn't even know tech existed as a field right for me growing up in a brown immigrant family it was you're either going to be a doctor you're going to be a lawyer or you're going to be an engineer and there's no other career path available right yeah that's it so for the longest time i was pre-med i actually studied neuroscience in university which is nothing to do with my day-to-day but it wasn't until i got to college where i realized the vast careers that exist that are outside those three fields and i would have never been exposed to those had i not gone to university and you know had a good guidance counselor or had these things but it's unfair that that is what led me to this path and i didn't have the resources that exist for others who maybe have parents or siblings or just a network outside of that so my career journey starts i guess in college really where i was pre-med and just didn't enjoy that path i think i enjoyed studying science because i've always been good at science and neuroscience particularly is really interesting it's super interesting and it connects to business like when you think later down the line about decision making and purchase power it's all related to science right but at the time i was like i don't want to be in a lab i don't really want to do the research so i stumbled upon an internship at jp morgan at the time which was called these programs still exist today they're called launching leaders and winning women so they're initiatives that are put on by wall street to bring more women and diversity into the field so i applied to this program that just said free trip to new york i didn't even know that it was an internship or anything like that this is how naive i was i mean i was also 19 at the time yeah and i had no role models right so i was like free trip to new york i've never been to new york let's go right and at the time my parents you know for those of us who grow up in you know immigrant households travel isn't always like accessible and things like that so my parents were were like okay you can do it for school purposes right so i was like okay great we got a free trip to new york so i applied to this program and miraculously got in even though i probably shouldn't have given the qualifications but i got in because i think they my interviewer was just like i see something in you excited to you know whatever so they gave me a chance there and the program was really interesting it was actually an interview process that happened to be disguised as a summit maybe someone who knows the industry better would know that it was an interview but i didn't because i thought it was just a you know some in new york for women in tech or women in finance at the time so the two weeks leading up to that so my interviewer was like by the way you have a super day to get an interview and i didn't even know what a super date is yeah but now we do right like it's a it's a four-step interview process so for two weeks that i was a neuroscience major i didn't even know what an accounting statement was i just crash course everything good job yeah i had two weeks between like getting the like getting the interview and then the interview to learn everything i need to know about finance so i just did a self-crash course and these are resources i still share to this day you know there's there's a resource called 100 questions to get into investment banking they're all free resources youtube is amazing if you just search like discounted cash flow or whatever that's what i did for two weeks they just crash course i learned everything i needed to know about finance or at least enough to get through the interviews right and then i got the internship and so that was really what started my career so i did about a year and a half on wall street as a full-time analyst but i also did two internships so i interviewed interned at jpmorgan twice once in equity capital markets and once in healthcare banking and decided to come back full-time in healthcare banking so i was a healthcare investment banker for about a year and a half and then i moved to tech four years ago well five years ago now but four years ago at the time and did four years at uber which you know and i recently about a few months ago moved over to a fintech company and so that's that's a shortened version of the career journey but really what i want to say is you i think sometimes we can have a set perspective of what our journey can look like and and oftentimes we set that very early on right at 19 years old yes and now that i'm almost 27 it's like i didn't know what existed back then right yeah and so i guess if i look back on on the journey i would just say let have a vision of your life but also don't have it be so rigid that it prevents you from exploring what comes along the way yeah i love that i actually it's funny i know you know you're saying this to people who are just starting out but honestly i needed to hear that right now because i think sometimes even as you grow in your career or and i maybe it's just certain personalities and i'm one of them i have moments where and paul my my partner can attest to this where it's like you know like late at night i like wake him up and i'm like where am i going to be in the next five years what's going to happen yeah is this you know what i mean like in all of this fear so yeah having that kind of you know vision or plan but also being open because you really don't know how it will will translate yeah okay wait going back a second here you when that interview and internship internship occurred were you done were you did you have to go back to college afterwards yeah so did you finish then neuroscience or did you switch yeah yeah so this was my sophomore year of university for those international that's your second year out of four and typically even today in the american university process your main internship is the summer between your junior and senior year yes so the year before you graduate but i encourage all of you if you can get internship this summer between your sophomore and junior year that's great because then you can set up for next year so this was that time period so essentially this was october around this time of my sophomore year where i applied to the internship yeah and i got it for that summer and then did the summer internship got a return offer to come back to the company for the next summer so smart yeah so then went back to school and you know did my junior year and then went back to jp morgan but in a different group because i wanted to explore and then at the end of that summer i got a return offer a full-time return offer so by august before my senior year i actually had a job offer lined up for next year now i know the environment today like i actually wouldn't recommend that today because of if you're working in tech finance is more set yeah but if you're working in tech i mean you've seen all the layoffs recently there were sins the offer so i actually you know i tell my sister this who just interned in tech over the summer she's she's a university she's much younger than me and so she i told her you know even if you get a return offer continue to network because you never know right now in tech when things are you know unfortunately getting pulled so true but back to your question i ended up yes i graduated with the neuroscience degree so i have a neuroscience degree that i never use but i actually decided to double major in business yes so what i did was i for me the actual science was interesting the classes i was taking like i mentioned decision making thinking about a neural pathway ways all of that's really interesting to me just as a curiosity point not really from a tactical perspective but i was already a business minor even my first year because i thought i was going to open a clinic or i thought i wanted to be as i said a doctor and i said if i'm going to be a doctor i could work in a clinic business is helpful right and so when i was taking my business classes i think business majors get a bit of a bad rep sometimes because people think it's an easy major it's a little bit of a you know an easy time but i do think that if you have the ability to study business the practical skills that you gain you know i took a class on resume writing i took a class on interviews i took a class on communication these are skills that i use to this day you know and are so transferable and so transferable i like the combination of my majors because i felt like my neuroscience major thought taught me to think deeply about the world and think more philosophically whereas my business major was very tactical yeah like i learned i learned skills that were very much like excel but again i didn't do those until my junior and senior year yes so by that time i already had my internship so the other thing is if it does not matter what you study in university yes yeah in tech today i knew people who are philosophy majors neuroscience majors communications majors that do anything and i know your path you know you you study fashion and then and then you worked in you know tech and encoding right so exactly i think it's really up there you can do whatever you want and for me that combination was just interesting as i went through my exactly exactly and it's so true and i always say too you know even though after after college university you know you didn't necessarily pursue a career with neuroscience i'm sure a lot of you mentioned it it meant it it showed you the world or you got to think of the world in a more scientifical way and even though it might not directly apply to your role right now i'm sure there are so many things that just translate in different ways you know like definitely i think it just i think different thought processes help you learn in different ways yeah and and you also meet a wider group of people right and so now to this day i think you know i work in the business side of tech as well we'll talk about but i interact with engineers all the time i interact with product all the time and a lot of those folks come from science backgrounds right and so understanding how maybe i think versus others think that that comes from a background of studying different things and just being open to different thought processes yeah and that's such such an important skill understanding how others think that a lot of people maybe aren't so good at so i think it's really really awesome what are okay so let's let's get into the business side and talk a little bit about the role of chief of staff great you know i guess maybe let's start with and i'm kind of going a little off script here but for those chief of staff when i think of chief of staff i'm like that is a massive title i'm like well that's so what is what does it entail and maybe every company is a bit different but for someone who isn't as familiar with the role or curious about it yeah so chief of staff is i would say a relatively new-ish role in popularity in tech i would say it's come to the industry maybe five or six years ago and it actually has its background in politics which is interesting like the role of chief of staff was like presidents would have chief of staffs as advisors so they were separate to their day-to-day staff and their function in in politics was to be a third party advisor to someone in power right and so tech now five six years ago adopted this role because they realize that if you think about an executive let's say a ceo of your company or a cfo or something like that they typically have a bunch of people that report to them right they could have hundreds thousands of people that report to them and they all have different functions yes and they all have maybe interests that are within their own teams right they they're not unbiased in their incentives so the idea of a chief of staff is you are reporting to your executive but you don't have a specific scope within that team so that you can be somewhat of an unbiased third party and so realistically when i think about the chief of staff role it's so different based on who you support some chief of staffs are highly analytical some chief of staffs are highly focused on communication yeah and org management and so it really sometimes executives look for a chief of staff that's like their clone right like they're an extension of them they're a second person yeah and sometimes chiefs sometimes executives look for chief of staffs who are their exact compliment so maybe they're great analytically but they're not good with communication so they hire chief of staff who's really good with communication can round up their skills this is my second chief of staff role which we'll we'll talk about i did a chief of staff role at uber and and now i'm doing a chief of staff role at this fintech company and they're so different you know my last chief of staff role i would say that i was that compliment yeah here where i served as a counter to my principal and now i would say i'm more of an extension and so it's interesting to have both of those backgrounds but if i were to boil down what it's a chief of staff do because on my instagram that's the number one question what is achieving staff what do you do how do you become a chief of staff yes i would say it's three different job functions okay and i would say i spend 30 percent of my time in each of them so on a given week maybe one week it's all on one area but then over time it it evens out so i would say the first bucket is project and program management okay so if you support an executive you i will oversee a lot of our day-to-day core processes like our you know executive qbrs executive reviews i oversee all of our off-sites action items just really making sure that the business is moving forward and and making sure that my executive set up for success yes the second bucket is really strategic projects so say you're in the org and a project is across the business there's no natural owner yeah that's where i would come in so i may be parachuting for two to three months clean up a certain thing and then move on yes so it's somewhat similar to consulting and that's why yeah yeah but internal yes yeah and then you report directly to your executive so you can clean things up move them quickly and move them faster and i actually did a corporate strategy role previously so that's most similar to this part the job yeah and then the last bucket i would say is it's like people management and the people side of things yes so i i manage my executive executive assistant i also oversee a lot of our people initiatives so i'm sitting on our women's board and and planning certain events focusing on diversity focusing on hiring focusing on interviews so really the people side of things is the last bucket of of the role and so it varies like one day i could be deep in a model doing some kind of financial analysis and the next day i could be thinking about our growth strategy and then the next day i could be thinking about hiring people right and so that's what i really like about this world i think it's very varied and it's very different yes but i don't think it's for everyone for that reason also yeah so kind of on that note and i want to get to get to get to that last point it's not for everyone as well but but going back to okay first of all that role is intense in the best way possible but you know if you're someone who adapts to and thrives in that environment of working in wearing multiple hats and and really yeah cross-functional with so many different teams and people and it's that's yeah the role itself is as big as the title not always i think you know what's interesting is people don't realize that it's it's one of those roles where you will always be the most junior person in the room by design ah so the reason for that is you i think the perfect time to be a chief of staff if anyone's interested in the wall is about like five to ten years into your career okay so let's say that you know you're not so junior like you're not right out of school you're not an analyst you're not right there yes because if you're too junior you don't have the executive presence and influence to actually do the job but if you're too senior let's say you're 15 plus years you're 20 years you're you you're too senior to do the nitty-gritty parts of the job because you you know in my role i draft all my executives communications i manage all of our action items i manage our trackers that's not something that say like a vp svp wants to do right or is used to doing for many years so i think that sweet spot is like five to ten years into your career when you're kind of like a manager yes senior manager you've had some kind of experience with management you've had some kind of experience with analytics but you're also not you know used to overseeing hundreds of teams because it's it's an independent contributor role yes you know in tech we have individual contributor roles which are ic roles and then you have manager roles yes and i've done both i was a manager and in this role i'm mostly an ic i oversee just one person and so that's different than say overseeing a team of like 10 15. yeah so i think it's it's really that sweet spot of doing it right there i think i view it personally as my own executive mba so i never went to business school yes and that's a separate topic we don't need to go into that i have a lot of reasons for that but but i view my chief of staff gig because often it's a two to three year job yes like there's a somewhat of an understanding that says you're going to do this role for two to three years and you'll move on and go back into the business be a manager do something like that so i view it as my equivalent of a paid mba because you take a step back you re-evaluate what you want to do and in every strategic project i do i think do i want to work in marketing for example if i'm doing a marketing project do i want to work in communications do i want to work in finance and so that's a little bit of the benefits of the role so in the sense of it is a lot of responsibility you're often encounter like i often encounter imposter syndrome in the sense of being the most junior person in the room because it's very easy to say why am i here you know i only have you know five six years of experience but folks here have 20 why am i here so so it is in that sense challenging but on the flip side you're in rooms that you would never be in yeah if you weren't in this role exactly and so yeah major pros to the role i would say but also not cons but it's not an easy one yes in that sense yes exactly okay i mean look at our questions here or else i'm going to ask you so many questions that are totally continuing because i feel like you know i have some well you know what we're doing we're good we're good we're on script okay exactly okay you know what then on that note and i'm i'm kind of going again off script but you mentioned you know oftentimes being in the most junior person in the room and you're sitting there with a bunch of executives just even sharing that is for a lot of people it's like whoa that's intense so how do you how do you kind of overcome or i don't know if overcomes the right word but how do you navigate those feelings of like should i be here or not do you know what i mean though like how do you navigate yourself yeah yeah yeah i think that is a a constant battle i think that you know one of the things that we talk about especially as women in tech and you know women from underrepresented backgrounds in tech particularly i don't think that feeling goes away i've read many articles that have tried to say like you know here's how you overcome the imposter syndrome yeah or here's how to get rid of it and i think more so what i recommend is how do you live with it in a manageable way love that because every step of the way i faced imposter syndrome when i was working in investment banking and at that time no one looked like me and you know i didn't see any brown women in investment banking let alone brown women who like to do their hair and like to do their makeup and wore you know pink blazers to work like i didn't see any of that right and and and that was a different kind of imposter syndrome that was just you know why am i here you know not can i do the job because i had done internships two internships and i was like i can do the job but more just i don't feel like i belong here then i moved to tech and then i felt a certain slew of imposter syndrome that wasn't you know i saw people who look like me but i just didn't feel like i had the qualifications for the job that's when i felt and i think we talked about this when i first applied to uber the role that i applied to asked for four to six years of experience and i only had one and a half at the time and and i i still applied for the job and we could talk about that separately and got the job but then when i was in the role i was like the imposter syndrome that hit was a competency related imposter yes i was like i don't know what i'm doing people would say acronyms all the time they were like oh can you use sequel to figure this out and then or sql to figure something yeah i don't know what that yeah i was like what is that and then i look it up and it's like a somewhat coding language and i was like this this is not i don't know how to do this right i i didn't know how to use sql yeah yeah but that that was a different kind of imposter syndrome than the lack of belonging and then now it's an imposter syndrome of not competency and not belonging but more so why me ah like why am i in this role why did i get this opportunity and not someone else who maybe is more qualified than me yes and so each of these imposter syndromes have been different and different to navigate and so my advice would be first recognize that you're going to have imposter syndrome at every stage in your life yeah and just learn to be comfortable with it learn to manage it the second would be identify the type of imposter syndrome they're not all the same is it due to belonging is it due to competency is it due to you know why me yes because these are different and you manage them differently so once you figure that out then i would try to overcome it so in my current role as why me often i just think about well i went through six rounds of interviews for this process you know if it wasn't supposed to be me one of those rounds would have failed exactly right like think about how intense tech interviews are and for a chief of staff roles they're like they're intense but they're also very sometimes subjective right like you're the most important part of the role is do you will you work well with your executive yes so it's somewhat of a vibe check at the end right and so i would think okay if this wasn't supposed to be me somewhere in the six interviews something would have messed up exactly so that i think back to and i'm like okay they saw something in me let me see it for myself yes and then in the competency related one if you're facing that i would say just break down what you need to learn into smaller things yeah so when i didn't know how to use sql i just took it step by step where i was like what is sequels yeah first of all yeah like what is it okay it's somewhat of a coding language okay what are the basic functions yes what is what is minimum competency minimum viable product look like like just step by step yeah and then you can get there and if it's in the belonging piece i mean that we talk about a lot on instagram like find your community right if if you feel like the you are the only one in a role see if you can join an employee resource group yes come to us on yeah on our platforms we'll connect you that one i think is a little bit more manageable yes i agree wow it's i this conversation couldn't have come at a better time because literally i i the way you broke it down the different kinds you know the different kinds of imposter syndrome really i can totally relate to it and and i feel like i'm going through something similar right now with the the why me one but i have gone through all the other ones that you listed and just to hear that others are you know others go through it right but when you hear it it's there's something about things yeah yeah okay i'm not alone in this and and so thank you for being so candid about it i really appreciate it yeah of course i think it's it's important to talk about because we can often see whether in work or social media everyone has their stuff together yeah but in reality you're you're only sharing that top 10 yeah right you're sharing the tip of the iceberg as they say and you're managing through certain things yeah background exactly and so i think talking about it makes it a little bit more attainable it does and it's hard it's one one thing i struggle with is you know going back to to sharing it on social media and what you share on social media it's hard because you know you or for me anyways i want to share more of the things i go through right but i'm also like people at my company follow me yeah so it's that weird and which you know being open and honest is something they would embrace and love of course but it's finding that balance of i don't want to appear to have it all together but at the same time i don't want you know what i mean like you don't want to be like you know used against you in a way or things like that that's one of the things i actually i don't share my age on social media yeah yeah and part of the reason i don't do that is for that reason because i don't want to i don't want people to think oh she's younger than i thought yeah right or based on your role experience or based on experience or like why would i listen to her she yeah barely has x amount of years of experience and so i think that's that's very much the key and i think people when you share your experiences some people appreciate it but some people will double down on the why her yes you know so we're talking about why me but then they might be thinking why her you know i have 10 years of experience exactly i have you know eight years yeah you know i i went to this school which is better than her school or whatever it is yeah and so sometimes you you self-sabotage because you're like i what gives me the authority to speak on this topic but i think typically what i think about is i'm not an authority figure i'm just here sharing my experience exactly your journey this is my journey this might not work for you this is not advice here but this worked for me so maybe it helps right and so just reframing it as you're not and you're not an advisor but you're more so a storyteller yes exact sense exactly i feel like i could sit here and pick your brain forever and this is why i said to you i need to do i literally am planning to come back to new york and just have like a weekend of just like full like just like connecting over coffee and whatnot but to end to kind of wrap up our conversation something that i always ask everyone and is is really around what advice would and you shared so much amazing advice that i'm just like i could just listen and listen to this but what advice would you give to your younger self that's that's interesting i think i would tell my younger self on the very beginning i would just tell her to relax yeah like things will work out i think i was very very high strung as as in high school and in early college i think some of that comes with just being the oldest child and sometimes the oldest child of an immigrant family yeah it was very much even more even more so that pressure was on because there was a pressure of figuring things out but also doing things in the right way and balancing your identity with your ambitions which i still navigate you know as you know personally i've i got married young i got married at 23. and that's not like my co-workers in investment banking were like what is going you know yeah yeah you know things like that and so balancing like a lot of those elements of maybe more of my traditional identity but also my ambitions i think i i had a lot of stress around that growing up and so first of all i would tell all my younger self to just have faith it'll work out and it might not work out in the first go-around but every misstep every rejection is really just redirection yeah because i remember you know we don't talk a lot about this but i didn't want to move to new york i wanted to stay in california i was going to ask you yeah i didn't i ended up here somewhat accidentally i'm from california i had no intention five years ago to move to new york and and actually at the time my parents were really against the idea because in our community women don't really move out of their homes until they get married and i left home unmarried and moved across the country very unheard of especially the oldest daughter the oldest daughter in the community in our muslim community wasn't a thing yeah but i so i i did that because this job was the one that came right i tried to get a job in san francisco and i got rejected at the very last round and it was a consulting job actually at mckinsey and so that would have been a very different career path and i would have been a management consultant instead of a banker but but it didn't work out in the very last round it didn't work out wow and so i was basically well i'm going to new york and it wasn't from a lack of trying right and so i think and then i moved to new york and i met my now husband here in new york he's from new york and so obviously there was that rejection that i talked about was redirection so like i was meant to be in this city for that reason and i love the city now and things like that in my career has would not have been the same if i'd stayed in california so and neither would be my personal life so i think that the first thing i tell myself is to relax and take things step by step yeah like don't don't over plan the future which we talked about at the beginning and then the second thing i would tell myself is [music] is you have more ability than you give yourself credit for i think a lot of us are our own worst critics like we tend to not see our potential the most sometimes or at least i do yeah i i think we're our own harshest critics right and as cheesy as it sounds you know sometimes people will come to me my friends will come to me and tell me about a problem and i will hype them up to the extent right i'm like yeah tiff you got this you are so calm like you're so competent don't worry about it you got this but then how i speak to myself in not that way i'm always like girl you're gonna struggle like you don't have it you're not it right and i think why why am i so compassionate towards my friends and my family and to myself i'm so critical and i'm so sometimes unappreciative and so i think i would just tell myself to be kinder and realize that the ability is there and sometimes you are your own worst critic i love that be kinder to yourself speak to yourself the way you speak to others exactly to your best friend like speak to yourself like you would to your best friend your partner whatever because you would never tell them you suck you know and sometimes you tell yourself yeah you suck right and so that's what i would say that is great i love that that's such a great way such a positive note to end this conversation thank you so much for your time and all your wisdom i'm like soaking it up this is so great too thanks for having me tiff thanks for watching everyone and i hope you come back soon i will for sure and for for any anyone who wants to to learn more about maria and her journey i'll link down below your socials and anything else that's great would love to have you join the community tiff is doing amazing things on youtube and instagram and and we have a really great community of women in tech there which is how we connected i know so hope you all come our way thanks everyone foreign [music]
