ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the chess grand swiss 2023 this is a ridiculously stacked chess tournament being played on the aisle of man and the top two finishers make it into the candidates tournament and the winner of the candidates tournament plays for the world chess championship as the challenger later in 2024 this is the round four recount we're going to feature hans neeman we're going to feature hikaru nakamura and this is the most insane recap by far every single game in this rec cap is going to blow your mind this round was explosive and starting from this round forward i will be giving you an update about the standings because we need to track who is winning the event sit back relax and enjoy your 30 to 35 minute flight it might be longer than that from where you actually live to the aisle of man and i'm going to take a little sip here of my little energy matcha shot you know what i'm talking about and my this is this round is just spectacular let's begin with hans nean hans nean lost to fiano carana a couple of days ago was a beautiful game that fano played but now he's back yesterday he won a very nice game hans did versus shaman vov who is an grandmaster from usbekistan now he's playing richard rapport 2752 the game and by the way we're going to go a little fast in this recap because i want to feature a lot of games so if you're looking for a little bit more spice detail i'm sure you can you know find it somewhere on the internet but i'm going to focus on giving you the key moments of every game rather than massive deep analysis this is a slow slo all right e6 white goes for knight h4 to try to win the bishop pair you can see from the time spent that both guys are quite familiar with what they are doing and report plays a surprise i've never seen the move that he plays he plays knight to e4 this is a very rare move and you can see from hans spending 8 minutes or about 9 minutes there he is clearly he's never seen this before and i think essentially the point is that this bishop gets out of the way of the knight but black is wasting a little bit of time right black has a powerful bishop hans is looking to trade like this and just get a very pleasant position on the queen side bishop 2 e7 knight f3 queen c2 and hans is just happy to try to trap the bishop report gives up the light squ bishop and replaces it with a knight in the center of the board and both guys castle queens side so we're going to have a battle here we're going to have a battle in the center and we are going to have a battle on the c file and on the queen side both guys shuffle their kings over rook to c1 report taking space on the king side slides this king all the way to the corner he's like all right get the king out of here cuz we about to throw some hands bishop c4 queen d7 but it is hans neeman who has the bishops it is hans nean who has the more open c file and it is hans nean who is going to try to put pressure on report throughout this game report is really not the one calling the shots you see he's defending himself he's in a little bunker over here if hans is able to break through he's going to be in good shape but he can't can't do anything report's position completely indestructible but here comes hans bishop f1 defending all of his pawns and here comes hans with a5 hans is instigating the entire game this is unstoppable force meets an immovable object pawn to a6 bishop c5 and all report had to do in the position was nothing he had to do nothing his knight was beautifully perched controlling not just two pawns but another one keeping an eye on everything over here and black just is rock solid you're not going to build up enough counterplay you're not going to build up enough play on the b7 pawn but report with 5 minutes on the clock took the bait he took the pawn on a5 and as you can see from the eval bar that suddenly opens up the entire a file i don't know why report did that he decided to completely go for it for no reason at all and that gave hans everything including bishop takes a6 and suddenly here comes hans barreling down the a file literally report is going to go down because because of that pawn that he took and he it's like a broken dam rook takes d4 he tries to sacrifice the rook bishop b5 and queen a8 is mate king c8 hans stripping the defense sacrificing the bishop because if you take it with the pawn rook c6 and i win the queen ladies and gentlemen hans neeman defeats richard report by basically checkmating him because you cannot run with the king you will get mated you cannot run to f6 because it's mate in 10 but it all begins with rook takes f7 and then the king you know for example rook f7 g6 rook takes b7 discovered check and then you win the queen and then you made him in a little bit lat hans nean just beat a 2750 he has three points out of four that's not even his best win ever you might remember his best win it's against a guy named magnus carlson 2022 september 4th day her around the world ridiculous stuff hans getting us off to a very spicy start meanwhile hikaro doing his thing drew the first two games yesterday won a game against arian choa indian grandmaster today hikaru's got the black pieces and he goes for a tash you don't really play a tarash open opening unless you are playing for a win trust me my friends there are much more solid openings hikaro historically has been a queen game of declined player against this hikaru plays bishop e7 then he plays the system with pawn to b6 that is like the hikaru specialty or knight bd7 hikaru is at the aisle of man playing for a win he is trying to win games that is why he is playing provocative openings isolated queen's pawn that's called iqp all right look at this look at this man played knight e 4 and f5 he is moving multiple pieces multiple times in the opening and he's not even castled he's using the f pawn that's ridiculous he's got all this space back there now all this airy space but look at his opponent spending all a lot of time b4 now hikaro goes back to e7 and transfers the bishop to the dark squares they trade amin defends the rook and gets a solid setup but hikaru is happy look at this this looks like a giga dutch hikaru's next move is probably going to be g5 and h5 and f4 like at some point or he's just going to plant his horses in a means territory anchored by his pawns and he's going to say amin what are you going to do you want to trade look at am wants to trade queen car says no queen trade no queen trade no queen trade here comes a me taking control of the dark squares a6 from hikaro taking control of the light squares amin's knight rotates to d3 it's a very tense positional game amin trying to take progress the queen side locks both guys focused on different things dark squares for white light squares for black rook c2 bishop f3 there goes hikaru hikaru is going to remove the only light squared beacon that is in the white position and now amin takes one step back one step back this is what it's like to play hikaru nakamura in a game of chess 27 moves you have battled it is a back and forth game you take one step backwards here comes hearu the only pawn that has not moved in the game the g pawn and he's going to create a same side attack with his knight anchored in the center of the board this looks like a collage take take here comes hikaru's queen he's going to slide back and bring the rook he doesn't even care if there's a queen trade because when it's all said and done this is hanging and this is a pass c pawn and the knight is hanging knight d4 knight takes g3 the dust is settling the players are getting deeper in the game to the 40th move we go and we get this end game it's equal material but hikaru is still pressuring knight f3 takes takes check and in this position rook d4 and white had to play king g3 he played king h3 rook e8 and resigned amin resigns because he thinks he cannot stop both pawns and this king is going to come here for example king to g3 black is going to play rook to d3 you cannot allow this so you have to step back now i play king g6 now you play king f4 trying to guard your pawn i get even closer you cannot take because my pawn sneaks through you try to escape i just push it's like a hydraulic press hikaru wins in a very convincing fashion versus 2685 rated aminat and hikaru's also got three out of four these guys are cooking they are cooking and they are memorizing the recipe they do not need need to look it up i got more games for you i mean everybody is in a crazy race for first place this is mark andrea mar i made a video about him a while ago probably named something stupid and forgot to change it so you might not know but he is he is a french chess prodigy i think he's like 16 years old i don't know he last i checked he was like 12 now he might be 25 i you know co messed up my perception of time like two years went by seven years went by i have no idea he's playing andre yeno who is a russian grandmas i think his peak rating is like 2720 very good player about 20 years of age it's a spanish okay it's a mainline spanish you don't need to worry about the details a4 a4 is is what's called called an anti- marshal and it's called an anti- marshal because yeno has not moved his d pawn he wants to play d5 he wants to meet c3 with d5 and and send us to a certain type of marshall with a pawn sacrifice in the center i have covered this many many times it's the favorite opening of magnus carlson and other players a4 basically says no marshall all right now black has to play d6 instead of d5 b4 yeno instigating on the queen side players developing white locks the center very lock position and now white tries to attack the center with the move d4 yeno trades bishops then he trades pawns and then he plays c5 now marria plays knight to b5 here okay he's attacking the pawn on d6 black plays knight to g6 and marria continues to build pressure against this pawn that's clearly what he wants right so queen b6 b3 position looks very nice you know this pawn can't really go to d5 knight d2 except white makes a very very fatal mistake the knight used to protect the rook he goes here now black plays d5 and let me tell you something right now if the only weakness in the entire black position could not move forward it was controlled by two pawns if your pawn could do that it's over you cannot take this way because the knight would lose a defender you cannot take this way because now you would lose a rook and if you try to play knight a7 and get fancy and do this at least your knight survived you attack the queen and your knight survived but here comes knight takes d5 and andrea yeno has come to collect his loan repayment you ever seen those movies where the lone sharks beat up people knight c3 knight f4 here comes the knight here comes the rook and in this position cool common collected rook takes e before and in a position of just being down one pawn white resigns he resigns because he is completely defenseless if you take and take black is threatening knight takes h3 removing the defender and then rook to d1 if you play king to h2 to defend yourself i will play rook to d3 threatening the knight and the pawn you just simply cannot defend white's pieces got completely scattered he kind of lost the plot of the game a little bit and that happens you know he just kind of chose the wrong plan it was a relatively equal spanish but this shows you that even though the spanish is a little bit more positional and maneuvering based it could go wrong real fast and yes peno wins and he's in clear first yeno has three and a half out of four points he's in first place alone hikaro has three hans has three i will show you the standings later yeno cooking cooking amazing stuff from yeno now here come the absolutely insane games of the round also i don't know why vali does not have a country she is indian she is the older sister of one prand raes babu you might recognize the name vali just recently got her third grandmaster norm at the tournament in qatar she played in the qatar masters she has three grandmaster norms the only other thing she needs to get the title is the rating of 2500 and she must be like 30 points away at this point and this game that you are about to see is a very nice step to getting there her opponent is one of the most accomplished women in chess of the last decade plus maria m you might know her sister anna muuk top five women in the world e4 c5 rosal liimo sicilian with bishop to b5 seen quite a bit also seen in the queens gambit seen in the world chest championship match fabiano carana magnus carlson g6 main line castles queen c7 d6 all right black is keeping the flexible options of moving the e andf pawns in the future we have h3 d4 look at this beautiful position by white but black completely happy completely in good shape knight c3 black plays c5 why is black playing c5 because black wants to open up the lines right black has the powerful bishops black has the queen potentially c5 is definitely a move in this position black can play other things like rook to b8 be a little bit more patient but white wants to go e5 and in the game that is exactly what white does white goes pawn to e5 black takes on e5 white takes and now before you move the knight you go rook d8 this is a zishan zug danger levels what's worth more than a knight a queen what's worth more than a queen a gotham ch subscriber queen to a4 knight to h5 this move looks like it traps the knight you can't move the knight but then this is no longer defended so i would go here and then like let's say white tries to guard like this here comes bishop h6 and let's say after bishop to b7 you move the knight you still can't move this knight but black has other ideas like rook to d3 or maybe f5 which is a very scary move trying to bring the knight back into the game so instead of that musuk plays queen h4 and is now trying to set up this move and in this position she plays e6 trying to knock on the door she says you know what vice shy i'm going to crush your king pawn to e6 hitting this pawn black plays f5 white continues to expand on the king side and vali says maria what about your king who is going to protect the f3 pawn when maria muzichuk played queen to h4 and then bishop to g5 she thought that black needed to defend d7 she probably thought of bishop f6 takes takes maybe knight e5 maybe knight g5 what she didn't expect was that vali does not care about the pawn on e7 because if you take the pawn on e7 i play rook d4 and white cannot continue to defend the bishop queen to g5 continues to defend the bishop but knight f4 and then queen f3 three and the knight h3 so suddenly white has to play defense and yes white does get the pawn on e7 but rook to d2 and white's position is completely defenseless white's position completely defenseless look you're two squares away from queening but you're going to lose the knight queen c4 which is an attack on the rook and a potential discovery and in this position vali plays knight to g3 the threat is made and if you take it's made even faster there is nothing to be done pawn to e7 check the king slides out of the way maria muuk resigns and vashali ramish babu moves into a tie for first place in the women's grand swiss with a monster 23 move win over a top five woman in the world maybe even top three women in the world i haven't checked the updated ranks bal is crushing and she is going to be a grandmas very very soon the games were unbelievable my friends i accidentally gave ramazan xal mahana from kazakhstan a grandmas title this man is an international master but he deserves the grandmaster title guys he beat a 2650 a 2680 he drew fua he dre drew ali resa fua yesterday 2780 with the black pieces he gets black versus 2680 alexis s and i got news for you i think you might know where this is headed and why he is still included in the recap because he gets out of the opening in a completely solid position slightly passive but very massive rook to d1 bishop to b1 takes takes and sra was trying to checkmate his opponent also they released head shot of the players ramazan janov looks like an anime character like this dude looks like a protagonist we are all fans of this guy now you have no choice you watch this channel we're cheering for ramazan this dude is going to win the tournament night look at the knight5 look at this position that that that sra builds up he goes into an endgame he's just slowly improving his position and raman just like trades knights like he did against ali reza please g5 brings his king takes some space and just he's completely he is bad he is better with black against a 2680 gm completely effortless he he plays f4 check removing the defender of the d4 pawn then he trades the rooks and completely effortlessly makes a draw against 2680 rated alexi sra they have a repetition of moves here alexi decides we you know there's no need to play on because the pawn is controlled and the king is going to go stop the pawn he's going to get this that guy's going to get that we're going to have one-on-one the could have played this out a little bit but raman jal mov 2447 has three out of four he hasn't lost the game he's performing at 2700 this is this is absurd he's three points out of four he doesn't even have a profile photo yet why does chess.com not upload a a picture of this guy can somebody watching this please from chess chess.com i know somebody's watching one of y'all is watching you're a big company you got a lot of employees or contractors one of you please get a photo for this guy get a remove my photo don't put it on his just remove one person has to go down somebody has to get elevated to photo level the guys the games that i got i got four more games that we're going to go through four more games this game was ridiculous you got to let's pause everybody pause back up from the screen let's take a deep breath hold on okay here we go alexander prka versus arjun eri this game was a semi- tarash take knight takes it's a very sharp it was a very not sharp very long theoretical variation rook d1 bishop d3 blah blah blah this has been played many many times before i don't know why er is spending so much time but d5 and now e5 so white sacrifices a pawn to create an attack it's common idea knight c4 white sacrifices a pawn and ladies and gentlemen welcome to the circus bishop takes h7 check look at the amount of time that prka has he thought for 27 minutes on this move you know who else was thinking on this move arguni about why is my opponent not making a move the buffet closes at 9:00 p.m. just kidding he was probably calculating bishop takes h7 this is called a greek gift sacrifice it is when you sacrifice a bishop on h7 with a check only defended by the king the king goes here the knight comes out to g5 you're going to see first the queen moves now the knight goes to g5 and the queen goes to h7 watch as arjun igi's king packs his bags and goes for a run queen g7 the rook is hanging queen takes f7 is hanging rook takes e1 his king continues to he's trying to go over here no way que oh my goodness the king is on c5 in the middle of the board rook to e7 the queen is hit the bishop is hit there's the queen is going to come back the king's not going to be able to escape knight f7 is coming knight e6 is coming knight e4 is coming knight 3 and queen d4 and knight d4 is coming queen d6 queen takes f7 the bishop is hanging let's keep this in mind if white is able to get the bishop back he's going to win the end game so black needs to defend his bishop he has to play bishop c6 but i think he didn't like something here i think arjin felt very uneasy about the positioning of his king according to the computer according to the computer black is completely safe but arjuni is not named stockfish and instead of that he plays king king to b4 sacrificing the bishop completely with the intention of playing knight to a5 and rook to c1 mate game is hanging on a knife sge rook to d7 and in this position argin eri says you know what i could continue the game with this and queen a1 check and then king h2 and knight a5 and maybe i'm going to survive but he didn't like the fact that the king was on b4 so in this position he went out in style he gave away the entire queen for absolutely free why because if you take rook c1 check knight f1 and the king cannot escape and the game would end in a perpetual check oh my goodness talk about go talk about making an exit knight to d2 i'm done i don't need my queen but i do respect your attack enough and i don't want to get checkmated so we're making a draw and our genera guys you could say survives i mean he could have played on but it was very risky he didn't want to risk it in this tournament every half a point matters as the players are trying to qualify for the candidates and that's how it ends oh but i have more games for you i have more games for you this game was totally nuts we're not going to analyze i these are like three quicks okay quick quick quick f you know firing away yesterday sha rodrigu from canada i want to feature players from all over the world world sha rodrig you know i have a crazy story about shawn shawn is from canada that's not the crazy story but i would play him in a lot of i would see him in a lot of tournaments in new york state in saratogo springs i actually played shawn in a tournament i think in like 2018 in canada and he was like 2200 and i was like who's this shawn guy he's like 2200 he plays some weird stuff he played some weird thing against my carl khan and i think we made a draw he had a good position now this dude is a 2500 rated grandmaster basically like he has norms and and he yesterday he beat gladura so yesterday this young guy sean got nine out of nine i i covered his tournament he in charlotte he played nine out of nine wins and yesterday he defeated grandmaster gladura hungarian 2650 2640 look at this game against alan picho they play a crazy game where just like just like that previous game knight takes h7 kind of a great gift and bishop takes g6 and in this position apparently the winning move is queen h6 knight f8 bishop e4 and the idea is that f5 now you have on passant if the knight takes the bishop takes it's easy you take and you take the bishop but if the knight takes you have bishop f4 and then when the queen moves let's say here you have queen g5 and the bishop comes here and the attack is too powerful shan and a friend of mine actually international master alexander osi great guy manager of the gotham knights team does commentary on hik caro's channel he had this game actually against grand master jojan chia from china who plays a lot of tournaments in the united states right now might even be living here look at this attack by lemieux but look at this defending by picho and what ends up happening in this game is that black defends perfectly but he has to sacrifice a little material the end game that arises is so weird white has three extra pawns but look at the concoction that black creates the rook watch this the knight on f5 the rook on h2 how is the white king not well the white king has no moves there is not a single legal move from the white king but he's not checkmated e6 the best black can do is rook g2 c4 but actually pichot does get a winning position in in this position he plays b4 bishop to e1 and right here pawn takes b4 and alan pich had to find bishop d6 rook g3 check and then rook takes g5 utilizing this pin for some reason i can't really explain it to you instead he goes c3 and the game ends in a repetition look at this end game nothing about this position makes sense pieces are scattered as if they just fell from the sky it was like a random piece generator that just put pieces on the board shan rodrigo is having a great tournament he draws against alan picho 2650 yesterday he defeated gladura and now we will end with two absolutely ridiculous games backto back games which ended very abruptly shich gu shage with the black pieces got a wonderful game it was a confrontational game bishop e2 was an isolated queens pawn game just like that last one that we looked at rook c5 like hikaru's game and it looked like we were headed for a more or less peaceful resolution but then it got confrontational it got confrontational because i think the players dilly ded too long and suddenly suddenly suddenly there might be some attack brewing suddenly the kings are getting a little bit more open little bit airy look at this rook at fate whoa is somebody getting mated whoa whoa whoa what is happening no come on guys you could have just made a draw and gone home but suddenly the black king is out in the open sh oh my god is gach going to win or is shich going to win the king is safe there's no more checks ukash plays pawn to h4 and in this position shage just has to go knight c5 and i have a question my friends who's stopping the pawn who's stopping the pawn let's say white plays h5 look takes h5 the pin but in in this position shage plays knight f4 and he blunders the only defensive move queen takes e when is the last time that you have seen a queen sacrifice for defensive purposes you cannot take because you lose the end game so shage plays knight to h5 oh my god the queen is hanging and then it would be pinned and the knight can't take i mean it can't sorry it can't take he can't take on e4 knight to h5 and the players decide here to just make a draw shage blunt a defensive queen sacrifice and if you thought that was bad i have another thing for you that was not bad that was just really incredible that was awesome stuff we don't even have to look at this game this was an e4 e5 game between andre volitan and vincent kima 2660 versus 2770 and it looked like we were heading for a more or less peaceful resolution white had pressure for about 30 moves in this game this is now move 30 the players are trading it's point 2 very pleasant position rook e8 queen f4 the bishops are traded black is a touch worse a touch worse tiny bit queen e5 and in this position c5 is played and the idea of c5 was rook takes b6 c takes d4 and then this pawn's never going to make it because if you play d3 i play rook d6 and then in this position andre volon touched the pawn andre volitan took the pawn on c5 thinking bc5 queen d1 check andre volitan blundered his rook and resigned oh my and your standings are as follows andrea seeno after four rounds leads the entire tournament it is a huge tie for second irwin lei janov pret neiman ner who we haven't even covered sarov eri karana nakamura yuang fuja vincent kimer vidit sean my friends we are about to have a wild second half at the fay chess grand swis 2023 now get out of here
