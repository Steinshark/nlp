hey what is up guys i'm pbht here and welcome to my setup tour for early 2018 i saw it i just updated my kit which is always linked in the description below but as you probably have noticed that's a pretty small list of things it's pretty minimal pretty clean and that's the way i like it and so this setup for me is obviously pretty video editing focus like that's most of what goes on here and so that explains most of what you're about to see that's on the desk that's around the desk because that's what i do here but it's finally different this was a mac pro dual monitor setup for a little while a couple of years went by and it didn't really change that much but now that it's actually different and i kind of mentioned i might be doing this soon this is the new setup so let's do it so i guess the first thing i should talk about is the desk itself so this is or was a next desk err pro i say was because the company that makes this actually changes their name to x desc so i'll link that below it is actually a custom size of it it's bigger than the normal air pro and it's a motorized desk so there's four motors one in each leg and you can lower it to a sitting height or raise it up to a standing height there's presets so i don't have to know where it is it just kind of stops it's pretty convenient so i spend a lot of time here obviously this was one of the first pieces of furniture in the entire studio when i first started putting it together it's obviously one of my favorites i've owned a lot of desks in my day and this one is really nice for having a motor in each leg it goes up and down pretty smoothly and pretty quickly and quietly and it also came with a glass top but i don't really use that at all i just use a straight metal it comes in white and you can choose the leg colors i went with the black legs so in fact the apple watch is not very good at telling when i'm standing up or not like i stand up all the time but then the ring will tell me to stand up while i'm standing up anyway that glow back there on the back that is a philips hue lightstrip attached to the back of the desk you can get different versions of this on amazon for different prices but i like the philips he one because i already had philips you stuff and you can obviously change the color with the app but i mostly leave it white also on the wall behind the desk a lot of people have questions about what this is this is they perfectly aligned a acoustic foam and fiberglass panel array this is also one of the first things in the studio very proud of it so now to get to the things on the desk it would make sense to go left to right like we usually do with these so that brings us all the way over here on the left to the studio monitor speaker behemoth the yamaha hs8 and these things are amazing these are an absolute workhorse and it's another thing i've had for a while since way before there was a studio or anything like that they are capable of incredible things way beyond what i'll ever need it's an 8 inch woofer and a 1 inch tweeter and they're internally amplified and the whole idea of a studio monitor obviously is to provide as accurate and neutral reference audio as possible these do that as well as any i've ever heard and they're sitting on these isolation pads basically foam and fiberglass blocks from rlx you can get fancier ones if you want but these do the job just fine which is to prevent the desk that it's on from vibrating or rattle actually yamaha also does make an h s7 and i believe in hs 5 so much smaller versions of this cuz this cabinet is huge but i'll try to link those below as a matter of fact i'll try to link everything i name drop or talked about in this video replica that like button wish me luck so right next to that that brings us to this this is promised pegasus r3 it's storage like that's it's just storage this is a thunderbolt 3 external raid array eight hard drives 10 terabytes each so that makes 80 terabytes of fast access raid storage it's all hard drives but it's also super quiet just one fan in the back i was actually using one of these with the mac pro before but with an adapter because it doesn't have thunderbolt 3 so now finally with imac pro i don't need an adapter and speeds are pretty great but this is entirely for archiving right now so previous videos unseen footage all that safe and sound so that brings us of course to vi mac pro this is the one i've had since before it came out this is the one i made a video about it's the all-in-one non upgradable workstation performance machine from apple and i got to say i'm actually really liking it so now like i ordered a fully maxed out' core version she'd come in the next month or two not that i don't trust apple but i don't really think that new mac pro is gonna be coming anytime soon it might be like a year of using imac pro at least before that comes out so that's soon but for now this is that 10 core is the w i've got 128 gigs of ram it's a 2 terabyte ssd on the 16 gig vega gpu review is happening pretty soon probably a little after ces but yeah that this thing is a monster and it's sitting on a stand the 12 south high-rise pro it happens to match of course the exact space grey color of the imac pro of course they did that on purpose but it does look great and more importantly it brings the imax display up to eye level for me and those little cover up here is reversible it kind of slaps on with magnets either way and i keep the card readers under there so the read mag reader and an sd card reader because i don't feel like every using the sd card reader on the back of the ims now onto the right hand side is mostly just the rest of the audio stuff so the headphones of choice on a whoo audio stand are sennheiser hd 800 painted by color wear so if you guys know headphones you already know what these are known for which is their performance their reputation is top-notch and they sound amazing they're known mostly for their flat sound signatures so they sound pretty good listening in music but these are actually amazing for video editing as well they're open back so soundstage is fantastic and they take a lot of power to drive which we'll get to in a second but when you finally get them plugged in and up and working it sounds like the vocal artist is actually singing directly into your ear it's amazing so then driving those is this little guy the apollo twin mark 2 duo it's again space gray gotta love that so this is the preamp that is taking information from the computer and turning it into the signal that the speakers and the headphones will play it's plugged into both it's extremely clean so that's what you're paying for here so you can turn the volume all the way up to earth-shatteringly loud and there is zero hiss no noise it's dead silent so it's capable of again much more than i use it for but of course i keep it because i love this thing but also like who doesn't love a huge volume knob oh also the chair how could i forget the chair i mentioned i do stand a lot but when i get into the groove of editing that's usually when i'm sitting down the most so the chair of choice is this herman miller embody again another thing i've had for years this is actually kind of popular already too and let me tell you if you sit down a lot you don't want to skimp on the chair everyone in the studio has this now because it's dope i like it a lot so that's about all there is with that though also that cable management though come on - and then all the other miscellaneous stuff that's actually on my desk this is hasselblad x1d it isn't always there but i tend to kind of keep it near me when i can and this is my slightly unconventional keyboard and mouse and trackpad setup mouse on the right logitech mx master 2's space gray kind of on this aluminum mouse pad and then i also have the trackpad on the left so i use a trackpad mostly for zooming and scrolling especially between spaces in mac os 10 or mac os i kind of have this three panel setup going and i move between them with the trackpad but then for everything else i use the mouse so i'm not lefty i just have like a certain weird way of doing things people always seem to think it's odd but that's the way it is my smart phone of choice is sometimes also on my desk right now it's pixel to xl panda an iphone 10 and this is also the new white 1 + 5 t they actually just came out with this little white version which i've been using for a bit and i'm a huge fan actually of the colored power button again seriously hoping this becomes a thing and also if you're interested in it we're gonna be giving away some of these on instagram so stay tuned over there for a post coming up and the chance to win this phone now we got our red mags over here on the right some of the new business cards a microfiber sometimes my water bottle makes its way over there oh yeah that's pretty much it unless i bring something else over here that i'm testing or starting to use now before we even get to this part of the video i'm sure someone's already looked up how much each of the things costs and like made a spreadsheet out of it in the comments but before you even think about it that way not all this happens at once obviously in one move like i said i've had this desk for about six years now i've had the speakers for about as long this chair i've i've had versions of this chair broke it got another one it's it's kind of comes together with time the peripherals you go into the computer that evolves over time but bottom line this is all for me to make it as frictionless as possible for me to turn footage into videos and so that's it's it's what works for me i think there's two ways to watch setup tour videos one would be just you watch one and then you go out and try to copy it exactly you try to duplicate what you saw but number two is you kind of look through it and you gather inspiration from different parts of it you get ideas about how to modify your own setup and i think that's the way i watch most set up to our videos and i think that's what i hope you get out of this is ideas for maybe you do want to make it cleaner or more minimal where you get ideas from the way i set things up that's that's what i hope you get out of it in this glimpse into what i use to make videos so that is it that is the early 2018 imac pro mkbhd setup tour if you have any ideas or if you have any comments feel free to leave them down below again i'll try to link everything i talked about in the description but that's pretty much it thanks for watching touch you guys the next one face [music]
