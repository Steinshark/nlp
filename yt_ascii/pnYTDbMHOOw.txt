have you ever been talking to a co-worker and the thought pops in your head do they get paid more than me if you have had this thought you're definitely not alone i think everyone at some point in their career has had this thought what do my co-workers make what do people who are doing the same role and have the same experience as me do they make more than me or worse yet am i underpaid today we are going to talk about how to know if you're underpaid and also too i really want to share with you that levels fyi recently released a report on the top paying jobs and we're gonna dive into that a little bit and also to tips on how to ensure you are not being underpaid alright let's get into it foreign research for this video that i kept on thinking about is just underpaid solely mean the amount of money you're making the short answer is no i don't think it does you can be paid fairly but if you are feeling as though you're being devalued your co-workers are putting you down or just not appreciating what you are doing and bringing to the table that in its own right can make you feel underpaid you can never have enough money if you are feeling this way that people aren't grateful for you and i don't mean that in a take take kind of way but i mean maybe it's a sign that you should get out before we get into tips though on really how you can understand if you are underpaid i wanted to share with you a bit of insight that levels on fyi recently released on their top paying or highest paying jobs and this is really interesting because two reasons one it does a really good job of showing transparency what companies are hiring from junior to senior level engineers and what they are paying now keep in mind this is total compensation this is not just being a salary and i really wanted to highlight that because i don't want there to be any mix-ups here thinking this is base salary no this is total compensation and i mean the base salary is pretty nice too though let's be real for a lot of these companies are paying very high base salaries too but the point of this is transparency we need more of this and i think this is a great place to start all right let me pull it up on screen okay i have it up on my screen here and as you can see the lowest total compensation this is in us dollars for an entry level engineer is 220 that's mind-blowing this means this is mostly people who are graduating from university and they're starting with this this is definitely definitely not what i started with when i started my first job it was at a non-for-profit so that also made it very very low in salary but as you can see the headquarters there is a trend here most of them are in california now a question i get asked is well tiff i don't live in the united states i live in canada i live in asia i live in europe wherever you live can i work for these companies and the answer is maybe what i mean by that is a lot of these companies nowadays are hiring for remote workers especially engineers that can work and be done from anywhere and what i think is really important is when you are looking at applying to these companies who are based out of the united states ensuring that you are getting paid in us dollars or at least your compensation is in u.s and then translated into whatever currency you are in and this is definitely possible a lot of companies do this so really keep that in mind next up we have engineer two and engineer two is typically two five years of experience so you're still you're mid in your career relatively new still and as they can say here ability to mentor engineers provide technical guidance code reviews design and deliver on small projects and your impact is typically at the intermediate scope so you're you're midway through and the salary or total compensation i should say is pretty high for this airbnb being the lowest at 318 and data breaks being the highest at 443. that is high that's really high and this is just for the end of year report for 2022 so this is this past year and taking into consideration everything that's going on in the tech industry i really think it's really important to showcase this as well because we focus the news and we like to focus on the negatives and the layoffs and all that but there's still so much out there so much opportunities in the tech industry all right let's do one more let's go to engineer three senior engineering so for levels fyi they say typically five plus years experience and typically 30 percent of employees less than 30 of employees in a company are at this level so this is very senior all right so we can see here databricks what is data bricks i'm not super familiar with them data bricks we're googling this oh yes of course okay so databricks yes a web-based platform for working with spark that provides automated cluster management with python style notebooks see here i've never used it though have you used databricks before if you have leave in the comments your thoughts around it data analytics and ai anyways data breaks you pay really well that is amazing and number seven for this is linkedin which is 458 so still really really good and i find it interesting actually that even for level one level two level three for total compensation you don't see a lot of fang on this which is very interesting and i think it maybe goes to show that sometimes maybe fang is a bit overhyped all right now that we know what some of the top paying rules are in this industry let's go back to the purpose of this video is how do you uncover if you're being underpaid one of the best ways to uncover if you are being paid properly is to ask people what they're getting paid okay that is not appropriate you can't just ask people what they're getting paid you can and i do it all the time to be honest and if people ask me i'm pretty transparent granted i don't just share it with the internet but if people have real meaningful conversations whether it be my friends whether it be people that i've connected to for mentorships etc that i have built a relationship with and i feel it is appropriate to ask what do you get paid because the more transparency we have at the end of the day the more we can all get paid properly and i think it's really important now if you are someone who might not have someone that you can go to to ask these questions to my advice is to start building those relationships because those relationships are so important regardless of the end goal being to ask could they get paid but to have that mentorship and support well actually recently i joined a slack group that is for developer advocates and this is just one example of a place that you know you can go online make these relationships hear other stories and build that relationship so i highly encourage you to do the same whether it be for software engineering whether it be for product management whatever the case is yes you can't just jump in these platforms and say hey how much do you make but it's a great opportunity to start building out these relationships the next thing that is really important if you are looking to uncover how much you are getting paid is honestly by utilizing these platforms like levels fyi that i just listed and if you are finding there is a huge a huge substantial gap in pay versus what these sites are putting up keeping in mind location experience company size etc but if you're feeling like you work at a company that is closely aligned with one of these or maybe you work at one of these companies and your compensation does not reflect what it says on here it's always worth having a conversation with your manager when you think of money as this taboo subject when it doesn't need to be having an open conversation with your manager around hey you know i was doing some market research and i keep on coming across these numbers what are your thoughts on this do you think there is something that we can do in the new year to think about a raise and then always always no matter what you do keep track of everything you do meaning an old manager of mine put it in a really great way document everything that when you go to ask for a raise or go to ask for a promotion it's almost like you're going into court and you are the lawyer representing yourself and you have this list of things to show hey this is my what i've done my progress how i have helped the company and this is why i deserve x y and z or why i think i should have x y and z and it's a great way to remind your manager or people you are connecting with of your value for the company all right for some reason the outro this video did not record anyways thank you so much for watching this video i hope you found it very helpful and valuable in your compensation journey it's something that at the end of the day we need to stick to together be open and transparent about that's the only way that we will all get paid what we should get paid if you haven't already hit that subscribe button for more tech coding and career related videos leave in the comments any questions you have i answer all of your questions and i'll see you soon thanks everyone foreign
