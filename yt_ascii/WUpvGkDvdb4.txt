so i thought we'd look at a variant sodoku which brings in some very surprising mathematical properties into the solving of it to go back to the basics a sodoku consists of the numbers 1 to n in every row column and 3x3 box of a 9 by9 grid in an original sidoku you didn't you don't have to use the numbers at all you could use symbols or anything it wouldn't make any difference with this puzzle we have a couple of extra clues that do bring the maths into we've got some little killer clues on the side of the grid which tell you the sum of the whole diagonal they're pointing to so this 25 is pointing to four cells if we add up those four cells they will add up to 25 and for this 27 clue that's a five cell diagonal 1 2 3 4 five those five cells which could include repeat numbers will add up to 27 we also have these purple lines in the grid called ren band lines they have to be a sequence of consecutive digits although not necessarily in the right order so this one up here three digits it could contain one two and three in any order or it could contain five six and seven in any order so that's all we get no given digits in this puzzle just a bunch of lines and those sums outside the grid you may have noticed some of the arrows are pointing along various lines as well as other cells and what you have to think about is that one of the properties of three consecutive digits is that they will be divisible by three if you take 3 4 5 that's 12 it's divisible by three if you take 9 87 that's 24 it's divisible by three you can work that out because the middle digit will always be the average of the other two so that must be x * 3 it's always divisible by three now what that means is that for this four cell diagonal where we've got the 25 we know that the three cell renb band line adds up to a multiple of three what must be left over is a digit that must come from the set one 4 or seven and a mathematician will know those as one modul 3 or something is what i think they're called and we're using this modulo concept in this puzzle because it's really helpful if we look at the number on the opposite side of the puzzle we've got a 23 again the three cell ren ban on the line must add up to a multiple of three and then we're going to be left with 2 five or eight to go into this cell here if we look at these vertical lines now we know that one of them is from 1 four or 7 and the other two must not be from that set because any three consecutive digits will have one from 147 one from 258 and one from 369 so we're using the modulo concept in a slightly different way now when we start looking at the other two clues we have in the puzzle is when it gets exciting we've got this 15 clue now that is a number divisible by three and so is 27 so we could eliminate the three cells on each of their diagonals and that will leave us with two cells that remain divisible by three in the case of the 15 diagonal two cells that remain divisible by three as a total on the 27 diagonal and since this cell down here is always going to be fixed you know whatever number that is it is going to contribute to those two then these two cells must be from the same modulo set and we know they can't be from 147 cu it's on this line with a 147 we know they can't be from 258 because on this line they're with a 258 so those must be from the 369 set and we can actually make a start on solving the puzzle in that way it's a bizarre setup of a puzzle with almost no clues in it that lets you use use this idea of modulo arithmetic to actually begin it who comes up with this this one is by a dutch constructor who's known as mr menace which is pretty appropriate i think goodness knows how he had the idea the fascinating thing is you can watch simon solved this on our channel and he has to go through these thought processes where you realize that the ren band line must be divisible by three and that leaves a remainder and when you take that from the sum that you've been given you can play with those numbers and you also have to realize that a ren band line must contain one of each it's just a really interesting analysis you know you may have known about modulo numbers as either a mathematician or just as an ordinary person but you may never have realized that they could have an actual application brilliant yeah if yeah if this is an actual application i guess puzzles are an actual application bridge is a very good point and i was wondering that as i said it brilliant if you love puzzles you can check out more from mark and simon over at cracking the cryptic and if
