oh my goodness i am to say i 
am nervous is an understatement i haven't looked at my first resume in a long 
time and as someone who doesn't come from   a technical background or you know my whole 
career was in fashion until i switched into tech   my first resume getting into tech it was hard to 
to do because i didn't have any experience to show   hey everyone before we get into the video today 
make sure to hit that subscribe button for more   tech and coding related videos leave in the 
comments other topics you want me to cover   whether it's coding career personal you know 
whatever your self-growth i'm here to support you   and your journey into tech and your 
career and let's just grow together also speaking of resumes and building your 
portfolio and breaking into the tech industry   it often means that you will be spending 
a lot of time building projects and you   really want your projects to stand out one 
of the tools i want to share with you that   really will help your project that you are 
building stand standout is for walla editor   for walla editor is a lightweight html 
editor that is written in javascript which   essentially allows for rich text editing 
capabilities for your applications   one of my favorite things about for wallet editor 
is it is easy to use when you are working on a new   project and coding away when you use a different 
tool or service you want it to be user friendly   and i love how they have a ton of documentation on 
their site it's very developer friendly also too   it's very easy to extend so you can literally 
do anything with the foil editor it's well   written structured and documented code makes 
it very easy to understand and further extend   another thing i always look for when i'm using 
a different tool or service is how fast is it   going to be i don't want this to slow down my 
application and when i was implementing it into   one of my applications recently i noticed 
right away how it doesn't affect the speed   of the website loading or anything like that it 
has blazing it will they actually say on their   website that the text editor will initialize in 
less than 40 milliseconds which is pretty crazy   also too it's lightweight so it's not going to 
bring down your application and it's secure which   is super important too especially these days you 
hear there's nothing more important than security   and the importance of cyber security so 
it's always something i look for as well   i linked it down in the description so make sure 
to go check it out save it or bookmark it for   next time you are building a different project 
okay let's get back to my cringeworthy resume okay i guess i'm feeling sentimental today 
because we're looking at my first resume okay let me pull it up here first okay i'll put it up on screen so you can 
go through this wonderful and embarrassing   experience together i obviously am going to blur 
out my personal information but otherwise you   get the point okay let's get into it first things 
first i do have to give myself a point because it   is only one page long i don't know why it would 
be longer than one page considering i had very   little experience at that point in time 
but we sometimes like to drag things on   and when we have little or less experience 
pad things up almost too much and then it   becomes more fluff let's get rid of 
the fluff okay let's dive in summary   i am a driven professional with 
a broad technical skill set   sure broad meaning i didn't know what i was 
doing a focused and detail-oriented web developer   offering exceptional troubleshooting skills and 
a talent for developing innovative solutions   i'm successfully able to multitask and 
work in teams meeting all project deadlines   all right you know obviously it could 
be improved quite a bit looking back   on it but overall it shows that i'm able to 
work in teams i'm detail oriented i'm driven yeah summary i would say out of 10 
points it would score like a seven   i don't know what do you guys think but i would 
say like a seven out of ten it was pretty good   then we go into skills before i'm i'm actually 
going to stop there when i'm looking at this   the formatting something is really off 
i think it's because there's no space   between the text and underneath the red line 
it's like very crammed together but anyways   okay skills i separated them languages 
servers databases frameworks other skills   okay all right it's not bad i mean 
html and css are not languages but   there they are under languages that's okay though 
i think javascript should have a capital s the dogs are home hello boys hello hi i'm just 
filming yes okay okay hi harry hi sweet people   lay down okay almost done okay sorry we had to 
take a little pause there for the dogs of course   but one thing i really do like under skills 
that i have is the other skills section and i   think that's something that's really important and 
not a lot of developers or people technical people   put in is other skills and i think it's important 
to show depending on what kind of company your   hot you're applying for but especially for 
startups to show that you have other skills   because a lot of times in a startup environment 
you might be doing more than you know a typical   your typical job description you might have to 
help out with marketing or graphic design or   things like that so even today when i'm making 
a resume for myself i still put other skills on   there to really show that you know i'm a more 
well-rounded person and it's not just technical   technical technical so i do think that it's a good 
thing to do i'm not sure why i bolded rather than   bolding the titles i folded the text underneath 
of it once again very unique design choices   we never said tiffany was a designer that is a 
fact for servers databases and frameworks okay   you know if i'm being totally honest 
when i was putting these things on here   i probably shouldn't have put some of them on 
because i had very little experience with them   but at the same time it's that fine line 
because the when you send an application   in it's usually ai who determines if you if 
your resume is going to get passed on or not   and if it doesn't have specific keywords it's 
automatically going to just get dismissed so   it is important to put those keywords on but 
also to have that balance of not over inflating   your resume with things that you actually 
don't know how to do so it's that fine line   education and training so i put education 
and training before experience because at   this point in my career i had very very little 
experience well no experience in tech at all   so rather than putting my experience first i put 
my education first to show hey i you know i took   a boot camp i went to university this is where i'm 
at and it's a great way to kind of just highlight   more of the technical aspects before getting into 
the experience okay then it goes down to education   and training i notice on education and training 
i put 2017 but i didn't put the graduation date   and the reason i did that at the time was because 
i got told by someone that to kind of prevent   people from judging you based on your age whether 
really young or older to not put when you graduate   but it is really confusing when i just put 
2017 does that mean i graduated does it mean   i didn't graduate like i really don't 
specify if i completed either of these   pieces of education which by the way i did so 
even if i didn't want to put the date i should   have put maybe something next to it saying 
completed or graduated and it's really not   clear so that's something i definitely would have 
improved let's go down to experience once again we   clearly are really trying to fit everything 
on one page here because it's really tight   okay under experience we have 
marketing whole renfrew toronto cool so how do i feel about all this thank goodness 
someone hired me for my first tech job because   it was brutal out here okay so marketing 
managed and developed content for social media   worked closely on the marketing team worked 
on multiple social media campaigns so there's   really nothing technical about these roles and as 
you can read down for all of them there's nothing   technical other than other than some content 
creation really but otherwise not really anything   one thing i wish i would have highlighted more 
on the very first one startup fashion week it   says at the very bottom created and managed their 
wordpress blog and developed posts for the company   i really should have expanded more on the 
wordplex wordpress blog part because it   has more of a technical aspect to it i could have 
talked about the plugins we used how we set it up   and different things like that and i really 
missed that opportunity to focus in on that at   the end of the day though i didn't have experience 
in tech so i needed to put my internships or what   i've done up until this point but i wish i would 
have or looking back if i was to do it again   i would have put more even of the soft skills 
more around time management building teams   communication because those are skills that can 
be applied into the tech industry as well rather   than focusing on these bullet points of you know 
very specific things i did at these roles which   really don't carry over into the tech industry 
and that's what i would have done differently is   rather than done such specific descriptions 
made them more general with a specific example   so manage teams manage a team of five and 
communicated effectively through solving   different problems and then giving an example 
something like that where as it's not exactly   tech oriented you can see how transferable your 
skills would become to tech so that's something   i definitely would do different next time i also 
added activities and interests which when i did   this it was to give that personable a personable 
feel to my resume that hey i'm a real human once   again going back to being well-rounded i don't 
add activities and interests on my current resume   but once again at the time it was a smaller resume 
and i had the space so i think it's a good way to   really show that you have other interests 
outside of work that you are committing   to different things you know i have here i 
was learning mandarin i was doing running   so yeah i think you know it wasn't the worst 
resume i mean it's a little cringe-worthy but   it got me a job so that's good it got me 
my first job in tech and there's so much   that you can take away from this looking at 
it and just kind of having a good laugh and   we've all been there starting out you know just 
not sure what the heck is going on and just   winging it and that's exactly what this 
was it was just winging it just figuring   it out as i went along and kind of shows 
but i'm someone who always just kind of   takes it day by day and continues to as long 
as i'm improving and growing just put yourself   out there one of the biggest things for me i had 
when applying for my first tech job was to know   when to start applying and i get asked this often 
too and i don't have a perfect answer when is the   right time to start applying i think at the end 
of the day it's always better to start applying   earlier than later don't look back like wow 
why did i wait so long just start applying and   if you keep on hearing no's consistently like 
i'm talking over a period of time because even   if you are the most qualified person you're 
gonna hear a lot of notes it's the reality   but if you're really starting to hear no no no 
week after week after week maybe take a step back   then and reassess what is going on if i'm not even 
getting the interview to the point where they can   meet me is it something with my resume like what 
what's going on here but i think you can always   just put yourself out there and see what happens 
thank you all for watching this video i hope you   not only found it valuable but also i had a 
good laugh at looking at my first resume when   applying to the tech industry i'm curious to 
hear your thoughts on it though would you have   hired me or would you have been like this this is 
a terrible resume actually i don't know if i   want to hear your thoughts which is a terrible 
resume anyways i have linked for walla down in   the description make sure to go check it out 
and i will see you all soon thanks everyone you
