- today, i'm going to be giving
my 40 millionth subscriber all 40 of these cars. we have a porsche, a chrysler, a tesla with a custom 40 mil wrap on it, and even a spongebob car. - i picked this one myself. - youtube gives you a list of
your most recent subscribers. and when i hit 40 million,
i refreshed the list, and i messaged the newest one. and all i told him is that
i have a surprise for him. he has no idea we're giving him 40 cars. guys, stop jumping on the cars. - imagine getting 40 cars. how much did you spend?
- how much do you think? - 300,000. - more. - really?
- yeah. - 500?
- i don't wanna tell you. all right boys, load 'em up. (rock music) now all 40 cars are
loaded up on car haulers, because my 40 millionth
subscriber is 10 hours away, and obviously i don't
feel like driving 10 hours 40 different times. that'd be stupid. let's go. (rock music) after 10 hours of driving, we're finally here. let's give away some cars. i'm terrified. karl, you knock. (karl knocking)
(explosion) hey, are you luke? - what's up? - did you actually think we'd come? - nah, not really. nah. - okay. well, i need you
to put this blindfold on. your prize is huge, it's gonna take us forever to set it up. tareq, come over here. first off, i have no idea what room i'm in. i literally just walked in a random room. second, there's 40 cars down
the road and he has no idea. we're gonna walk him out
blindfolded and then surprise him. i am so excited. - i can't believe we're about to unload all of these cars into his lawn. this is insane. this is the first of 40 cars. go ahead, offload it. karl. i don't think he notices you. - he can see me. - that's not productive. 1 out of 40. and the next car, come on down. let's do this. this car actually looks really nice. can i be my 40 millionth subscriber? wait, does this mean it's manual? all right, next car. - we've never done
anything like this before. this is ridiculous. (rock music) - do you remember where
jimmy said to put this? - no, here's good. - all right. you were our 40 millionth subscriber, and because of that,
take off your blindfold. we brought you 40 cars. - [luke] whoa, dude, dude. no way. - obviously you don't
need 40 cars, correct? - no way. - which is why i have a challenge for you. if you give away all 40 of
them and under 24 hours, you get this custom wrapped tesla. but the last nine cars are covered, and let's just say, luke's gonna
struggle to give them away. don't think the challenge is over yet, it's gonna get really hard. - i'm a good salesman though. - okay.
- well hey. - but that's at the end. let's give away the unwrapped cars first. see the timer there? all right, let's do this. - i'm going my brother, jake right here. - you wanna go grab him? - got a surprise for you,
bud. this one right here, that's yours.
- no way. (engine revs) hey, man, hey, we can do this all day,
but i got 39 more of these. - [mr beast] that is car
number one of 40 gone. do you have another brother? - well, i have a little
brother. he's like 10. - i mean there's no rule that
says you can't give a car to a 10 year old. ben, can you drive? - maybe - legally? - no - we're gonna have luke
drive it off the lot for you. these are your parents? so if he gives away all 40 of these cars, i don't care who it is, he could give them to a
random person at walmart, he gets that tesla. so he wants to give you guys one, so just walk through and pick one. - i always like the grand cherokee. - its yours, dad. what are your thoughts on this? - i love it. - think i can have this porsche? - go for it. - really?
- yeah. - thank you so much, luke. (engine revs) - luke is currently
texting all his friends to come and get a car. imagine someone in your high school class just sends you a text saying, "hey, i have a car to give away." would you actually believe your friend? - no. - all right, so this
is your friend, carson? - got a lot of cars here. gotta get them all gone, and i get that tesla. - there's so many cars you can pick from. - jimmy, he wants the subaru, let the man get a subaru. - yeah, this is the one right here. - i got more cars to give away. - all right, bye. good luck. - what are your plans with these? - we give some more of my friends, and some to my grandparents. - let's go give these away. - hey, i have some cars for y'all. - what are you doing? - blue one right there. - oh my goodness. - we're giving luke 40 cars to give away, and he wanted to give you guys this one. - if i hadn't recognized
you, i wouldn't believe it. - you know how some people
say like, kids watch us. she doesn't look like a kid. - good point. - just saying. - get your grandmas to subscribe today. - actually, i know you
from my younger grandson. - all right. well, nevermind then. - this is what i've been needing, a car just this size. everybody, please subscribe to mr. beast. children like it, but
the old people do too. - and we're here at
his great aunt's house? - yes, sir. - all right, let's do this. - hey. how are you doing? - what are y'all doing? oh my gosh, luke. where did you get that? - [luke] this is yours. - mine? - your 17 year old
nephew got you this car. isn't that crazy? - i think so. - all right, there you go.
- thank you, sweet boy. - this is my special little boy. this is great. - he was wanting to give us car to y'all, because y'all support him
for everything he does, come to all his ball games. - that's right.
- and he wants to do something to give back to y'all. - thank you, luke.
- yes ma'am. - you guys wanna turn it
on? see what (indistinct) - listen to that engine purr. - bye! you should keep your hands
on the steering wheel. let's head back to the lot. - wait, didn't we drive
this car over here? that was our ride. anyone got uber? - we're back at luke's house, and we still have lots
of cars to give away. (upbeat music) - nerd! - what's the good stuff? what's the gas? let me hear it. (engine revving) ooh. now as i'm sitting here, that spongebob car's taking my fancy. - bro, have you seen what it does? - no, i haven't seen what it does. oh! (dolphin noise) i gotta get it now, don't i? - what car has a water gun? - i don't know. you can't find them. - oh, do that. - my dad just called me
and we called him back. - [friend's dad] (over the
phone) got any sports cars? - my best option out here was
the spongebob wrapped jeep. - [friend's dad] a what? - spongebob squarepants. he lives in a pineapple under the sea. - spongebob squarepants. - he's absorbent, and
yellow, and porous is he. - everybody ready? - i'm ready!
- i'm ready! - karl doesn't know this, but this is actually his car. play the clip of me taking it. no joke, i paid someone
to drive it 10 hours. this is the last car
luke's gonna give away. shh, surprise for the end. you're luke's football coach? he wants to hook you up with a car, man. - thank you, i appreciate it.
- not at all. - thank you for delivering this food. - do you want a car? wait, what was the question one more time? so it's mine? so this is my car? love it. thanks mr. beast. - just found three new people. - who are they? - cheerleaders. - ooh, are you single? - shut up. - right? - can we just scrap
three cars and head out? - yeah. - so do you think one of
them wants the white truck? - nah, i really don't but
i'm gonna do it anyway. - why is the windshield cracked? it wasn't cracked when i bought it. - [tareq] you remember karl? karl? - karl, tareq told me you
cracked the windshield. - we just snitching now, tareq? - how does that feel, luke? - oh, my god. this is too much. i'm gonna start crying. - now that you gave them cars, we gotta go give away the rest. you still have this much time remaining. - it was a boost for his happiness. - dude, shut up. - three of his friends just pulled up. you want to let them
grab whatever they want? - whatever they want. - boys, have at it. - i'm loving this anime car. - wait, you want the anime car? - i think this is the one. think i'm gonna pick this one. - all right.
- all right, hop on in. - wow. - its a pretty nice car. - kinda matches. - it does match. - do you know how to drive stick? - no, but i'll learn. - he is facetiming his mom. - hi mom. so this is mr. beast. they're giving away 40 cars. blue dune buggy, mom. i'll be back in a couple days with it. - i love it. - congrats on your new cars. you can take them home now. luke, you've given away a
ton of cars so far today. do you have any more friends? - i'm running out quick. but i got it for you. - keep calling people. let me
know when you find someone. - all right - we got a looker. (fast paced music) - me flagging down people works. so the dad doesn't believe
that it's actually free, but the son watches the channel. so i'm letting the son explain. - there's gotta be a catch. - there's not a catch. - we'll see. - if you can drive stick.
this might be the one for you. - i'll try it out. - all right. all wrong. - there's something wrong. its out of gas. - yes it is. - its out of gas. - here, guy, i got it. - who would've thought if you
put gas in a car, it works. i think this would be a good time for luke to get back in the tesla. luke, do you like this tesla? - i love this tesla. - good, because you're
actually on track to get it. you're almost halfway done
with giving away the cars. and when you give away the other
half, this bad boy's yours. - lets go give away some cars. i think we go find some
random people at walmart. - that actually sounds like fun. all right. we're here at walmart. so, do you wanna do that guy right there? - [luke] yeah. yeah. hey man, you want a car? - a car? - yeah. - do you believe us? - its hard to believe. - well, it is true. hop
on in. she's all yours. - enjoy your car, sir. - oh, thank you then. doesn't even make sense. speechless. - [mr. beast] all right, drive her on off. - thank you. - we're now zaxby's. what's the game plan? - order something.
- okay. - and then when i get up there, i'm just gonna be like,
"this is your car." - we're about to give away this car. wish us luck. you're so inconspicuous. - that's mr. beast. - yeah. do any of you want a free car? i'm thinking of a number
between one and three. pick a number. - two. - the number was three. so whoever picked it just won. congratulations on your brand new car. - i got a car. i'm gonna cry. - i'm already crying. - don't cry. - i'm about to go to college this fall. so this was just a really perfect gift. - people around here, we struggle. we have to work really
hard for what we got. i know his show cause he come here, and he works hard every day. - [mr. beast] well, congratulations. - thank you so much. - [all] thank you, mr. beast. go subscribe. - its legit. you probably could be next. luke, you've been saving
this really nice car. you wanna tell us why? - this guy works for my dad, he's such a nice guy. - we've talked it over and we
wanna make sure he gets a car, and he gets a good one, 'cause nobody deserves
a car more than he does. - let's take the car then. this is where you work? - yes, sir. - hey steve? - what's up, man?
- i was surprised my man. - luke actually has an extra car he wanted to give away. - aw, you're not for real. - yeah. yes sir. i am. - you wanna close your
eyes and walk out front? - y'all pulling my leg. nobody giving away vehicles. - open it up, boys. this car right here. - [steve] what?
- this is your brand new car. - are you serious? wow. what a surprise. this is awesome. - yeah. congrats on your new car. - thanks a lot. wow, man. this is awesome. thank you, luke, a whole lot. thank you. (horn honking) - luke's other grandparents
drove hours to get here, and they just arrived. - got a surprise for y'all. - okay. all right. - this guy right here shows up to my house and gives me 40 cars. and if i give away all these cars, i get that tesla. - that is like, crazy. we get this car, luke? - you want this one? - oh, i don't want that, i'm sorry. - this is a beauty here. - this is awesome. pretty cool. woo. it's mine? oh my god. okay. here we go. oh my gosh, luke. this is so crazy, luke. - it is really, really
cool thing you're doing. this is awesome. come on big boy. - congratulations. - [spongebob narrator] three hours later. - i just wanted to remind
you real quick, luke, that if you give away those 14 cars, this tesla is all yours. his friend just pulled up. we're gonna go meet him. so we got luke and brent. - i'm taking that one. - this one's making me feel really good. - well that was pretty easy. do you wanna at least drive it first? - yeah. - all right. congrats on your car. - got three more. how about you open up
the trunk real quick. - holy cow. - because we destroyed this car so much, we put a bunch of money in the back. you get people off the lot
so we can give one more cars. these nine have been
covered under tarps all day. we saved the wackiest for the end. you can pick any of these cars, but you can't take the
tarp off before you pick. - good. sounds fine. - you can pick this car right here, but it could be made of toilet paper. okay, well... - i'm liking what i see
from the shape of it. i like the big tires. - are you sure you want this car? - sure. - because once i reveal it, it's yours. it is a jurassic park jeep. why do you look like
someone would drive this? - this is my normal clothing. - all right, have a good day. - i'm so jealous of that one. - karl, i think you're gonna
be jealous at the last one. it's not gonna ruin it,
but it's pretty epic. you guys can pick whatever car you want, but we can't take the tarp off. - i have a good feeling
i know what i want. that thing right there. - really?
- i know what i want. - what do you think it is?
- a volkswagen beetle. - i actually don't know. i don't remember. i bought these cars weeks ago. - chandler, reveal it. - oh my god. ooh, it sounds good too. - [mr. beast] yeah! - this seems like a good car. - this one? - yes. - this is a surprise for me too. i keep forgetting what i bought. - it's not that bad. - thanks for taking it, bud. (engine revving) - oh, it turned off. all right. go, go, go, go. just put it right there. go man. oh, it died. - i feel kind bad, but he picked the car. hey, what's up, boys? - i don't know what this is here. - it just looks cool. i mean like... - well then get it. - i'm going for it. - he's locked it in.
- i'm locked in. woo! its a dune buggy. - can you drive manual? - not really. (engine revving) - let's say this was calling my name. ooh boy. - do you see what's in the front seat. - oh wow. oh man. - i may or may not have put a bunch of money in this car as well. what are you thinking? this? - looks like a batmobile. - reveal that car. this car is not only drivable on land, but also water. - the battery's dead. - oh, no, actually this car doesn't work. that's why we put money in the back. can you throw it in
neutral? we'll push it. - this is what we get for giving him a car that doesn't work. - yeah, we kind of played ourselves. - we gotta push it as well. - oh, there's no chance. - let's hit tareq. - come on guys. - remember that video where
we had people put their hands on a stack of a million dollars. - yeah. remember how mark won? - yeah.
- he came back to hang out. come on in, mark. what's up man? mark, you literally won a million dollars on our channel before. how have things been? - i won a million dollars, and i was able to provide
for my family and everything. thank you. i appreciate it, man.
- no problem, man. all right. well let's give away more cars. - next person right here. - maddie, there are only three cars left. - i think i'm gonna go with the truck. - you sure? - i'm sure. ooh, i like it. - it's literally three
trucks glued together. - this fits me. - not a lot of room for cargo in the back. what the heck? - so, because this car is a piece of crap, we put a bunch of playstations in it. - oh, i'm a gamer alright. - oh perfect. i'm glad you're a gamer, and if you're a gamer,
subscribe to mrbeast gaming. - yeah! - gaming channel shout out. - [mr. beast] enjoy your truck. (all laughing) yeah! - it works. the breaks work. - there's two cars left. karl, what's your thoughts? thank you. very insightful. i love putting them on the spot. - will. - i think i might take my chances. - yeah! (engine revving) - hear the music? getting really dramatic. it's building up, 'cause
there's one car left. here's what it looked like
at the beginning of the day, and here's what it looks like now. we only have one car remaining. - little jimmy. let's go. - little jimmy!
- yeah, little jimmy! - you have this car, and only this car. - i think i'll take this car. - okay. i specifically only want
karl to unwrap the last car. - why? what is it? all right. what did you do? i just got it. - here's the clip of me
destroying karl's car. and then after that we
bought him this car, and then for whatever reason, he sold that car and bought this car. kind of hurt my feelings. so we gotta give this one away. - i don't even know what to say. - just say "congrats on
the new car, little j." - thank you. - congrats. - after this, we will buy you a new car, but you actually gotta
keep the car we buy you. come on man. - he doesn't even have a
license plate on it yet. - ready to go? - where we going karl? karl? - right out here, okay? - and with that car given away, luke, you successfully
gave away all 40 cars in under 24 hours. - i did it, man. - congratulations on your new tesla. anything you wanna say? - thank you, man. thank you for real.
- no problem. hit the subscribe button. we'll see you later. - i'm glad it ended up
