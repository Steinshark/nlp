alright this just arrived from xiaomi today and we're gonna do something a little different for each of the products inside feel free to try and guess what the price is going to be as i'm showing it to you you might be quite surprised right at the top before we get to the meat of the package is the red knee go this is a smartphone released by the company at the beginning of the year but it was kind of a silent release they didn't make a massive deal about it but i've never been more impressed with a phone this cheap so let's take a quick look externally it is made of plastic it's got this metallic texture but it's ultimately just a sturdy sheet of polycarbonate it looks simple but that's the entire premise of the phone and it extends well into the software they've bundled in apps like facebook lite like youtube go apps that are designed for areas where you maybe don't get really strong reliable data connections and you should go for those you who don't know is a really cool app it basically lets you just download the videos you want to to watch on the go alright what are the specs what is the price it's got a 720p hd display it's powered by the mid-range snapdragon to 425 chip which does keep things going along very smoothly and something that's actually a positive here is a 3000 milliamp hour battery which with a screen like this and specs like this keeps it going for a long time and the price of all this 49 pounds or $60 i was blown away before we get to the main event here we've got one product that i kind of love and another one but i kind of hate so this right here is wait for it yami's aluminium alloy mouse mat we've also got xiaomi is wireless bluetooth mouse and these two products they look like they were completely made for each other right well the mouse at least is amazing this is one of my favorite wireless mice it's low profile it's curved so that it fits your hands really nicely it's got these soft touch buttons and the scroll wheel is really smooth for less than $20 it is an absolute steal i couldn't recommend this product more and then we've got the mousepad and i was skeptical but hopeful on one hand why on earth would you want one like this but on the other hand surely they must have had their reasons in the end though this one is a no there is just way too much friction and it makes so much noise i've been really excited to test out these next two products xiaomi doesn't really a lot of tablets but the ones they do definitely make an impact but first things first the meap had four it's an eight inch tablet and you can tell there is some bezel here but at the same time the fact that it's not huge and the fact that it's got these pretty significantly curved corners i think lends it a modern touch i do like how it always feels that you could slip it into a pocket although it actually is a lot bigger than most smartphones the weight is distributed across a much wider area so you don't feel it as much it runs on the pretty powerful snapdragon 660 chip it's got a slick polished ui this is a massive improvement over charlize past iterations i was pretty happy with the screen - you get in 1920 by 1200 lcd and all of this is a hundred and forty-nine pounds or a hundred and eighty-nine dollars so if an eight inch form factor is something that's actually useful to you then this is some of the most tablets you can get for the money it gets better this is the me pad for plus and it's essentially quite similar to that tablet but with three key improvements the boxes for these products aren't exactly hugely exciting you get 10 watt charges and you get usb type-c cables but the tablets themselves are the real priority here so first things first same resolution but a 10.1 inch display it is bigger it is better it is brighter and to be honest even though they have stretched it with the same resolution you'd be hard-pressed to distinguish pixels they've added a fingerprint scanner in the home button and the third thing is a mega battery this thing has eight thousand six hundred and twenty milliamp hours which know is not gonna last as long as it would on a smaller smartphone screen but at the same time you could expect 17 hours of video playback now in theory the perfect product to complement these would be the xiaomi air these are true wireless earphones and at the same time true air pod copies but i don't intrinsically have a problem with that if a product can do apple is doing but cheaper and better than that is something worth celebrating and to get one thing all the way these are good sounding earphones they isolate noise better than most and they even have those fancy new touch controls that everyone is using now the annoyances that i had though were largely due to it feeling like a first generation product the case for example has been designed in a way that if you're trying to open it with one hand the back of your hand will continue to push the hinge shut the earphones themselves they're a little slippery they don't slide out the case as easily as you'd like but to be honest for me the bigger issues were in connectivity also it's not like they're super cheap so for this kind of price you can do better it turns out xiaomi also sells sunglasses and they're pitching this is a premium product not as a competitor to some off-the-shelf pair from a supermarket they've got a hundred percent uv protection they've got a stainless steel frame and what's kind of weird about these is that they're entirely flexible and it's weird i've never seen a pair of sunglasses like this and it's not flexible in a disconcerting way it almost makes it feel more durable you're most less worried about dropping it instead of plastic pads they've got silicon so for me at least these were massively comfortable and it's really helped by the fact that they're just so light as for how they look it's gonna be massively subjective so i'll leave that up to you the only thing i'd say is the frames do seem slightly on the large side but this is not an expensive pair so when i saw this product my first instinct was to laughs i just thought it was a funny idea actually it very quickly became my favorite product in this entire video it's an attachment and it clips on to a tap in your home and it basically aims to save you water and the magic is done by this thing it takes a couple of hours to charge and from that can last six months so anyway i install this on my tap and it saves water in two key ways it physically reduces the amount of water that can pass through it but then spreads it out again so it doesn't feel like less but the coolest part of it is that it now uses infrared to detect gestures to start and stop the stream so let's read the second you stop needing water you just pass your hand over and it stops and you could also argue it stops the spreading of germs because you don't need to touch anything all right you might have seen my mystery unboxing from oneplus video in which one of the products they gave me was their one plus explorer backpack and i really liked that but it was kind of expensive this might be a better solution the xiaomi u river backpack has got water repellent materials it has got a ton of pockets and in fact even more once you open up the magnetic straps it's a tech person's bag the kind of pockets you'd keep a phone in or a power bank or some able's and it's about half the price of the oneplus equivalent making it still not cheap but much better value and something i can wholeheartedly recommend if you enjoyed this video i'm gonna drop a couple more that you might find interesting as links from this one and as always my name is erin this is mr. who's boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
