jeff from our sales team is my kind of guy he makes his bed like this but he cable manages computer like this he buys the cheapest furniture from ikea but then covers it in only the finest collectibles nice this is his light switch and this is his lamp he cleans his figurines like this and his floor like this i swear i swear that wasn't for me so with all of that in mind i'm sure you guys are dying to know if jeff was given five thousand dollars to spend on an intel extreme tech upgrade what on earth would he choose well intel obviously yeah and then the rest will figure out as we go [music] thank you right out of the gate there's a couple of things i've noticed first of which is that you already have a sick gaming computer that's not bad why did you focus so much of your budget on more gaming computer i mean i really like the anime collaborations they've been coming out with like asus and msi and i thought i'd just kind of capitalize i feel like i don't know i really like anime i thought i'd buy a bunch of their parts all right you spoiled my second theme and that is that basically everything you got is a computer brand collabing with evangelion and i'm going to reveal evangelion by the way yeah so i don't need to reveal that i am not cultured when it comes to anime and i have no idea what the hell evangelion is you have some evangelion to show me i do okay well let's start with that not this that's the special thing oh there's a special there's a special thing so i should i should close my eyes i would close your eyes okay you would close my eyes i could it's a special special permission special permission from colton and hr right from colton and hr yes so there's a thing that people get sometimes called a decky macra or a body pillow and they typically put like their favorite anime character on it oh god i got one of these are you kidding me it's pretty life-sized almost the same height and then wait dual purpose bam what do you think oh my god so there's that what does this have to do with evangelion nothing at all i just thought i'd really lean into the whole like weeb theme and got myself a body pillow of my boss and my other boss cool all right i'm gonna put this actually i'm not gonna put this in the bed that makes me extremely uncomfortable i'm gonna put it here well you've succeeded at throwing me off you and sarah officially win the game let's go what does it think alien evangelion is an anime from the 1990s i mean i've wanted like i want to see it though oh you want to see it yeah like do you have evangelion oh i don't dvds or like i don't i'm not that big of a fan they have the dvds i just watch it on netflix literally half of what we're building today is evangelion theme so if i have no idea what it is i'm gonna be lost is this a fidget spinner on your keyboard what is wrong with you you know when you're queuing for games you need something to fiddle around with while you're waiting i mean there you go at least you're not fiddling around with your body pillow yeah no this is the last scene of the anime essentially it's about this guy his name is stingy he's one of three kids essentially that pilot these robots and they fight each other like godzilla style and each episode is effectively like monster of the week okay at the end of the series they essentially ran out of budget and so the last three episodes are just like powerpoint presentations of just like storyboard drawings really yeah but people love it like people get like really really into like the theming and that's this big cult following okay yeah all right let's build a computer let's do it i don't want to come across judgy but i do feel like i need to open this build by warning that the best way to shop for computer hardware is not in fact based on the color scheme oh yeah you've spared a 12th gen k-series processor with a b660 motherboard that isn't going to allow you to do any overclocking all in the name of that it's purple and it does look freaking awesome look at the back too but i just can't yeah i can't in good conscience recommend that people buy hardware based on a cool silk screen graphic on the back where they will never ever ever ever ever see it versus based on features and performance and value how much did this thing cost that's a wonderful question i actually have no idea is it evangelion theme cart cart as easy as that thank you intel the up charge on this motherboard has got to be more than the entire cost of the table i'm building it on 100 oh my god i'm afraid to find out how much you just paid for a b660 motherboard can't be that bad 420 us dollars really sick you can get b660 boards for less than 200. oh okay never mind said one of the things i left out of the intro is that you know clearly buddy here doesn't mind paying twice as much for something because of the label on it i choose what are your favorite shoes oh my gosh they're hidden away in storage somewhere oh that's right this is a temporary living arrangement by the way before you guys judge me for how little money are sales people obviously make oh no offense to the people whose house this is hopefully they won't watch this video god well the walls could use a coat of paint that's all i'm saying i'm told that you do painting not today okay we banned painting intel extreme tech upgrades after andy's house no you can get this board for only like 220 bucks it was just a third party seller i think this might be eol how long have you been sitting on these parts probably like six months performance is temporary purple is forever maybe okay all right jeff's gone with 32 gigs of 5200 mega transfer per second ddr5 memory and a 12 core core i7 12700k so it's a weird thing where we're going premium in terms of the tier of parts that we're using but kind of like step down in terms of the actual performance 5200 mega transfer per second that's a pretty decent kit 12 700k it's a really good cpu but not top of the line and we've gone with a b660 motherboard but with a sick colorway that if we hadn't chosen we could have gotten something that is overclocking capable you know what i like it it makes for a fun video hell yeah hell yeah oh where'd you get one of those screwdrivers lttstore.com we're finally shipping the black shaft ones which means that we're getting close to the end of taking orders for them if you guys want to get one of the ones with the black shaft you're going to want to get an order in pretty quick get in the queue and for our ssd will be installing in the top slot closest to the cpu and we've gone with a crucial p5 plus with two terabytes of capacity oh no nope brandon roll i've got some bad news dude are you serious look at your socket do you see that damn this has like 10 to 15 pins that look bent in it that's so cool out of 10 how bad do you think this is oh that's very bad do you have a magnifying glass maybe not for a dull moment let's do some motherboard surgery i also don't have all of my best tools for something like this i think i'm actually gonna use my knife i could use a bit more light though what it looks like to me is that they've been pressed down and the good news is that's a relatively simple fix all i need to do is get under each of these pins and lift it up just a little tiny bit without breaking it if i can do that successfully 15 more times without making a single mistake then we're good i believe in you this would not have made contact with the bottom of the cpu oh oh got it man the temptation to go fast when you've got this many of them to do is very strong patience is a virtue hate socket surgery i want to clarify that i don't know whose fault this is it could have come like this from the factory but it could have also happened later hopefully you'll never have to do this but a pro tip if you ever do is use light and angles it's so helpful when you're trying to find something that's ever so slightly misaligned compared to just trying to look at it from one side foreign i think we're good to go great job well don't congratulate me yet it hasn't turned on next we'll be needing our power supply wall art i wonder if this plate licensed that we don't work with them anymore but apparently we still shop there we're gonna be needing our case also evangelion what is this other power supply they gave me two power supplies when i left the office why you have two evangelion power supplies you may not be very good with your money maybe not hey hey if you have them just in case you get a broken motherboard oh my god how much does this one cost this one actually due to the cost of at canada computers i think it was seventeen hundred dollars i think yeah right it was a different time i feel very bad for you yeah got some six speakers this desk is nice where'd this come from ikea oh it's rg stuff of course it is because it's all about the brand of course this is the aio i was wondering where this one was oh my god you've got an evangelion cooler it's okay though because his job is to take other people's money not to spend it there you go yeah if you were in like our procurement department or something though i would have some serious reservations if we need some new workstations like purple and green buddy we paid 30 more for these yeah but they're purple that's purple look how cool they are but maybe the theming they've done on this is really cool tell me about what i'm looking at here well it's purple it's got a couple of japanese texts on it do you read any japanese like are you that into it no not really no no okay that's pretty cool another one of the mechs in the anime i'm teasing him a lot today but the truth is don't tell him this is a pretty cool build and it's gonna look absolutely sick when we're done oh hi jeff hi your build is dumb okay thanks until while i'm working on this you're gonna pick which power supply you're using today and maybe just unbox it here you got it the packaging on that alone is probably worth more than the table we're building this computer on yeah very easily very easily it's like the thor 1000 watt one it has a little display on it too that's red switching it up a little bit wait what's going on here what's up red cables yeah you're gonna put red cables in a purple and green themed computer you don't like it do you sure i thought the whole point was that everything's purple well this came out in red the other one's red too yeah there's like a white and blue one i think but the box is purple and green no this one's purple and green and just black oh we're gonna put them to the test the test do you take the basic 650 watt power supply that matches the color scheme or the balls to the wall 1000 watt power supply that's going to put red all over it i think the red you'll take the i'll take the red i'll take the red we'll just so you're saying i've shamed you enough enough yeah that is the idea here i think honestly though i think that's even worse is it because now you've made it clear that it's not even about it looking good now it's just about the label that's about it now i'm worried that the packaging on the graphics card is going to be a lie too and you're going to have a giant red graphics card no oh we're good so this isn't even just an asus thing how'd they bung up the power supply because that looks freaking sick my biggest problem with this table is not even the quality it's the size don't worry we're doing great today we got this man is this one colored red i hope not oh this just isn't really colored anything okay cool oh that looks pretty cool though oh sitting on it yeah it's exactly the right height to sit at this desk i actually don't know if i want to know the answer to this question why do you need that pillow i don't really need the pillow i thought it'd be really funny do you actually intend to keep that pillow in the long term 100 absolutely i see wasn't it back in the day in the old videos we had the other body pillow in the office yes i don't know what happened to that we decided it had gotten a little too cringe we got rid of it yeah no worries i thought i would bring back those old memories with this one actually that's okay what does your so think of that pillow oh she loves it her parents though think it's super weird i'm with her parents okay i think what we've got here is a generational book the height's pretty close to your heights i mean it's definitely cold and tight look at me i'm cold and potter look at me down here do you guys like chairs subscribe to short circuit it's a really good colton impression yeah does it make you uncomfortable having colton for a boss though one day you're gonna come into the office and just he's not going to work there anymore and you're gonna have no idea what to do that's fine i have seniority so i mean i get his office next why is this eight pin cpu connector long enough to run to a completely separate computer on the other side of the room see the other one's fine i well whoa oh my god no we're good we're good this is a good table quality i don't know if i have enough space down here to put the psu cables in here oh my god this power supply is the gift that keeps on giving yeah i feel like the indiana jones and the last crusade meme here like you have chosen unwisely here you had the one that fits and matches but no jeff no you wanted this one you can go with the other power supply or you can rip out your hard drive cages knowing that you're only ever going to be able to expand with two and a half inch or m.2 drives which are going to be ssds i think that's fine i think i could probably live with that oh it's a bit of a pain in the butt to get at it though that's okay well yeah for you i'm the one dude you know what they say you win some you dim some right come on buddy hey there you go very cool so much room for activities now go ahead and put that in there you got it there we go oh hold on a second are you gonna have this on the floor are you gonna have it on the desk i'll probably have another desk okay then flip it over there like oh he's working on it this one that is exactly how you had it when we started like there we go because in the this display you'd want it on this side it's made to be right oh you want the display yeah it's all part of the aesthetic okay fine just do you need to have any actual airflow to the power supply fan anyway not gonna lie jeff i'm not a huge fan of what you've done with the cable management for the power supply here this is quite twisted it'll keep you on your toes yeah yeah great thank you for that oh jeff i gotta run the hd audio like that did i oh you're done dog here it goes man as a centerpiece for a build does that gpu work or what it looks kind of awesome hey the red is killing my vibe a little bit okay all right yeah looks good yeah yeah cover that up we don't want we don't want the people looking at this here no i'll show them i'll show them oh my fingers in there i mean okay don't look very closely it's bad gbs to close this up so i'm not going to but theoretically we are finished the computer build which means it's time to start setting up the desk you screwed up what what do you mean nicole has a more anime monitor than you that's right oh my god she has like the gundam one doesn't yeah what is this crap i'm gonna cut this from the christmas party last year so i thought i'll just save a little bit of money let's put it towards i'm gonna save money on unnecessary anime crap and i'm gonna spend it on unnecessary anime crap you bought that pillow how much was that pillow ah from what matt told me like 150 bucks u.s yeah i know i'm serious did you actually use your budget on that colton said you don't have to what yeah that's what he told me he's like yeah don't worry about it it's funny for the video [music] [laughter] goodness i want this you can have it i want this that's fine if it didn't come from his intel budget then i paid for it who does colton think he is just colton potter hey man how are you doing gotcha on speaker jeff informed me that the body pillow apparently did not count towards his intel budget because and i quote colton said it would be funny for the video did i buy that hundred and fifty dollar pillow you piece of [ __ ] unbelievable thank you for the pillow oh yeah you're welcome i guess i wasn't gonna question your choice of speakers these neck easers super nice i'm gonna hate this oh my god an orange no we had a good thing going on with all purple and green and then asus done bunged it up with red and then they then bunged it up again with orange is that an eve mouse pad as well yeah it is it is what yeah wow this is coming together i'm liking it and you know what the fidget spinner's grown on me here yeah it's got a nice bearing in it fidgeting this is really efficient fidgeting do you watch a lot of like tv shows and movies on your computer why did you go with these like six speakers i asked matt what would be good speakers and he recommended these ones and they don't match anything not at all no if you're down for quick and dirty cable management i actually really like the approach that this desk from ikea takes basically you just got this like pouch at the bottom and you just jam everything into it and then there's this slit along the top so things can either come around the back or they can come up through the desk a little bit closer makes it a lot easier to keep things tidy on the top can we fire this up let's do it moment of truth let's go oh no did you plug in the power supply at all yeah yeah take the switch off yeah and the switch is off okay okay oh no what did you do jeff what do you mean oh my god jeff well i see at least one power connector that's not plugged into anything in here oh that's so cool thank you so much oh you're oh here's another one ah yes happy little accidents right you're trying to stress me out here man okay oh that's a good sign three two one let's go yes let's go and it's purple okay that looks so good hello do you happen to know where the antennas are for the motherboard by chance and 10 as you say yes it has wi-fi built into it and i don't know ethernet in this room you have no ethernet and you don't think to solve that with an intel extreme tech upgrade no no i'm disappointed jeff's wi-fi is broken i wasn't able to connect to it earlier on my phone but i didn't really think too much of it and now we can't connect to it on the computer looks like we're going on a side quest let's do it wait this is as far as we're going that's your wi-fi access point yeah that's the one so because of how old the house is and how like thick the foundation is wi-fi doesn't really travel between the floors and so the best way to do it is like wi-fi repeater mesh network kind of dealio this isn't even powerline this is just a repeater oh did you not watch nicole's extreme she has a better monitor than you and she has a better solution to getting wi-fi to the upstairs than you yeah if your wi-fi reception is bad for your device and your wi-fi reception for your repeater is bad but this was working before yeah yeah the first thing we can do then is just try unplugging it and plugging it back in okay i'll do that you you stay there all right i don't think i can trust you to configure the wi-fi okay all righty should i restart the computer at all do i just stand look pretty hey you guys welcome to short circuit my name is colton potter we're going to be unboxing this chair the razer isker oh man look at the look at the lawnmower support we'll go for those here you get her done get her done is totally his catchphrase wait using wi-fi for the setup wasn't an option at all because your drivers weren't detected oh are we gonna have to drag this whole thing downstairs go through the setup process and then bring it back up we're in the living room now getting through the windows 11 setup wizard yes i'm sure there's a workaround yes i could have looked that up but this was probably faster let's go here we go we got this no problem that's a good sign that's a really good sign since we're here anyway i guess we could show off the next part of the extreme tech upgrade the 880 j 65-inch oled tv that is going to be replacing this fine other different tv yeah it could be better i would ask why jeff went oled but i already know the answer vibrant colors perfect blacks near instantaneous pixel response times and i would ask why he went sony but i already know the answer oh watch out with that oh wow there's a fan up there sony uses android tv which is great because you can install android apps their processors could be a little bit faster though and the other benefit of sony is they have excellent oh wow there's some stuff going on here this is excellent image processing and what's super cool is this is one of their tvs that have what they call acoustic surface audio plus which basically means the entire front surface of the tv vibrates and it can either be standalone or a center channel speaker in a surround setup which is really cool exactly and we're on the wi-fi let's go let's go you're gonna take this back upstairs now that it has an internet connection and i am going to try to get this tv removed from this wall okay we got a plan sounds good teamwork makes a dream work maybe oh did i just break that yeah you did uh-oh what is it okay oh it's a keychain oh oh it's no no these pieces are just glued together in the first place anyway okay jeff i'm tasking you with something for your in-laws here yeah yeah yeah get some wood glue put this on here put it in a vise and then it'll actually be as good as new very cool thank you very much appreciate it let's pull this out oh this one's this is not secured have fun okay i mean that means it's going to be fast to remove actually jeff don't go anywhere ah one two three lift that was it wow that's the whole thing oh my god that was so hard i sincerely hope that the hardware on this tv will work perfectly with the new tv with no modifications whatsoever i sincerely hope it i don't believe it but i hope it yes we're good this is gonna go straight on easy peasy oh i love it you're good is it on i think so how sure are you very you mean you think so you can't think so it is on here you go take a look okay all right let's go whoa your wi-fi is really slow i know we're getting steam installed but in the meantime what's the deal with this shelf i kind of just had a shelf available and sticking some stuff on here but i didn't really know where to put it that's as far as i got yeah are you gonna push off with command strips yeah yeah wait what well nothing heavy on it you know i was probably gonna put like i don't know like a figure or two on there there's not gonna be anything heavy i wouldn't put any valuable figures on it no not really i think it looks pretty good i think you're good put it on there so right there yes please okay because this one's permanent we ran out of magnets this one's got a command strip on it which theoretically you know is easy on the wall but in practice the steam finally installed on this thing yes yes all right let's get signed in let's run some games what was your old machine spec again 1070 oh used i did a video on ltt like months ago talking about how i got it used for like 300 bucks i think something like that canadian so this was a big upgrade for you yeah just a little bit okay what's a game you couldn't play before then cyberpunk for sure you got your desk all set up and your bed is well in some ways it's better yeah it's better in other ways it's gotten a lot worse i don't know what's weird or me sitting here next to it or him sitting next to it let's freaking go oh i am here wow you're really good at games jeff i try my best how's it running very very very fast ultra okay yeah we're doing all right this looks so good can i fight people yeah almost definitely wow i mean that's not who you're supposed to fight oh my god they'll come to me crime reported to me so you're just gonna fight the entire police force yes that's it this is just an unofficial survival mode i'd like to hope so yes and we've unofficially survived yet another intel extreme tech upgrade hope you guys enjoyed getting to know jeff from the sales team and i hope what you didn't take away from this is any guidelines for how to manage your finances thanks intel thank you intel as always intel delivers an amazing gaming experience even if you bought your cpu six months ago you guys can check them out at the link in the video description you're going down no no it's okay they're coming after you with a mech see you know you're putting that bad energy out there if you were to able to support me you know pat me on the back a little bit maybe i would have lived but you know it is what it is there there
