let's get started so today i'm here to talk about like the hiring offer of meeting c++ right so hello to everyone in the chat and on linkedin and later on youtube so are you hiring for c++ is the question right this is also the target audience kind of defined with that let me go into my slides and then we can start so i am looking for employers for the job fair in two weeks and two weeks actually we will be sitting here in hubo and having the job fair live and i would like to announce which employers are at the job fair but that's kind of yeah this is not the case at the moment i'm still looking for employers to join and i see that some some companies may be interested from what i see but i have not yet seen signups from companies so i guess the next two weeks will be where this happens so this has often be the case this is just normal but if you are hiring right now and you're looking for a good way to connect to the c++ community the meeting c plus online job fair is the perfect place for you to be to present your company and on the first day we're going to be at 300 p.m. berlin time middle european time 4 3 hours live and on the second day we'll be at 8:00 p.m live for again two to three hours to cover kind of you know all time zones and we've been doing this now for quite some time since 201 21 and last year's result i recently posted to the blog 225 candidates actually submitted unique candidates submitted over the cv sharing form for meeting c++ last year into this and there's some data on it which i'll you know present later in this and for years i've been hearing that c steps are hard to find but one thing i can say this has changed in 2023 there's lot less interest in hiring now and there's seems to be mostly companies still looking but they're looking with less effort and more in the traditional ways what they've you know do for other things and more like where they like look for all their jobs they also get their c++ fix but they're not doing something extra and for some companies that might be the right strategy but i think there's some companies out there which actually should do something extra and should be presented like a job fair for c++ to specifically be able to you know get a feeling what deaths are on the market and what people you can talk to for c++ and to kind of you know see how things are going in this direction i did a survey and these are from last year from april and august and the question basically is your employer is currently or hiring for c++ not hiring for c++ and letting c++ folks go and there we see it's like last year's numbers it seemed to be getting a bit better in august than it was in april last year and if i look at the numbers of this year it's like not as good as in april last year and i wonder kind of is this like a seasonal thing and kind of you have to get a bit more data on it and i'm looking forward to have this question probably be again a survey in april to see if that changes but for the moment we seem to have like still majority of companies are hiring but it's not over 50% and a third of companies is roughly not hiring and 20% are still you know downsizing and restructuring and i also do ask this question on linkedin so april august we see that's like of course on linkedin there's always a bit more hiring and firing and that's the general trend and if you look at this year it's very close to what twitter had in is also on linkedin this time so these are very close much closer than than they were in the past year and so generally yeah about 47% are currently hiring not hiring is like about a third and about 20% is right now in the way that you know there's there's various reasons for the the amount of people being let go financing has become a lot harder for startups a lot of startups go down or just you know structure and have to you know conserve their trying trying to you know not not end the startup but keep going so they they set people free we've had the big hiring and firing spree especially the the big tech companies hired a lot of people to basically stock them and to not make them available to the market and the competition and that ended last year and a lot of those people were set free and there is not yet like the that the market has all you know bounced back and rehired those people that's my impression right now so if you're looking for c++ developers now is the time to really hire very good talent and let me quickly read chat i see a lot of people in the chat thank you for coming and yeah so if you have any questions just post it into theat but i think i will continue in a second with a talk and then present mostly on the data i have from last year all right let's carry on [music] so my offer from meeting c++ is through the online user group which was reaction to the pandemic and this exists now for soon as four years and from the beginning i thought something like a jop fair would make sense and so the whole concept was making really really a good introduction in 2021 and since then we've hosted like a few events of that like four to five events per year this year i can host one in march and in april usually april is bad because of easter but easter is like right on the border of march and april this year so that in late april we have long way lead before people are returning from the holidays and going into holidays again after april right may is big holiday time in germany and june and and some other months anyways so the plan to run those drop fairs is march april late september maybe beginning of october and then end of november to close the year and that has played out fairly well in the recent years um the concept itself is you have your table and people join it and you talk about your company what you do with c++ what your open positions are what you think about candidates what they should learn or what they should have etc etc and on the other hand companies are sitting on their tables and candidates join them on their table and candidates of course also ask the same questions like you know what do you do with c++ how do you hire what do you hire and etc and if it's a match then an interview is not at the event okay just want to clarify this this is not an interview event it's more like a fair where people come and go and you get to meet a lot of people again the times in the afternoon for europe and the first day 3:00 and 8:00 in the evening on the second day that's a to cover the time zones better and b to the evening job fair is not as popular in europe with the recruiters because they like to you know attend in working hours but when we have companies able to staff that in the evening in europe and the european companies or american companies or you know other companies from time that makes sense we do have very very interesting folks come also in the evening when they are of work because they can't come during work so this is a very good thing and then there is the cv sharing form which captures all those folks and these are the majority in here which are not able to come to either date right there's always like doesn't matter how many job fairs you make you never capture the whole audience with it so they are captured through the cv sharing form they can just just you know upload their cv and that's one of the things we're going to talk about but let's talk a bit more about the event so the event starts with a kickoff where i you know talk to the event and linkedin to get a bit more folks into the event because those can also be quite interesting like people joining seeing it by random chance and having an interview and getting a job that's always a good story too and so the other goal behind it is just simply to to explain the event to the the audience and get a better retention to come to the louch and if you're hiring and you want your own live stream like only the audience should like only be on company x of your y company y of your choosing then and you want to cover like what you do you maybe you're tra company maybe you're an automotive company maybe you're an embedded company and you want to specialize on that and say this is the topic of the stream then i i can do your own live stream and you also can sponsor a user group meeting which then also is online but let's talk a bit more more about the series sharing form it's always online and the job fair sponsorship gives you six months of listing so even when you do not find your candidates during the job fair you still get a lot of companies to have receive you know candidates and so your chance is to get them within the next month and this is very successful this has helped a lot of companies hire very good people this is how the first page of the form looks it allows candidates to share their cv with sponsors and also to enter an optional six months listing i i do have a candidate listing which is visible to the sponsors of the event and so if you're joining the event you automatically have like right now it's 76 folks which have their cvs listed there for six months and of course after six months so they drop out this number kind of you know bounces often up up and down every day a little bit and so this great a light profile of where they're coming from where they want to work how they want to work their c++ skills field of work and the years of experience and let's have a bit of a look into that for the candidate listing i have this overview of regions where we see that the submissions currently come from europe and asia mostly a little bit of north america a little bit of africa and a little bit of south america but this changes all the time and europe and asia just we have the biggest reach and also just north american companies have not that often joined so that's not as popular and not as well known in this time zone these are the skills from those candidates and this is basically to tell you know the recruiter and also to give us a bit of data on what you're kind of you looking for to you know have employers know as your skill set so generally c++ 14 lunux 11 17 modern c++ object orientation and cmake are the top seven the ordering is changing and there's some trends for a very long time it was c++ 11 on top now it is mostly linux if i go into the other data we'll see that and here it's now 14 but it's just you know so small a margin and then you have a lot of other skills where people are you know skilled in and i also do ask like what's your background in the industry which fields have you worked in here the big change now is for me that embedded is on top and usually for the last years this has always been desktop i think it has something to do with automotive making it to the third place because automotive deaths are also embedded deaths mostly and then there's finance industry robotics image processing and so on you know it's a big mix of backgrounds and people science university of course covers of the education some people work for finance some people work for hpc and so on and when we look at the data for 2023 225 candidates from 52 countries and country-wise i do have a bit of a chick n egg problem when i do not have employers from a country i have less candidates and if i can advertise like for a certain country and employer it usually helps us retention from country first place here for countries has always been india and germany and united states usually are close to you know the second or third and then comes just the selection of countries from asia and europe and it always kind of differentiates how the how you know how this mix comes together pakistan iran turkey brazil netherlands and poland are there currently like in the leading group and the next and this year will be again a bit different this is kind of you know fluctuating the skills for last year and here it's again it's like the the top seven this time the ordering is linux c++ 11 14 17 cake object orientation and modern c++ and if we go around 90 folks choosing something that is like 50% so make is above that boost cute and functional programming is around it and yeah cs 20 is not there yet but i guess within this year could rise to it becomes more popular also becomes more available with compilers you know going down the chain of deployment slowly and then there's just the specialities and package managers unfortunately are still rather a rare choice fields of work for last year also it's as i said desktop is on the first place embedded and automotive now are second and third and if automotive stays around like that then probably embedded will become the first place and server finance other image processing and so on you know and one thing i'm wondering is like ai is not like really a space where top c++ c++ is a top lead but it plays such a role in in our future i guess that we'll see like either like if the high you know resultes into nothingness and we all find out that ai is not yet ready for the market as you know certain things are looking in that way or if we're getting used to using assistance which are ai and cloud powered so that's like something where i look into for this year is like this this is like a field where which finds more people with a background in in our community or not and i wanted a way to compare those numbers with the overall community and this is still work in progress but i do actually have the perfect tool for this with the meeting c community survey which is a survey tool and just as a k this is a different data set and context different matter so take this with a grain of salt but interestingly at least currently the data is fairly similar if we take a look here at the c++ skills in the community we see that 114 and 17 c++ standards is on top it's not very surprising linux is then was more than c++ on the fourth and fifth place and c is already like yeah it's not it's then cmake linux cmake and then mod c++ the top six hold up from the top seven we have object orientation and that does not hold up and i feel like this is makes a difference when people are wanting to be hired then object orientation is more important than when with a general community interestingly more people have chosen c plus 98 which is around 200 and object orientation should be like at'5 i'd say maybe'0 [music] and if you generally look at the top five skills it's sorted a little bit different i think this is a reflection on that people in a job search are more comfort comtable to choose something they're really comfortable with and c++ 17 might be for some still to new or they want to or they assume that someone who uses c++ 17 also uses 14 and 11 and that is covered for them which you know that that's like i think the the main difference between those data sources is that people employ employ different strategies and have a different impression of what is important for them to choose in this form and for the job search form definitely it's also that we do have people maximize that so that they choose a lot of things they know about like what i'm interested in and other people like what i'm really good in and they're like just just a few ones just just three or five and others to like a lot which might also reflect on your career status and so i don't i don't want to limit this to to five or tell people how much they should choose but this makes a difference fields of work is very similar desktop is on top closely followed by embedded big difference is that third number here is industry and then it's automotive image processing and server which are the force place shared together and then everyone else ai is like more like in the not so often chosen ranks here interestingly so this could be an interesting difference to to job searchers maybe maybe that becomes important for them to choose ai in the future because not not of not all of those will you know be chosen for truth but we'll see and if you look at and compare these we see that industry is is a big difference but it's not really mattering that much and then automotive image processing server but i think this is also like really a reflection on what companies we have at the job fair if we have a lot of gaming companies we have more gaming deaths coming to the job fair and hence this will be stronger in the data and otherwise it will not be as strong in the data of course and same for finance if we don't have finance companies finance field will not show up as strong and then maybe we had companies with a lot of embedded background in the past and so embedded has become stronger right now i'm also asking for years of experience and here kind of like these are always the same looking graphs roughly like 2/3 60% until 10 years like people which are either juniors or just have become seniors and then for last year this goes up to 33 years in the industry which is like really senior right and so that's something that is like yeah just interesting to see that there's a lot of folks which are joining the industry and they're looking for their first or second job and then all the other folks which just you know are looking for their next gig and this basically is a cv sharing form it allows candidates to share a light profile and then this gets shared with employers which sponsor the event and on the second step of this of course is for the candidate to select the companies they want to share with okay i i want to stress that that as a company as an employer you're attending but you're only receiving cvs from candidates that are actually interested in you right candidates have the choice to also be listed in the candidate listing though you can look into the candidate listing and look if there's candidates which you find find interesting as an employer but the active notification that an candidate has chosen you is always the meaning that they've you know clicked the box for your company and in this step also they upload the cv in the resume and not everyone but most people added general cover letter and if you look at the general data of the history now last year we had was 100 candidates in march submitting a record four companies attending back then and then kind of the interest in hiring during summer naturally wi away so last year we probably had the last drop fair in june until companies really demand this again because just companies seem not to be interested to attend these events in holiday times september we had linda which is still in in the form great company great employer but we had from from the execution it was like a late sign up so it was a bit difficult this is the new low and then this went up again and then still you know got all the those candidates from the second meeting which was like 69 so the the average of 60 candidates with each event still troop and if you join one job fair as a company you will also like you know receive more candidates after you're attending and mostly when we do like for a year that means you're getting the candidates from the next job fair too and as i mentioned you know attending companies and early sign up influences how many candidates are coming and what kind of of candidates are attracted the event consists out of sponsored tables where companies you know sent their staff to and they have their logos listed with a link to their recruiting platforms in the cv resume sharing form on the website in the job section i can introduce them in the live streaming they have access to the recruiting tooling i'll talk about that in a minute and the me to advertise with your logo to say hey company ha why is cominging and you probably want to come and you know meet them and it drives and guides the tooling i do have fre tables which are basically just letting you have a table at the event as an employer you're listed below the sponsor tables it's mainly for getting a feel for the event format i kind of have to limit it to two visits you get a smaller table and this is for also like some some some people want to join and then they don't get the funds soon enough it's like two weeks now and in some companies it takes like four weeks to acquire something like that and and building so either then join the next job fa join this one and then use the budget to join the next one too and quickly explaining what a table is this is a virtual lounge and people sit on a virtual table with eight four or two seats everyone is able to join by clicking on a seat once two folks sit a meeting starts and meetings kind of have their own ui so when you once you in an in an meeting you will not see the lunch again but everyone from the outside is still able to join your meeting as long as there's a free seat on your table these meetings are limited by one hour which is a feature by hubido and then basically candy dates should go to the next table or you know they're free to leave your table if they're not interested anyways after the amount of time they spend there that's up to them and recruiters then simply should join the table again the recruiting tooling is basic overview which candidates have submitted to you you can read their message open their cv which you also received pre email you get the statistics i showed you for your company specifically so this probably helps you with internal presentations and helps you to to say this is what we spent the money on and so many candidates we had skills they had and this can be very interesting data for your teams i do have a search form because we do have a lot of candidates admitting the one event had 100 candidates submit and that can be too much to keep an overview and maybe you have multiple roles maybe you want to have you know you have this one rooll was cute and then you want to search for a candidate in your submissions that knows cute and maybe you know you also have some other interface where you need to have the legacy interface where you need to have boost or job where you need boost on the server or mfc in the legacy and so on you can just choose the profile if there's like that the need and there's also a text search to cover the cover letters and the cover letters kind of also have this this data pasted into it so you can search for that also in the text search and that basically is a job fair it's a longtime project we're doing it now for three plus years it's a success and but it needs really and it hangs on the employer support from companies and early stups help a lot more for the community to know who is coming to the event and we always learn with states how to deal with it and how to improve the event and let me quickly read chat i see there's some questions here's an interesting question is there some data indicating continents as well as industries like fintech automotive that hire more c++ engineers as most of my candidates come from asia and europe i can kind of generate graphs for that and i have done that in the past but that then gets a rather long talk and so i skip that this time but yes i i do have the data on the regions and i can basically generate a graph of skills by region for example i can do that i do only have candidate data i do not know what companies and industry on specific continents or countries are looking for ah this is also a very good question and i i agree with that that there is of course this whole developer setup and usability with code that comes and yeah that's actually good i i think i would like to also have this like in the skills covered but yeah this is like how to express it how to find a name for this and so you know and i i understand that you know that you're mostly missing an candidate is an interest and experience and meta aspects of the software development life cycle how to build stable yet extensible interfaces apis and well maintainable code and i think this is like really difficult to to to cover in in such a form but that's of course something you can ask for and also kind of see like if yeah let me generally let me let me think about on how to integrate it in the skills i probably get around it but right now i yeah i i agree with it that it would be interesting to know if people also have experience with st ops and api design and maybe that's already like two good keywords to add to the skill set which helps people find out more on the candidates they have in front and with that let me continue back to the slides i quickly want to go through the submission model candidates user form to choose the employers and then this creates an application state employers also can basically use the filter search to create an application state i do not have like a direct back channel to the candidates because while i do have an internal state for candidates which can which you know can be applied from the employer s my experience in the last year is or last years is that this is not really used and i don't want to force like my tooling on companies companies have their own internal setup and they usually are very happy when they receive the candidate email with the cv attached that's fair game for most companies some companies have a different setup that is basically that you see the link to their portal to submit it there which is an extra step and the way they receive candidates but they of course will filter out those candidates that are not as much interested to submit to company y and the y portal and you know create an account there and do all the things that you need to do to submit for that company and that is completely their choice that is something which came as feedback from employers and i've implemented it and that's covered but and also i had the case that like one company currently is not listed because they fill their positions and they don't want to be listed if they don't have positions which is understandable and this cv in submission form basically creates a profile which covers the skills the field of work the region or just continents i also collect the the country where you're from but i don't filter on that that would be a bit of an overkill and the years of experience and companies may filter or search on these and the filter is actually you can set this also as a visibility filter like your company is using cute and you do not want to see or be visible to candidates that do not use cute you can set that cute is mandatory you can choose a range of things which then are either all mandatory or partly mandatory and like for example if you want are are specifically looking for candidates with an experience in ap design api design or something that would be a good feedback which we just got thank you for that where you could set a filter on and then you only get candidates which are choosing this as a skill but of course the the downside of that is that some companies overdo this and then wonder why they do not receive any cvs right because not everyone chooses this and some candidates will be rather critical of choosing ss of skill which is the down the downside of having like too many skills or skills which are more like in the ex like you know maybe something would make sense in that to filter for that but then you might end up with having less candidates for stuff which is not like very common and for the community we do get a better hiring we get less use of recruiters and head hunters from agencies which just you know spam everyone with drop offers which right now is not so much the case but i guess it's still happening and i do get the funding which i need to to run the event right this is not my free time it's not a hobby and i i try to integrate employer with this event into the platform edge i have build over the last more than 10 years now and it's still my goal and linkedin just last week i two sus ago linkedin went over the 40,000 so meaning c++ is growing a lot still and there's a lot of c++ deaths out there and from from the numbers we saw that right now about 47% of the deaths i can reach are working for an employer which has currently open positions so i hope that some of them will be with us in two weeks to join the job fair and we have fun for three hours and conversations about jobs c++ and often during those talks a lot of tables evolve by the way around topics like api design how do you use certain features how do you you know keep your code maintainable and par programming and other things but it's completely up to the companies what they do on the table so sometimes you have devs talking to deaths sometimes it's recruiters talking with sts and so it's completely a different experience from table to table often and with that thank you for listening i'll be looking again in the chat if you have any questions also for youtube if you have any questions just put it in the chat in the comments there's not chat on youtube and if you have you know contact me on linkedin write me an email job fair. med.com leads to the website where you can sign up as an employer and march 12th and 13th are the dates for the job fair and so if there's any more questions i happily can answer them there's a comment on languages you speak as in german english or something yes but i for now i don't want to put that into the tooling because it's just too much and i think that for most companies that are hiring they also have english- speaking teams or some of the german companies have chosen to you know to restrict their reach to europe which i also understand smaller companies hiring here might just only be visible for european candidates if you see this after we have been live i can still answer the questions in the comments and i usually do also there will be youtube this will be on youtube probably by tomorrow tomorrow and yeah send me a message on linkedin contact me if you're an employer that is also a good thing because that's like you know one of the main goals right now is again to find companies which join this event and some companies might join it again that has actually happened that we had multiple companies join it over the years for a few times so we'll see what happens and with that i hope to see you in two weeks at the meeting c+ plus online job fair
