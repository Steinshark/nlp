all right so i did need to do something very very very important okay which is i do need to tell you guys something that i asked on stack overflow okay so are you guys ready for my question that i asked on stack overflow i'm gonna blank the screen for a second because i don't want you to even i don't even want you to see what i'm about to ask okay plus i'm a little scared tweeting it all right hold on hold on hold on okay so i i found the original hold on hold on i gotta find the problem is that the question was deleted and so i do have to like go through and try to okay here we go the title to the question of course was what is the best way to measure your dict in bytes a friend and i were having a boys night out and we got on the topic of compressions and unique ways of measure data structure unique ways to measure data structs one of my problems at work is managing a very large lru we are frequently running out of memory and estimates all seem to be way off i thought it would be straightforward to measure dicks but it's but it's been complicated let me explain the current approaches one json stringify now i could simply measure my dick by using json stringification but this has its drawbacks it does not always get the proper length of my dick often under under measured i worried i worry that my lack of measurement is due to utf-8 i also feel like the stringify dick performance would be sub optimal option two pickling the second option would be to pickle addicted to pickle addicted for those unfamiliar with pickling here's a resource pickling i'm unfamiliar with the performance of a pickled the dick but it seems to have a firm base of support the protocol protocol version 4 added in python 3 4 adds support for very large decks this is this does seem to fix potential utf-8 encoding issues easily by measuring the deck's output directly protocol v5 discusses out of band data so there is a potential here for being able to take the dick as it comes no matter how much there is of it but there is a fundamental problem you can't rely on a first glance memory usage of your dict the nature of memory allocation is a in expansion and contraction means that it can grow substantially when you start messing with it potential measurement ideas i could take the approach of dick measuring head on by considering the runtime implications of python i also feel this to be the most correct i don't want to consider pointers or i don't want to consider pointers and their weights to be zero and the previous two methods really only consider direct dick measurements as opposed to the indirect heap management helping hand does anyone have any ideas how to measure pointers and put or potential pointer counts within my dict i know dicks are very complex and i don't want to miss a drop of memory i was thinking of simple taking the sub plus or sub length plus four for each key and value thanks hello we are writing in reference to your stack overflow account the prime engine your question the best way to measure your dick in bytes was deleted as rude slash abusive because it appears to have deliberately crafted to have multiple sex-based double entantras how thoroughly you wove the double entendras into your question was impressive but it also made it clear that it was doing so intentionally in addition given that it has been closed as a duplicate of a question which already has multiple duplicates it does not appear to offer much benefit to the site for anything other than the existence of double entitrus in other words it seems that the efforts to completely rewrite the question in order to remove the intentional focus on dick's jokes double entenderes would provide little overall benefit to the site regards stack overflow moderation team you're welcome you're welcome twitch okay the name is the dictogen i do have one more story for you i actually i do actually have one more story for you i i kid you not i kid you not i went to versel okay the versel conference i know it was a dick move but it was a bold addict move but it paid off they really grabbed that question with both hands and just just got it out of there you know what i mean so i went to the versel conference and i was i was standing around a table and there were multiple people at the table of course and i was going through looking at each person and i looked at one of the one of the the tags instead stack overflow and i would like this this is all i said this is it i didn't say anything else i said you work at stack overflow and he's like yeah and i was like dude one time i asked a question that got deleted and his response was this you're the dick guy and i was like i am the dick guy i'm the dick guy everybody i have the dick guy like i gave him no indication into what i actually did he knew he could smell it he could see it he could feel that i was the dick guy not all heroes wear capes okay some of us just exposed dick to questions that's it and i'm that guy okay i'm that guy there's some big big dick energy going on there okay all right the name is the primogen i
