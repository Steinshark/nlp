hello and welcome to today's talk about hiring in c plus service meeting c plus plus i will be speaking today about how median c plus plus you know utilizes the online world and let's reach into social media to start and run a job fair for now over two years and we'll present some of the candidated data on 2022 and give you a bit of a you know plans and the next job fair is in two weeks so if you're right now hiring there is an opportunity for you to be visible to the community in two weeks and to sign up for the job fair so let's get started so let me start with you know why meeting c plus plus so for terms of visibility and outreach and the community me and c plus plus has a huge reach and linkedin twitter and other platforms it is some examples here for the numbers and it's an untapped possibility for you to just have this as a visibility and the job fair itself exists now for two years and it's really a good success for companies which are coming and hiring through it and that's a lot of the things we're going to talk about but one direction first also i already mentioned the results for 2022 are usually at the beginning of the year i will pull an aggregate from our candidate data and show you a little bit about that it's on the block but it also will be more in details here in this talk but anyway let's start with a problem at hand c plus plus devs are hard to find and i've been hearing at this for years from lots of people as a community organizer it's not something new it's like a current and ongoing thing which has been you know there for a lot of time and of course with all the community exposure i have had i wondered why is it the case and to me like it's always like that i have barely met a company which is not hiring or which has it's not looking or it's not like saying well if you find a good kid any date or a good developer we will hire them so there's a lot of competition and always has been for c plus plus devs and on the other end this year might be a bit special and maybe it's right now a good time to be hiring because of the society you know set for the people which got laid off but for for companies which are hiring currently there might be some talent on the market which otherwise would not be because right now really everyone is looking the companies which are having open positions and the kennedy dates which are looking for new perspectives but then when you see how people are hiring in our industry how every developer in our industry gets spammed by recruiters just you know hiring my shotgun and you you find your candidate but you alienate the rest of us and also i kind of find it funny that those people always claim to look at your profile and your profile is perfect that's that's why i'm contacting you right but if you look at my profile this this thing i actually have on my profile there or i had my profile there that i'm not looking for a job and so if they looked at my profile they wouldn't have contacted me right and on the other hand there's this linkedin trick where people put the emoji in their name so if someone writes them automated and it's just a text replacement of their name the emoji lens and the message and then they know that this is an automated message which just has been sent to them because they showed up in some search another thing which has actually happened to me last year was misgendering and that's very very common for the women our community from the data from linkedin i think that the c plus community probably is something like 15 to 20 women at least but it depends like how you select this and how you look at this but it's definitely a minority and so misgendering for women in our community is very very common and yeah that's not not how you should hire right that's not the quality we should aim at and i've been also asking the c plus community about this in 2021 and last year and the question was if you're not looking for a c plus plus job how many recruiters slash companies have contacted you for one in the last three months and 2021 you'll saw it so the majority hasn't been contacted but it's actually when you look at the overall data like two-thirds of us almost have been you know reached out by a headhunter and in 2022 it gets it it kind of you know gets it gets worse so that now the leading group is 30 of us which have been like really really a lot of contacts it was headhunters which they didn't want to and which you know it's just annoying them and if you're on linkedin which is the platform there's a lot of headhunters you are of course more exposed to that and it's also like the trend for 2022 holds here i probably would ask this question in social media again when the first quarter is over so that we you know actually have data from that year and let me quickly go into the event and read the chat to see if there's any questions i see someone who said hello yeah see there's a bit of an audience greetings to iran and so i'll be continuing the talk then if you have any questions you can post them in the chat i will continue to with the job fair now let's go into you know maybe we should be trying a different approach like we should and it's what you know i i have been thinking about this and when i started the online user group which i have now for two years maybe we could offer an event for hiring and in the group and so the idea came together to bring together those who are looking and the the picture you see here is now actually two years ago in mid-march in 2021 when we had the first big drop fare in remo back then today we're using a different platform we'll show you in a minute how this looks and today but so for this year minister plus will organize for job affairs we had a similar plan for last year but last year it was actually five events because the main event only had one company attend and two other companies reached out to me and said well we did have time in may but how about june so we had five events last year and the overall concept of this is that there's tablets virtual tables where people can take a seat and then there will be a conversation about c plus plus usually you know of course revolving around your company what your company is doing with c plus plus what your needs are for developers what tools you are using what standards and some people might have questions about that and some people might you know directly tell you what they need and of course also as as a recruiter and as a company hiring which has a table you kind of set the tone and you know you can kind of you know you can present on this table you can have a presentation you can have a website home you can work on code with people there's a lot of possibilities you can do here and this fair is on the first day in the afternoon three o'clock in europe and in the second day in the evening of europe so we kind of you know we get on the first event we get a lot of people also from asia which are still the evening and the second day we are a bit more friendly to the folks which are not on the east coast in the us and stand up early so last thing i'm going to talk a lot about the cv sharing form there's a cv sharing form which is used by all candidates which either are coming through the event or do not have time to be available at the event or couldn't make it to your table because sometimes we just have too many candidates at one time and then they don't come back later and just see me sharing from usually gets 60 submissions per event after two years this is kind of the average and what i learned last year is that i'd like to kick off the event with a welcome message and so we've experienced and started experimenting with live streams to linkedin like i do right now and this will be now definitely becoming part of the event that we start the live stream have this as a workout message introduce the platform but also introduce the employers and maybe have some of the employers as guests in the live stream i want to keep that optional because not every employer has the possibility to do so or not every employer wants to be on the live stream and that's totally fine and also if if you want more than that if you want to you know be the content if you want to actually be an employer branding working with some music plus plus i of course i'm happy to you know organize your own live stream where we will be talking exclusively about your company there is a sponsorship for user group available which would fit very well and of course we can work on other ideas and plans and i want to mentioned the the cb sharing form it's always online and the job fair sponsorship gives you six months of listing this is something what i learned last year is i i want to offer more than just the event when people sponsor the event because this is also kind of a contingency plan to ensure that you're receiving candidates for a longer time and sometimes we just have job fairs which are not very well matching to candidates or to companies and we have less attendance and so this is kind of helping with that but let me talk a bit more about the cv sharing form the cv sharing form is where candidates share their siri and this or resume this is on our website and the candidates are able and it's their job to select the employers they want to share their suv with but this is the next step and this step it creates a light candidate profile where they can select the country relocation and remote options they would like the c plus skills as a big field in the middle there with lots of super skills which you can choose from a field of work and years of experience and this kind of creates a live profile and when this was set up i realized i can do an aggregate i can just draw a statistic from this right and so this is the countries which candidates came from from last year and total we had about a little bit more than 250 candidates last year and these are these are unique numbers from 57 countries and we sometimes have a bit of a chicken and egg problem if we have like no companies from a country we have less candidates and if we don't have candidates we it's harder to get companies so this is evolving and you have to try right now it's very good if you're hiring internationally or from europe or north america but that you know companies often come back and have to try their works out for them and so this is the chosen skills from 2022 as the aggregate of over all of those 250 candidates and actually when i looked at this number i realized there was something nicely matching up with 250 and that's percentages 50 now is around 20 of candidates so you see everything from opencv to the right is basically under 20 and candidates that feel that they should you know match with that 40 that's everything from generic programming to the left to the right and anything which is like above genetic programming in this bar is more than 40 percent and the candidates fields that they should you know this this doesn't mean that the other candidate days are 60 doesn't know it it means that 40 felt that they have enough knowledge to be you know sharing that with an employer and might be you know asked about that in their interview and so we see that when we go to 60 now it's the top six modern c plus plus object orientation c plus 17 linux c plus plus 14 and secrets plus 11 and then c plus 11 has always been in the lead and you probably already guessed that that's 80 more than 80 of the candidates feel that you know their basis their base of their knowledge of c plus plus 11 and fee go on and look at the fields of work in 2022 we see that like there's a lot of desktop embedded and then a closed field of telecommunication server finance automotive image processing and also like a lot of people seemingly with the science and university background and also i want to stress like these bars are always heavily influenced by which companies are showing up an example i usually pick out because it's like so specialized as the gaming community if we have gaming companies actually be present at the event of course we have game developers from the gaming industry coming but if we don't have them they're probably not showing up and so this graph the also kind of you know adopt to what industries will be using this in in the long run and how often they will be using it years of experience is now very much settled in that we have a lot of people which are in junior or on the way to become juniors and followed by an equal amount of people that are looking into becoming seniors or our seniors and then there's everything which has more than 10 years of experience with c plus and i'll probably like in you know looking for a teamly position looking for more experienced ways to work with c plus plus and are really the the other third which we have on our candidates and as i said this creates then and every candidate fills us out that it creates a light con candidate profile and companies also can filter on this so a company can choose to say we do not want to be visible to every developer we only want to be visible to people that know cute and boost which they them can't say like how many how many of those things they they won't have to match to the candidate that they're eligible so you can choose not to be visible to all candidates as a company but most companies don't use this feature actually they are choosing to rather look at every candidate and then to filter out what they are interested in for the candidate the next step after the form you saw on the first slide on the section is then to basically select the companies and the employers they're interested in so there's nothing automatic and then share their resume and add a general cover letter which is optional so not everyone everybody does that you should do it it's better but not every candidate does it and so this offering is not a candidate pool okay so right now we don't have a pool where you can just look around and say these are the available candidates this is a solution where the candidates actively choose you as an employer that they're interested in you and you don't have to code call candidates that maybe you already have a job or maybe already you know are figured out that they're not interested in in your company as an employer and if we draw an aggregate for each event and see how many have candidates have have been submitting over this form you see it's like really like a pretty well line which goes around 60 and the two events which are really below 60 are the events of the second quarter from 2022 which is the may and the june event which in total had three companies it would be very good to have that as one event would be in around 60 probably a bit about that i guess but they kind of cannibalized and didn't have the same time frame to be visible for candidates so and here are the skills for 2022 and 2021 and i left the percentages and so you kind of can see what this is for of course only for for last year for 2022 that for 2021 this doesn't match up that nicely so i didn't put the percentages in because it's it only makes sense if you have those bars and one thing i wanted to point out is like i looked a lot at this graph there's a tiny change that c plus 14 is now more or less a little bit ahead of of linux but maybe that switches around in this year so one of the changes i saw is that conan was like on the same level as drm going last year and this year it's definitely has gained there and in 2021 next to conan was android and android also has gained more than conan so it's a bit up in this but it's also a very close group to to see catching up here and interestingly above this group last year was catch two which now is like on the same level as android so there has not been like a visible adoption in the candidate population for catch two and generally i think that we you know will not see a lot of this like this this data doesn't tell us like about the general developer population okay this is the general population we're just looking for a job in an international context so don't pull general assumptions from those graphs that's what i'm saying yeah and then the event sponsored and free tables the sponsored tables are listed so sponsored tables if you choose a sponsored table you are listed in the cv sharing form only website and in the job section with your logo the introduction the live stream is there potentially having you as or someone from your company as a guest to to speak about your company for like five minutes you will have access to the recruiting tooling which i will be speaking in a minute about of course this enables me to work on the event to work on this problem and to advertise it and new and your feedback drives and guides the tooling the free tables are an option to try out the event it's event only so you're not being in the cv sharing form you're not visible on the website what's your logo but you will be able to attempt the event you could be listed below those tables from the sponsors you will be getting the feel of the event format and this is limited to two visits because if you tried it twice and you don't see a value in it i don't want to waste your time in giving you another free table and also your table will be smaller so you will have less capacity for candidates in the event and i i do want to also explain to you what a table is because you know we're in a virtual environment and they're you know what what is this is the lounge which hosts this event today and the table is a video room with eight four or two seats everyone is able to join this by clicking on a seat and once two forks sit on a table a meeting a virtual meeting starts which is like a video call people are still able to join your table then as you see those three of those four tables have actually a meeting ongoing and you kind of see the time which was taken down meetings have their own view which is like from inside the meeting you will not be able to see the tables anymore i will take you to a different view these meetings are limited to one hour by obedo and unfortunately obedo doesn't place you on your table again but it just you know freeze the table and getting everyone off the table which is unfortunate about this whole video feature i can change so if you're like recruiting on the event please go back to your own table and if you're a candidate decide if you want to return to the table of the employer you just talk to if you're just been there for an hour you might you know want to talk to a different company and i i manage the recruiting tooling there is a little bit of a backend on my website which helps you to view the candidates that have submitted to you via the form and also gives you similar graphs as i showed you for all the candidates that have submitted over the platform to you those graphs i think might be useful for you to have an internal presentations this list is available if you use a team feature to other people hiring in your company the candidates which fill out the form are also made to you to the contact email you gave or not to the contact email to the job email there's these are two different emails can be the same email but this is the difference i should mention and of course i've implemented also a filter and a search functionality so if you have a lot of candidates and and we do get per event like 50 candidates which of course not choose all the employers but 30 to 40 vendors for some companies the reality and so i figured that it would be good to have search functionality this is either searching on the actual values or doing a plain text search and that way you can find for example folks for a position that you want to hire for you know having a position which really needs to know knowledge of cute or poco or you have a team which already works with c plus 20 and they're like having a new position and they're looking for someone who is already knowledgeable in c plus plus 20 so this enables you to specifically get an overview on which candy dates let's submit it to you have which knowledge and that is basically the current standing of the job fair it exists now for over two years the first real job fair was in march and two years ago and there was like a pilot in for this first tryout of this in october 2020 which worked pretty well and so we continued to work on this since then and i was trying to to update it to keep it current to see where the trends on the time go and what other features we can add to enhance the visibility of this and also this is like this with every event we reach out to the community and more people are knowing about this so this penetrates very very slowly and sinks into the community the knowledge and most of the people i'm reaching for the event are of course not looking for a job but they will know about it and when they are looking for a job they will probably then if it fits for them use the tooling or come to the event to share their series with their employers and let me again quickly see in the chat if there are any questions okay one second there's a question [music] so burke asks hello is there any reliable resource out there for junior c plus devil lopez how about which subjects to focus on in order to get hired i think the hiring requirements it's really diverse so i think focusing right now on 14 and c plus plus 17 knowing those bases potentially having something visible on github and generally knowing build tools knowing modern knowledge there's something which can make you interesting to a team it doesn't mean that your team is like hiring you because they have all that but maybe they are also hiring you because you are the new guy or the new person the new girl that brings in that knowledge that they say we are now you know hiring new positions and we want to have people with newer standard knowledge so that they can share their standard knowledge with our folks but our folks then can share their knowledge about our code baseless and on the same time and maybe that is also like you know a good onboarding strategy for companies to hire people that have a good c plus plus 17 knowledge and then works through c plus 17 in examples in their code base with they are current employers and employees so that they can be on board at easier and also yeah kind of you know gives knowledge to the team and i was like to chat like if you have any answers to that question i'm happy to to you know to let you post to the chat about that if you can answer a question on the chat that's always great and with that let me continue yeah so these are the eight companies which are listed at cv upload.mcb.com which is the form this short url leads to the form and these are the companies which are currently listed and which you can choose to submit your cv if you're looking for a job these are the companies which are currently using this regarding the job fair in two weeks we currently have two companies signed up which are the last two icons here quasar and davinci and i have like two or three other companies which are interested and also this event should give more people to have you know an interest in coming to to the event and as oh as i always say it's really important for the event to sign up early as a company to be visible and usually a lot of companies then sign up a week like next week or the week before the drug fair so that is going to be probably more than the two companies which we currently have but the form that's also like the advantage of the formula form always has the companies of the last half year available and i quickly want to talk a little bit about the submission model the candidates are using the cv submission form and choose the emperors they are interested in with sharing then the application state is kind of this through this created right this is known application and my system made it then an email with a link to the uploaded cv to the empires i do also offer the filter search functionality so maybe it's not the email maybe it's a filter search functionality which actually gets your attention and also this updates application state and then in theory there will be an application state where you could look at the website that's not implemented because the reality is that mostly employers choose to directly reach out to you and they do not update the internal application status in my local database right and i i could force employers to like only work with this database and only work with the website but that would not fit their hiring processes and we want to enable a lot of employers to be on this and not only work with a few employers that have the time to go through an external process for hiring and so the reality is that the cv submission form where you choose your c plus plus skills in your field of work your region which is continents and also your country and years of experience is then shared per email to the companies and some companies may already like filter for visibility on this if they only like some some companies have chosen to filter on region to only be visible for candidates from a certain region because they hire locally they don't want to support international hiring which i understand is often like smaller companies doing this and on the other hand a lot of the companies we currently have do hire internationally and so they are actually taking the not the filtering approach they're taking the approach to look at every candidate and of course then what's for the community and this it's a better hiring i hope which will improve as it includes employers and it's kind of also inclusive for them because they only get the candidates actually that chose to have interest in them so it makes their hiring process also more effective and of course yeah this oil generates cross funding for my online activities because the online platform we use costs money and my time costs money and also this helps with building a platform and a network for c plus plus which is still what i do is meeting c plus plus now for over 10 years and we're pretty successful in underscore and of course i am always looking for employers to join and many thanks to the companies which are currently in the system but also a lot of the companies which you know have users and mostly i see like the pattern that some companies useless even like until they have hired everything they wanted or that companies right users once or twice a year to include that in their hiring process and so thanks for all the support and these are the eight companies which are currently in the system live and where you can submit as a candidate to end with that thanks for listening reach out to my website and here in linkedin etc to the email if you have any interest in that if you have any questions i'd also of course now we'll be looking at the chat i see that somebody asks a question of the slides i usually don't share the stats i could upload them on my website maybe i do that but this will be available as a video so if you missed the first 15 minutes or if you don't really want to watch this again this will be on linkedin directly available after the event ends as a video and i will upload this later today on youtube so this will be later on youtube and then also be on winning c plus plus again so yeah ah there's a question which i always get present question is the fee for the sponsored table the only fee when hiring a candidate yes this is this is a lot of companies have asked me that and i see a lot of companies got by similar offers burned where basically you have to pay extra to access your candidates after the event i want to keep the prices fair so that it's available to a lot of companies and i want to also keep the offer fair for both sides so there's no extra fee to contact the candidate that's also why i directly why other form mail out to you as a company the candidate was the link to the cv that you are able to contact them and there's the question from sri lanka greetings to sri lanka it's always amazing to see which people i reach us online global organized sql first certifications that you can enroll that's that's a good question i i have in other years i have seen some attempts to have something like like that but i do think that there's nothing right now which is wildly recognized rhino groom has a mentoring program but i am not sure if this mentoring program is like available to folks in sri lanka either because of the availability of runner grim or because of the costs that rana grim has to charge for this mentoring program maybe this will become available we actually would have ranagram as a guest on march 20th and we will be speaking about the mentoring program and the online user group and also just this as a spoiler for for the next months and events so then thank you for listening if you have any additional questions i'm happy to look at that and otherwise i will be closing the live stream thank you for listening thank you for coming c33 33 people are at least live on linkedin still that's pretty good and then yeah as i mentioned the video of this will be available later on linkedin it's available basically as soon as i oh there's another important question no it's not so you can still sign up for the event on the 14th march okay this this is open it's like go to the job fair link there directly takes you to the website of the job fair and then there's another link going to the booking this is available and it's available till next week basically until friday probably you should try to get that through to have that in the system monday before the event is also still like an a theory possible but it's not helping with the event so much it helps you as a company of course to sign up late if you can not arrange it before that but if you can make it earlier that helps a lot you and also you like the sooner you sign up the the the earlier you receive series because from the moment you books are sponsoring you're visible on the website from that moment and from that moment a candidate that chooses to use this form like people will have using will have been using this form right now or will be using this form today because of this live stream and of course this live stream also has a bit of the opportunity to reach out to all your folks to sign up to the event so no it's not like i do this talk and have the sign up close that that will be not a good idea and so if you don't have any more questions i will close the live stream thank you for listening i'm looking forward to see many of you in two weeks either as employers or as candidates and with that i'm going to go offline with a stream
