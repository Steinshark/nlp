i mentioned soup in terms of progress there's been a little bit of tension a little bit of love online in terms of deep learning so i just wanted to say that the kind of criticism and skepticism about the limitations of deep learning are really healthy in moderation jeff hidden one of the three people to receive the turing award as as many people know has said that the future depends on some graduate student who is deeply suspicious of everything i have said so that suspicion skepticism is essential but in moderation just a little bit the more important thing is perseverance which is what geoffrey hinton and the others have had through the winters of believing in your own nets and an open - for returning to the world of symbolic ai of expert systems of complexity and cellular automata of old ideas in ai and bringing them back and see if there's ideas there and of course you have to have a little bit of crazy nobody ever achieved something brilliant without being a little bit of crazy and the most important thing is a lot of hard work it's not the cool thing these days but hard work is everything i like what jfk said bought us going to the moon us i was born in the soviet union see how i conveniently just said us going to the moon is we do these things not because they are easy but because they're hard and i think that artificial intelligence is one of the hardest and most exciting problems there before us so with that like to thank you and see if there's any questions [applause] you
