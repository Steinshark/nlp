hi everyone in this video range we're creating some simple clothing for our character so i don't need the animation window opens at the moment so i'm just going to right click on this dividing line here and say join area and join to the right like so and then i'm made to select all of the bones in pose mode all taran old chief to get my default pose back and i'll go into object mode i'm just going to put these bones on a separate layer so with them selected i'll press m and just move it over to this layer down here so we can click through here to look at these two layers separately and if we hold down shift we can view them both at the same time but for now i just want to see the character object and i'm going to select this and go into edit mode and i just want to select all of the vertices belonging to this leg region here to use as a starting point for the trousers we're going to create so i'm going to go into wireframe so i can select the back vertices as well and i think the best selection tool here will be the brush select which we can get by pressing c i can change the brush size with the scroll wheel i'm just going to select all of these vertices here like so i don't want that one so i'll just middle mouse click to deselect it then i can right click to cancel the brush select tool and we'll press shift d to duplicate these vertices and then right click to cancel the transformation there and now i want to separate this on to a new object so i can press p and separate by selection and then press tab to go to object mode and just right-click over the legs to select that new trouser object and quickly go into the object settings here and just name this either trousers or pants and i also want to give this a new material so we'll go into the material structure and just remove those two materials there create a new material called pants and i'll turn down the specularity let me just go into solid shading mode so you can see this and i'll make this a very appealing shade of brown something like that it looks nice then you want to go into edit mode on the trousers here and let's just select all the vertices and press alt s to scale it up a little bit so that it's not interfering with the leg mesh and to make it just a little bit less a form-fitting we'll press w and just smooth it out a couple of times maybe once is enough and i'll just need to scale that up a little bit more since it's intersecting with the legs again all right then from front view i just want to go out right click to select this top ring of vertices and then scale that on the z-axis i just did flatten it out all right we've got some of the body sticking through the pants at the frontier so i'll just move these vertices forward a little bit and it seems we have the same problem at the back so just manually shift these vertices around until the body is nicely concealed all right i'll then ultra click once again select the stopping of vertices press e to extrude right click and then s to just scale this in just to bridge the gap between the top of the pants and the body all right now i'm going to leave any tweaking for at the end of the video for now i just want to rush ahead and create the top so i need to move this pants object to its own layer i'll move a to layer 2 over here and now i will select the character once again go into edit mode and like before i mean sure press c and just go through and select some of these vertices here i think this is actually gonna be easier in face mode this time alright so just something like that should be a good starting point let me make sure that i haven't got too much of the neck selected there i'll just shift alt right click to deselect that ring there and haven't grabbed in if the bottom that's good so shifty once you had to duplicate right-click to cancel the movement p to separate by selection and going to object mode we can right click to select the top object and in materials i'm once again in to remove these two materials great new material let us call this shirt i guess it's sort of a long sleeve shirt and turn off the specularity and this can maybe be some sort of bread like so alright i'll then go into edit mode select everything old s to just fat in this and we want to smooth this as well just once and then scale it up a tiny bit more okay i'll go into vertex mode and just flatten down this line here once he enters by scaling on the set axis all right i'll flatten that a little bit as well and we've got some intersections over here in the armpit region so let's grab this move it down a bit and some random intersections here on the shoulder let's look from the back i've got some more just to quickly fix all right that looks okay now i want to view this at the same time as the trousers so i'm going to let me actually move this onto its own layer moving on to layer 3 and now we can shift select layer 2 & 3 to view those all at the same time now the shirt is obviously intersection with the trousers at the moment so let's scale this up a little bit to make sure that that doesn't happen and you can imagine that this is where things get very tedious when you have lots of different items of clothing which can all be worn in different combinations and you have to make sure that you know they all fit nicely together anyway these two are looking ok so i'm quickly going to you into the object router and just call this shirt object shirt and then we will go into the character object i'd like to just change this material i'll call it skin just do something a little bit healthier looking so maybe something like that and then i'd like to make some shoes so you can just select the character go into edit mode just zoom in here and select the foot shifty as before to duplicate and let's go through this process once again of separating by selection then selecting the shoe and alt s to scale that up a bit let's give this a new material so i think to remove materials will it be an object mode so just remove the skin material from that call this shoe and now i get something like that is okay let me just flatten the bottom a little bit so i'll just box like that s-said and scale it flat just like so looks okay i don't want the feet sticking through so i'll just move it down a tiny bit on the z-axis to fix that okay so we've got some shoes the last thing i want to do is just create a little mop of hair for the character so let's go into edit mode and i'm just going to box select this top half of the head yeah shift d to duplicate that p separate by selection and on this hair object i'll remove the skin material and said create a new hair material all right and i'll just make this some sort of dark color like so that's fine i'll then go on to the modifier section and i'm going to apply the mirror modifier so that we can not have completely symmetrical hair and i then also want to add a solidify modifier so with this if we just adjust the thickness we can stretch it out like so i don't want it to be quite so dramatic just a tiny bit like that should be fine and then going into edit mode it's a bit irritating that we can't see the vertices through the solidified mesh so just enable that little button over there and now we can see these vertices on top and i'm going to turn on snapping by pressing the magnet icon and there is snap to the nearest face so this will just let us move these vertices around and it will be snapping to the faces of the head and so we can start styling our hair so i'm just gonna make something very crude if you want to make more sort of interesting hairstyles with like spikes and side sweeps or whatever these things are called you'll probably need to model the different sections of the hair individually but with this technique we can basically just make something very crude like this alright so i'll just go around and what's happened over here it's snap to the other side of the head so just fix that alright does that look okay possible his hair mm-hmm almost let me just fit a little bit more maybe make this a tiny bit spiky up at the top here just to make it a little bit more interesting okay i'm going to mmm it's kind of weird isn't it anyway i'm going to say that that's good enough for now so with that done we have all of the pieces assembled of our default outfit let me just quickly go into the hair object and name this hair and because i forgot earlier i'll sing on to the shoes and name these shoes if we want to be really thorough we've also select the character itself and call this the body finally i just like to select the shoes move these to their own layer and select the hair and move that to its own layer as well so we can i easily look at individual pieces of clothing just by enabling and disabling the different layers let's start with just the trousers enabled and what we need to do is see how well the trousers deform during animation now because we created these trousers from the actual body mesh you can see that in the modifiers panel it's got the armature modifier applied already and if we enable the bones here and just go into pose mode and go into weight painting mode you can see that the trousers have got all of the weights from the legs but probably it's not going to be deforming exactly how we want right off the bat so we'll need to do some tweaking i want to get these bones a little bit out of the way so got to do what we did earlier in a previous video just changed the display type to wire here on the armature options and then i'm going to open up a new window and just bring back the dope sheet get on to action editor and let's open up the run action to loop the animation i'll set the end frame here to 16 and if i press alt a the animation will play and we can have a look around so from the back here we can see that there are some intersections with the body and also the line of the pants is sort of waving up and down a bit which looks a bit odd so let me pause this and i'm just going to hide the body layer for a moment and i just want to focus on getting the trousers deforming nicely on their own now to help with this i think i want to make some quick adjustments to the pens mesh itself so i basically just want to straighten out some of these edge loops so main to alt right click to select this one and i'll press s&z to just straighten ralph's a little bit and i'll double tap g to edge slide this down we're still snapping so let me turn that off and i'll do the same thing with this here double tap g slide that down and just make way for a new edge loop over here press all deaths and just fatten that a tiny bit alright then i will go into weight painting mode i'm going to find a frame in the animation here where this right leg is sort of as high up as it goes so we can see that it is currently intersecting with the brim of the pants so i'm going to select this upper leg bone and i'll press t to bring up the brush options and i think to resolve this we're going to have to sort of remove some weight from the top of the leg here so i'm just going to turn down the strength and increase the radius a little bit and just start brushing over here a little bit like so and we can watch the right leg to see how that looks alright so that seems to i've mostly fixed the intersection problem that we can maybe bring in the blur tool and just try and smooth out a bit what we've done here all right it's back to intersecting a tiny bit but what we can maybe do is add some weights to the brim of the pan sear on the leg bone so we could do this with the brush but it's gonna be a little bit inaccurate so maybe it's best if we go into edit mode here and let's just select this room here and in the mesh data we have all of these vertex groups named after the different bones so currently the upper leg left vertex group is selected so i'm just going to set the wait for that to something like 0.3 and then press a sign and if you're going to wait painting mode you can see that's now colored correctly so if we just frame through this let's see how it looks it's looking okay i might want to reduce the weight a tiny bit there some glue instead change it to maybe 0.2 and assign that okay and let me go into the hip spoon and give that a hundred percent weight now rich so i think that's looking fairly good let's have a look around at the back here it isn't waving as much as before which is nice yeah that seems fairly reasonable okay so let's bring the body back and let's have a look what's happened here okay just need to play the animation to sync that back up and so we can see we're getting a lot of intersections at the moment and these are going to be very tricky to fix purely with weight painting so instead we're going to do is use something called shape keys to shrink the mesh of the body underneath the areas that are concealed by clothing so basically how it will work in our game is that we'll have shape keys for each of the different parts of the body and depending on what item is the character has equipped we'll be able to drive the values of those shape keys to shrink the appropriate parts of the body so we can try this out on the legs for example i may go into object mode select the character object so here in the mesh data panel we've got this shape key section we can just press the plus icon which will give us a basis key and that's just the default state of the body and then we can add in new key and we'll call this legs and let's then just hide all the layers except the body i'll go into edit mode and i'm going to select all of these vertices of the lake here and a little alt s and shrink these down so that it's nice and skinny i'll write something like that and now if we go into object mode we can see it reverts back to normal but we've got this value slider on the leg shape key so if i bring this up to one you can see the legs go all skinny again so you can imagine that in the game when the player equips an item which covers their legs we'll just drive the value of this leg slider up to one to make it nice and thin so that it doesn't intersect with the mesh now as i mentioned we can of course have shaped keys for all different parts of the body so we could in served as having one for all of the legs we could have one that specifically does the upper leg and one that does the lower leg so that the character could wear shorts for example and then we'd only make the upper half of the leg fin and the lower half of the leg would be as normal but we can worry about that later let's just focus on getting these legs working nicely so i'm going to bring the pants back here and we can see that the body is still not entirely covered up by the pants so let's go onto our leg shape here and let's just try patching this up so that when we go into object mode everything is properly concealed so i still need to bring these vertices in a little bit more it seems don't ever need to adjust these here as well a tiny bit chuck that in let's see how that looks that's getting closer just need to maybe adjust some of this here all right let's try playing that animation i'm seeing a tiny intersection over there that's probably something we need to fix with weight painting though so let me go into waist painting mode and how do we fix that maybe we need to use the subtract tool to just remove a bit of weight in that region from the leg bone another intersection seems to be gone all right so that looks like it's behaving fairly well where are we still getting an intersection that i can see a small flash of skin just through that so let me come back into a painting and let's see how do we fix that that's not helping so much hmm we might need to add some weight to the hipbone just in that region all right so i think it's all covered up now now we just need to see on the body what this looks like when we change the value here because we don't want it to be too outwardly visible of course if you say the characters topless and you put on some pants you don't want to see too much of a change in this region over here otherwise that's going to look odd so we maybe need to fiddle a bit with that and just to make that less apparent okay so more tweaking obviously wind - but let's move on to the shirt so i'm gonna hide the pen slayer and show the shirt layer and just to make this a little less grotesque let's get the legs back to normal no press alt' say to view the animation and you can see we've got some intersections with the body and the bottom line of the sure she is waving up and down a lot like the trousers were so let's hide the body layer for the moment and i'm going to go into weight painting mode on the shirt and with the leg bone selected i'm going to use the subtract brush to just remove some of the weights from the back here it looks like the brush is hitting this front part of the shirt as well which i don't want i'm just going to undo that and go back to my cell track brush and i'm going to use this face selection mode and then if i press c i can bring up my brush select tool and i'm just going to select these faces at the back here and then when i brush over with the weight brush you can see it will only affect those selected faces all right and then let me press a to under that selection and then only select these front faces so let me undo that selection at the back there and now i can easily just paint over these faces here hmm i want to go to the ad brush and just add a bit of weight in there because i want this front part to sort of jostle up and down a bit with the leg otherwise it's going to intersect obviously let's see it something like that might be okay i'll go out of face select mode and let me bring the body back you see how that looks so i think that's looking nice we just need to now do some shape keys for the upper part of the body some glue create a new shape key for the torso and another one for the arms alright let me show only the body layer and i'm going to go ahead and just select all of these torso vertices let me do this in face mode rather alright i'd only select this ones at the bottom there and then all 2s2 just shrink this in a tiny bit maybe scale it on everything but the z-axis like so alright yeah accidentally did that on the arms shape key instead of the torso so let me rename this to torso and i'll rename this arms let me just now remove that series 0 1 ok going on to the arms shape key then i'll select all of these are vertices alt s shrink that and ok we can now drive those values just over there so if we show the shirt layer now and let's bring the torso and arms up to a value of 1 if we now play this we hopefully no longer get any intersections that looks good might want to just tweak the arms here so that by the wrist it isn't so thin just so that it doesn't look so odd where it's peeping out of the end of the sleeves there all right so that looks nice let's now try this with the trousers on as well so here we'll have to put the legs up to one that's working quite nicely and let's just for completeness sake show the shoes and the hair as well so he has a little character running around with some clothing on and generally just looking very handsome so in the next episode we'll be continuing on in the same vein creating some armor for the character and i think in in particular will be creating a helmet plate body and plate legs so until then cheers
