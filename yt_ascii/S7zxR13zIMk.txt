in 2021 netflix dropped 17 billion dollars in cash 13 billion accrued for its content a significant portion of that was spent on making its own shows and movies in 2021 the company spent five billion dollars on originals people aren't going out to see movies in the theaters anymore unless it's for a marvel movie yet the film and tv production businesses are busier than ever before pandemic shutdowns notwithstanding all of that is thanks to the streamers what's the strategy behind all this content spending content is hard to value it's not like a box of biscuits and different companies have different ways of doing so however the goal of a pure play direct to consumer video subscription service is pretty straightforward you want to grow the subscriber base you want to release content that gets more new customers to sign up and keeps old ones from churning either to a competitor or to something else and you have to make or buy that content at a reasonable return netflix makes money from subscriptions the longer people subscribe the more it makes and while some subscribers never use it and still keep their subscription the best situation is that they watch a lot of shows on their netflix account and they keep watching month after month this requires vastly more content back when there were only three to five networks the tv show production machine used to only have to make some four hours of original content a night from september to may cable expanded on that a little but the season system remained now netflix and streamers have to commission produce and release new shows each month year round in 2019 there were 500 original scripted series made and because of the sheer volume these have to be produced more quickly and cheaply in today's tv production environment there is 60 percent less time from green lighting to release and 65 percent lower budgets per original content hour amazon and i presume apple ii add a few tweaks to the model yeah they care about acquisition and retention too but they also use their video subscription products amazon video prime and apple tv plus has retention tactics within their particular ecosystem it is content marketing billion dollar white papers thus amazon wants to measure what shows incentivize people to sign up or extend their amazon prime subscription but more on that later in october 2021 netflix changed the way they reported their content viewership they used to report just how many accounts watched a particular show for at least two minutes the new methodology would present the number of hours viewed for each show or movie presumably this says more about which shows or movies hold subscribers attention for longer whereas you can argue that the old metric just told you how well the content's thumbnail performed however we're still missing how far an individual subscriber gets through a particular show or movie retention and retention is key is it 500 million people watching just four hours or two billion people watching just one a recent bloomberg news article caught my eye and in it there was a really interesting statistic in the case of squid game netflix estimates that 89 of people who started the show watched at least 75 minutes more than one episode and 66 percent of viewers or 87 million people have finished the series in the first 23 days 90 of viewers finishing at least one episode and 66 percent finishing the whole show that is kind of crazy good an example of this focus on retention i have noticed that netflix original shows don't have to hit the arbitrary 16 or 22 episode limits that a tv season requires thus they tend to be tighter without padding or random side quests netflix wants them to hold people's attention longer not to fill up the hours in addition to a show's retention netflix assigns values to the people who are watching it shows watched by new signups or have been previously inactive are said to be more valuable the idea is that the show got to be impactful enough to get them to reactivate their use of the service according to the bloomberg article the two are summarized into a single internal metric called impact value this metric makes the various shows inside the netflix portfolio comparable with each other divide the impact value by the cost it took to make a show and you get a return on investment metric netflix reviews a show's impact value ratio 7 and 28 days after release it reminds me of something that i have read somewhere with regards to youtube you are in the best position to judge a video's performance seven days after upload rather than after 30 minutes when youtube starts showing you statistics speaking of youtube it is interesting to me how these metrics overlap with what youtube content creators work with an experience on a daily basis and in this i can use some of my personal experiences for background the metrics that youtube makes available to its content creators tell you a lot about how to think about making and valuing pieces of content leaving aside the revenues from sponsorships and whatnot one way your average youtuber might value a piece of content over another would be to look at how much ad revenue it brings in that is calculated based on two metrics how long they watch the retention and who is watching the audience retention the longer a person watches a video the more ads they watch and the more the creator makes the youtuber mr beast has repeatedly made clear that he wants people to watch 80 percent of his videos not only because it racks up the ad impressions but also because the youtube algorithm seeks to reward good retention a good retaining video is more likely to get pushed out to more users at the same time youtube assigns different values to who's watching the videos a metric it refers to in its dashboard has revenue per mill or rpm the ways it is calculated i've not really looked into and have had a hard time predicting what i have found most reliable but not always so is by country viewers in australia the united kingdom and the united states deliver a much higher rpm than those in taiwan for instance that being said i cannot say that it much affects how i in particular pick and choose my topic ideas as i mentioned earlier amazon's strategy for prime video is slightly different from that of netflix's retention is undoubtedly important to them but they seem to be really focused on driving new signups this makes sense since prime video is supposed to be a suitable acquisition channel for the rest of the amazon ecosystem for amazon reuters in 2018 mentioned a metric called first stream and it is frequently referenced in the documents reuters got to see note that these are older documents dated december 2016 so keep that in mind but i don't see a reason why the overall strategy might be significantly different if someone streams the motoring series grand tour right after they sign up for prime then that show gets credited for the win something they call a first stream in that shows first season reuters reported that the grand tour had over 1.5 million first streams to prime worldwide once you have established these metrics as your ground truth you are able to then calculate your returns by dividing by the amount of money you pay to acquire or create the piece of content the grantor in this case costs 49 per prime sign up the best of its cohort which is not bad if you recall that prime cost 99 back then 119 now which means you've immediately made back your cost on revenues not profit but add to that the strategic benefit to amazon for someone to have prime prime members are far more locked into the ecosystem buy more stuff and all and the show was a huge win for them in 2020 amazon spent 11 billion dollars on content up 41 from the previous year the fact this budget has kept on growing means that the strategy is working the biggest and most dressed up content marketing budget in the world originally the company invested in niche tv that garnered critical acclaim and won big at the award shows bezos himself mentioned it in 2016. when we win a golden globe it helps us sell more shoes by 2017 however the data conclusively showed that high-end prestige dramas and their awards were not delivering better cost per acquisition numbers than four quadrant blockbusters in other words more shows like game of thrones rather than transparent the company promptly changed tactics with a variety of franchises like the wheel of time and tom clancy's jack ryan and of course the 500 million dollar mega deal for the lord of the rings prequel tv series i recently watched on netflix an episode of the tv show voir made by the youtubers who made every frame a painting this episode is called film versus television and it notes how the two mediums developed their own distinct straightforward style film with its limited time budget but richer canvas television with an emphasis on character but shot to be watched on smaller screens it has made me think more about the style of a piece of content made for a streaming platform i think that content even if netflix labels it a movie falls more on the tv spectrum they apparently encourage their filmmakers to accommodate second screen consumption in other words on the phone while something else is going on up on the television which means less budget for the art department with bland props bare walls and big close-ups of actors saying their lines the analytics are apparently bearing out the experiment everyone seems to hate red notice but it's been the number one stream movie for a while it's interesting to consider how the streaming business model will affect the viewing experiences of its content redditors say they want all their movies on streaming and never have to go to the theaters ever again maybe they should consider what that might mean for the content they'll end up watching alright everyone that's it
