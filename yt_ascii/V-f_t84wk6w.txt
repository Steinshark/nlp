ladies and gentlemen we are fascinated by chess ai specifically chess ai that is tremendously better than us like stockfish like leela like torch and chess ai that is tremendously stupid like martin bot or in today's video martin bot versus oscarbot you see it's currently november 20123 so chess.com and dualingo are doing a little bit of a partnership and so there is a bot on chess.com who's rated 200 and his name is oscar and oscar is an arrogant prick oscar talks trash the entire game despite being rated 200 martin on the other hand is rated 250 loses to absolutely every human and animal probably on the planet but is a very nice and respectful gentleman and today i paired them and all i'm going to tell you is that the game was 158 moves what happens when two of the worst chess bots on the planet play against each other let's find out oh and if you're watching this it's probably november 11th and gotham merch drop just happened i'm wearing one i love this one this one's this one's this one's really cool and you you gota you got you got to get a an order in in the next 48 hours we're closing the store on monday we want to get all the orders in and then we want to make preparations for the holiday season so it can get to you by late november or christmas all right so get those orders in if you like it or if you want to buy it as a present for somebody here we go martin bought ver oscar bot the olympic games of degeneracy martin begins with e3 c5 and i will be keeping you i will keep keep you in the loop of some of the things that oscar says during this game okay so queen h5 very powerful move here by the 250 elo rated martin bot h6 powerful response from from oscar martin now follows that up with the devastating a4 playing on all three sides of the board on the king side on the queen side you know instead of playing for scholars mate now knight c6 has played and you know in this position i was expecting a lot of things from martin i was expecting a king move i was exp yeah i was expecting him to follow up in his earlier plan of like threatening mate knight f3 now content begins on move number four in this game because here martin play he plays queen things [music] why did he play queen takes f7 i was actually very upset that he played that move because he forces oscar to play a good move oscar is an idiot now oscar is going to justify you know his his trash talking the whole time the whole game at this point oscar is saying things like did you know that i have a weekly dinner with some of the best chess players in the world magnus carlson fabiano carana hiar it's not a big deal it's not they programmed oscar to be so insufferable so insufferable i feel bad for every oscar and martin on the planet and now martin just proceeds as if nothing happened you know i was really upset that he played that move cuz i thought well now oscar is just going to play really well you know oscar's taking the center look at that and then i remember these bots are rated 200 so it's going to be a really stupid game like it's it's just going to be stupidity non-stop b3 powerful move very powerful not developing the knight not developing the bishop d6 solid move from oscar getting some development maybe n bishop we got to get all those pieces out bishop be look at look at martin developing a piece that's the martin b i know now a5 i don't know what this move does but as long as he hasn't blundered any like heavy pieces i think i'm probably okay with it now a very very powerful and unexpected idea here from martin bot bishop c3 you see martin just played bishop b2 so he is playing the creepy crawly gambit he's going to try to creepy crawl his way to the queen that's what i that's what i think is going to happen all right now b5 simultaneously losing upon pawn two different ways as oscar while also trash talking he claims at this point that he was asked to host the next world chess championship but he declined he said they came to him to host the world chess championship he said no that that's what oscar said i don't martin's just talking about you know enjoying time with his kids or something he's a father martin bishop d okay bishop b2 bishop c3 bishop yeah i mean i'm not making this up all right i made these bots play against each other all right i sat there and i watched the whole thing it was disgusting so now you are going to sit there and watch the whole thing with me and i'm watching for a second time so it's disgusting but you're going to watch see and i was like what the heck is going on why is oscar playing so well cuz he's also really annoying okay he talks a lot of trash he started saying they're going to build like a monument in in iceland like you know bobby fisher's grave is in iceland they're going to build a monument in iceland now now the 200 kicks in and here oscar plays a very powerful move king to f6 six okay we're not developing anything now if you thought that's where that stopped it wasn't because his next move was h5 and then he played king g5 and by the way if you were paying attention martin literally just played rook a2 rook a1 no reason just rook a2 rook a1 now the people who are watching this for like 1600 you see there's like a age cut off i think where watching this stuff just isn't that interesting anymore i think you get a little older you get serious you're 35 45 55 sometimes i get comments from folks that have very old youtube accounts their youtube accounts are like 16 years old so you know they're like probably like 40 or something and and they they write things like i saw a comment recently it was like what happened to this channel you know you used to provide like you know high instructional content now it's like this garbage i mean this is this is garbage right but one man's trash is another man's treasure and i think a lot of people just like need a break you know i think we need a break chess is a very serious endeavor sometimes you just you just got to watch two gorillas punch each other in the face without paying a ticket for zoo admission because here in new york that costs like $30 $30 to go to the zoo i would rather get a smoothie delivered for $30 another epidemic by the way delivery and all that stuff king g is it the same in other places like europe asia afc like are you guys all like south america you guys all paying i don't know what delivery cost in antartic i would imagine it's a lot bishop takes b5 queen c7 and now martin plays king d1 you see martin here was going for the ancient jutsu of distant opposition when the kings are on certain types of squares you know you can kind of oppose now at this point there is a way to blunder mate in one by the way with black you can play a move where white can mate you in one move it's king h4 i was shocked that that did not happen you just walk into your own death you you can't get out right so king d1 that doesn't happen knight b4 h4 check and now c4 and now a major moment will oscar noas will oscar no or no how do you say no it's no no not no what what am i even saying bishop d7 bishop takes queen takes king e2 i tried to learn french my experience learning french was sitting there going why do they have words that are nine letters long but you only say three of the letters it's like the french created a language that could not be decoded it was like the french made a lang language so they could two of them could sit in a cafe and talk trash about everybody else and nobody would understand them and that's actually not that different than real things in france because in france if you ever go to paris you you'll notice restaurants outside people sit on the same side of the table looking onto the street i've never seen something like this i went to paris look we'll get back to the game it's not that interesting we'll get back they sit on the same side and they look at the street i mean like what that's that's insane i've never seen behavior like that then i went to paris i was like it's kind of fun you sit here you go oh my god his shoes are so ugly you know it it's incredible just the parisians do things maybe it's just the paris thing is it a french thing period any french people in the comments let me know you know why is your language so difficult i mean english is difficult too we have three words that are pronounced the same and spelled differently rook a7 d3 check king d1 and and at this point i was like all right i mean oscar is just going to win this game he he hasn't made a single mistake and the thing is martin is programmed to lose all right martin is like an ai in a movie that's just programmed to explode rook h2 and then something weird started happening oscar played night to a2 and i was like oh oh there's the 200 kicking in oh okay he is going to start losing this game okay now martin did not take come on what what do you think we're dealing with here he didn't take the knight he'll take the knight at some point and now look at this move by oscar sniping the pawn on the opposite side beautiful move queen b8 amazing move martin of course does not see it and now queen takes b3 is devastating for the white position because you have to go here you're going to lose the knight the pawn the pawn and then this in the future and you're going to lose everything but instead of that oscar goes here so he gets into b4 but he doesn't take the pawn on b3 and now having his attention drawn to this side of the board martin plays rook takes knight so he actually wins the night this was a very big moment in martin's career and now we see5 bonus question here how does white blunder checkmate one try to solve it this is like an anti- chest puzzle antichess puzzles are designed to still improve your board vision but prevent blunders white to move blunder checkm in one got to move your f pawn queen g1 i i guess either of these moves right queen g1 so that's the way you avoid blunders because you got to find the worst moves to just have them there in the background now b4 b4 attacks the queen but it hangs the pawn two different ways okay and now in this position rather than taking like this or like this oscar plays queen takes c4 losing the queen in one move like this and then oscar said and i am not joking after hanging his queen oscar said and i quote less pieces on the board might be better for you oscar defended his full blunder of a queen by saying i am removing pieces from the board so that it is easier for you because you are so bad at chess we should all aspire to have this degree of a delusional confidence and now it's game on now white is winning white is winning because material is equal black hasn't developed three pieces white's rook is ready to get into the game and also white has a pass a pawn white has an outside pass pawn while this king is very close to stopping that pawn white could very easily just pick up a few pawns so now martin is completely winning now if you know anything about martin he does not like to be completely winning but here comes knight f7 oh my goodness knight to f7 check king to h7 and martin takes the rook and at this point oscar said that was a beautiful move you must have learned it by watching me play chess and somebody got to punch this dude in the face like i'm not even like you know you know i have a rule okay i don't i don't believe in resorting to violence i've been in a few like little little fight you know in middle school you get a little physical you 11 12 years old you pushing i've never been in a serious conf i'm an adult i like when i'm out on the the street i don't believe in violence as an answer i think most things can be diffused otherwise but i firmly believe some people can improve their character can improve as people by getting punched in the face just one time you've probably met somebody like this just somebody who sucks you know and like one punch to the face would improve all of that you know they like mess with the wrong person boom i'm not condoning this for legal reasons i'm not saying you should you you should not be that person to do the punching or get the but like you know you we've all met somebody like that we've all met somebody like that and oscar is one of those people lot of checks knight b2 martin is now completely winning but now he hangs a knight the way martin should win this game is activate the rook right his rook is just stuck so he's got to take a pawn take a pawn he probably get down there with the rook right to the back rank put pressure remove the knight from the defense of the bishop instead he hangs this and then here oscar plays this move and says a generational chess genius like like me sees five better moves than you could have played except he hung a night in one move dude just dude's dude dude said a generational chess genius like myself could have played five better moves and he hung his knight and then he hung his pawn and so now martin is just a full rook up very easy to win this game take take rook behind the pawn rook behind the pawn always push the pawn that will force black's rook to be very passive while black's rook is stuck being very passive you can start being very massive so you will take for force the rook out push the pawn as far as possible get the rook out from the corner and win just don't stal mate all right instead of that martin loses the rook in one move because he's martin okay he's used to playing with with with his own kids you got to give kids a chance to win king takes h8 and when i thought it couldn't get any worse i mean poor martin broke my heart he he played the dumbest i mean this move you know some of these bots make blunders but some of these like what is that why did he do that why did he do you can't let these arrogant schmucks like oscar win man you can't but you know what i was like martin's gonna get stalemated that's that's what he's going for he's going for content martin martin knows he he gets it all right and and and martin's just moving his king and he oh he's he's got three pawns in a kn left and and and and oscar to my shock took the knight and i mean that's just just make the queen here or move the king okay or just make the queen d2 no oh oh now at this point oscar played king g8 and i swear to go oscar said i just texted my friend hikaru nakamura about that move and he said he likes it okay let me explain something right now you cannot text your friends especially if they're 2800 to ask them about moves you play you can't do that that's cheating oscar is cheating oscar's cheating they should just ban him he's cheating can't text hikaro and go hey hikaro what do you think about this position now also it does not take a rocket i'm not trying to take away anything from hik caro's intelligence or capability as a chess player a 400 could tell you who's winning this position and a 400 is double oscars rating so just before you get it twisted a5 now i was still holding out hope remember these are 200s and these are the two worst bots in history so i'm still hold holding out hope i i think martin's going to sneak that pawn through and so i was holding my breath oh he got that pawn oh he got both pawns he got both pawns oscar completely hung both pawns oh here we go come back season come back se come on man martin you breaking my heart dude come on martin oh get back there get back and oscar's not pushing his pawn you see oscar's not pushing the pawn now we have a king dance we have a king dance no progress getting made oh he's sneaking the pawn through rook h8 push the pawn push push the pawn or go for the pawns this is not over push the pawn rook f8 oh he's going for the pawn a he's not going for the pawn go for the pawn oh he's going for the pawn yes he's going to stop the no no no oh oh god he was so close oh my god my friends the square the concept of the square this dude is like in he could just go smooch the pawn on the cheek oh my god he went the wrong way dude went the wrong way and now it's over now you're not going to oh my god you can't you can't even push the pawn through oh you can't even push the pawn through martin says maybe if i make a rook instead of a queen he's not going to pay attention he's right now i kind of wish that it was a queen because you never know what would have happened and now martin says boink takes the rook takes the rook away but unfortunately oscar does this and so now the major question for me was will martin's pawn become a queen in order for that to happen martin would have to get his king forced in here moved promoted and then he might still win and that's the most beautiful part you have no idea what's about to happen cuz these are the two stupidest bots on this website they are capable of doing anything all right meanwhile after losing his piece oscar goes one last piece for me means the checkmate is going to be that much sweeter when it comes later look at this he doesn't have any technique he doesn't have any technique but he's sealing off the g he's not taking the pawn that was the most interesting thing to me is he wasn't taking the pawn which means there is still hope for a comeback queen b oh god oh but he's going the wrong way you see he should run he paralyzed martin's king but instead he's giving checks you don't need to give checks to win a king and queen end game king g8 king c3 king's running king's running oh king's running ah thwarted thwarted he almost got there that was that was his one major comeback now he has to go back now his king is getting booted around now we've crossed 100 moves we've crossed 100 moves but no progress is getting made is he going to find a way to win this game or not queen e3 oh my god he's not winning the pawn he's not taking the pawn king is dancing king g1 only move he's not going to take the all right oscar is going to win king yep all right seal the deal that's it well martin can't win the game he no longer has a pawn but what stale made is going to occur queen g4 we going to get a three move repetition you know how many times these boos threaten us with three move repetition queen c2 king e1 120 g4 where is it oh he's stuck in the corner ah let him out king g1 king f1 king g1 again king a it's got to be three move repetition they they're shuffling the pieces back and forth oscar doesn't know how to win a king and queen and a pawn end game oh my he's trying to lose the dude's trying to lose the pawn martin says no 130 moves the queen goes back to the corner queen to a3 check and now oscar plays his best move of the game which is not saying a whole lot cuz he has a pawn king and queen he plays here and the reason this is the best move of the game is that that martin's only legal move is to take the pawn and now oscar has to demonstrate king and queen technique and is he going to be able to do it king h4 they're they got they got to be shuffling the pieces queen f8 okay the king's running king of six 145 moves this is going to end one in two ways one of the most embarrassing stalemates of all time or the most arrogant scumbag bot on this website with the lowest elo might may i add nobody is lower than this man nobody he's 200 250 is martin thus we're going to give this arrogant degenerate bot a victory over our beloved martin queen to b8 king to e7 king d7 queen here king d8 those moves are stalemate they're stalemate there's only one legal move in and out king h6 king e7 i thought the queen was going to move the king moves again are they going to repeat they're going to repeat the king moves oh king h7 king e7 only legal move 150 moves have been played on the board the king gets closer again king d8 if the king gets in it's a draw if the king repeats the position it's a draw the king goes back to the corner the king once again escapes the only legal move king g that's got to be a draw how many times has the king been on g8 one but never again it was here here here and here it's slowly going around oscar is definitely going to screw this up king d8 now the queen get slides down but the king is coming king e8 this is stalemate this is a stalemate right now the king goes up king d8 if the king goes to f8 or f7 it is a draw king f6 the only move king f6 and now in this position oscar finally finally checkmated martin i was devastated 158 moves queen to c7 i was hoping to walk the king over here in stalemate momentarily but there is no way to stal mate in this position queen c8 along with queen d7 are checkmates in one i am willing to put on a best of 10 match martin versus oscar would you like to see martin get his revenge the score is one to nothing oscar let me know in the comments check out the merch you got two more days to order you have until monday that's all get out of here
