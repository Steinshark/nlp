ladies and gentlemen welcome to a special episode of coffeezilla where we'll be roasting the worst startups of all time and we'll be answering the age-old question does everything need to be redesigned from the ground up should we ever stop and think not can we build this but should we build this has silicon valley just gone too far gonna answer all those questions in this video but before we do this video is actually a partnership with our friends at mischief you guys may remember the name i featured them on an episode of marketing mondays anyways long story short i guess being a sick fan can get you somewhere in life mom because the mischief team actually called me the other day and told me they wanted me to review one of their drops i said i'm in i'm so excited and how much am i getting paid they said nothing okay slightly less excited but you know what i freaking love this company what they do so i'm in a day later they sent me this their never before newest drop okay relax it's just a box right to give some context if you know how mischief works they call themselves an art collective which is like a fancy way of saying they're a company that's bad at making money which technically makes me an art collective too and mischief's whole thing is that they do a new drop every two weeks never the same drop and they can be about anything and this is their 50th drop which they call dead startup toys and it looks like from their website that it's basically an homage to all the like the iconic startups you can see these terrible products are in heaven now i already recognize a few a few of them and yeah basically they took the products themselves and made miniaturized versions of them to remember them by because let's all be honest a failure as big as theranos will never be truly forgotten and in conjunction with this launch they wanted someone to roast these startups and they picked me so let's let's open this guy up let's start baby with the juicero maybe we should just check out their marketing real quick and remind people what the juicero even was making juice is easy start by taking a stroll down to the neighborhood farmers market buy about 50 worth of organic fruits and vegetables don't forget to bring a tote bag dig your juicer out from the back of your cupboard realize there's still a part missing okay i think i know what they're getting at here making juice is annoying so okay you've told us the problem now show us what the solution is what is this it's a juicero i don't i'm sorry i don't know what that word means it's a new cereal okay define it for me juicero the best juice ever what comes out of the juicero is so fresh that it shouldn't even be called juice it should just be called i don't know squashed produce because that's what it is you know what we call liquid from squashed produce it's juice [music] our founder doug is straight up made of juice literally there's juice in my veins there's juice in my veins i would have known this thing was a fraud from the start anyone who goes literally there's juice in my veins that person cannot be trusted promise you that the juicero team have taken care of everything not just the washing the peeling and the chopping but the growing the harvesting the washing the refrigerated transport inspecting did we mention the washing packaging and finally delivering to your house okay so actually here's the thing you watch this commercial even now knowing the the ending of juicera and you're like damn this looks this looks nice so what's the issue right what was their problem well basically they over engineered themselves to the max they have these like smart packets which you can see on screen right now with like chopped veggie products in them that you supposedly needed this fancy 400 like machine from the future in order to squeeze this thing right here you put your little sustenance package in there and it just squeezed it for you but the problem is you didn't actually need it it turns out you could take these little packets yourself and squeeze out just as much juice into a cup as the machine could like look at this is the hand squeezed one and this is the the machine squeezed one basically yeah you 400 bucks to get a drop more of juice in your cup and honestly at this point i mean i'm looking at this and it's like oh this is just pre-juiced juice with an extra step like if you're just gonna squeeze juice from a bag into a cup why not just buy you know like this it doesn't make any sense anyway so that's jucero guys and here's the little miniature version they sent me it even opens up to reveal the legendary juice packet guys that you definitely should not be squeezing guys wow up next we have the coolest cooler let's take a look at the ad that got them 13 million dollars on kickstarter that's the sound of a cooler coming down off the shelf it's the sound of imminent fun so why haven't cooler designs changed in almost 50 years foreign coolers are boring break easily and are a pain to get to and from your destination okay so already i already know what the problem with this device is gonna be it's the biggest problem with silicon valley in general you're always trying to reinvent everything like the classic silicon valley person their big idea comes when they're sitting at their desk and they have a pin and they go the pin hasn't changed in 300 years i'm gonna i'm gonna install wi-fi in it and change the world like no we don't need that and we also don't need a cooler redesign here guys but this young founder doesn't look like he's about to take no for an answer i wanted a cooler that was really well built yet had so much fun built into it that i would look for excuses to get outside and enjoy so i created the coolest [music] the coolest is a complete redesign of what a cooler can be first you've got this' volt rechargeable blender you don't realize the number of places you could really go for a blended cocktail or smoothie until you've got a blender built right into the lid all right i'm not gonna lie that's that's cool they also said they had a removable bluetooth speaker coolest comes with a removable bluetooth speaker that connects to any smartphone to wirelessly stream music from up to 30 feet away they also said it's got a usb charger in it okay this is where it's starting to get really weird you're trying to design a swiss army knife cooler it's like installing hdmi ports into your tire it doesn't make any sense it's like it's like you can do it it doesn't mean you should do it right and that's this whole product it's just way over engineered for a basic cooler it's got led lighting it's got tie-down bungees it's got reusable plates it's got a knife it's got a removable divider all told this thing probably assembles like a lego set with a thousand different pieces you have to assemble together and it turns out well it was a little harder to manufacture than they originally thought and these kickstart backers ended up waiting years before they got their product with a bunch of them never getting it at all basically looks like this guy just got 13 million dollars for nothing actually i shouldn't say nothing they actually got investigated by the organ department of justice so that's something to put a little feather to put in your cap there so yeah i'd say that is well deserving of the award here of one of the top worst startups of all time or kickstarters in this case oh look at this thing this little comes with wheels and everything all right this is nice and more functional than the actual thing anyways that's it for the coolest cooler i suppose up next we have gebo the assistant that is not amazon or google and is probably going to fail immediately cause of death price and non-functionality let's take a look at their marketing this is your house this is your car this is your toothbrush these are your things but these are the things that matter and somewhere in between is this guy introducing gebo right off the top i hate the listicle where you're telling me what's in my life this is your house this is your car these are the things that matter your family here's a 900 product that doesn't matter a robot that nobody asked for to spy on you all the time yo if i wanted somebody spying on me in my living room i'd just ask alexa i mean why do i need this please explain it to me go the world's first family robot say hi jibo hi jibo when was this made oh it's 2015. yeah this is like in the the tech optimism world back when we thought robots were gonna help us instead of displace us you remember those days good times now it seems like they're gonna definitely be bringing on the apocalypse jibo helps everyone out throughout their day he's the world's best cameraman by intelligently tracking the action around him he can independently take video and photos so that you can put down your camera and be a part of the scene take the picture bruh best camera man this photo's overexposed to hell i don't know what you're talking about he's a hands-free helper you can talk to him and he'll talk to you back see grandma's carrying him around everywhere he goes and what is he what is he like spying on what her recipe here you don't have to skip a beat excuse me and yes jeebo melissa just sent a reminder that she's picking you up in half an hour to go grocery shopping excuse me and i can't let you do that i can't let you leave this house for your safety the i guess this is a robot that's going for that like almost humanistic natural feel which i don't know about you i don't like i don't like this like robots are your friend thing they're not your friend okay but anyways who cares about this marketing what's the point well it promised to be able to like do all these things and it got there and was basically dead on arrival i mean the functionality was extremely limited it was 900 compared to amazon sweatshop which can crank out alexa for like a dollar and just in general it was just out competed in every single conceivable way and again even with this image i'm just like pissed off like what are you setting jibo down at your dinner table you're gonna hang out with jibo all the time i don't get it i don't like it a bad idea this is the same kind of thinking that got us here where we're mass producing sophie the strange uncanny valley robot to solve human loneliness but anyways here's our lovely gebo toy here oh that's kind of cute right look at that does this thing work like is it voice activated hey gebo order me an amazon echo on amazon.com about as useful this toy as the actual gebo and considerably cheaper up next we have the theranose minilab ladies and gentlemen long awaited i knew this would make it this is a this is an all-time great it was supposed to revolutionize the industry of you know taking vials of blood instead of taking whole vials you're supposed to just get a drop and magically this little black box device was going to tell you everything about your family history and you know your vitals anyway let's take a look at their marketing they put together for us people don't even know that they have a basic human right to be able to get access to information about themselves and their own bodies that can change their lives i want information about your body gosh that voice is so creepy i want information about your body it may change your life what that dude every person should have the ability to get that type of test because if you understand that early that you're at risk there's a lot more that you can do about it i really hate to do this it's such low-hanging fruit she's creepy though like so oh we make fun of zuckerberg for seeming like a robot but this thera-nosed lady looks like a body snatcher even despite her running one of the biggest frauds of all time because there knows it didn't work like spoiler that thing sucked it didn't work and they actually took vials of blood from you they told you that they were only going to use a drop and they used the vials as backup but they actually ran the test by just using like regular blood testing their whole thing was a fraud but it has been so overshadowed not just by me but in the press everybody by elizabeth holmes herself which is quite the feat to overshadow a billion dollar fraud with how weird you are you know you know hey i ran one of the biggest frauds of all time but the headline is like chick changes her voice for absolutely no reason and a bunch of other weird stuff about her like personal life like apparently she just lied to everyone about everything she got a siberian husky puppy and told everyone that it was a wolf and took it into the boardroom where the dog just constantly peed on everything and she told everyone oh no it's a wolf and people like that looks like a husky anyway the point is pathological liar weirdo apparently she bullied people and just created a mythos for herself that is even bigger than the fraud she perpetuated which i mean hats off to you for that that is a that is hard to do so yeah guys that's the that's the short and long of it about theranos i feel like you guys have already watched 20 documentaries about this you don't need for me to explain to you what was a fraud about it okay here we go here we got the toy okay it's a toy you you get the gimmick guys right you get you get the thing it's a it's a little collectible now for our next and final startup we're gonna roast here today we have the one laptop per child laptop thing apparently they had 60 million dollars in funding and have since gone the way of the mini lab now this idea i actually think much like the juicero is not a bad idea on paper it was billed as a 100 laptop that was going to save the world how you know by giving hungry children internet how is it going to do that well because there's no electricity in a lot of these places well these geniuses they they thought of everything and they designed a hand crank that these kids who are bubbling with free excess energy can crank to turn on and power their reddit accounts what's hilarious about this product is that when they actually unveiled it it was sort of like a cyber truck moment because these hand cranks broke immediately [laughter] he's whining and then oh he broke he tore it off turns out when you're gonna build something for a hundred dollars the materials have to be pretty cheap so they kind of scrap that idea and go okay no we're gonna redesign it from the ground up these kids these kids are gonna charge that with the power of their mind i guess and so they redesign it into this form factor where the antennas are like wi-fi etc the only problem is is they originally had built it at costing a hundred dollars and everyone got stuck on that price point turns out it's kind of hard to build up anything tech wise for a hundred dollars so they failed and the re-pitch is like this is the 150 laptop yeah that didn't go so well and people quickly out-competed them with like new netbooks and chromebooks and all that kind of stuff which actually had windows on them as opposed to you know they had some weird operating system here so yeah a very like tech optimist kind of idea we're gonna give all the kids internet you know we're gonna give all the kids laptops that was met with the actual price of goods and also was crushed by expectations that they themselves set and that was actually i think that's a recurring theme in this whole whole thing right all these things they set up expectations that simply couldn't be met and or they over-engineered over-promised and ultimately under-delivered but yeah okay let's unveil the last one oh it's kind of a larger one that's cool oh dang that's actually a lot of detail huh look at that like flips out and everything ah nice all right that basically does it big thanks to mischief for partnering with this video and now i'd like to actually review maybe not the startups themselves but actually the things they sent me which are these toys so who are these actually for because they cost money it's like 40 bucks for a single toy and the collector's bundle is a hundred and wow sixty dollars so kind of it's pretty pricey and i would say that like these are not for everybody i think there's a very specific target audience number one for collectors who like limited time edition things they only make 550 of them ever and if you also love watching the hubris of mankind burn itself out you'll probably like this but the other people the other target audience and this i'm actually going to tell the mischief i mean honestly i think the real target audience to buying these things is actually venture capitalist straight up like i don't know if that's who mischief is imagining as their target audience and they told me that it gave me no strings about like what i could say so i'm just gonna review this honestly like i don't think most people need this but if i were a founder or i had a company out there and we're like we're trying to innovate i would buy every single one of these toys buy them all up and give them to every new founder or member of y combinator you know because that's who these neat lessons need to go to it's not your average person you know working in the back of jimmy john's like you're the backbone of this economy you didn't ask for this right like you don't need this in your life the people who need this are the people who are trying trying to install voice assistance into everything into a pizza box into a coffee cup right they're trying to reinvent the wheel they're thinking they're steve jobs while they burn through billion dollars in capital they need these little toys on their shelf to remind them of how far too far is right like for those people 40 or 160 that's a bargain right you're gonna save money with this thing you know like hey you know i was gonna try to install geotagging inside of a paper straw but then i saw theranose and i was reminded you know by this little desk toy that humanity probably doesn't need that right like boom billion dollars at venture capital saved from the hellfire of dead startups but that's basically it that's who i would say collectors and venture capitalists anyways if you're one of those two people or you just want one of these things links are descriptive whatever you know this thing i just thought it was a fun idea with these bishop guys and i'm a huge fan of their style which is why i did it yeah i hope you guys had fun watching this video thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next one wake up smell the coffee
