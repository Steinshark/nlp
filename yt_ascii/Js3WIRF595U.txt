[music] hey what is up guys mkbhd here fresh new graphics and welcome to 2018 and we have a lot of plans for this year as i'm sure you can imagine and notice i keep saying we because this actually gradually started to turn more into a bit of a team effort at this point as you know it used to just be me my camera maybe my computer and not a whole lot but as you start to get more hands you realize the benefits of being able to do more things so you know third person shots moving shots all kinds of fun angles basically capturing things and experiences that i ordinarily couldn't if i was the one already focusing on the camera work so this changes things a bit makes it a little bit more dynamic but in a good way so yeah bottom line we're going to be expanding on that again for this year and i think you'll notice the difference it makes to the videos and it'll help us make bigger and better things and also more often in fact in 2017 i didn't tell you guys this but one of the goals i had was to make 100 videos to get a hundred projects fully complete we ended up at 95 so like i got pretty close but i think this year in 2018 there's no doubt we'll have a hundred videos for you in 2017 we also made the casey neistat studio tour as episode one of a new series and then we were planning out episode number two and we're getting all hyped up and we hung out with dead mouse in his newly built studio and then linus made his video which was basically the same as we were so we're that's cool we're back to working on that we got the dope tech series going that is a fun one that's going to continue of course and we also shot some car videos that will never see the light of day in their completion took a couple days on them did a lot of shooting and learned a lot but then later we did make a car video that did see the light of day the tesla project love day video which also happened to win the contest and now let's just say there will definitely be some car videos in 2018 that do see the light of day that's a guarantee we got a pretty good playlist name for it too something else we dabbled with in 2017 was the whole idea of custom merch you know a limited edition design here and there and that's fun but i think in 2018 that beast will be entirely different i don't want to give away too much but i think you get the idea so in 2017 the channel passed 5 million subscribers which is incredible and also rolled past 800 million total video views and of the 95 videos uploaded in 2017 they were watched about 266 million times in total which multiplies out to 1.1 billion total minutes of watch time geez that's a lot of time but look in 2018 what we really have to look forward to is all this new tech that's coming out the new mac pro allegedly apple's coming out with that this year i've gotten non-stop questions about the red hydrogen one that's a big one and there's going to be mysteries of course too maybe an 8k tv or beyond electric cars foldable phones there's going to be surprises but i'm going to do my best to show it all to you literally my favorite thing to do is talk about tech and experience it and use it and i don't thank you guys enough for this but i am super fortunate to be in a position where i can not only experience some bleeding edge tech and amazing stuff all the time but then i can also turn around and share it with you guys i literally one of my favorite moments of last year was when i interviewed at the end of my google i o video i interviewed sundar pachai the ceo of google and that was fun obviously kind of an on-the-spot thing but that wasn't even my idea that was google's idea that they came to me with so the fact that companies at this point are reaching out shows that there's a lot of doors open and i just have to step through them to try to share that experience with you guys a lot of it's going to feel outside of my comfort zone and i know that and that's sort of like a general new year's resolution to do that as well but that's what makes us better either way bottom line welcome to 2018 i hope every video i upload this year is better than every video from last year and from all the previous years and i think that's definitely possible but other than that thanks for watching talk to you guys the next one peace [music]
