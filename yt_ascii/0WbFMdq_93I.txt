okay so i'm up here in the canadian arctic on a shoot and i'm going to let you in on a little secret i love those what's in my bag videos even when i totally disagree with what the person is packing or when it's so different than what i take i'm yelling at my computer oddar i'll still watch to the end and start looking for more videos like it if that's you too you're going to like this video because today i'm going to go through my main shooting bag for a 3mon shoot in the arctic circle and show you what i'm bringing with me on a daily basis for professional production and since we're in such a remote location this is going to be the wilderness edition of what's in my bag so if you're the kind of filmmaker who likes to get out of the city and get your gear dirty this one is for you now i'm just going to get off this beach find a place where i can get the bag out and show you what's inside all right so i got off the beach and i found a little tucked away spot out of the wind where i can actually open this stuff up and show you what i'm dealing with just for a little bit of context here i'm currently working as one of the lead dps on a popular survival tv show which i can't sl won't name for legal reasons so if you're wondering why all my videos have been a bit rough around the edges for the last month or so now you know and if you have been watching and you've been asking yourself doesn't this guy ever changes clothes the answer is not as much as you might think that's disgusting i'm deep in the arctic circle here and this is actually the furthest north i've ever worked and the tree line ends not all that far from here and then it's just tundra all the way to the north pole so on a personal level this has been a really cool shooting location but it's also the perfect opportunity to show you what i'm carrying on a daily basis as a remote environment doc cinematographer when it comes to working in places like this you really have to learn how to make compromises because as much as you might like to bring a full set of i don't know cinema primes and a massive stack of filters you also need to be able to carry this stuff on your back on a normal day here i'm getting in and out of boats multiple times a day loading my gear into helicopters and hiking long distances without a big team of assistant to carry my gear for me this isn't anything like a set where an ac is going to run in and take the camera off my shoulder the second the director yells cut i'm hauling this stuff all day every day and so you have to learn not to be too precious and focus on functionality over everything else okay so let's just dive right into it and i'll show you what i'm working with first up obviously here is the bag and if you've been following this channel for any length of time you'll probably know that i mainly work with f-stop bags they're built more like hiking packs than camera bags they're really welld designed they're insanely tough and i happen to think that they look good too the pack you work with as a filmmaker always matters but a place like this it matters even more in my opinion you're going to want a pack that has a higher weather resistance like it can get wet and dirty while keeping your gear safe and it has to be well balanced enough that you can carry heavy loads for long periods without wanting to die that means thick straps and a really good waist belt to take the weight off your back and shoulders f-stop happens to be great at all these things and that's why i use their bags pretty much exclusively these days this is not a sponsored video by the way there are other brands that people seem to really like out there that fit into this same niche as well though but just whatever you do don't come out to a place like this with one of those space age looking urban sling bags or something because it's going to ruin your life okay so let's just start going through the pockets one at a time and then we'll dive into the pack itself so this very front pocket here i carry a porta brace rain cover in an environment like this the rain and the moisture is your biggest enemy so carrying one of these things that fits the camera perfectly which in this case is a super old fs7 this isn't my camera i'm working with most the production company stuff on this but this one is designed exactly to fit on top of this camera so it's still a giant pain to use i'll be honest but it does keep the camera pretty dry and it's about as good as it gets when it comes to all- weather protection for cinema camera next up what else is in here this is just a down jacket a small packable one in case it gets super cold and you get caught out you always want to be able to keep yourself warm if you start going hypothermic even you're not much good to the production so always keep an extra layer this one's really warm and we're in the arctic after all on this outside pocket here i have first and foremost a radio super important to stay safe in remote environments there's grizzly bears there's wolves there's all sorts of stuff out here so this is how i stay in touch with the safety team and even when i'm out shooting youtube videos like this and i'm away from the main camp i can always be in communication with the people that can come and save me if something goes wrong also in here some gloves i have pretty bad cc culation but in general shooting in the outdoors you want to keep your hands working cuz as soon as you start to lose dexterity everything gets difficult and there's nothing worse than shooting a standing interview for example and it's really cold out and your hands are just going numb and you can feel the blood rushing out and it's just so painful but you can't move it's torturous so good gloves are great on this side what's in here water bottle nothing fancy drink tons of water and in this top pocket a headlamp really useful outdoors an anchor battery i can charge cameras off of this and i also have some extremely industrial mosquito and bug repellent this stuff is like 100% deep you never want to put this on your body but when the bugs get really bad i'll spray it on my hat and that keeps bugs out of my face when i'm shooting so nice to have just don't get it on your skin cuz i'm pretty sure this stuff is what napal is made out of okay what else i love packs that open from the back or or this part here whatever whatever you want to call that just means that you can put the weather resistant side facing down put the bag down on the tough side in the mud or the dirt or whatever and then it opens from here definitely lots of other bags do this but ftop just does it really well so i like them also on the outside i have this little headphone pouch headphones are so important to have especially in environments like this because if you realize iiz too late that the audio is messed up your whole story is in big trouble so always carry headphones always check don't rely on the levels always be monitoring so i tend to forget them all the time so by having them attached to the bag like this i always have them when i need them moving to the inside of the bag we have a tool pouch really handy outdoors there's a rocket blower there's a leatherman in here really really handy everyone should have one allen keys there is lens tissue some screwdriver attachments for the multi-tool some bongo ties oh also down in here i have a broken off paintbrush this is really good the blower can get fine dust and stuff off but when there's dirt that really works its way into the cracks of your gear this is handy for getting it out at the end of the day okay let's move on to the lenses i am notorious for bringing tons and tons of stuff many camera assistants who've worked with me in the past can attest to the fact that that i will haul in massive backpacks worth of stuff sometimes to the point of overkill but in a place like this where you are going to have to make some sacrifices over what you bring you have to prioritize flexibility and versatility over the absolute best and image quality at least for this specific show some other shoots are different you know but as much as i would like to be working with my you know fuji cine zooms and a full set of primes we just can't carry that kind of glass by the way i'm not even allowed to use my own camera so it's whatever the production company will give me which is an fs7 mark1 super old camera which you can actually buy for like 1,200 bucks on ebay right now i just checked and they're shooting one of the most popular shows in the world i'm not going to tell you what show it is extremely popular show on all the big distributors and they're shooting them on fs7 mark 1es that you can get for 1,200 bucks so don't be afraid to buy used cameras we're also using a metabones to adapt canon glass so nothing fancy here this is a 24105 if this was my own shoot i'd use my' to 55 to cover allpurpose verite scenes shape handle on the side sennheiser shotgun mic but none of this is my gear the only thing on this rig that's mine is this rock climbing harness that i use as a strap so that's the camera so that means i'm using e-mount lenses or adapted canon lenses so the 24105 is my all-purpose lens and then i also have this monster this is my lens this is a sigma 6 to 600 this is a beast it's super heavy but it covers any reasonable amount of zoom and then some because this is a super 35 camera with the crop sensor this is actually even more of a zoom than that so any normal coverage it's a 24 to 105 but if i need to do anything from a sort of landscape to wildlife shots from super far away this lens will cover me for all of it it's not you know the best optical lens ever the focus is not perfect you know this is not a high-end cinema lens but it is extremely handy in a place like this it takes the job of you know three other lenses that i don't need to bring now so when working in a spot like this you just have to make those kind of choices and then also on top of that i am carrying a 100 mm macro lens on this show in particular you know we really want to personalize or visualize the landscape so one of the ways you can get a really different perspective on natural environments is to get super close and macro lenses are amazing at that so that's it those are the three lenses i'm carrying and they cover me for everything i need again not the crazy best but out here it is a pretty powerful combo and i can cover anything also in here filters the fs7 does have built-in filters but because the native iso is 2000 and it's not dual native iso in the middle of the day day sometimes you don't have enough nd so i also carry additional nd which i also use for the fx3 right now i'm using nii true color yeah nissi true color filters they're super cool they screw on they it's really easy to add more andd on top of this this is a a 2 to five stop that covers me for most situations but i can also put on a 5 to n stop on top of it as well just with magnets i use this one mostly because i don't see any color shifting in it but the real reason is just this simple little knob at the bottom when you're in a wilderness environment and i'm wearing gloves all the time and in a month from now i'm not even going to be able to leave the building we're staying in without wearing crazy huge mittens it's going to be so cold so just this simple little knob on the end of the filter completely changes the game makes them so much more versatile and so much more pleasant to use i don't know why more more companies don't do this but nii great job on on that can recommend them just because of that probably cost like 10 cents to put that on there extra battery it's the fs7 we're not mounting it with vmount so it's just the standard sony bpu they run for like 3 hours on these cameras they're incredible in here we move into audio so i've got set of lavs super important to have audio on your characters a sanken cosos 11d if you've never heard of these things this is the one biggest quality of life or i should say quality of sound improvements you can make to your mics rather than go out and buy new mics just replace the stock mic or the stock you know lab cable that comes with whatever you own with one of these and you're going to notice an immediate difference in your sound quality so you know if you own sort of more budget oriented microphones already or or lav packs don't replace them for something more expensive try getting this first it's amazing they're really small they're really easy to hide and i try not to mic anybody without using one of these also a little bit more audio stuff here i have a tentacle time code box this is a multicam shoot so sometimes we want to run time code i have some medical tape for attaching the lav mics to people i've got a tentacle track e which is an internally recording lav mic as well so this camera only has two xlr ports which means shotgun and lav take up all the audio ports so if i ever get into a situation where a second person needs a mic or even a third or fourth throw one of these on them and it can record everything internally and they can sync it later in post also got an extra sanken mic in here for the tentacle and a pack of r coat over covers these things are great they're basically little wind jammers tiny little adorable wind jammers and you use double-sided sticky pads you sandwich the mic cable between them them stick them under a person's clothing and then you have a sort of windproof microphone attachment point really handy if you've never used these things they make miking people much much faster and that's pretty much all i have in here the last thing in the bag is right at the top and that's a drone i know sometimes on this channel i'm harsh on drones cu i think they're overused a lot but they are incredibly handy storytelling tools and especially when you're out here where at ground level it just looks like like i'm in a scrubby piece of tundra but when you get up high you can see that there's actually you know hundreds and hundreds of likes around me and it's pretty amazing looking so really handy to get a different perspective in an outdoor environment i am using the dji air 2s couple reasons why i still have this one one it's still working so i don't see the need to replace it it still looks pretty good to me two it's tiny so it just fits in the top of the backpack and i never have to worry about carrying it or i never question carrying it it just goes in the bag and i can bring it with four batteries and it doesn't add that much extra weight and then lastly the reason i still like this drone is because now it's 3 years old maybe more i've been using it and i've gotten a ton of value out of it and i'm not that scared of crashing it anymore which means i take more chances with it and i'm less stressed when it's up in bad weather or something like that i am kind of tempted by the mavic 3 pro it looks really great actually the other dp on this show has one and i'm jealous every time i see him using it and just the incredible images that it's producing so i might upgrade to that but right now this one's great and i would probably still keep it as a sort of risk-taking drone so yeah don't ride off older stuff don't always upgrade to the newest and best cuz this is a huge show and i'm still using a pretty old drone for it so there we go that's pretty much the bag it's everything that i'm packing on a daily basis for working in the arctic circle so obviously this stuff changes all the time and that's why i always say as a dp or a filmmaker it's great to familiarize yourself with a lot of different gear because on some of these big shoots you're not going to be able to use your own stuff you just got to be able to pick up and use whatever they give you so even if it's not maybe what i would have chosen i'm still going with it and that's your job as a filmmaker or cinematographer i also you know might not bring such an extreme telephoto lens if i wasn't shooting so many animals or i wasn't looking for wildlife so it's job to job i'll switch this out i even have a much bigger version of this the shin 80 l pack i think it is that i'll bring if i need to haul around some serious gear but that tends to get so heavy that it's not practical for carrying all day but in general that's a pretty good idea of what i'm carrying with me for a normal shoot day up here in the far north of canada hope you like that one as much as i like watching other people's bag videos and now i'm going to head in because the sun is down and i'm getting pretty chilly see [music] you [music]
