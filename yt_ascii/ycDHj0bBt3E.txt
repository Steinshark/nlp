melania trump dropped an nft collection promised to save the kids and people are pissed and also very happy let's talk about it ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million studio i'm your host coffee zilla and wow i could not have predicted this i yes i did expect influencers to get involved yes i did expect actors to get involved but the former first lady what are we doing here she just dropped an nft collection melania trump i mean if you didn't believe nfts were mainstream before it now should be pretty obvious i mean look we're one step away from the trump coin i mean quite honestly the biden bucks we're we are very close to campaign fundraising that is just purely coins and ponzi schemes right that is we are very close to that and i just thought i would salute salute the grifters out there you guys are taking it to the next level right before christmas you know i made my scam rewind and people said i made it too soon because there's so much of the year left i said you guys are crazy but look at look at us now you know i couldn't have seen this coming now before we get into specifics here i feel it's important to remind everybody i don't hate nfts i hate the marketers and grifters doing the cash craps in the same way i don't hate your politicians of choice i don't care right it's the scams right and left to right the thing they both agree on is they love making money off of their tribal base who thinks that the left is bad or the right's bad or whatever because they know they're untouchable they're they're untouchable with their fan base and we're going to get to that in a second because this nft grift is just it's historic it's legendary and let's talk about it melania trump dropping an nft art thing okay limited time edition guys that's what that's what edition it is what edition limited time so here's the art piece right here it comes with a little audio recording we're gonna listen to that real quick put the cans on and from the press release they said that this is melania trump giving us all hope okay you can buy hope a message of hope from melania for'1 dollars in solana my vision is here we go look forward with inspiration strength and courage and that's it actually that's that's all you get'1 dollars that's that's what you get now i think it's important to read the actual press statement here because this thing's amazing excited for this new venture which combines my passion for art guys she's passionate and commitment to helping our net nation's children fulfill their own unique american dream guys melania is not fulfilling her american dream of keeping getting rich no no no this is for the kids we're doing it for the kid it's always about the kids guys you have to understand that and if you're wondering how it's about the kids well read up a portion of the proceeds from the melania trump nft collection will assist children aging out of the foster care system by way of economic empowerment and with expanded access to resources needed to excel in the fields of computer science and technology with a keyword there being a portion of the proceeds guys never has there been a word carrying so much of a sentence that that word portion is really just ah it's carrying this because guys a portion of the proceeds doesn't mean a hundred percent it doesn't mean fifty percent it doesn't mean one percent it means anything so if i raise a million dollars and i give a portion of the proceeds to save save the turtles i could give a penny and technically that would be a true statement a portion of the proceeds is what you say when you haven't decided how much you really want to help those kids out now guys make no mistake though this isn't a scam this isn't a get rich quick scheme this is melania wanting to share art with you she wants to inspire you melania's vision is a breathtaking watercolor art by guy and embodies mrs trump's cobalt blue eyes providing the collector with an amulet to inspire okay i don't know what that is the limited edition piece of digital artwork will be one solana and includes a audio recording from mrs trump with a message of hope now guys i want to point out this limited edition part of this because this is another word that's sort of carrying a lot of weight here by a limited edition they sort of mean unlimited because looking at the blockchain this doesn't seem to have a limited quantity nowhere do they say that a million people couldn't buy this they just mint a new one every time you buy it so is it limited if you it's like you have a print you're just printing it off and they're going it's limited i don't get it maybe just because you can buy it until a certain time i suppose but for nfts where the whole thing is like scarcity scarcity oh there's it's like a one of one it's a one of ten this is weird because just like anyone can buy this thing and a lot of people have guys going into this i thought that people would see this for what it is just another politician suddenly caring about art suddenly caring about nfts right as it's about time to pay the mortgage but as usual i was stunned by the stupidity by the credulity of the followers of these people already 391 people have bought this nft for'2 dollars which if i still know how to do math brought her about seventy one thousand dollars in a few hours which hey nft's baby she cares she cares but yeah no i really thought everyone would see through this and no one's gonna buy this right but you know what i was wrong about i just was in my bubble right i was in my bubble of you know people on twitter or whatever who are sort of dunking on it but there's this whole other contingent of the population that i did not anticipate i'm i messed up and that portion of the population is facebook judging from these comments you would think that she had just won the nobel peace prize you never cease to amaze us thank you for keeping us informed of all the wonderful things you continue to do not only for our children but also for our country thank you melania for your ongoing efforts to assist children in foster care i mean it's another world facebook right and then of course you have this one purchased minutes after launch thank you so guys this actually does look like it's going pretty well just just shockingly because of course man in fact i honestly should have seen this coming nfts are sort of everything that politicians like they like making money they like having to do almost no work and they like rousing up their fan base because you know this is getting the fan base all juiced up on both sides you know because the conservatives are are dunking on the libs by buying this collection and the libs are pissed giving this more fuel to the fire so i expect quite frankly many more political nfts in the future she says she's dropping some nfts in january and i'm sure she will continue but i think most rational people look at this and they go yes easy cash grab off your followers but i don't know if the followers care that's that's the crazy thing either way whether or not you know you think this is a scam i do it's pretty clearly a grip but either way this is a historic moment i mean what's next boys is trump gonna create the next tether i don't know but whatever happens we're gonna cover it we're gonna make fun of it as it deserves to be but that's basically it thanks for watching see ya
