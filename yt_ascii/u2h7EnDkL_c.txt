this really might be the breakout rpg game of 2023 i'm super excited you should check it out now let's get back to the video thanks sponsored gotham alright ding has the white pieces in this game there are three games left in this match if this match is tied 7-7 after 14 rounds of action then we have a tie breaker and wealth that will be kind of insane if we get there ding begins with d4 he's played d4c for the entirety of the match knight f6 knight f3 the last time that ding used this move order and did not play the pawn to c4 he went for a london so naturally after this what pawn to e3 this is wild so you know what's interesting there's a lot of ways to play sidelines but ding has almost not entered c4 in any any lines which is crazy which just really means that chess is in a bad spot because ding has played everything under the sun except main lines the movie 3 is not a bad move by any stretch of the imagination but it is not a serious try for an advantage in fact when i saw this i was bummed because i was like what like what even is that move i mean he's not playing a main line he's not even going for a catalan like the one line that plays all the time now young plays c5 the most principled way to play queen spawn openings is to get the c pawn for assistance right so c5 very natural move but normally nowadays people are playing c3 why because to avoid the main line of the london which is c5 they are playing c3 so after c5 they can take and hang on to their pawn but against e3 c5 you can't take and hang on to your pawn i mean you can't do this they just get the pawn back because you don't have good support this doesn't make a huge amount of sense and then knight bd2 what on earth i don't think this opening has ever occurred in a world championship this is not a traditional serious try to get an advantage it just doesn't make any sense i mean ding is just looking to get nepo totally out of his comfort zone and to have to play chess on his own which all right well he does that takes takes now the fascinating thing about when black takes and white takes is that now you have a karo khan what does that mean well e4 c6 d4 d5 white is missing an e-pawn black is missing a c pawn and imagine the game goes knight f3 knight f6 knight bd2 so essentially it's the same exact position it doesn't make this is not the way white is supposed to play in exchange karo khan right or maybe it is maybe it is the way white is supposed to play an exchange but in the exchange karo khan which is what i just showed you it doesn't make any sense for white to play knight bd2 right away white plays like white plays bishop d3 and c3 and then later the knight moves maybe it goes a3c2 maybe it goes like you keep this open you keep the bishop open well jan then plays not a bishop move not a night move but queen c7 this is some sort of deep strategic prep but i got news for you it gets even more dank what does black like to do in an exchange carl khan pawn structure is to play knight c6 and either play the bishop out here or fiancato you can play g6 bishop g7 i've played both i've also played lines where my knight goes to h6 and comes back to f7 and then you build for i mean i've played i've played it all but it gets a whole lot more dank now you would expect here that since white has not committed the bishop to d3 bishop f5 i mean i would recommend this move to a lot of newbies it's not the best move because according to the computer white can go knight h4 that's probably what ding was gonna do ding knows that most newbies probably don't okay but fine i mean you can probably play bishop g4 right that makes sense and if you don't want to commit your bishop all right fine play 96 first well young here plays a move that i don't think a single human being on the planet understood bishop d7 played after 10 minutes of thought that's not prep what even is this match i cannot even explain moves to you in the world championship on move six how am i supposed to do my job i'm supposed to be kind of the bridge all right between 2800 level chess and 800 level chess and if you're below that bridge like 200 you know you're living under the bridge that's fine all right you've fallen on hard times everybody does at some point in different scales that's okay soon you will be on the bridge not under it so bishop d7 a bit i can't explain this move i don't know what this move does i don't understand this move at all now what's interesting is that ding could actually play knight e5 which is super fascinating he didn't but knight e5 just trying to get the bishop makes a lot of sense and maybe the idea was like knight c6 and then maybe play for e5 or just play for e6 i don't know i already cannot explain the world championship at all and we're on we're on the sixth move of the game anyway ding plays bishop d3 okay and jan plays knight c6 and we all live happily ever after but why didn't he play here i mean bishop d7 literally looks like your mouse lagged on the way here this is what it looks like that happened like it looks like you know you went oh oh damn and then you dropped it on d7 i don't know and i got news for you it gets even weirder because a few moves later he plays bishop g what what why didn't why didn't he just pin here's here's what i think i think pinning too quickly before white has castled might actually backfire this is really interesting i think that if you pin too quickly white can actually get a very very powerful initiative without committing the king i actually think this was really clever from yan because now ain't nobody going g4 not only is nobody going g4 because the king is here i'm gonna trade like this is very easy right now the thing about this move bishop d7 a niche actually explained it anishigiri in his commentary that there are some lines where the queen is on c2 and this is the top computer move but yeah i mean super dank stuff but okay jan you know yon doing it his way and it seems to be going fine rookie one very natural move pawn to e6 we're just kind of in a typical exchange karo khan now now what does white want well white would love to trade the the dark squared bishops white has what we call a queen side majority right so maybe expanding over here taking space e5 and e4 are two very important squares in the exchange karo khan as well if white can establish a dominant position on e5 followed by f4 it always allows you to fight after that and keep expanding something like 95 like thoroughly planting something in your opponent's position to prevent communication it's like any of you watch gervante davis ryan garcia i'm not going to pretend to be a boxing expert i'm like 300 elo at boxing i'm like hit him why isn't he hitting him but it's like when you control the lead hand i was seeing footage that the way jervante fights his control of the lead hand like making sure the jab isn't defective and and this is sort of that this is like extending the lead hand and not allowing you know not allowing easy combinations and communications between the shoulders and arms and everything and the brain now i've been doing a lot of this he's not gonna do it right now because he's not going to lose a queen he plays knight f1 first knight f1 is a multi-purpose move first of all he wanted to give the king a smooch unfortunately the horse doesn't actually see the king the horse only sees these squares king sees the horse though so it's adorable the bishop is now open and the knight could maybe go to e3 g3 and then the move h3 would take away its escape square so the bishop's escape score so it makes a lot of sense bishop d6 and now for the second time in this match disaster strikes well no disaster has struck many times in this match depending on who you are rooting for in this position dingley ren plays the move bishop g5 which is a very very very clear indication of what he wants he wants to damage the pawns right he which is probably why it was better for jan to play bishop e7 right because then after bishop g5 there would be no purpose of capturing and black would simply castle so did jan make an inaccuracy by playing bishop d6 and allowing bishop g5 to take on f6 to damage structure no not only does yan not care about bishop takes f6 pawn takes f6 damaging structure young castles that way for the second time in this match ding threatens to damage his opponent's pawn structure and his opponent uses that to his advantage ding played the move bishop g5 in less than two minutes he played the move bishop f6 in 30 in 30 minutes that is a massive giveaway of information it like in poker i mean poker pros they little tells right tell that your opponent was not ready for this is the fact that he spends 30 minutes convincing himself it's the right thing to do and i got news for you it's not the right thing to do for the second time in this match ding is digging himself into a hole all right bobby was like fabiano corona was like why didn't he just rotate right trading off the bishop who cares about tonight but ding said i gotta win this match right now and the only way to win this match right now is to cause a little bit of chaos i'm gonna damage his structure and open his king and i'm gonna give up the bishop pair and his pawn structure in the end game is bad okay you take away everything this is not a really good structure to have in the end game everything is weak here's the problem after knight to g3 black has a very simple plan here and that simple plan is ponto f5 to build a light squared pawn cage to counteract the bishop not only does white no longer have a dark squared bishop the pawn cage that is about to be built like this look at this black has nearly every pawn on a light square so white doesn't have a dark squared bishop and white essentially doesn't have a light squared bishop either this is not good and i got news for you after that king 2 h8 is coming and you are not going to sit there and pretend like the other person having a bazooka pointed at your king is you're trying to pretend white's king is safer all right a lot of people here would go white king is safer because in this king though there's a giant hole yeah well what happens if one of the kings has a gigantic hole in his house but he uses it to point a rocket launcher at your house whose king is actually safer okay whose king is safer in this position is it the white king with the three pawns and the and the horses and the beautiful front yard who cares if this king has a hole in front of the house when there's going to be a rocket launcher appointed okay so f5 invites all of that ding plays h3 he gets this but this is a really unfortunate competition of bishops all right it's a really unfortunate competition now something interesting here if black rushes this zing is actually a genius because suddenly the bazooka changes hands all right and mate is threatened it's not game over yet but it's an extremely unpleasant position to defend and if you aren't able to defend it you might lose in the end game because you're going to lose all your pawns well that doesn't happen instead of that nippo plays knight e7 knight h5 king h8 and rug g8 is on the way and i think this only spells bad news now what's funny is that this is when i woke up i woke up around this position i scanned the game and then in this position dingley ren he went for it that's it he's going for it it's round number five of a five round fight he's probably down 3-1 or 4-0 he's going for the knockout pereira adesanya one in mma g4 this is unbelievable pawn to g4 same side attacking chess pawn to g4 attacks the integrity of the structure black should not capture because it's not about the pawn it's about that and that and you can bm here sack the bishop for absolutely no reason everybody knows that so what you have to do g4 rook g8 that's it the fist the cuffs are beginning it's like a hockey fight you know they don't really they're not really supposed to fight in hockey so it's way more exciting than watching an actual fight these dudes on skates like throwing off the helmet grabbing each other yeah this thing you know and then no this is super super exciting the kings have been escorted to the back kings have been escorted to the back they can't get any blood on them you know we gotta we gotta respect the monarchs and now black plays knight g6 and now the fun is over unfortunately all good things in a recap have to come to an end like the recap itself in this position ding should have continued transferring pieces to this side he probably didn't like the move bishop h2 because he can't go rook g2 because of knight h4 fork so ding can't play rook g1 because of bishop h2 let's keep in mind jan would take a draw in a heartbeat so ding plays bishop c2 yum plays knight h4 anyway and ding plays queen e3 and yan plays rook g6 he's ready to bring the rook here he's ready to double jan is faster by the way jan did not take the pawn on g4 because again checkmate is just way too big of a threat if you play a five this falls queen f6 and so on so rook g6 now ding played rook g1 because if bishop h2 has played rook g3 sacrificing a rogue to trap the knight which is very interesting but janjos closed it all down jana's playing lights out chess i mean he is honestly just playing sensational chess he has completely sealed the door on the king side ding has nothing and if you look at the advantage it hasn't worked out none of it has worked out all right the whole plan bishop takes f6 on move 15. all of this advancing over here it hasn't worked out and things in bad shape queen e7 simply rotating the queen over rook is coming and at some point black will play f5 untangling white's defenses and it will be app it will literally be game over ding brings his other rook queen to g5 jan has created a completely unstoppable barrier and ding gets desperate and plays c4 and the evaluation falls off a cliff pawn to c4 pawn takes c4 and if ding just plays queen c4 trying to trade he just gives up a fork so that was not his idea c4 dc4 sacrifices a pawn to open up a hope and a prayer on the black king john just plays b5 it is move 25 it is minus two and a half if you let the engine run ding is down a pawn ding has absolutely only one idea in this position literally one and it's to go here and that's it it was a good match it was definitely a good match but ding unfortunately just unable to break through and seemingly the nervous system just gave out a little bit and he took his chance at the wrong moment he plays a4 trying to untangle and jan of course has the move a6 here just maintaining defense but jan plays b4 okay b4 is good enough it's a very aggressive move and it's something that ding expected because after this there is a fork knight to f3 is simply a fork there is one idea here queen c6 triple fork back what is the best way to answer a double fork easy triple fork queen a8 queen d6 and queen f3 all threatened but it's still winning rook g8 and black is going to capture this and then black is going to go here and win queen c4 but john plays rook g8 wait a minute wait a minute okay not the most accurate of moves not the most accurate thing still goes queen c6 hits the bishop and this and now rihanna has only one move here jana has only one move he has to play knight f5 because pawn takes f5 is not possible black will sacrifice and there is a bulldozer coming in with f3 and rook g2 so queen c6 you actually have to play knight f5 but bishop b8 wait a minute whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa ding ding is winning what the hell what is going on ding is winning ding is winning bishop takes g6 is winning it's just completely winning now i guess the idea is that the knight is trapped but d5 d5 is winning for ding and the point is if g takes h5 you just break into the black position dingly ren for the first time in this game and for the first time in like five days is winning after bishop b8 he just has to take the rook no he doesn't see it well he doesn't see it he doesn't see d5 and jan is winning again with the move knight to f5 knight to f5 again winning but young plays rook h6 and now it's back to equality oh my goodness both sides missing absolute haymakers to put the other away so ding now plays bishop e4 centralizing controlling rook h5 is an idea but it's a little bit too fast now black can play f3 here but but dion plays rook f8 rook f8 is a very clear intention all right he's trying to set this up but he gives away his b-pawn and his rook is now hanging and now he's bringing his queen back wait a minute this game is spinning a little bit out of control here what is happening queen c3 realigning the threat on the king on h8 okay knight g6 fine f5 maybe rook h5 maybe you should have played knight of five a few moves ago it was a hard move now bishop g2 protecting the king all right protecting the king still equal all right now the queen comes back to h4 oh my god this is so tense now we have rookie two defending the pawn on f2 it's a very very tense position both sides are kind of running out of moves in fact one of black's top engine moves here is queen g5 okay both sides are kind of stuck and in this position game 12 world championship match leading six to five yan yipomney she plays the move f5 and the evaluation pogo sticks to the stars as jan gives up the entire house burns all his bridges and tries to go all in but after rookie six it's over it's over remember the wheel kick chris weidman threw against luke rockhold that dethroned him as champion and effectively ended his career that's what f5 was almost the point was after fg4 there was this and this or something but d5 is game over and if you do this i sacrifice and if you play king jade it's simply made on g7 jan i've got no idea what he missed he spent the rest of his time 17 minutes he spent head in his hands devastated unbuttoning his shirt not all the way that would have been a bit too much absolutely devastating the scenes rook h5 gh5 and in this position resigned game 12 of the world chess championship and it's six to six against all odds he was up 6'5 he was out playing ding bell to bell he was up a pawn in a nearly minus three advantage and it slipped out of his control back to equality and the move f5 completely ended the game he resigned because he cannot stop all of white's attacks and made it stopped it's six six after 12. the this match is nuts i don't even know what to say i can't wait for the last two games get out of here
