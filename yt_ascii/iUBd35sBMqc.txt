so this is the mantis hexapod walking machine as a six-legged walking machine that was developed for wear to test two things really it was to test whether the software that i developed on smaller machines would scale up to larger machines for in hospital industrial application and as a creative engineering project so trying to cover two things in one the software on board here was developed original my much smaller ones and that was always called the hex engine the hexapod engine and then for this larger machine the hex engine had to evolve quite a lot because it turns out that there are all sorts of issues with the weight of the machine that the way the software no longer worked it worked very well on the insect sized machines but when the scale got up and the mass went up it all broke apart so the hex engine as i called it got completely redeveloped and there was all sorts of safety features that went into it and it also went from a microcontroller it was actually a dsp controller and i ended up putting onto a linux embedded system which is actually a 486 running a hundred megahertz with a real cut-down linux system at boots in seven seconds and that's called the hex engine and that is the core of the control system the hex engine basically does all of the inverse kinematic mess and all of the control algorithms the gait generation and all that stuff and it talks to six control stations on each leg which are basically dsp pic processors running pid loops and they close the loop on each leg for each axis on each leg and they're all set on the can bus so the hex engines basically sending out what angles the legs need to be up there just doing the closed loop stuff and they're also monitoring some of the data such as the sensors on the leg and sending it back to the hex engine then there's also an ethernet network on here which is talking to a windows ce ii user interface and that's about a 25 second boot system is now at the tractor actually lock screens you get in tractors which has been reprogrammed for this purpose and that has all of the information to the driver so it's like a bird's eye view of the machine i can see what all the legs are doing i can change configuration i have your engine control panel if you likes or revs and flow rates and oil pressure that kind of thing so that's all on an ethernet connection and in fact that the reason why it's underneath a net connection and that also talks to the joysticks in the cab they are actually on another campus they talk to the window seee machine the window see machine on ethernet because it was also on wi-fi you can take all those controls out of a cab and run it via wi-fi remotely so basically the the core is running more real time and the user interface is a part of an offline system it doesn't need to be there if it crashes the machine isn't gonna fall apart is it worried that it can be remote-controlled no not really i mean you know it's not the best of security i could probably up it a bit it's only quite low-level wi-fi security but then someone would have to figure out my protocol that i wrote that goes on top of that to control the machine so you know it's only everyone for 15 minutes at a time if anyone can figure that out do you know what i'd shake their hand so so inside the cab here and we've got a joystick on each side and and a bunch of buttons which i don't label up for four reasons just to confuse people only i know what they do these are on a can bus that just talks to this module over here which is this robust tft screen touchscreen and has a bunch of buttons down the side and this is my operator driver view panel and if you like so this is where i can see everything that's going on the machine i can select certain modes and i get questions fed up from the heck's engine 2 here like do you want to do this do you want to do that are you ready to power up and so on and then the left-hand side over here i have another more basic control panel so this is rpm flow rate oil pressure and temperature so it's basically if this goes down i can still see all of that stuff here and this also has the big kill switch and the key start so this is more like the engine control panel of a normal car and this is more like a fancy dashboard version so this is tethered via ethernet down to the the hex engine the control system which is around the side here you come around the side set up underneath the drivers chair here so this is my 4 h6 stack in here and it can it's a pc 104 is the modular size and in these really nice robust cans and there's two cam buses coming at the bottom here and then there's the ethernet connection it's powered through the cam bus connector here and then there's another connector here which is a serial connector and that's going to little imu measurement system so i can basically correct the body attitude according to gravity and level the machine off so this is quite a nice little unit and there's a very convenient little a reset button just under here somewhere so i'm gonna do a i'm gonna do a soft reset when things aren't going right we just reached down under the seat what's a minix built around must of course a long time ago now but it's basically the whole the whole core was built on a build root system and it was just stripped down to the bare minimum and it was a thing that the the the processor board in there was by a company called vortex i think off the top of my head and they already had like a version of oh no stripped-down linux running i just took that and stripped it back further to add it on some stuff for the cam bus and things and built it back up from there i'm sure it was called a vortex board from what i remember and that was probably all based on some kind of debian based initial version i guess yeah i come from the film industry and the creative side you can't just let it's got a look at cystic lead please i was talking to someone today you know half of my problem with this is that i couldn't let things go and i could off because it would have been fine it would have worked fine like i wanted to seal up the whole of the engine bay and stuff like that and in the end i ran out of time and energy and actually most people want to see the engine so it'd have been silly if i did but the aesthetics are important to me but they're not needed to operate the cab looks really cool but the whole thing's removable so you can take the cab and the seat off and then you could have a different deck layout on there if you wanted to so ya know it's i don't know why i have to make things look good but it you know why not i didn't have an investor for this project because we did have commercial interest in it yeah it's the price of a house you know it's it's not cheap and i did three years of my own time on this and i wasn't paid so there's three years out of work for me as well and it really to be honest though if you were gonna build something like this i stayed properly because we didn't do a proper job but if you did it with a team a proper team of people i would say this is five to six people and i would say this is one to two million pound project if you did it for a company properly you know we did it as best we could on a much more a much much smaller budget still insignificant a significant budget much more and half of it issue i had whether it was trying to do so many things on my own i had to be the hydraulics expert the engine expert the software expert the electronics expert and i'm only two of those things you know i mean so a real tricky project what it does at the moment is about 1 mile an hour that is limited more but from the mechanical structure than it is from the the hardware of the machine i built it to go up to 4 miles an hour so i have capacity in the pump and flow rate for 4 miles an hour i think it's probably closer to 3 miles an hour now i've studied it but it's actually limited by there's too much flex in the legs in this direction the joints needed to be much stiffer on the legs up here and down here we need to make them much bigger probably twice as big as what you see now and then maybe if i had that stiffness in the y-axis as i call it in this which is in a straight line then we might get up to 2 mile an hour at least all three miles an hour and that would be it's not about speed at all it's never been about speed you know it has a foot pressure when it's standing on six feet the same as a human foot standing on one foot so it does very little damage to the terrain it was never about a speed thing that all they needed was a machine that would cope with rough terrain and have lots of traction in rough terrain and yeah it's to me speed isn't an issue on that bothers a lot of people number one youtube comment is too slow but you know if you don't understand real physics of stuff so it was pretty much for shows now i think i mean we would like to do something else with it i'd love to move it on to a company or a museum or something like that i'd be happy for a museum to take it they have the right money the problem is now that obviously it's you know it's an aging machine is five years old now and at least a lot of tinkering to keep it going so to sell it to someone as a work and entity would be quite tricky because obviously you know someone's got to maintain it and every time i get it out there's something needs adjusting so yeah i don't know what the future will be so it goes on trailer that trailer over there part of the whole design process was how are we going to move it around and so we built it in a way that the front legs fold in these middle legs fold right there way back flat to the body they have an extra range of motion on them it basically lifts itself above the trailer you drive the trailer on the leaf and it drops yourself back on and folds up technically speaking no lifting gear required this episode of
