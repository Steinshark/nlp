brady i want to tell you about a lovely puzzle that was invented by two undergraduates at michigan state. they call it the stepping stones puzzle and it goes like this: you've got a chess board, it's infinite, and you've got a certain number of brown stones that are worth 1 point each. the puzzle is you can put down the brown stones anywhere you want - say you've got four brown stones, that's fixed. you put down your four brown stones and then you add the white stones. the white stones are numbered 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; there's one of each value, and you can only put down a stone label 2 if the sum of its eight neighbours, the sum of the eight neighbours of that square is 2. well you can put a 2 here because it's got 2 neighboring squares of value 1, and 1 plus 1 is 2, so 2 is legal. and having put the 2 there we could if we wanted put a 3 here, because there's a 1 and a 2. we could have put 2 here also instead of putting it there. we could not have put it here because the sum of these stones around it, namely this this and this, are 3. so we could only put a 3 there, but we can't put a 3 there until we've placed the 2 stone, we've got to place the stones in order. and the puzzle is, for a given number of brown stones that you start with, like here's 4, how many white stones can you put down? what's the highest number you can get to? so let me do it with two.
- (brady: two browns?) two browns, exactly. 
we're gonna do it with two browns. and we're going to work out; if n is 1 you can't do anything, you can only get 1, so the answer - i'll call it a of n - if n is 2 how many- how far can we get? well let's try it. i'm going to start off by putting the two brown stones worth 1 point each, put them there. and now there's a unique place to get- to place the 2 which is between them. i can put it there because 1 plus 1 is 2. now i can put down the 3 and i could put the 3- i could put it there or there or there or there. but without loss of generality as we say i will put it there. so now we have to find a place to put the 4. well, i could put it here because the 1 and 3 makes 4. but it's a little better to put the 4 here because then this frees up this square for the 5. we've got to put the 5 somewhere, we've got to make a place for the 5, so i'm going to put the 5 there. and it's legal because it's got two neighbours: 1 and 4. 
now what about the 6? well there's a choice. we could put the 6 here- no no i can't put it there because that's got neighbours 5, 4 and 1 - i could only put a 10 there. you've got to put them in order, yes, you've got to build your way up.
- (so it's) (not what's the highest value can i get) (on the board? it's what's the highest) (value i can get on the board building in) (order?)
- building in order, yes. it's like climbing a mountain, you've got to get- work your way up.
- (oh i can see) (where you can put a 6) here right?
- (yeah) yeah, all right, 6. it's legal because we've got a 1, a 2 and a 3 - makes a 6. we could have put it there too but i like putting it here. 
- (does that not now) (invalidate the 3? the 3) (remains valid?)
- the 3 main- remains valid because when it was built its neighbours added up to 3 and and that's fine and then we can use it to build up other things. yes. all right, 7, where are we going to put 7? i'd like to put the 7 here because it's got neighbours 1 and 6 so that works. now what about the 8? how about here because then we've got the 1, 4 and the 3 adding up to 8. now what about the 9? well here would be a good place for the 9, but that looks promising because i can see where to put the 10. the 10 can go here because we've got a 4 and a 5 and a 1. okay, now i think it'll be easy now because we continue that thread. we'll put an 11 there, now the 12 - there's going to be a clever place to put the 12. here. the 12 is a bit of a nuisance because we really want to get down to using the 13 and the 14. we have to, so to speak, place the 12 in a way that won't interrupt us. because you can see that we have a 13 square here, the 6 and the 7, and now now we've got a 1, a 6 and a 7 so we can put the 14 there. and we can put the 15 there with the 1 and the 14, and we can put the 16 here. now i carefully provided stones labelled through 16 because i knew that 16 was the best we could hope to do. the two undergraduates who came up with this puzzle worked this out. they proved that you can't do better than 16 with two starting stones. 
- (because- because you) (could put the starting stones in) (different positions, but that's the) (optimal position to put them in is it?) (where you- where you placed?)
- yes yes. what makes this an interesting challenge is that in fact you could put the starting stones anywhere you want in the whole world. so if you were writing a program to search for this you could say, for you know x1 from minus infinity to infinity from- but of course you don't do that. you say without loss of generality we can put the first stone there and then there's really only one good place for the second stone, but then the number of possibilities increases. initially it's an impossible sounding problem but in the end we can do pretty well. so that's the solution with with two starting stones, all right, so and it's 16. and we know a few more terms: so we actually know only six terms and the sixth is 60 and three is 28, four is 38, and five is 49. that's all we know. we don't know seven,
no one has been able to work it out. and maybe it's because nobody has really tried hard.
- (do we know the stone) (configuration for 3, 4, 5 and) (6? we obviously do.)
- we know one, yes. it's not necessarily unique. here for example are the configurations for four stones, we you put the starting stones, the brown stones, in these places and then you work it out and eventually you can get up to 38 there. and with six starting stones, that's the starting pattern, and you can get to 60. now one thing i was expecting you to ask me brady is, how do you know it's finite? maybe if you're really clever you can put down the 2 and the 3 and the 4 and 5 and go around in this in a spiral and get very large numbers. well that's not possible and i will prove it. i can also give you a lower bound, i can show you that you can do at least this well. this is a construction of andrew howroyd. look at this, look at this construction. we're gonna put down a 1, a brown stone here, leave a gap there, and put a 1 here. these are the two brown stones. and then we can put a 2 here; then we can put a 3, a 4, a 5, and a 6 there. and then he said let me have pre-placed a 1 here. if we do that then we can put a 7 here, and then we can put an 8 and a 9 and a 10 and an 11 there, very cunning. and then we're going to put a 12 there in a minute; so let us have pre-placed another brown stone there and then we can get 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. and there in a minute we'll go 17. so each- each brown stone buys us five more steps. when we put down that brown stone we were able to add 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. and here we got five and here we got five. so with n starting stones, n brown stones, this is not the best you can do but it certainly shows that you can get at least five n minus 4, because each time you add one more brown stone. so here with two brown stones we went up to 6, and if i put n equals 2; two brown stones, 5 times 2 minus 4 is 6. three brown stones we went up to 11.
- (and this thing's going) (in a straight line?)
- it's going in- (it's not gonna twist it 
back on itself?) no, it's a zigzag. so we just do in a zigzag like that and keep going. it's a very simple-minded construction and i wouldn't be at all surprised if some ingenious person viewing this can come up with something that does wrap around itself and give a much better lower bound. but at least we know it grows linearly, 5n minus 4. now what about in the other- the other direction? can we put a limit on how many you can get? and for that i need another piece of paper. is there any limit to how many you can get? if you've got three brown stones what's the maximum possible you could ever hope to get? you might think you could get infinitely many. and the way i think of this is it's a kind of a mountain climbing problem. you want to get as high as you can, but in order to get to that height you have to build steps up the mountain to get there. to get to height 31,000 up at everest you've got to have steps in the mountain that are labelled with all the numbers down to 1, and the 1 being what any one of the huts. i think of the brown stones as huts, brown being a good colour because the huts are usually down on the ground. and the white of course corresponds to the ice where you're cutting the steps, the snow fields that you're ascending. so let's suppose you could get to a very high point; and this argument from robert gerbicz says let's look at a really high point, let's call it h. it's a square where we got very high up. how did we get there? well it's got eight neighbours. how could you get 100? to get 100 you must have had some pretty big numbers around it. you could have had for instance an 80 and a 20. we could have had a 50, a 49, and a 1 - the 1 would be a hut, a brown stone. i want to argue that there must be a fairly small stone somewhere in the neighbourhood; if there's a 1 so much the better, but there there has to be a stone around it which is less than or equal to 50. in fact less than or equal to 49, but never mind. if if we've got h here one of these stones - i don't know which one - is less than or equal to h over 2. because if all the stones around it were bigger than h over 2 we wouldn't- we'd get a number bigger than h here. so one of the eight, at least one of the eight, has to be at most h over 2, a neighbour of this. well look at the neighbours of that. the neighbour of this h over 2, one of them must be at least, at most, h over 4 - say there. and the neighbour of that must be at most h over 8. and so after going- after going d steps from this high point there must be a square with at most h over 2 to the d. but if we go far enough that's got to be a 1. 
- (what's got to be a 1?) the small one you get to. the high point has to have a neighbour at most h over 2, a neighbour of that has to be at most h over 4, the neighbour of that most h over 8. each time we go one step further away we can divide by a power of- another power of 2. so for instance to have a concrete example i was going to use everest. it's a little easier if i take 65,000. suppose we could get up to 65,000. 65,000 is just less than 2 to the 16, which is 65536. so i've picked a number here just a bit under 2 to the 16. and so following this path, you're always taking the smallest neighbour, we will eventually get down to a 1 in at most 15 steps. so from here to here- so if it's 655- think that means within a radius of 15 there's a 1, there's a hut at one of our starting things. all right so now let's suppose that we could get to 65,000 using just three 1s. let me prove that's impossible. so let's say we have our high point here, 65- 65,000 - twice as high as everest. and within a square of side 15, within a square around it of size 31x31 there has to be a hut somewhere. so a brown starting stone. let's suppose we were able to get to 65,000 with just three starting stones. here's a starting stone, here's a starting stone, and here's a starting stone. and we know that somewhere within distance 15 of one of these three is the 65,000. so if i draw the squares around it of size 31, and around here size 31, and around this one of size 31; inside one of these three squares of size 31 is our high point, is our point higher than mount everest, the 65,000 is within one of these three squares. that's what i just proved. but that's going to be impossible because not only do we have to get 65,000 we have to get all the numbers up to it. we have to get all the numbers in these squares: 1, 2 - well we've got the 1 - we have to get 2, 3, 4, all the way up to 64,999 before we can get to the top. it's not going to work because inside this square there are only 31 square stones, less- 961, less than 1,000. so we've got 1,000 square here, 1,000 squares here, 1,000 squares here. total of at most 3,000 squares. on the other hand we have to get 65,000 stones to get up there. so it's a contradiction, so you can't do it with three stones. three stones are not enough to get to 65,000.
- (you can't create) (branches that come out of the squares?)
- no because if there was a stone at 10,000 there still has to be a 1 within 10,000 divided by what- the appropriate power of 2. they all have to be within the squares of side 31 centred at the three huts. everything we do has to be within these these three squares. (so what does that mean
for our upper bound?) so our upper bound, yes. so what this actually gives if you do it properly is about n log n for the upper bound. but robert gerbicz fine-tuned the argument and taking care of what happens around the huts, the small numbers, doing that counting more delicately. and he proved in fact you can't get more than 714 n. if you have n huts, n brown stones, the highest you can get is 714 times n. so we know you can't get arbitrarily high. (but that initial sequence you showed me-) went up to six- 
went up for six terms, yes. (and that wasn't 714 times n.)
- no it's just an upper bound. he's- he he's just proving that you you cannot hope to do any better no matter how clever you are. in fact you can't do anywhere near as well but it's just- it's just a theoretical upper bound. the answer is 0. what about a 3x3? if we put a black queen here it attacks all the squares except these two. so we could put a white queen here. we could put a white queen here too but we'd have two white queens and we can not put two black queens. so the numbers have to be equal, okay. all you can do is one. one of each colour.
