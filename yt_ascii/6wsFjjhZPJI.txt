- we built a revolving door. last one to keep revolving wins $20,000. unless it's chandler. if chandler wins this challenge, he gets $50,000 in straight cash. because as you know, he's
never won a challenge before. so if he does win, we
wanna do something big. you four, get in that revolving door. it's simple. last to stop pushing wins 20 grand. - let's do it!
- run, let's go. - i am speed. ow, my foot. all right, i'm gonna win this. probably not, actually. 'cause i want chandler to
win, 'cause i love him. - hold it up higher, chris. - it's been like, already way too long. been like eight minutes. i'm really tired. - hello. you know, it's another challenge, and i'm probably gonna lose. i promise i'm gonna win this challenge. dustin, am i gonna win?
- no. - sup, guys. it's not feeling too good. i feel super dizzy. we're gonna stick it out through here. - make a goal, you win a thousand dollars. do it on your next time around. come on, chandler. you can at least do this. ah! - somebody say buckets.
- buckets. - ah! - i'm gonna finger roll this in, watch. somebody say buckets. - don't cheat.

i'll give you 10 grand. - okay. - you guys hurry. you gotta get in here with me. - if he hits this, i'm gonna need a loan. - [camera person do you
think he'll make it? - no. - you think he'll make it? - what? no. - all right, let's see it. - no chance. - i thought- i'm so tempted to throw it
at jake but i was like, why? - so what is this, chris? is that your wheel? - dude, i told you, i'm speed. the wheels can't even
keep up with me, man. - i'm trying to keep
up with you right now. - yeah, you can't keep up. - y'all are going really fast. - keep up if you can, slow boy. - best way to burn calories, honestly. - blur that out. - oh, wow. what happened? - blur that out. - oh, okay. - you don't wanna do
what happens next tareq. don't look at me. - this man is married. - yeah, that's not good. - i require a five gallon lowe's bucket. is that already pee in it? - yeah, i got it warm for you. - chris. - okay, oh, god. - oh, god, right here? right here?
- this is happening. - hold this for a second.
- yeah, no problem. - if my filming's bad, it's 'cause i'm covering my eyes. how does it feel to be
probably the first human being to ever pee in a revolving door? - it feels like science. - chris pees at least one
time in every challenge. - are you jealous of chris peeing? do you want to pee too?
- yeah, i can't do it. - oh you can't pee either? - it's a skill i don't have. - oh, that's right. - i two feet of dental floss, an aspirin, and a . - what's the for? - pleasure. - oh, oh, we're having a brother off. what are y'all doing? - just brothers butting heads. - ah, the bumps! i got a headache now. - he's still going. - i need an . my favorite thing is to
annoy chandler in these. he's breaking it. - we could probably
start a fire if we just, like, went super fast. - if you go really fast for maybe 10 minutes. - let's start a fire. start a fire. i am going to vomit. i need an aspirin. - uh oh, oh. that's it? whoa, oh okay. - can't spell tareq without reek. 'cause you smell. - i smell great. - oh, spin move. spin move in the revolving door. - why are we still here? just to suffer? - chris is farting up this whole place. - that's his strategy, man. - i'm not dealing with this. - why are we still here? - on a scale of one to 10, how bad do you feel right now? - horrible. i'm gonna get out if they keep going. shut it! shut it, shut it! - i will now perform
my longest "yeah, boy." - in three, two, one, and go. yeah, boy. - oh! - chris lost this one. - i was about to pass
out, i'm not gonna lie. - you ever tried knocking? just to see if somebody answers? - y'all got any beans? - oh, okay. - hello?
- hello. - chandler, it's been an hour and a half, how do you feel? - terrible. - exhausted. - chandler, you could win. here, chandler, roll this die. - all right, so we gotta go with the roll. - chandler, you rolled cornhole. fire away. all right, hit the corn. - don't do it yet. - here, take this, you roll. - basketball?
- basketball. hit it, hit it. - let's go. - okay, you can have the thousand dollars, but you're quitting?
- yay. - all right. he made a shot, which
is a thousand dollars, but he left the challenge. - sometimes you take
the bird in front of you instead of the one in the bush, i think that's how it goes. - two birds for one nut? - yeah, something like that. good job us. - another one bites the dust. - one of your victims is gone. - yeah. - you could actually win. caroline, cheer him on. - you needa win, go! - i'll do it. - how could you lose after hearing that chandler? - i know. - not only her, but
millions of other people are crying for you to win. how does that make you feel, dustin? - not good. - so as i said in this
video, if chandler wins, he gets 50 grand. and that still holds true for this video. if he wins this one, he gets 50 grand. everyone else only gets 20 grand. because, like, chandler never wins. - he's a loser. - but we're gonna do it a
little different this video. if he actually does win, he's gonna get the $50,000 in $1 bills. - that's like, at least 30,000. - no, it's like, more like 40,000. - geez.
- so, yeah. make sure you watch to the
end, because if chandler wins, he's getting $50,000 in $1 bills. - chris.
- give me this. - okay, here you go. - i will teach you how to win, chandler. - boy, if you don't get outta my- - pewdiepie is probably sick of seeing that you can't win a challenge. do this for pewdiepie, if no one else. does this remind you of anything? just going in circles. - throwing up. - throwing up? tall chandler, what would
you do if you won 20 grand? - i'd get a new piano keyboard. - dustin, what would you get if you won 20 grand?
- oculus - an octopus? - yes, octopus. - what would you get if you won 20 grand? - a house. - houses aren't 20 grand. - okay, a lambo. - lambos aren't- whatever. - i'm getting an ostrich. - an ostrich?
- yes. - all right, well then actually win. - what's up, guys. it's pretty easy. no one asked me what i
would do with my winnings. - jimmy. what would you do with 20 grand? - i would give it away. - you feeling okay? you're looking a little seasick, buddy. - yeah, i'm getting a little
seasick, a little tired. - stop it! - hey, hold on, this is legit. if he makes bullseye, you get 10 grand. - fine, one. - you gotta go fast. - i have one speed. oh. - he still missed.
- oh! - no, it still missed. - no! - dustin, you got too greedy. - look at it. - you got too greedy. - that metal changed my life.
- nope! - i just realized that would've
been, like, half the prize. - what was going through your hair when you did that? - lots of air. - so, you walked away,
did you win anything? - my pride. i beat chris. - okay. thank you for not winning anything, and making the video cheap. - tall chandler versus chandler. - i'm getting out soon. - no. this is your brother's
one chance at winning. you're gonna take it from him? - we'll see. we'll see.
- yeah? - we'll see if he beats me. - he wants to beat you? i mean, i would too. if you win, zach, if you
win, you get $20,000. - do you know what i can do with that? a lot. - stop holding your stomach and acting like you're about to throw up. you're gonna win. - you look like a cyclops. - you look like a bird. - you look like creep now. - how long do you think
they're gonna last? - um, 30 minutes. - really?
- yeah. - chandler, i'm gonna read
you "frozen" to motivate you. - no! i hate reading. - when the bridge-
- no! - so who do you guys think is gonna win? - chandler.
- chandler. - chandler? - chandler.
- chandler. - why do you guys so
confident in chandler? - the internet bullied
him for like three weeks. - that is true. - and they're still bullying him about it. - that is true. - you see all the memes in the room? - that is a meme right there, from the internet. - it's probably good
that you didn't want to. - cornhole!
- cornhole. - oh! - chandler, you are
lasting very long, man. this is crazy. i love this. - basketball. - how you feeling zach? - to be honest, i'm tired. i'm dizzy. i gotta win. - well, if you're gonna win, stop showing weakness. let's be real, the whole
world wants chandler to win. wait, did-
- oh, no. he's out, chandler just won. - wait, let him keep pushing. let him keep pushing, it's kinda funny. i know you've never won a challenge, but no one else is spinning. you know what that means, right? you won! - chandler, you won. i'm so proud of you. - as for your prize, it's not actually 20 grand. we will cut to that in a few
days, or actually right now. - so as you just saw, chandler
won his first challenge. he's competed in all of these challenges you see on the screen, and he
lost every single one of them. it's a big day. for months, you guys have made fun of him, and harassed him, but
that all changes now. so we have $50,000 in cash. he actually thinks he's
getting like 20 grand, but he's getting 50 grand. - even our fridge can make
fun of chandler, look. chandler, trying to win a challenge. losing on purpose so we
can make memes out of him. - chandler! - you didn't use soap. were you pooping while drinking a pepsi? - all right, connor hand me the 20 grand. open your eyes. here's all the money you just won. - 20 grand.
- wow. - so you're gonna use
this to pay off your car? - hello? dealership? - the light! now hand me another five grand. is this five grand? all right, it is. rock, paper, scissors for another 5,000. - rock, paper, scissors, shoot. - what are you doing? - oh, actually i don't care. you can have it. so now you're up to 25,000.
- hey. - what are you gonna buy
with the extra five grand? more debt? - buy some debt. - wait, another five grand? - i'm gonna form a number under
the table, try to guess it. - five. - just three. but here you can still
have another five grand. now you're up to 30 grand. staring contest. i lost. okay, well, here's some more money. now i think you're up to like $42,000. here you go, $45,000. there you go. there's some more.
- oh my gosh. - here's 50 grand in cash
because you won a challenge. oh wait, there's more. what are you gonna buy
with all this money? - i don't know. i've never had this much before. - here, you wanna give one of them a band? - yeah, i got you, dude. here you go. anybody else want one? - all right, chandler. throw your money in the bag. let's let's take it to the bank. there you go.
- all right. - all right, chandler, let's
take your bag to your car. - ho, ho, ho. - let's see what my mom thinks of it. chandler just got $50,000 in cash. - you won?
- yeah. chandler, you won, yay! - $50,000. that's a lot of money.
- he barely won that one, to be fair, though. - hey dad, i won a challenge. they gave me 50,000. - what?
- are you kidding me? - uh-uh. - do i need to come pick you up? - yeah, i need some security. - for real man? you lying to me? - no, i'm not lying. - so you won a challenge?
- yeah. - chandler.

people who believed in me. i know it took a while, but i did it. and stop making memes about me losing, make memes about me winning. winning. - follow me on instagram @mrbeast when chandler spends this money, i'll try to put it on my story. so go follow me. bye. - yeah, we'll ride the ostrich together.
