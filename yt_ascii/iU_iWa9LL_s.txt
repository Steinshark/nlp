iris somehow word got out to the framework team that i was heading to cooler master to cover the case that they built in collaboration with framework so imagine their disappointment when they all showed up and found out cooler master wasn't demoing it fortunately framework ceo extraordinaire narav showed up with a care package that has both the cooler master case and the reason that i need it you see i am going to be the first person outside of framework to upgrade my original framework laptop which started its life as an 11th gen intel machine to ryzen 7000 mobile all i need now is somewhere to perform the surgery oh and this segway to our sponsor mexico whether you're in need of webcams or accessories for your vr device nexigo has a great selection of products to choose from learn more about them at the link below i have to know for the team bed framework how painful was it watching me last time screw up like half of this upgrade process that hurt to watch you do understand i've still looked at none of the documentation right fully expect that you've never read documentation in your life but now that's not fair but you are here to make sure nothing goes wrong right definitely first you need a screwdriver oh i got you there never leave home with that one yeah absolutely i mean did you see me taking apart the new nvidia grace super chips oh boy don't judge me look from a waste standpoint that's true you should keep using this vintage chat melts or exactly disintegrates somehow that's what i'm talking about and the fact that i can keep using it with modern hardware that's the whole point is and if you build a ltt hammer you can bang the dent back out we may actually do that for the uninitiated this is one of the coolest things about the framework laptop the modular i o you can have usbc usba hdmi you can have four hdmis on your laptop if you really wanted to i don't think you could drive them all at the same time but you can drive three of them actually you can drive all four if you're not using the internal display on intel okay all right fair enough he's just gonna correct everything every every sentence is gonna have a correction it's good because the audience likes seeing me taking down a peg ah no no no no okay hold on hold on hold on yes good infamous to me it's been a while since i've done this wait wait you have to power it off chris why well technically i guess you could leave it on but it's bad for your os permission no okay hold on i'm not gonna break the ribbon cable i remember the ribbon cable good okay how cool is it that this is magnetic though okay it's like a fidget toy i mean you heard it from the ceo first this is a fidget toy how much are you guys enjoying watching me bug him or our head of ideas looking at this thinking like oh my god what's happening to this laptop so that goes up a little something like that and then there's a little pull tab here now my keyboard and trackpad both of which are user serviceable are removed well to start removing things the ssd has got to come out now i'm gonna remove the wi-fi card yes let's put that with that those are actually the same so that's okay they're color coded right yes yes not cool oh yeah and there's extras just in case you are me and you lose some huh i didn't tell you this but aside from wanting to upgrade i've had an issue with my display okay every once in a while it just like you know does stuff so i figure i probably screwed up something here you might have by scratching around like that and possibly it's a graphics driver issue and you need to update your drivers that's one possibility okay well one way or another we're gonna disconnect this yes if you are not careful with the edp cable you might have messed up somewhere something in there cool now i'm gonna pull out this daughter board thing yeah just just just relax i'm gonna release the latch sort of actually you want to disconnect it from the other side okay that also happened it came off it'll probably go back on oh oh oh speakers yes and you've got two more cables don't tell me the answers okay we've got the whatever the crap this is yeah oh six fudger not a metal screwdriver for that you say there's another one that's important one i wouldn't have noticed that so oh god the battery's still connected well there's your problem i should have done that one first realistically oh it's actually safe to disconnect the other cables while the battery is still plugged in as long as the leds aren't blinking oh okay what why do the leds matter so the leds are indicating that the main board is still powered and we've designed this in a way that if the systems open like that and powered off it'll shut itself off after about five or ten seconds and then you can do anything safely so it's like chassis intrusion but in a way that's not yeah that's helpful and then the best way to remove the main board is to just flip it upside oh my god okay that'll work don't do that anyone please strictly speaking there's nothing else i need to do that's it but i do want to investigate my edp cable so we're gonna pull off my bezel yeah you should open that further it's easier to take the bezel off oh got the tech tips here framework tech tips okay so what did i do i think that routed this wrong yeah you have to be careful there's a routing channel here and you want to route it through there and you have to carefully route it around the hinge in a way where it doesn't get pinched yeah not bad you've built a laptop before build a few thousand up i'm sure we got to make a big decision do we want to put the amd board in now or do we want to put this in the cooler master case cooler master's been generous enough to lend us their booth why don't we put it in the case can i can i call on the case pm to come help me with that esther do you want to act go in the video do the case it's okay they'll give you direction for for what to do he told me i don't need to speak oh that was a lie why would we put a microphone on you if you don't have to speak who designed the case then cooler master or framework we designed together oh really okay it's a very useful case so if you got our laptop and you need to replace the motherboard and then you got a older one so you can place it on this magic box okay now hold on a second what's that a rubber stand with a visa monk schools oh on the bottom side so you can mount it on the desk or use the screws that are in here and then what put them in the keyholes and mount it to the back of a monitor anywhere you want yes now tell me something the laptop itself only has an intake on the bottom but the case has an intake on the back on the front why is that so we try to make the inkjet more so you can release more hits oh so it's just to improve cooling yeah now your job is very simple if i do anything wrong you have to stop me okay do you think you can do that i can do it okay perfect whose idea was it to do a clear front we kind of to put our part online to be transparent to the various modules cool oh and it's got labels and stuff too and vme type c ram slots very cool that's going to be awkward if you guys ever change the layout of the board is the layout of the board ever going to change excited okay and it just goes in like that and the whole thing just like fits by friction or you still need to a school on you sure yeah because it seems to be in right now yeah because i already don't need to wait yeah okay oh i get it the screw holes have what are called screw bosses and these actually push down on the motherboard everywhere where a screw goes into the top of the chassis securing it with no motherboard screws at all yep so if i wasn't busy chit chatting i could do this whole operation in like two minutes by yourself yeah by myself you sure by myself i mean did you watch the video where i upgraded my laptop yeah so now i just do up all the screws yeah and actually we can put up if you want to abandon this laptop you can use the audio card to insert here and also for the wi-fi card you can put here oh we also didn't put any ram in it yeah now you included the screws for those cards but i couldn't help noticing that there's no antenna for the wi-fi card people can use the external antenna from here or they can also buy our antenna module as laptops in our marketplace but you don't include it in the case yeah we don't include it in the case okay i probably would want that included in the case but okay so right now i have no audio interface unless i buy another one you can right but i still need my laptop okay so you can use our audio we got audio car oh right i could just get an audio usbc module not right now now all we need to do is install ram ssd i gotta say aside from that i you know didn't order some of the components that i need that is pretty much the easiest computer i've ever built we're done now right yeah i didn't miss anything this time not all this time on a laptop obviously your power button is wired up to the motherboard somewhere where's my power button how about in here we highlight in orange so basically it's a little piece of plastic that presses a button on the main board itself to power it on and off usb-a usbc hdmi and instead of putting in my second usbc i'm actually gonna borrow this two and a half gig module from narav i'm gonna try sure there we go now we have display usb and ethernet we just got to find somewhere to power it on wait power oh right usbc that makes sense took me a sec it's upside down oh this way the last step is to power it up cooler master was kind enough to lend us their motion one chair demo here so can i just start unplugging things sure okay fantastic now we borrowed a displayport module from norov because of course he has one of those why change your cable when you can change your i o the lights on right yeah there we go yay okay you guys are selling it a little hard here you can't blame them for being passionate about what they do and there's that windows update i just want to shut the thing down and more updates no it's time for the big show he was so like oh no i can't let you have the amd motherboard oh the firmware's not ready before we started this video oh no the other media will be mad that i let you have the amd motherboard so he made me promise to say it's because i'm an investor that i get to play with the amd motherboard you want to provide two hundred thousand dollars we will give you an amd main board anyone in the world out there i wouldn't be surprised if someone is crazy enough to do it you got to be careful with stuff like that now in theory i don't have to do basically anything here right you reverse what we just did and put it back together what exactly am i putting in my computer though is this ryzen 7 ryzen 9 this is the ryzen 7040 series so this year's latest platform from amd this is very similar to what you're seeing in handheld gaming systems like the rog ally which i mean i know that you guys have never built the framework 14 as a oh it's a 13 isn't it framework 13. sorry as a gaming machine but yeah the gaming performance is there especially with two six of ram i am so excited wait oh you already put the ram in for me preloaded for you 16 gigs of ram that's it i'm sorry this is also a ryzen 5. this is not the ryzen 7 version because we gave the engineering team all the good main boards so if i understand you correctly people have to give you two hundred thousand dollars and you're gonna give them a half baked rice five yes it's great raisin five is really great though you know for an evil super villain you present very nicely tell me something did you guys completely reuse the same thermal solution it is almost the same the fan's the same the heat pipes are the same the heat spreader is actually different to match the die got it because it's the height's a little different the xy is a little different and the power regulation around it is different i have to confess i debated you in here a little bit because i wanted to ask some questions on behalf of the community starting with why the hell did this take so long when you're a startup as you know having been a new company many years ago it is hard to get attention from the right people you have to build credibility you have to put in the work you have to put in the hours and people realize that you're serious people see that you're doing something important people see that the community is getting excited and then we start to unlock better ability to do more and so ultimately the question is like why why isn't framework done anything yeah why haven't they done anything yeah the answer is asking himself the big question why have we done anything now the answer is either we don't have enough people we have to focus so we really really have to focus we have more ideas than people we don't have the money sometimes people give us money to help us out which is great or we haven't been able to get the right connections at the right partner to do the thing that we wanted to do so i got debated you lured me in here to ask for more money i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say anything he actually didn't say no don't say no okay i guess i'll just screw it on the motherboard first you can yeah okay you should make sure you're not pinching any of the cables under the main board okay but you there's like one there and one there gee relax you know for someone who didn't even bring me the new higher capacity battery you're being awfully correct i was gonna ask about that actually if you wanted one i could have brought one same with the panel actually the matte screen i'm okay with the glossy screen yeah i like seeing the outline of my my keycaps okay okay then i get my y wi-fi over kind of here-ish right yeah you can put them through the routing channels these rubber channels also this we have a new wi-fi bracket that's a lot easier to use this is the old one oh okay cool now you said the label's not right on this is it wi-fi seven it is it is wi-fi 6e but i just reused case that we had on really you're gonna give me an intel box and you're going to give me a mediatek wi-fi module it's an amd media tech combo rz616 module co-branded amd mediatek so the trick to this is you keep your finger on it while you're putting it in there yeah we'll hold on the first trick is that i have to find the screw yeah because i think it's stuck to a magnet somewhere oh no no we got it now i'll just plug in my display and hopefully not ruin that this time why didn't you do a better job of stopping me oh okay it's labeled it's labeled actually it doesn't end up both sides the same but we label it anyway it looks like i'll have to wait a little bit to actually have a secondary computer made out of my main board but this is such a cool concept i mean you guys said before yeah you can reuse your old main board for something but i feel like over the last two three years that sort of aspirational dream has actually come true like if you buy a framework today whether it's 13th gen intel you wait a little bit you get the rise in one once it's not two hundred thousand dollars that is a very usable machine by the time you're pulling the motherboard out of it putting it in a cool little chassis like this and then repurposing it for a media pc or for a retro gaming box definitely or whatever else not to mention that on the intel side you've got support for thunderbolt so you can even hook an egpu up to the thing if those ever get affordable wait you guys should do an egp we did show a demo of one at our event a concept demo of one see they were all like no you have to come to our event to see everything and i was like look i know i'm not coming to the event they're like well then we're just not gonna bring everything so i didn't even know i actually didn't watch the event are you okay so i did not know that that's fair i didn't watch your last video either it's amazing how quickly this relationship went from let's support each other to do great things in the pc industry to purely adversarial record time i think hold up i'm not done yet no that's right that's power i got i got my cable routed i got so you have to be careful in this yeah yeah yeah you have to be careful mom so now all i gotta do is put my keyboard trackpad back on here i really like this cable the way that it kind of is nice and long and you can kind of you know yeah this is called oh i think i just powered it on yeah is that okay yeah i mean that's good right so the blue light means powered on right no actually that blue light's a debugging light so i'm not sure why it's on oh sick that's not on the actual shipping systems that's for debugging oh okay and then i have more flashing red lights in fact there's flashing red lights all over the motherboard but you are powering up oh but i'm powering on so i should maybe cover it this back together are you sure you'd like me to cover it now yeah you're good well yeah no you're good first boot outside of the lab amd framework laptop i actually don't know the answer to this whether this is gonna boot so this is genuinely a surprise i had to be extremely let's say assertive to get him to let me show you guys the amd motherboard it's really really not done yet there's a ton of firmware work to be done like the thing with going from intel generation to intel generation is two things one he didn't say this i just know this intel has a lot of structures in place to support their oems that amd doesn't always have analogs for number two is going from intel generation to intel generation there's a lot less to rework but it turned on anyway i'm genuinely surprised happily that that worked now he made me promise not to go any further than the login screen i didn't i didn't go any further than that on camera can you tell me why i can't go to the desktop the firmware and the drivers are definitely not baked also i didn't bring any drivers so you're running intel drivers on an amd main board right now what could go wrong neither amd or intel is going to give either of us the answer to that i'll tell you what here hold on hold on i'm altering the deal pray i don't alter it further we go until wait hold on okay until the slightest abnormal behavior and then the video hard cuts so we won't show any of it can't do it you can can't do it this is it what do you mean can't my my keyboard doesn't work no my keyboard doesn't work i can do but you can't log in right now actually you probably can't i don't like that i probably can he said it no you probably can't oh can't you think i can't log in do you think my fingerprint will work no your opinion your pin is required but your pin can't be used because your pin is no longer available why did you break my laptop i'm sorry okay but actually hold on a second what does all this mean so the key to all of this is that when we actually ship this we have guides that we publish step by step super easy to follow guides got it you follow it step by step everything just works god you do this it happened to get this far which is great actually so i think we're stuck at this point because you're not on a network because you don't have the wi-fi drivers so you can't connect your microsoft account to log into it intentionally what's the eta for this all right so we are starting shipping in q3 batch one is in q3 and actually right now we're all the way out in q4 so we've had a ton of demand for amd oh i see so if people want to get one this year they do probably need an order yeah okay and full disclosure i am an investor in framework laptop anchor whatever the company so you make ink we it we get asked a lot to make a printers man this might not be just throwing my money away after all and this might not be throwing away this segue to our
