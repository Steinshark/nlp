this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] for me this is mostly a conversation like i don't i don't i'm not if you go on my channel you won't find debates it's mostly about exploring ideas and exploring and i think that i think that there's a i think that there's an interesting bridge for people in the west that are interested in in esotericism in general with just really mainstream orthodox theology where it's more integrated in the west there seems to have been a schism somewhere in the late middle ages where you know the elites kind of went up towards these these these esoteric groups and esoteric societies and then the catholic church was kind of was kind of left down there and then finally it ended up being a hostile relationship between the two sides but i feel like in the east there's a more integrated version and so i talk about symbolism i talk about mystery i talk we talk about all these things about you know becoming god the deification of of man and i have no problem with my hierarchy at all like i have no there's no i have no pushback because it's basically just the common thing so i don't know if you know a little bit about eastern christianity i've i've studied a little bit about it but not quite so much i think catholicism is more accessible with regards to their traditions and a lot of literature that i've encountered the orthodox thing is as far as being a major force in the english-speaking world i think is more recent generally speaking most of my forte though a lot of it really deals with the occult at large in the sense of folklore superstition things like that like as far as esotericism of any brand it really focuses more on that i have more of an appreciation for the what we would conceive of as the vulgar actually more of an interest in that folk charms and rituals including some christian mysticism it was often in the works that i've actually edited a lot of it is at the very least a facade an overlapping of christendom and praise jesus over what would otherwise be considered as heretical magic actually as well and that's quite common this is even in hermetic works this is in works that are even certainly the alchemical works a lot of them are chemical preparations but they're basically coded and they talk about angels and spirits and different divine ideas and figures sort of as a facade to hide the chemical recipe and also a lot of the works masquerade as chemical recipes but they're really spiritual polemics i find that fascinating and so you're mostly interested in the application like the the the magic part let's see yeah and and folklore in general religious history i just got done editing a work on the babylonian and syrian customs not just the occult side of it although it was especially in babylon intertwined with everything but even their weights and measures it was funny in babylon when they when they study their cuneiform tablets they find a lot of personal correspondence a lot of it's actually kind of funny it's like between lovers or between neighbors legal suits then assyria takes over and it's almost entirely military and diplomatic in nature and i find that aspect of the human experience to be fascinating and so i guess like my question would be to you what do you think happened in the west that created that created these kind of schisms let's say in terms of esotericism but also in terms of of of even the the definition of magic as it came to be in the early modern the early modern era i think it's intertwined a lot with civics and deals with with more secular authorities too there was an interesting schism actually between the the catholic and protestant groups in terms of the burning times in terms of persecuting people for folk magic or herbalism or whatever the catholics had a caveat well if you can establish that it's just white magic you're just healing people you know you're not you're not causing abortions and you're not doing black magic they weren't burned at the stake or or drowned or anything in the protestant tradition allah king james demonology of course which you probably read they didn't care if you if you were doing any folk magic and it wasn't explicitly canonical explicitly uber christian you were a witch anyway and would get killed for that yeah and so do you think it has also to do with the kind of burgeoning of scientism that happened at that time because a lot of people tend to this is one of the things i always face is people tell me you know the medieval witch burnings i'm like medieval whisperings like which burnings are early modern although they're renaissance exactly and so there's like there's this there's this birth of the scientific mind which wants to categorize things in terms of just in terms of technical and in terms of quantitative things and so they face these practices which are different let's say and that are more related to spiritual influence you could say or influence of the person that is performing the the remedy and they don't know what to do with it so so it's like it doesn't fit in this kind of like enlightenment version of christianity yeah and the the really weird part is that the middle ages were less persecutory in some ways than the renaissance and everyone says well things got better during the renaissance everything was maybe science and technology clockwork mainly and actually in the middle ages there was less of that i edited another work recently on medieval medicine and one of the main things discussed is in the renaissance you have sort of a reversion to the more antiquated notion that the sickness was invariably spiritual in nature whereas in the middle ages there was at least some attempt to say well yes i believe in demons and demons of sickness are definitely causing problems but also you know you've got these humors and it's not necessarily a demon maybe you just ate the wrong food they didn't have germ theory but they had a basic concept of the transmissibility of disease and it almost disappears actually later on it's almost strange how there was a retrogression in medicine there's also an interesting one of the interesting things that i discovered was that i would see in the roman times there was a kind of witch-burning that was popular and then charlemagne actually was one of the people that banned the burning of witches he said you know like this the witches don't exist basically it's what he was saying like this is just like you know let's not bother people with this and then it came back like you said towards the late middle ages and ultimately especially during the renaissance and kind of in this these weird kind of witch scares and werewolf scares it happen at that time oh yeah werewolves is another funny thing yeah the babylonians used to do that they they used to have specifically like medicine men you could call them they were intertwined with the priesthood actually that would dispense little spells and give people like little items to put next to their door to keep witches away led by lily to actually they're sort of a queen of the damned if you will that informs lilith later on in judeo-christian tradition and it's actually funny because they imagine that this horde of demons went out at night along with the transients and and pickpockets and prostitutes actually and they were sort of all lumped together and they they would get paid to have protective spells and incantations against them and we die it's funny because in in the middle ages you see less of that i've i've edited grimars and most of them they're not from the middle ages from the renaissance or even the enlightenment and there is where you get some of the classical sort of takes on on witchcraft miasmas and stuff like burning a wolf skull with herbs in it at the edge of the village to keep the plague away and things like that even though the black death predates that by many centuries one of the things that i'm curious about because i've been to i talked to about this with a a professor of many of byzantine studies and i was trying to understand because a lot of the texts that informed the renaissance magic some of them obviously came from you know from from spain but many of them came from constantinople as constantinople was kind of taken by the the muslims a lot of the scholars left constantinople for the for the west like the corpus hermeticum was preserved in constantinople basically but there it doesn't see it didn't seem to have the same effect and so i was we're trying to figure out like in constantinople towards the end there were all these neoplatonus there were the the the hermeticists you know and they're all there but it didn't create this schism which we see happening in the west as modernism kind of sets itself up it could have been like a neo-roman appreciation for the compilation of knowledge sort of thing like just having the material there was considered comfy and and enlightening just having access to it maybe more than an actual sub movement maybe yeah but i think there were people that were practicing and reading it it just wasn't it didn't create a kind of social disruption as it did as it is it moved into italy let's say and and you see boccaccio and all these people kind of taking it up anyway so to me that's it's curious like i'm trying to figure i'm a western person right and so i'm always trying to figure out what is it that happened in the west so that you come to the'th century 19th century and you have these like free masonic these freemasons and these rosy christians or whatever and then you have popular culture and what like what broke like how is it that that these things became became so separated and so i don't know if you have if you're interested about more info folk religion maybe you don't have insight on that but if you do i'd love to hear it not so much insight but maybe the the disruption was greater because those greater powers including the the ottomans and other groups held things together more than the smaller inter-warring states that comprised western europe for a lot of that period maybe because i mean if they're constantly changing land you know one day you're flying one flag the next day you're flying another you're going to have more authoritarian civics you're going to have kings that are more strong arm as opposed to having a greater expanse and you have sub-governors and stuff and there's maybe more tolerance it's funny the ottomans were butcherous and insane in many ways but religious tolerance arguably was higher under the ottoman empire at most points than it was in the west well yeah just because they also were like in the same way that the west kind of tolerated jews then the muslims tolerated jews and christians it was like what comes after it tolerates the thing that they're replacing for yeah i think i think the jews mainly in the in the plague times i think mainly migrated to poland if i remember correctly yeah i mean there's a huge for sure foreign and so so another question that i had of you is how does it translate today like because you study all these books and everything and you call yourself a pagan like how does it translate into the modern world like how do you practice these things like do you ha like is it is there like animal sacrifices like something like that no that's that's that's that's mainly a jewish and islamic tradition more than it is genuinely pagan when we see mention of mass animal sacrifices a lot of them they come from like the mesopotamian pagan cultures and things like that are ancient greece most people i don't think do that fortunately that's really just a take off of fortune telling i think there's been a co-development a co-evolution of the practice of divination especially because it used to be you needed to buy the oxen slaughter it read its entrails or you needed to offer two goats to the priest or or do something that was expensive and or possibly dangerous and it was simplified over time to become more user-friendly you can call that a devolution in the sense that it's no longer the authentic original tradition but if we were to live a world today where you had maybe like a sumerian style animal sacrifice then the price of beef would be a little bit higher than just under bidenomics yeah we killed we killed all of our cows every single year we always knew what the future would hold in the future held that we wouldn't have hamburgers anymore then american culture would collapse and so how does it translate like i'm curious to know like how it translates well with my editing in my study mostly it's more on the academic side to tell the truth my own personal practice i rely upon i believe in dream interpretation in the loose sense although there are a million different methods to interpret it this is something that's common i think pretty much to every religion there are christians that dabble in that even if they say well well yeah i'm interpreting the dream but god gave me insight or something it's a mystic experience it's in judaism certainly in islam it's in hinduism etc that i believe in in basic oracle usage again it's a fortune telling methodology you can use a random number generator for that for what it's worth but mainly it's an academic interest initially i don't know if i've mentioned this to you before but my editing started simply because i saw that there was a huge amount of literature available about the occult in general all subtopics and on amazon but people were taking pdf scans of initial documents great for primary source work but a lot of them they're dog-eared they're missing pages there's grammatical mistakes there's writing in some of these things and they're charging 20 30 for them i'm sitting there as a poor person i'm like now i'd love to read these books in an actual print copy but i can't even afford more than one or two of them and i said i set about getting the original digital scans and completely re-editing them to make them in a modern format and lowered the price sometimes yeah the prices are pretty low yeah yeah by three or four times and what i wanted to do is say this is is literature that's valuable in some cases there may be only two or three paper copies of these works i've stumbled across mention of works that are apparently extinct there's supposedly a fortune teller from the early'00s that was ascribed to thomas jefferson i've seen it mentioned in a couple of other works i've never run across any information on a copy mm-hmm and i am also a bibliophile i love physical books so i don't want them to go extinct and i might as well make a living off of it in the meantime is that your main source of like living is the is the book editing yeah i make more off of the book editing than i do on donations and things like that and youtube stuff yeah yeah and so what like what value do you think it brings us these books like as modern people well if if someone's interested academically they can study it if someone's interested in certain paths or ideas within the occult they can actually utilize them that i mean i keep them in their original format occasionally i redact sections like a lot of these works had lengthy lists of advertisements at the end especially the herbal works for like this miracle tonic this will make your hair grow back and and you know stuff like that and it's just like only occasionally do i include any of that sometimes the index would be mispaged so i'll take that out otherwise i keep them intact and the idea is that people can study from them people can use them maybe they just want it you know in some cases someone's a fan of mine they just want something that i edited so yeah make it available i mean i think i'm kind of pushing you in the sense that so you know obviously everything's in crisis i think that you probably noticed that for several years that there's a crisis in the west you could say there's a crisis of meaning there's a crisis of identity there's a crisis in education there's a crisis just constantly there's a problem with commies yeah yeah exactly and so i think that i guess where i'm going to is like one of the crises is a spiritual crisis you could call it like there's a there's a and it manifests itself in the in all kinds of stuff whether it's a it's these weird kind of literalist evangelicals whether it is the the breakdown into like new age mushy whatever stuff that that that is out there crystals and all this kind of crystals are fun they opened a sorcery school like two streets for me and it's like it's like a witchcraft school it's obviously so wickens in other words i don't know what they are they they probably go out back they probably go out back and dance topless twice a year and then they take some mushrooms and play with their amethyst i by the way inauthentic religion like that it can be cringy but it's harmless and there are some people out there still think wiccans worship the devil and like you gotta read the a book on hedge wicca sometimes basically they just want to grow and drink tea all day yeah i mean it's like it's like a weird it's like a weird modern union kind of real imagination and 100 years old gardener all he wanted to do was see naked priestesses yeah i'm not surprised that that's what we behind it so so the idea is like there's this crisis and so so when i look at like let's say when i look at the popularity of narcissism right now and the popularity of all these all these kind of resurgence of all these weird texts and all this weird stuff i see it as part of the breakdown like i see it as a scattering of of stuff where everything is kind of breaking down and and fragmenting into into different into different kind of idiosyncratic you mean like the availability of like a cult literature and stuff like that or well not the availability just the fact that joe whatever like joe next to next door you know is talking to me about kabbalah as if like as if this has anything to do like as if and then and then he mixes it with aliens and then he mixes it with like all this kind of modern stuff and you're like it just seems like it's poor it's like a huge yeah yeah but that's already happened anyway all the religious practices of today pretty much are a bric-a-brac because of the cosmopolitan nature of post-colonial trade and travel i would say arguably the one other than the orthodoxy which is more puristic in that sense another one and i actually thought to mention this to you because i was thinking back to when we were having our our debate actually there is one other mystically inclined religion that hasn't changed form at least you know the the scriptures and stuff are still there you can practice it authentically hinduism yeah it's just hard because to be a hindu you have to be in a in a cast so it's like it's hard to become an indian i know people that become hindus and it just feels like it's it's bogus to me yeah i would actually actually debate that point too the the caste system initially doesn't really have to do with with birth and do a specific situation by parentage it has to do with being judged on one's traits thereafter like once yeah but who would attribute you to a cast like how who would decide well well it's canonical the way in which that's done it depends on what you're geared towards your your personality and so forth if you if you actually go through not just the bhagavad gita but all their other various texts that that part actually is still authentic that's more the indian state and i think what happened is that the people at the top who tended to be brahmana said hey we've got a good thing going we'll just make it about who your parents were we'll have all of this fortune and stuff will be the raja forever and then again that's a civic denigration of what was originally a more spiritually minded thing yeah have you ever thought about the relationship between the varna and like the cat the basic cat system and the medieval caste system it's almost identical in the in the medieval world they had those that pray those that fight and those that work so it was three it was a three-tiered system and it wasn't also necessarily completely based on births obviously because the the the priestly cast wasn't a it's not a it's not a cast that was that that could be transmitted because of the that's almost similar to plato's description of how to describe to people why there are differences between cultural groups like saying oh well you know the people were formed out of different metals and so the the ruler he's the ruler because he was made out of gold when he was born you're a merchant because you're made out of copper you're a soldier because you're made out of iron and you you're a homeless because you were made out of the dirt under my shoe and it's funny because actually julius caesar in the roman days reforms this initially the roman columns are very much like the greek hoplite and were taken from the ranks of the nobility and caesar said well we need more men because we've got all these barbarians we've got to kill and then he started going out to like the farmlands and finding the big brawny dudes that were working all day anyway and drafting them be making them centaurions and stuff yeah turning them into soldiers yeah i mean caesar was obviously much more pragmatic more revolutionary than we sometimes want to to to see him as let's say but so my question is like what do you see as the as some let's say some of the solutions to the to the the crisis meeting and so i'll be totally honest with you like to me you know spending many years thinking and looking and everything i see that christianity for the west that's that's it like there's no everything else that's presenting itself is presenting itself as a destructuring agent it's presenting itself as something that is increasing the breakdown and that the solution that i that i kind of grabbed onto was to restore the mystical possib not myself but to go back into the mystical possibilities of christianity like dive back into the early church fathers and the you know the the latter towards heaven all of these these types of descriptions of mythical transformation rather than kind of go into all this stuff that was boiling up and so obviously that's not the solution you grabbed onto so my question is what do you see as like a spiritual path for the west or a spiritual possibility i think that it's about the the individual and that it's cosmopolitan in nature i don't see that as a breakdown of anything other than an order that wasn't initial to the united states certainly in elements of the west because those were promulgated by something you could roughly say it was an amalgamation of christian lore but in the deistic sense generally secular authority the civic structure and then elements of maybe the more enlightened pagan groups that had already been studied especially in greece rome and to an extent egypt and those things those ideas amalgamated together they did in the middle ages as well as we've already gone over and they formed a backbone to society that was much stronger it really isn't in the united states for example until the the'30s'40s that you get a resurgence of two of these forces trying to break that that sort of backbone you get the rationalists the secular side of things like well god is dead you know screw you shouldn't have this religion stuff it's boring and then you get the the hyper fire and brimstone especially protestant groups in the us i know the orthodoxy doesn't engage in that quite so much but among the protestants it was a big thing i would say also christianity is also already schism we have the protestants and they've subscribed into a million groups you've got catholics you get the orthodoxy you got like the newer groups like mormons which are arguably vaguely christian in some ways jehovah's witnesses and then other groups and then you have and we spoke about this too the absorption of of foreign matter into various forms of christendom forming new age movements you know scientology arguably to an extent the a thousand cults mostly based in the la area you know because california is a cult and but but i don't see this as a problem because that sort of diversity of thought on the secular level was already there and then was a good thing i think that people by and large should simply study as many spiritual systems as possible and arrive at their own conclusions but in order for that to happen they have to have self-awareness and they have to have rational critical thinking the problem is that mainstream religion is the only thing that's going to work for the masses because the masses don't have the time or the intelligence or the inclination to study these things for them i've been approached by people asking me for spiritual advice and what i tell them is if you want to put a lot of effort into it delve into everything just go ahead study it's all there you can get it for free digitally because of the wonder of the internet if you're not inclined in that direction shop around for a mainstream religion and just make sure not to follow any cult leaders exactly but so what do you think is the vector of like what's the vector of unity like what stops what stops the u.s or what stops the west from just being invaded from the outside like what makes us something you mean in what sense invaded ideologically physically both either whatever like that you vanish as something like you just because physically it's it's your military capability and your will to guard your borders so the former we've got down pat the latter as a work in progress or redress at the moment under beijing biden's administration and others trudeau up there as a little bit divisive himself i'd say a lot of the divisiveness though is the misuse of spiritual systems by civic forces that as governments have understood now that if they divide people it's easier to control them and abuse them and take more of their money and religion is a great vector for that at this point i think race and artificial identity like the lgbtqa plus xyz thing are the main things but religion is still alluded to even in the united states think about this way joe biden reigns over a party that harps about secularism but every time that he's confronted he talks about how deeply catholic he is he still pays that same lip service to a tradition that he's not really religiously part of yeah he feels he's compelled to do so but not by religious forces he's not doing it because he's like well my god is the true god it's doing it because he wants to be elected he's doing it yeah he is not conventional yeah he knows that the prince has to be nominally religious in order for the people to to like him like he he read his renaissance politics he knows what's going on but like when we talked about when you talked about the let's say the hindu system you know the original hindu system would have been the notion that the spiritual element is the highest right and so the priestly caste is the highest caste and it doesn't have military might so that's what legitimizes the power of the state is that you have a spiritual power that doesn't have that is only supposed to be turned upwards towards the highest things they don't have political they're not supposed to have political and military power so the military finds their justification for their military power in the spiritual tradition now the problem is that if you make religion like relative to all the individuals then the only thing left to justify the only thing left that's ultimately going to bring about milit civic unity would be something like brute power because it's not always interesting but that's but that's the truth of the way that it always has been the priestly class has always relied upon the consent of the militaries and the governments anyway unless they're twain unless you have an outright theocracy in which they're the ones doing the governing and the religions of side hustle what i would say is that it's still it's it's effectively the illusion of a benevolent detached priestly class and that actually is a problem it's not the breakdown of traditions or anything like that because of the availability of different spiritual systems because those spiritual systems were never actually in control the leaders typically they would they would walk the walk and talk the talk but only to a very short extent they would say pray like like us leaders they'll say praise jesus get the evangelicals to vote for them then you look at their voting record you compare it to any proper interpretation of christian canon and it tells an entirely different story yeah and what would i mean the way that it what i mean is that so let's say let's let's look at the difference you know between let's say the syrian empire and you know the worst even of christian the christian colonialism and so the syrian empire just came in brutus brutally killed and raped and took and did whatever the hell it wanted and justified it by its strength only that is there was no need to say there was no need to pretend like no need to to say like you know to at least put out an image of being nice and just and let's say having the the christian values and then doing something else in the back what you see in christianity is that people will project at least the christian values and then in this in secret do the bad things you know try to get away with the bad things but and that's that's what's leading is still an ideal like even if it's not completely followed upon like it so that's what i mean by the idea that the invisible like the spiritual world leads the physical world and so even if the even if let's say the roman popes were all lectures and and and whatever they still held they still had to hold a certain ideal and the aristocracy had a an ideal which was let's say the chivalrous ideal is something that you don't find the idea of like the the night that helps the the weak is something that is just not there in the roman times and it's just not there in germanic in german unless you think that that's not the idea that should be held the idea of like the strong helping the weak let's say but that's a that's something that holds that's what i mean when i say that the spiritual has to be above the the civic authorities even if in practice the leaders don't necessarily follow it yeah but then that becomes a problem because it becomes useful fodder for propaganda if you've congealed the society and there aren't those differences of opinion that difference in thought about spiritual topics and stuff there won't be as much debate to potentially shine upon those leaders who aren't even acting they're not acting for a god or anything they're acting in their own self-interest or in what they conceive of as the nation's interest and they'll justify it it's sort of like the debate we have right now about coven now i won't get too too deeply into it because of course this is going to go on youtube so we have to choose our words carefully yeah exactly because because susan weiziki is our is our deity here but look look at the public response it's presented with a facade of this is for your own good this is for keeping people safe helping society and stuff but the things that are actually done don't comport in in all essences to that actual goal the patriot act is a great example i constantly default to even the label patriot actor had nothing to do with patriotism it was presented as a way to keep people safe but it was really a way to spy on people it's a misrepresentation the problem is that when you have that congealing of society where the super majority of people follow one ideology that ideology will inevitably prevent potential actual reformists who are outside of it from becoming leaders that's problem number one problem number two allow charlatans who are simply charismatic within that grouping to take power and to use it and for their own benefit it's sort of like what stalin did stalin works his way up the rungs of the communist party deviates entirely from what we could consider at least at the very outset to be an attempted reform because people were suffering under czarism and then goes on to kill 20 million people well it's all for your own good i'm going to take these cool acts move them off their land it's for they that they shouldn't have that land they stole it or something we're going to take a bunch of ethnic russians moving to ukraine and ship the ukrainians to the middle of siberia why well it's it's because we need to break these people apart to to move closer to a communist collective all of these things were presented under the ideology that was professed to be good things and instead they caused untold suffering famine and pain for many many people yeah but there's a there is a difference between ideology and traditional religion that is let's say if you ask what's the what's the ideology of christianity it's not it's not a practical ideology per se right it's a it's a it's a notion that it's an idea of worship of the highest good and then that brings about certain virtues and certain values and then there are obviously ideology the only difference is that you're claiming a divine origin for what is can only be construed of as a human ideology because it involves humans involved in that behavior it's still an ideology it's just it claims it doesn't claim the ideology is promulgated by force or by a collective will it claims that it's enforced by a deity that's up in space somewhere nothing stays somewhere no that's what the evil minds thought yeah well they didn't think it i don't think they think it the way you thought you think they did you know when you read dante he he mocks people who think that the that the that the let's say that the spiritual beings actually inhabit the heavenly spheres he says no it's a it's a condescension of divine language for our understanding like the the spiritual beings don't actually inhabit the heavenly spheres it's a it's like it's it's basically an a system of analogy that helps you see the higher realities that are invisible realities and so believe in the all-encompassing god then it would be in the heavenly spheres but it would also be intertwined with everything else so yeah definitely and that's that's sort of like the force maybe we should all just become jedis yeah that would be super practical yeah but in terms of what you're saying that's the way it's especially in the orthodox tradition that the way it's understood that is god is both absolutely transcendent and absolutely imminent at the same time because he is the he is the thing he is that which holds the world together let's say the bonding you could say that the the world holds together through the divine love is the best way to understand it and that everything i would yeah i would say if you believe if you believe in the total inner penetrating imminent god that also and this is actually in the bible it creates good and evil and is sort of passive and all-encompassing then i would say the best thing to do is not worry too much about schisms and civic things anyway because ultimately it's just you know this amorphous being's will and doesn't matter so much and it would be mostly a statement of individuality on that end anyway because you would simply be professing your faith doing your thing and living according to what you believe is holy and and godly but there's a way in which we have to like not only we have to but human beings manifest like communal bodies like we have to join together you know we we join together in in in in communal versions of what we are it is you are like you are an amalgamation of stuff right you know and so and that has to hold together or else you're schizophrenic like if you let the parts of you rule you too much then you're you're you're diseased and so we do the same like we come together and then we create let's say higher versions of what we are like where we participate in communities and bodies and that that has to that can't only be to brought down to the individual level can it well it can if the individuals i argue from a pragmatic perspective and say if the individuals understand critical thinking the individuality aspect is prime the civic and religious aspects are more decentralized and and the civic aspect legal one is less important if you argue the transcendent nature of a deity the all-encompassing nature the good and the evil the light and the dark the everything and nothing at the same time sort of imminence argument then i would say it doesn't really matter if the world ultimately goes to hell your your soul is safe ultimately everything that happens is part of that divine will or lack of will anyway and it doesn't really matter and then i would also i would also argue a proper construing of you know the words of jesus and the new testament would beg to differ as well and essentially become completely passive towards all civic affairs and is almost quasi-separatist in nature allowing people to form if if they share your religious views those communities on the outskirts and if they're persecuted they're all the better for it and they're martyrs yeah but there there's a way there's a way in which i think what you're saying is that how can i say this if god is the all is imbibes all things then we participate in the world that is it doesn't make it doesn't become this kind of less affair thing where everybody it so let's say in st paul there's this idea that we are that through bonds of love then we create let's say something like the body of god in the world that is we we are the ones who make the world something which holds together rather than something that breaks apart so but why would that be important in the civic sense ultimately you would be spending your time let's say that you've got a societal reform on your mind you make videos about it you march you do activism or whatever would that not technically be time that you're taking away from doing what the explicit command was which is to go give things to the poor and help the widows and stuff and you're trying to help society at large that society if you follow the example of your christ effectively is nullified there was no real attempt to reform society it was individuals that were being interacted with the only interaction in the collective sense of node is going in with a scourge and attacking a bunch of bankers which also is is something we can't openly explicitly support that again because this will be on youtube but it is an interesting story yeah but there there there is the idea that christ gave the idea of communion is not something which just limits people to the to if you read the chap the chapter then saying the gospel saying john he keeps talking about unity he keeps talking about like you know be one as your father in heaven as i and one with my father all of this idea of like a bond of unity and love and so you're right that it's not something which is political per se and i think that that's also why the christian ideal is is more something like the the the saint or the monk or the martyr but then out of that will flow certain societies that his societies will flow out of that it doesn't create how can i say this so it really is in this sense that i was talking about this hierarchy of being that you have the brahmin and those that fight and etc so if you recognize the the monks and the saints as the highest and they're the ones who do the things you're saying because not everybody's going to end up doing that the world kind of lays itself out in normal hierarchies like it just kind of flows out but at the top of your hierarchy is someone who gave everything for the poor if the top of your hierarchy is someone who gave everything for others then there's a good chance that some of that will flow down into the world as and so i agree that like the civic part is definitely not the top like it's not the highest aspect but it can flow out of it but then the dysfunction of the world would be properly more ascribed to the sickness of organized religion than anything else because it's already there maybe in a degraded form but what allowed it to degrade would allow what do you mean would allow weapons if the civic is to be subjugated entirely to the religious the religious is is held up at the height which until the last half century generally it was in most countries anyway and things are degrading wouldn't it have to start at the top at the root of the problem would be the religious leaders no you're right you're absolutely right and that's why if you read so then if the lord allows them to be degraded and it's not certainly not just the case in christianity it's the case in any religious or spiritual movement including among most pagan movements then then why entrust them with greater power or try to organize society on their basis if they're already sick you'd need an entire revolution no but that's why you in the in this traditions you always have two strains you'll have like a you'll have a saints strain and then you'll have an official strain and the real strain is the saints strain that is the saints don't have to be bishops or priests they can they don't have to be popes they are recognized they are recognized by the church by the by the people by the the bond of love as being representing the ideal and they're the ones that really give us the the way to go that then you have the hierarchy let's say the actual civic verb like the let's say the official version of the hierarchy where you have priests and bishops and everything and those are needed and useful but ultimately those are they they have to bow to the saints right they have to worship they have to venerate the saints because the saints are the one are not part of that hierarchy you know and the hierarchy is supposed to flow out of it it degenerates i agree it of course it does like every any human system it ends up degenerating but it has in it the possibility of keeping those ideals up there like the ideals are clearly marked and you know like what you're what you're following whereas like in in a like that's why i if you look at what's going on in the u.s i feel like that's the main issue is that there is nothing there's no spiritual example that is keeping us together right what is keep what is making us something like what is making the united states something my memory of it's descending maybe yeah the civic example of its founding was based upon certain spiritual precepts not all of which were christian that part definitely the saints of christendom would play a huge role not in the religious sense but in what you're saying the metaphoric sense though again though pagan ideology was intertwined and also secular ideology that had been delivered through things that are logic philosophy in the more secular sense although again that's intertwined with religion mostly and things now we're seeing what we're seeing exactly that we're seeing a kind of taking down of the saints of the of the united states history oh yeah there's a reason why they want to remove thomas jefferson and so what what like what do we like that's i guess that's the idea is like how do we deal with this like how do you deal with i mean i we have the same problem like i'll be honest with you like i have the same problem in christianity you're seeing the same thing happen right the pope of rome right now like is is is is acting against the pedophile yeah against the very foundations of a lot of the foundations of his own i've got a solution and it actually kind of is the the christian prescription for it at least in the sense of jesus teachings which is decentralization don't rely on public education it won't teach your kid critical thinking homeschool your kid or at the very least get tutors grow your own food get to know your neighbors form your local communities create syndicates decentralize your income do everything that you can to be self-sufficient and starve the machine because the real problem is globalism is that the problem the biggest problem is it goes beyond just the united states it's an international phenomenon at this point that's actually an advantage in one way because you can tell people of different religions look it doesn't matter which god you're worshiping you're still going to be a slave to so we need to get it out but it's one of the problems with decentralization is that in the process of decentralization it makes you weaker because you're fragmented and so you end up being a bunch of fragmented bits facing this massive machine and i'm saying this like i'm not trying to get you or anything like that but if you're think about it as a puzzle so you get a puzzle of 500 pieces and you only take two or three out now the puzzle's bigger but now let's say that most of the pieces are absent well that puzzle is not so formidable anymore it looks like swiss cheese that's the way to do it you need enough decentralization and i would say pseudo decentralization in the communications era because these groups can coordinate with one another even at great distances even across the entire world they'd communicate with a lunar colony if they wanted to these decentralized groups but what unites them together i guess hatred of the system yeah the fact that they want individualism they want an end to the abuse and tyranny of this of the world system as it is which really it only benefits a handful of crooks at the top and none of these none of those people are religious some people blame religion to say like well it's these these greedy christians running this country these greedy sheiks islamists running another one the jews the hindu cast or something no these people don't believe in any god if they if they believed in the concept of judgment or hell or purgatory or karma or reincarnation they wouldn't act the way they do because they'd be terrified all the time yeah i don't think i don't they're not necessarily atheistic but they've just they're completely clouded by self-interest they don't even think spiritual thoughts they're completely apathetic towards them yeah they they worship mammon basically is what we've got they wouldn't even worship mammon it'd require too much effort i just care about i have to i have to walk up these 50 steps just to throw the baby on the altar what the too much exercise i'll have my secretary do it yeah there you go and so look i mean i think i think we we've gone quite a quite a while i guess maybe like my last question for you would be something like in the past let's say 10 years or the the past time that you've been on youtube i've noticed that strangely enough you do have a lot of christian people that follow what you're doing and you know you also moved it seems from this kind of satanist kind of a you know secular satanist type position to now a more which seems to me like a more nuanced position and so i'm curious to see if you if there are some aspects in these last few years of christianity that you've reconciled yourself with but if you still think that it's really useless oh well the majority of the more modern works that i edit they were written by christians more or less religious inform i just did a work on mystic christianity actually only about a week ago i have an appreciation for anything that i believe falls under the umbrella of the occult any mystic tradition christianity kabbalah mystic islamic sufism those all fall under that umbrella as well i don't in the past i had more of a problem with organized religion and took it out on the religion itself and in time what i realized is while it's really greedy leaders i mean they could also be greedy secular leaders it really depends on the interpretation more of the religion what i would say is the fire and brimstone aspect of some groups of christendom i oppose i think that it's crazy but then it's no different than the fire and brimstone style groups that you find in any hyper zealous community it's the same in all religions there are pagans like that there are pagans that probably probably would revert to human sacrifices if they were legally capable of doing it and getting away with the actual devil warship cults out there that do crazy too one thing that i would like to point out for the benefit of your audience is going on your channel is i am not a satanist some people believe that i still am that was ten years ago and that was a transformative atheistic step to clearing my mind out before i indulged in all religions and i could look at them with a clear lens it was sort of like a wiping of the lens for me even the term pagan though at this point i don't know is fully appropriate for me due to practice it's really occultism yeah it's a it's a search for what is hidden or what is not known more than anything else i'm just on the road with everybody else i just don't think there is an end destination maybe i find one someday but i'm not looking for it i'm just looking for the different paths and enjoying myself on the way well i would say then i would still i would recommend that you look into hesi chasm like the the christian the eastern mystical practice which is which is completely it's very similar to to other mystical practices but in that it's not secret that is it is it is integrated into into the church there's a there's a compiled book called the the philocalia which is a kind of compilation of all these mystical texts which talk about the mystical practice breathing techniques you know attention to the heart posture and then repetitive prayer all of these things that you find so it's like yoga so see it is like hinduism i mean it's obviously it's not it's not it's not the same but it is definitely a spiritual practice which looks more like eastern practices than it does the kind of emotional you know gospel worship you'll have to link you'll have to link me to that book where i can get it i'll definitely think and i'd still i think i mentioned it on our last song i would suggest you read my my brother's book his name is matu pejo he wrote a book called the language of creation and he actually he actually watches your content so he was excited when i told him that that that i was gonna talk to you but i think that he can bridge also some ideas in terms of in terms of like let's say the the esotericism and a way of understanding it in a in a way that isn't hostile to to that's one of my biggest problems i think with the occult is that the man in which he became hostile to to normal religious religious practice you could say like where you had this elite that were practicing these things and then the people is like it's it's actually in a way that you phrase it yourself it's like ah for the masses this stuff and then for the really the the the elites this stuff and it's that separation which i find difficult well the positive side of that was an attempt to bring the masses upward and make everyone sort of aware of that occult nest the theosophists were big for this social reform and so forth some of which actually took off and and were promulgated including prohibition sorry for that one say this theosophists unfortunately there are some occultists that are just completely elitist though and they don't think anyone can learn unless they've been given the the mark of solomon or something like that like they have to be like marked at birth especially with special star signs or something in order to learn magic and i'm like i don't think so all right well anyways thanks for the conversation i appreciated it and like we'll see how people react to this conversation if you want we could always pursue it so yeah it was great all right cool nice to talk to you we'll say peace out all right bye-bye as you know the symbolic world is not just a bunch of videos on youtube we are also a podcast which you can find on your usual podcast platform but we also have a website with a blog and several very interesting articles by very intelligent people that have been thinking about symbolism on all kinds of subjects we also have a clips channel a facebook group you know there's a whole lot of ways that you can get more involved in the exploration and the discussion of symbolism don't forget that my brother matsuya wrote a book called the language of creation which is a very powerful synthesis of a lot of the ideas that explore and so please go ahead and explore this world you can also participate by you know buying things that i've designed t-shirts with different designs on them and you can
