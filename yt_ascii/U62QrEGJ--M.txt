ladies and gentlemen chess is a pretty tough game and all of us are trying to improve at it in some capacity in this video i will be showing you the secrets to getting hs elo of approximately 1200. i'm going to be playing three games against volunteers shout out to them very very brave one is rated around a thousand one is rated around 1200 and one is rated around 1400. my reasoning for that is that you have to be able to beat the players underneath you in elo consistently enough and you have to be able to get points off of people above you because the truth is if you're 1200 that's a rating range of about a thousand to fourteen hundred and you need to adapt your play to all of those different styles so let's jump into today's games and i will be playing certain openings that i recommend in my courses if i have a chance and obviously i will be using methodology and thought process and all that those types of things from my middle game games master class as well as my intermediate course free samples of both link is in the description let's jump into the first game this is blitz and i i did this specifically because i i didn't want to make like a 40 minute video so these games will be a little bit faster and then i will analyze them but you should play 10 or 15 minute games to improve okay so at the 968 level let's assume you know nothing about chess i imagine we're gonna get a london because it's one of the most popular openings i'm just and there it is i'm responding to a queen's pawn with d4 d5 and you don't need like a bulletproof london methodology when you're 900 of course i'm 27.68 i'm actually exactly'00 points above my opponent sorry that you didn't click on this video to hear me flex knight f6 is always a good move and when you are playing queen's pawn positions what you need to remember is the best friend of your d-pawn is your c pawn but i'm 900 okay right i'm 900 maybe i'm 1200 maybe i'm 1100 i i don't i don't necessarily remember that so i'm not even gonna play the opening fully accurately this is not good your dnc pawn should go together but let's just assume that you're not like a super tryhard in the opening let's just follow good development principles so let's let's pin the knight to the queen and we're gonna get our light squared bishop out before we finish the development of our dark squared bishop all right let's play e6 and life is good now obviously when you're playing speed chess you don't want to fall behind too much on the clock i'm okay doing that obviously because you know i'm gonna win but bishop d6 is a good move so we've finished our development more or less and now we want to castle probably castle pretty much quickly white should respond yes that's actually exactly the right move and now i'm going to castle and okay i have a completely reasonable position after seven moves now the game is going to be about decision making when are we going to trade pieces when are we gonna trade pawns a lot of chess is played with the physical pieces and a lot of it is played on the empty square so that move is made and the thought process should be what is the idea of that move do i have any checks captures or attacks and then how do i improve my position that move is attacking that to be honest with you i i can take a few things but there's no reason to right now i think let's just keep it simple like i don't need to overthink this just rook b8 yeah i mean could i have had like some better flashy move maybe i could have went knight a5 which simultaneously attacks and defense but there's nothing wrong with this move this like there's no the game will not be won or lost based on the move rook to b8 right and if you're 1200 you need to slowly outplay a 1000 and an 1100 pretty consistently like you've got to be able to beat these people seven out of ten times maybe eight out of ten times because if you lose to them you're gonna lose a lot of rating my opponent is thinking my opponent really shouldn't overthink they got to develop their bishop and castle now depending on what type of opening people play like in this case the london system people are going to be losing games at a slower rate the the london is very solid like this move is just trying to put the knight into the center you can take this but it's defended you can take this but it's defended now can i take this yes but if i take like this i walk into a fork does that mean i therefore need to take like this not necessarily but is it better than taking with the knight yes do i need to give up the bishop no i mean i would argue to be honest with you you really shouldn't be giving up a bishop for a night unless there is a concrete reason there is it's okay to keep the tension here among the pieces that's one thing people they try to relieve the tension no just play relatively straightforward chess like we don't necessarily want to give up the night for the bishop so let's not do it my opponent develops with with bishop to d3 now i can play bishop g6 but then again the knight will take so check out this idea i'm gonna play bishop takes knight my opponent will respond like this and then what i'm gonna do is i'm going to rotate my knight to hit that pawn right so now this is under attack two times okay now is the part of the game whereas the higher rated player i'm 2700 but if you're 1200 you got to take over and that means certain exchanges that means outmaneuvering your opponent with pawn play or piece play and obviously okay so my opponent didn't see my idea right like they just missed that this was the point i can probably take with either let's i don't know which one is better to take with i i guess i'll take with this one now the only thing to remember is if this than this but if this if this if you do this they're gonna do this you cannot forget there is another person sitting there right trying to beat you too so you have to come back with the knight that's the point you gotta come back with the knight and i will show you there's actually something even cooler in that position but we're 1200 so we don't know that now i imagine my opponent will go here or castle i was gonna say or castle we have a lot of options here a lot of options we don't have a lot of forward jumping aggressive moves but let me just attack the bishop like let me just ask the bishop what's going on you actually have to take and there's two second bonus time so we're not gonna be you know we're not we're not going to be losing on time i'm just trying to get as many games in as i can alright i don't want to make you you know sit here for like an hour so knight takes okay i'm a pawn up i'm pawn up i have eight pawns versus seven so now i gotta use my pawns i wanna go here but that loses that so be very careful i'd like to slowly expand my pawns in the center of the board okay first i'm gonna slide my bishop back and attack the queen that there's nothing wrong with that move and you seize control of all of this now i'm gonna block i think the diagonal of this bishop this is actually a slight inaccuracy let's see if my opponent is able to take advantage i'm weakening this that pawn move right so let's see if my opponent now sees this like i'm gonna play queen e7 do they see that they can take my pawn that move opened up the queen do they see that right like it looks like oh okay they missed it so now i'm gonna play here and defend that that was a great move actually opening up a few things at the same time now i think my opponent is getting a little bit desperate like they're just trying to throw pawns forward which is something what people do when they get low on time all right i've brought both my rooks to the center my center is rock solid now maybe we try to bust open the king right we try to open up the king a little bit create some sort of attack over there bishop h4 is a nice move i gotta block this i can either put my knight or my pawn i'm gonna play f6 it's not so bad because everything is super held together in my position it's really not that bad my opponent couldn't try to poke some holes here with b5 but i don't have to take anything that actually walks directly into a pin and put pressure on the pinned piece now the knight can't move and spotting that tactic is critical i actually don't even have to take yet but i whoa okay now i guess they're gonna go here all right now we can simplify to win a position like this up material knight d3 comes in hits the queen in the rook just tactics here like this person played very very well but it was just the tactics that that ultimately will will will make them succumb to the pressure we're gonna simplify now and now you can just trade a few pawns and trade off the rooks that's going to be the most important thing trading off a few pawns rook takes is a free pawn and let's give a check and let's do this this is a very nice technique here now the the easiest way to win okay well that's actually going to make it a lot easier if they trade rooks with me and trade a few pawns we are now the remain you know the remaining rook on the board so we're gonna get in and you can if you really want to do this because the the opponent is not going to beat you with just the king and pawns we have the extra bishop so we're gonna gobble just be very careful don't let them walk into your position and take your pawn now you're in good shape and use your pawn majority here to march it through so a couple of different phases of the game here i'm gonna make sure the pawn can't go through and my opponent resigns that was a very well played game by my opponent i gotta say as a 1000 this person must be like 12 1300 rapid right i can't see it but i would imagine i mean they played a really nice game they played very very well i didn't play super great you know i i was just very solid and this maneuver here my opponent should have defended this pawn with f4 and the game goes on as you can see like it's equal it's an equal game so to beta 1000 nowadays is a 1200 it's gonna take you like move 15 move 20. you know if you don't catch them first of all it's a lot harder to win fast with black a lot harder to win fast games with the black pieces because because the london is so solid like they're not just gonna flame out my opponent even though they lost the pawn still was doing more or less okay throughout the position like i you know i played a6 to kind of try to to to force them to make a decision i didn't play the best moves and i wanted to show something here that was kind of funny if bishop takes d7 i have something called the suicunzuk i don't need to take this right now the problem is that i can i can do this but then this but the most forcing move in chess which is why you always look for these is a check and the point is that now i remove white's right to castle and then i take and this is a pretty bad position for white because they can't get rid of my knight because of this and now they can't castle which means the rook cannot get into the game and i am completely winning so a very very high level tactic there but of course had we just been playing and i was you know simulating being a 1200 emulating simulating i don't know which one is the is the best word but yeah listen i gotta tell you to be a 1200 you've got to you you've got to beat these 1000s these like high 900s low 1000 rated players and it is not easy the london is one of these openings that it's very tough to get out to beat quickly if you want to beat it quickly you have to play dnc pawns together the reason is that taking is just not good for white you can always win the pawn back very quickly and if they do this you can just start to attack them like this queen b6 is a very very provocative way to play but i got news for you even if they defend very passively the london is so solid it's just a tough opening to crack really so this game was ultimately decided by my opponent making a pawn blunder they lost the pawn but then more than anything they missed this chance by the way he could have equalized right the the tactical mistakes low time tactical mistakes pinning yourself and then after you pin yourself you walk into a fork just two tactical blunders really decided this game my opponent lost the pawn pinned themselves and blunder the fork but that's like that's life you know what i made a slight inaccuracy as well the london is is a very very tough opening it is not easy to beat at all all right i i'm trying to start my next game uh and i can't which frequently happens so let me maybe jump ahead to the other game i was gonna play three games in today's video but i will i will jump ahead to my third game and if the second game doesn't start actually i will play white in this game i'm gonna play white in this game i apologize for that i don't want to edit this out that's okay technical error i did not want to play two games with black because you obviously will get games with white so let me play e form and let's see what happens all right so my opponent is playing e5 now when you're 1300 right so the point here is that my opponent is is 1384. if you're trying to be 1200 when you play 1380 rated players you cannot lose 10 out of 10 games what like if you want to be a rating in chess you have to not respect that rating you you need to fight that rating so what we're gonna do is i'm gonna play the ponziani i'm gonna play an opening that's a little offbeat and this is the way i like to study chess i'm gonna play an opening it's a little bit offbeat and i'm gonna try to put this pawn in the center it's a it's it's not the most popular move okay opponent just responds very quickly with knight f6 and now i'm gonna play d4 so i'm not playing the most common move i'm playing something slightly off the beaten pass d4 is played they take the idea now is we we go here and the best move is there okay my opponent plays that move and you can recapture here before i recapture i will play queen b3 the idea is to attack the knight and target on this diagonal right so now the best move for black really the only move for black is this if they go here i just take okay very good and now i recapture now many people here will go d5 trying to block my queen d5 is a bit of an inaccuracy even though by far it is the most natural looking move this is the best move is pawn to d6 this is also played quite a lot to try to give a check to me and go here very simple you don't even need to trade just keep developing keep getting pieces the point is that white has a very very nice center opponent castle so they haven't committed this pawn yet i can do a handful of things here i think it's a little too bold to start attacking in the center of the board but maybe maybe we can get away with it although i think unfortunately there's tactics on the king so before it's very very important that you kind of like relax yourself a little bit in chess you gotta you gotta calm down like you you cannot just go to battle right away with with your opponent i think what i'm gonna do here is mate i'm considering bishop b5 bishop d3 or bishop e2 i like bishop b5 because the idea is to take and take obviously but let's let's let's let's kind of keep it a little bit relaxed let's play bishop e2 and try to play short castle i just don't know yet right like i don't know where my opponent wants to go and i'm not castled yet so it's just a good rule of thumb to not overextend all your pieces forward while your king is stuck in the center okay d5 is played now it's not checkers as much as anarchy chess wants you to believe it you don't need to take on passant just because you can is there any threat to this move no is it worth going a3 and getting this maybe but that's not going anywhere i want a castle let me be principled let me castle i anticipate this move now with the intention of capturing my knight okay that's a little bit passive no problem i kind of want to finish my development what do we think about that to defend my pawn i can also play a3 now let's play a3 now if bishop for knight we take with the pawn so that we have a rock solid central formation notice how our opponent despite maybe not being completely familiar with the opening has still has developed other pieces in a very natural way and has set them up for success for the rest of the game in fact i would not put it past my opponent to go back because i actually think taking here is a bit too committal you don't need to do that and i think at this level maybe intermediate players are like it's okay to go back okay he decides to take it's fine it's not like losing by any stretch of the imagination but my opponent decided not to waste time the problem with this though is that i have a very very strong pawn wall now and more space okay a5 i understand the idea is to go here but i'm not convinced by this and i'm i'm thinking of ways now to start like attacking over here maybe even knight g5 right away to take the bishop let's let's just put our bishop out and then i think we're gonna start firing away at those weak spots over there the secret to beating players higher rated than you is to attack them it's not to play defensively and survive it's to attack them nobody likes to be attacked nobody i don't care if they're 250 points higher either than you watch how quickly my opponent disintegrates with this attack coming so 97 the idea is to go here very smart idea by the way i have to i have to give a lot of credit there all right so now we've got the cannons lined up right knight g6 very good move i have to decide between going forward and backward i'm gonna go forward i think it's a good idea hit the queen and then we gotta play h4 h5 right we just gotta go for it h4h5 just attack we also do have knight h4 to try to trade the knight off and continue this attack i gotta tell you knight h4 also looks very interesting but of course if you're gonna attack you should do it with your least valuable piece right which is a pod just h6 sharp move we can already consider sacrifices but i i think it's a little little too bold let's drop back and we still have the cannons pointed that way h5 is is coming i gotta tell you if my queen and bishop were flipped it would be a bit nicer because queen h7 would be made i don't have that so right now we are threatening to take but believe it or not it's a knight c4 is also another very decent move very decent i don't want to trade that bishop that bishop is useful over there so h5 now my opponent is playing really well really really well i gotta i gotta give props gotta give some serious props here i was gonna say i think a lot of people would disintegrate under the attack but i like how my opponent is playing this and notice i mean i'm still just adding pieces like same side attacks in chess which is what i'm doing right now same side castling attacks where my king is short castle and their king is short castled the pawns really are the difference makers and sacrificing material to opening to open the enemy king is very important this move i'm not super concerned about because first of all to replace my dark squared bishop i already have a bunch of dark squared pawns and second of all it would open my rook f5 is another very good move good move wow that is a seriously impressive move by my opponent they're looking at f4 maybe i'm gonna go g3 now i have nine seconds because i've been talking through the game i have to speed up i can't sit here and keep talking so i'm gonna try to make moves first and then talk obviously don't leave yourself with 9 seconds versus 45 i'm sort of just doing this to kind of show you the instructional value i prevent this move and i think what i'm gonna i'm gonna have to find a way to get in there somehow right so queen attacks that very good move again i'm gonna defend that maybe they're gonna go bishop f7 all right b6 is i think a step in the wrong direction now i can rotate my knight over to f4 let's go here attacking the bishop now it's kind of like the go pace that's under attack now c6 defending king g2 i'm gonna probably get my bishop out of the way here at some point maybe bring my my rooks to this file gotta be careful though that pawn is hanging i mean my opponent this person has played super super well this game all right rook g1 we're still looking to create something there let's put our knight on c5 plug the hole and we we definitely have a very menacing position trying to like still make g4 happen while we're both trying to run our kings this is wild stuff g4 now and now we take and we take and things are things are happening here so we're breaking through now we can use our pawn we've got the pressure i can take that on personal and now you you will not survive this attack you will not survive rook h6 rook h8 and if queen f5 i'm just taking actually rook haters just mate should i sacrifice my queen for a checkmate for absolutely no reason oh no my queen but that's mate okay completely unnecessary flashy finish there with queen f5 takes and rookie mate did you see how to put into beta 1400 i think this person must be like 17'00 rapid right 1600 rapid i mean this person was really tough really really really tough it was not easy to beat this person i mean i had a good position for a very long time i was plus one plus 1.5 but let's just show you like it's hard to be a 1200 for 1300 consistently look who you're up against in blitz right this is this is this is tough stuff and in the opening you know i was just playing like a ponziani you know i had a decent position but i mean this person was was a fighter was a fighter even though i managed to get like the wall and i had a nice position i tried to create some sort of attack person just defended super super well i thought i was playing very logically and yeah they were just doing a very very nice job defending themselves and i mean i i sort of did walk you through my thought process of attacking but h6 was well timed knight c4 was a nice move and look at this look at this they actually got back into the game with f5 i mean all the all the all these sharp ideas it took a monumental effort to beat this person so how do you beat a 1400 i mean still attacking attacking was the way to go like if you're 1200 and you want to beat somebody two three hundred points higher than you you still got an attack but i got news for you you are going to lose games like this and it's gonna build your resilience and build your character because these people are so resilient this person did not go away it took me rated 2760 like 35 moves to finally crack through their defenses this was not easy at all you know what i mean so yeah chess is hard it's real tough i'm gonna i want to end the video playing this person i i hope they're here okay there they are here they are i unfortunately get white again in this game but let's let's play d4 this time and let's play instead of a london let's play a queen's gambit they play the slav defense in the queen's gambit get your knights out get your dark square bishop out like out to f4 or g5 and then we're gonna play e3 to make sure our light squared bishop defends as well and this is like a 1200 now right so we're playing down we're playing up let's see the level right in the first game our opponent played about 15 good moves and then lost the pawn and then started blundering last game was a monumental struggle it was so tough all right so my opponent has played a semi-slav defense here and now is thinking which is odd pawn take c4 is actually the best move it's actually the best move and i think the idea is to go knight d5 i'm gonna be shocked if they know that okay i'm gonna go e4 so anytime in the queen's gambit that your opponent okay not bad the idea now might be before i was gonna say any time in the queen's game but your opponent plays pawn take c4 your idea should be to go e4 this person clearly clearly well prepared so now queen c2 the idea of queen c2 is to support your center again we're supporting our pawns we want to play bishop e2 in castle and another example of a person that knows what to do in the opening black has kind of gotten everything that you want you want this free pawn and you you want to hang on to it with b5 however what black doesn't have is a center pawn we're up pawns in the center black's piece is also very kind of blockaded here right so we we got rook d1 we have bishop e2 i think i'm just gonna go i don't know i mean i want to go here in castle right that's that's sort of always the idea rook d1 i'm gonna castle and i think i'm gonna put my rooks in the center of the board and yeah i mean i see nothing wrong with this move right like we're just making improving moves notice how at this level we're not trying to jump in and attack our opponent right away there's a lot of just good chess being played by all three of my opponents knight b6 okay at some point maybe my opponent is going to want to go here i don't know when that's gonna happen i kind of want to stop it but then you gotta anticipate this coming too so maybe b3 maybe just both rooks in the center for now there's nothing wrong with just activating both rooks on their center lines b3 at all times to kind of break that up d5 is always an interesting idea we can try to just like last game start some sort of attack over there jumping the knight into the center of the board is also not a bad move it's just a good active move it's defended it's well supported and we got to decide what to do with our pieces now just like i've mentioned chess's empty squares and physical pieces and it's also kind of a battle of pieces and pawns which of them is going to be the hero like do you want to walk through into the position every single time a piece moves something happens peace moves right so now we've got kind of conversation going on here between the pieces knight f7 doesn't do anything kind of want to pin my opponent i kind of like that so my opponent went here now i have some pinning ideas so now the knight and the queen are sort of interacting we're gonna slide back i don't i don't think taking gives me anything taking there's no fork now g5 here would be a massive mistake it would be an overreaction to the pin and it would be a big weakening of the position actually i think going back might be best okay a6 is fine there's nothing wrong with the move a6 i kind of want to apply a bit more pressure here i think you know i have this interesting idea i want to trade this pawn and bring a rook to the attack i'd love to bring a rook up and over but i can't so we're gonna do it like this we're down a pawn but as i've been okay that move loses we're down upon but what i was gonna say is it's we have what's called compensation so my opponent is up a pawn but look at this bishop very passive the knight can't really move this move forgot about the fact that when i take suddenly there is this so completely just forgetting that opening the position comes with risks which is why it's so important to put your rooks in the center because when that center opens you're going to be staring down the board and one move just lost the game on the spot it didn't just lose a pawn it will always it will come with a price tag of a bishop and probably more material if you go here i take your queen but at the end of it i'm also going to take your knight so one pawn move same exact situation as the 900. 15 good moves one mistake and this mistake is actually fatal now here it's better to take the bishop than the knight it's just almost always better to take the bishop the knight but also in this case the knight is actually under attack so i mean honestly rook takes is pretty good but i like pawn takes i mean we're two squares away from queening how can you not like that it's such a thorn in the position and now that we're up at night we're up upon in a bishop a couple of ways here to win the game get your pieces to the king and also just simplify it just simplify down all right get that bishop in there anchoring that pawn rook goes to c8 nice move counter attack being created here if you get tunnel vision you're gonna get it with this move so yeah i gotta slide out of the way rook c8 is an excellent excellent move and very very blunderable okay but unfortunately my opponent totally on tilt mode and and loses a piece there but listen i i got news for you i mean bishop e7 rook c8 was very very nicely timed and if i got lazy here and played this to go here suddenly after b4 it it it's it's a game again i'm gonna lose that night so my opponent had a pretty good grasp of their opening just like the the the 1000 did and played very well i mean i had to you know i was down upon in the early going but i i played principal chess i took the center i put both my rooks on the center of the board and it's just not an easy opening to play with black it's just that's really what it is and i came forward i kind of reacted to this move by pinning the knight the computer here finds a very ridiculous idea sacrificing the night taking here and then e5 getting the material back but it's very hard to evaluate that as first of all it's very hard to even see that as a 1200 i thought i played it pretty well a6 and you know i thought b3 was pretty logical just sort of relieving that pressure and my plan here was going to be to play something like rook d3 and rotate maybe knight g4 also decent in some in some future moment but my opponent's sadly blundered right and the 1400 did not blunder that was the major difference between these three levels is that the 900 rated player the 1000 rated blitz player you know they they sort of like they they made a elementary blunder like in the in in the early going like that pawn and then obviously as the game opens up more blunders are gonna happen because time gets low this player played really well it was just sort of a really tragic mistake that lost them the game just like it happens the 1400 did not make a single mistake like until so much later in the game so that is what separates these three levels and to get to 1200 you just have to be a very very consistent player you have to minimize your errors and you have to have a good grasp on your openings you've got to beat up those 1000 seven eight times out of ten punish their blunders you've got to be consistent and beating the 1200 rated players like 5 out of 10 6 out of 10 times a little bit more than half because obviously that you that's you can't just be losing them to them half the time and every now and then you gotta put up a huge effort in my opinion you gotta attack these 1400s with white and with black and really anybody if you're watching this is a 1600 and you want to beat'00s you gotta attack them but you got to scrape some points off of them because if you want to be that level you can't respect that level i hope this was useful great games today really none of these subscribers fell apart none of them lost in 10 moves really really great games and if you enjoy videos like this let me know i'll keep making some in the future
