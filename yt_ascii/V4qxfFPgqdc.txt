everyone's really excited about virtual reality the oculus is just around the corner i guess that one's waiting to get them for easter or perhaps next christmas and so i thought it would be interesting to kind of broaden out the discussion of virtual reality a bit and put it in context think about how it relates to augmented reality and a few other ideas and so more broadly that means introducing the topic of mixed reality about vrn ar and all these kind of buzzwords so tell me what what's mixed reality well yeah to tell you what mixed reality is i really need to draw you a picture i think that's the only way we're gonna get through this and so this is a picture that was proposed by couple of researchers called milgram and casino back in the early 1990s and they called it the reality virtuality continuum lovely name bit of a mouthful so i'll just call it mixed reality if that's okay mixed reality continuum and if they're watching i hope they'll forgive me here is the universe of mixed reality and to understand what this line means it's a good idea to look at the end points so first of all at this end we'll call it physical reality or everyday reality this is the everyday physical world actually ideally if you went back to pre 1950 no computers no digital okay just as it was so if i put where we are now in this office we're we're actually kind of probably sitting here because inescapably we've got some phones and there's some digital stuff going on in the background to vote at this end is broadly physical stuff let's get to the other end here's virtual reality in the sense that virtual reality is an illusion you're trying to give someone the sense that they have left the physical world behind and being transported into a digital world created by the computer and they've become immersed in this world so that's things like oculus rift and is it at that end i've gotten cut out pictures that i've carefully prepared over breakfast this morning so let's kind of position some technologies here is our soon to be friendly oculus rift that everyone's excited about so we thought but on a head-mounted display and so the physical world is blocked out and the digital world is introduced and you hear it as well the head mounts have been around since all seventies eighties i'm sure someone will correct me on that so here's an earlier picture of a head mount from 20 years ago and they're wearing some data gloves that are tracking their hand movements and kind of various other things i think it was 1994 that computer weekly was telling us that vr would be a mainstream phenomenon within three months so take your take from that what you want and here's a simulator this is a car cynicism other way of doing vr and i know you've talked about caves computer file so there's all these kind of gubbins that's about getting people in a virtual world and i'm going to position this here so that's not right at the end of that no it's not is it what would be right at the end of the line i guess right at the end of the line would be taking your brain out of your body and putting it in a jar and wiring it into the computer directly or possibly even turning you completely into an ai or some other sci-fi thing so clearly you can go beyond things like the oculus and you can have more tactile interfaces that are prodding the whole body or whatever and in science fiction you can imagine how you completely remove someone from the physical world so yeah i wouldn't quite put the oculus at right at the end of the picture i don't think that's given us a sense if you like of the two end points the two extremes there's some interesting things that live in between those so let's talk about another thing that that people get very excited about i draw a line about half way then i'm gonna write augmented reality on this side of the line so why am i doing this because i think with augmented reality you're trying to give people the sense that they remain in the everyday physical world but you're introducing more and more digital stuff into that world and you're kind of overlaying it on the world as if it were connected or part of it and how far along the line you are depends on the technology you use so now there's a few others where all the way up somewhat correct me yeah i'll put it sideways let me not quite sure these microsoft hololens project that was talked to earlier this year which is a see-through head mounted display that tracks where you're looking and various other things so it overlays the virtual world on your everyday physical experience let's get the google glass in there there it is i think i'd be tempted to position it a bit further along the line here it's not quite as immersive in the digital sense you're kind of more in the physical world we can debate this but you get the point there's different levels of where you're on the line there's other things of course here's a mobile phone or a tablet that i'm holding up augmented reality style or somebody is and it's overlaying labels about the world so here you're kind of getting closer to physical reality but you're kind of you can position yourself along the line but all of these leave you in the physical world westwego next let's move a bit closer to physical reality and just complete the picture there so here you start to get a bunch of other stuff you get ubiquitous computing i might think that what ubiquitous computing is about is more and or embedding the digital experience into the everyday physical and you end up with her the latest incarnation people are talking about the internet of things for example he kind of lives in this space you know now your experience is really with everyday physical stuff like mugs but those mugs contain sensors and the digital is kind of hidden within them so you you're pushing the experience at this end now i'm probably asking for a fight here because the original definition of ubiquitous computing by mark weiser from xerox parc he wrote a fair bit about how it was sort of the antithesis of virtual reality and possibly mixed reality maybe that's okay i suppose i positioned it here quite a long way from it so so so maybe it is well there's a gap there's a gap kind of here and it's interesting thing what lives in this space then what is it where you believe you're in a virtual world but it's really quite connected to the physical and this is a kind of this is a milgram casinos concept of augmented virtuality i think the easiest way to think of it is it's virtual worlds that are made live that you're in a virtual world but the digital stuff you're experiencing is driven by real events in the real world that are being sensed possibly in real time or something that's close enough to real time that it has a feeling of being live so what could that look like well here's a few examples this is a one from quite a long way back one simple way of doing this is to punch video windows into the virtual world virtual worlds are made up of polygons or the textures on them and you can make those textures be a live video and then you can essentially have a window in the world where you walk up to it and you look out and you're you're looking into reality somewhere with this office or in this case it's a guy who's made his face live so his avatar his character's walking around the virtual world but with a video face yeah so you kind of punched a hole in virtual reality and you're looking out another way of doing it is essentially what google are doing with google earth so his the google car in that they are building a virtual world google earth that he's made by scanning the real world although they're currently not strictly live you know that they're live ish i don't know what the refresh rate is is a couple of years maybe i don't know how often that car comes down your street but but they are refreshing the world so it's on a very slow update it's just not on frames per second it's yeah millenia yeah frames per decade but as we get more and more drones or people mobile camera or whatever is going on out there then of course that refresh rate is going to speed up and we'll end up with a google earth maybe that's much more live and you can see some of this some lovely videos out on the internet that show things like plane data coming as you see these over europe and you can see you know it's still not real time but you get a sense that if you could track planes as they were flying you would actually see the journeys that are being made right now or whatever i think augmented virtuality perhaps doesn't feel quite with us yet but you can see some early glimpses of where we might end up in this spectrum so there's another kind of bit we can we can fill in we've drawn the picture this is that if you like the universe of mixed reality a lot of the technologies and certainly the underlying software techniques are actually quite similar here a lot of these involve being able to track people's movements and head positions and objects in a world a lot of them use graphics in different ways even the devices are quite common on we see headsets on both sides of the line but it's whether you can kind of see through them or not you know i think that things like augmented reality and virtual reality are not really different things what they are is different experiences of the same thing which is mixed reality it's tempting to think that you're in you know just one of these you're either doing augmented reality i've got my phone now or i'm doing virtual reality i've got my oculus on but actually there are experiences that mix them up and move between them in really interesting ways so for example like in the naughties group of artists called blast fearing maeda a really lovely game in which you could play it in in two ways there were a bunch of people who are on the streets of a city running around they had handheld devices that showed them a kind of a live map of where other people were in this game and they were tracked with gps and then there was a bunch of players who were online in a virtual model of the same cities they were logged in over the internet and they could see where the people on the streets were and the people on the streets could see where they were and then the two of them had a game of chase basically the people in the streets chase these people and as they went audio streams were captured from the people on the city and they kind of went out to the online players and the fun here if you're an online player was again it was not a nice example of augmented virtuality you could tune into the sounds of this person running through the city so you could hear the traffic and you could hear them being out of breath and then you could figure out things like okay the right game tactic is to work out where the hills are and if my avatar runs up the hill which doesn't hurt me at all this poor sucker is going to be laboring and i'll hear it and then so on so that's a lovely example of an experience that deliberately mixes up these and also you could head out of gain territory and think about other situations so let's think about them so my colleagues have worked on emergency and disaster management where you've got a big command and control problem so with disaster management you've got people on the ground yeah out there in the field who are trying to rescue people or you know solve problems wearing whatever got handheld devices or possibly even kind of heads-up displays but also you've got people back at base in a control room who are trying to coordinate get an overview of the effort so you know any that kind of command and control situation is a classic example of where you probably want to mix augmented virtuality and augmented reality in some kind of more flexible way stealth and botnets usually go hand-in-hand because from the point of view of a cnc server it wants to ensure and some years ago it seems the nsa got a backdoor in one of these routers presumably because they got one of their people to get a job
