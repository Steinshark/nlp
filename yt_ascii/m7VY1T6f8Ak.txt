in this episode we're going to be looking
at the vector structs, which we use to store things like: positions, velocities and directions. when we're working in 3 dimensional space,
we need three values to define a vector - one for the x axis, one for the y, and one for
the z. this is called a vector3. when we're working in 2d space and no longer require
the z axis, we can switch to using a vector2 instead. let's take a brief look at vectors. say i
define a vector2 with an x value of -4 and a y value of 3. the usual definition of a
vector states it as a quantity having direction as well as magnitude, or in other terms, length.
we can calculate this magnitude using the theorem of pythagoras: so in this case the
magnitude is equal to the sqrt(-4^2 + 3^2); which is 5. to calculate the direction of
the vector, we have to normalize it. to do this we just have to divide both the x and
y values by the magnitude: so -4/5 = -.8, and 3/5 = .6; the significance of what we've
just done is that, if we calculate the magnitude of this direction: sqrt(-.8^2 + .6^2); we'll
get a value of 1. as a practical example of why this is important,
say we create a vector2 from the player's input. imagine the player is holding down
the left and up key, so we have an input vector (-1;1). now say we want to move the player
object a distance of 3 units in that direction, so we multiply this input vector by 3, giving
us (-3;3). we then move the player object -3 units on the x axis, and 3 units on the
y axis. but, if we measure the distance the player has moved, we can see it is about 4.2,
instead of the 3 we intended. the mistake we've made has allowed the player to travel
faster when moving diagonally. and its an easy mistake to make, so remember, if you
want to treat a vector as a direction, normalize it first. i find it helpful to think of a
normalized vector as fitting perfectly inside of a unit circle. our unnormalized input vector
with a value of (-1; 1), clearly lies outside the circle, whereas if we normalize it by
dividing it by its magnitude - that being root(2) - it will have a value of approximately
(-.71;.71). now because vectors conveniently define an
x, y, and potentially z value, we use them in programming to define, not only directions
and velocities, but also simply a point in space.
say we have a vector representing the current position of the player object at (-4;1), and
then another vector representing the position of an enemy object over here at maybe (2;3).
now if we were to subtract the enemy's position from the player's, we'd end up with a new
vector of (-6; -2). considering this new vector as a position would be quite meaningless,
however considered as the displacement between the player and the enemy, it can be very useful.
its magnitude is the distance between the two, and if we normalize it, we get the direction
from the enemy towards the player. both of these, of course, are very useful to be able
to calculate. the vector structs - vector2, vector3, and
even vector4 - already exist as part of the unity library, which we are given access to
by the line 'using unityengine' at the top of our code. all the same, we're going to
be creating our own rudimentary version of the vector3 struct, just so we have a better
understanding of what's going on when we use vectors in our code. now you might be wondering what a struct actually
is. structs are similar to classes, in that they act as a container for some code. there
are some important differences between the two, but we're going to worry about those
in a later episode. i like to think of structs as a way of grouping related variables together
to form a single, custom variable type. say for example we have an enemy class, which
needs to keep track of a vector for its current velocity, and a vector for the position the
target its chasing. we could have six float variables: 3 defining the velocity, and 3
defining the target's position. by creating a vector struct, however, which groups together
these x, y, and z floats, any time we need to represent a set of 3 numbers, we can simply
use this custom vector variable. inside the vector struct would be a bit of
code called the constructor. we'll talk about this in detail when we look at structs properly,
later on the series. but this basically enables us to set the values inside the vector by
writing = new vector3(3,4,5); we can also get or set the values of the x
y and z axes individually by writing, for example, velocity.x = 5;
unity's implementation of the vector structs also contain handy methods for doing things
like getting the magnitude of a vector, or the normalized value of a vector. as a last note, i would like to talk about
what sort of operations are defined for vectors. we can multiply a vector by a number, which
has the effect of multiplying each of the individual axes by that number. the same goes
for division. we can also add two vectors together, which
simply adds the like axes together. x + x, y +y and so on. the same applies with subtratction.
these are the only basic operations that are defined for unity's vector structs. multiply
or divide a vector by a number, and add or subtract two vectors. fancier operations like
the dot and cross product, we will discuss in a later video. for now, we've learned some of the basics
about vectors and how they are represented in unity, so next video we will be able to
use this knowledge to do cool things like, make a cube move around our game world, and
have a sphere chase after it. i'll see you then.
