i don't often find myself truly envious of console gamers but today i am because the playstation vr2 headset is just plain better and i don't mean better than the google cardboard that you have next to your tissue box i mean that in some ways it is better than anything that you can buy for pc gaming at all what an oled screen so bad this this one has it and the most impressive thing is the price the psvr2 comes in with specs better than a valve index at a price that's closer to a meta quest too meaning that for the 30 million of you who already own a ps5 you're ready to leap head first into the world of high fidelity vr gaming at an unprecedented price that is as long as you want to play one of these games yeah out of the gate it's got some downsides and as a pc gaming and vr lever you better believe i'm going to be looking for them with an extremely critical eye but if they can sell it to me they've got a winner on their hands which wait that's not a winner that's our sponsor big thank you to the ridge for sponsoring this video hey get rid of your old bulky wallet the ridge wallet will keep your pockets light and organized click the link below and use code linus to save 10 off your purchase and get free shipping the problem with comparing pcs to consoles is that it's never going to be quite apples to apples however there is one universal language and that's money so to level the playing field we took the price of a playstation 5 with its shiniest newest accessory and we put together a competent vr capable gaming pc with a meta quest 2 and a usbc tether cable now obviously there are other ways to skin this particular cat rift s headsets on ebay for example are looking like a nice little snack at the moment but given the wearable nature of a vr headset i can sort of understand if some people would feel that it's kind of like buying second-hand underwear so we opted for all new gear if you want new underwear by the way lttstore.com oh yeah yeah i haven't fooled around with the quest since the last time we did a quest video though to be perfectly honest with you oh my goodness i'm gonna be nauseated it's having a really hard time tracking right now is it the lights maybe the main reason i'm playing around with the quest 2 right now is just to establish a baseline for latency tracking as well as image quality because what a lot of people don't realize about the quest 2 is that type c connection is not actually capable of carrying displayport so it's sending all the display data over usb meaning that there's a lot of compression it really doesn't look that great even with the quality of the lenses on this headset especially when anything is moving quickly which with rhythm games like the one i'm playing right now is a major concern just haven't touched one of these in a while i wanted to hear the speakers and stuff still like the lightweight it's kind of shocking given that the brain is actually in here and the controllers are okay as long as you tape them closed so the battery compartment doesn't slip open all the time i appreciate how you wore that for like three minutes and already have a ring on your face yeah okay one sec oh what's happening before you proceed you want me to put on a playstation vr2 hat yes i mean sure if i'm gonna film an intro declaring this thing god's gift to gamers before i even get a chance to put it on i might as well wear the hat right out of the gate i was really impressed by both the weight of the headset itself and the thinness and lightness of the tether obviously removing wires entirely would be ideal but if you're stuck with them big difference having one that's not super heavy dragging off of you and there's lots of other things that show sony's experience here the headband for example expands quickly and easily with this button to fit even the largest of noggins and they've used a specially textured silicone rubber both at the back and at the front that's designed to a be comfortable b block light from coming in at the top above the skirt here and see not feel sticky in fact this is cute they put their little x square triangle circle icons here just like they did on the inside of the cover of the playstation 5. i like the feel of this the cushion is kind of two stage it's got a nice soft half inflated bike tire kind of feel initially and then if you go deep there's kind of a a stiffer but still cushioned component behind it really like that for the rest of the physical design this button adjusts the position of the headset itself so you can bring the skirt up against your eyes we've got ipd adjustment thank you it's physical right yeah oh thank goodness external cameras for pass-through and tracking power button microphone and easy access to the pass-through button so you can actually see your surroundings moving inside we've got a nice sanitary silicone skirt to keep light out we've got a sensor that tells the headset whether you're wearing it or not and it's far less obvious but there are ir sensors around the lenses here that handle eye tracking so that the psvr 2 can actually tell where you're looking and render in higher quality depending on what part of the scene you are actually focused on now what you won't find is any kind of integrated speakers which frankly is probably for the best because i pretty much promise you that they're included three and a half millimeter earphones are going to sound a lot better than what the oculus quest 2 has just go ahead and get this plugged in right and there we go you can really tell that this is not sony's first kick at the can but you can also tell that sony is a japanese company on the one hand it's not that hard for me to get a good seal on the other hand for comfort i really like to wear the headset as close into my face as possible and it is this is my nose well you know that thing where nintendo designed to ride for america that half of american men can't ride i think sometimes you know the designers are not the same shape as some of the users and that's okay i would still give it a solid b-plus for comfort which is saying a lot about any vr headset and i really like that i'm able to block out almost all the light here without any pressure against my face that's sick i'm gonna lose the hat though it's definitely going to be more comfortable oh i was aiming for that if you say that's a b plus yeah what is the quest 2 the quest who's okay b really yeah i think it's like a for the playstation and like c for the quest 2. i hate this thing i am just kind of used to it because i had a i had a vive before and it's a very similar mounting mechanism so i've spent a lot of hours in it moving on to controllers the award for best improved goes to sony they're super easy to tighten on your wrist equally easy to loosen really love that and wow they actually look like vr controllers with things like the ability to squeeze the grips here to close your hands and nice easy access to your dual joysticks as well as your circle x triangle square buttons really i can't say i have much in the way of complaints they are a little heavy people with large hands had trouble with the way it goes around them oh large hands being a bit of a disadvantage once again japanese design got it another little drawback of the controllers is that while they do support usbc charging they can't be charged while playing so while i don't expect most of you to be playing for more than the four hour battery life we would afford you but if you forget to plug them in after a session you might be hooped the next time you try to jump into vr for that reason i can see why sony offers this 50 charging accessory and honestly it doesn't seem like a terrible value considering that it's first party and probably decent whatever complaints we might have about the psvr2 controllers though they are nothing compared to the complaints we had about the pleasure ones of previous generation playstation vr experiences good riddance and goodbye enough talk let's give it a try i like the haptics it vibrates make sure you're holding your controllers yes yes yes mother you know what the pass-through is really good oh yeah i mean it's black and white like it sucks or whatever but it's very low latency it's clear enough that you can easily just like do things if you need to you know oh well i got hooked on a thing there but that wasn't that bad oh oh that oh i want oled screen so bad i can definitely see some rainbow effect on small white objects a little tiny bit of fringing i do wonder about the sub pixel arrangement i'm coming into this cold guys so you're having a rgb with me rgb sub pixels yeah okay if you go like this you should be able to see kind of like a smearing behind objects if you're on an lcd display not on this but that's not the highlight for me it's the deep inky blacks and the fact that going around like this there's so little in the way of motion blur or trails behind moving objects let's do horizon call of the mountain i'm really excited about this not only is this display extremely high resolution it's 2000 by 2040 per eye but i can already tell that compared to just about any other vr headset i've ever tried the screen door effect is almost negligible so that's the like the black spaces you can see in between the illuminated pixels and i was expecting it to be a little bit cleaner in terms of fringing because it does use an rgb subpixel layout but there is still some and honestly i think that just comes down to the fact that fresnel lenses these kind of ringed lenses they're just not perfect okay all right so let's oh this is pretty unforgiving okay rob does this ever look good though wow like i feel like obviously the you know that this is a grass texture as opposed to an actual grass thing but like you could just like you just you want to interact with it you know what i mean does this support hdr yeah the way the sun and the shadows just oh man having that experience you know where you feel like you're oh well okay the wall also came up but you know you feel like you're actually looking over a cliff foreign okay okay tell me this the eye tracking theoretically is boosting the graphical fidelity where i happen to be looking and lowering it elsewhere i thought i would probably notice something like that oh i'm gonna i'm gonna go super obvious you don't even need to hold on hold on wait what really yeah it's so obvious on this display where you were looking where am i looking at the triangle lee chummy on the right side of the screen shut up the fern that's like halfway down the thing stop no i can't tell alex i can't tell it's super obvious like the stuff that you're looking at especially when you're looking out past something yeah it's like super clear there and then everything around it's blurry wow that is so cool here i can't tell because you're just looking at stuff but like you say this is odd i can't see it at all it is super obvious ly can you see changing yes because our eyes are supposed to be so good at seeing motion why can't i see when things are shifting like is it just sharpness yeah it's like sharpness and like the resolution of the textures wow okay okay where was i supposed to go oh that is very nauseating for me oh yeah this game just oh absolute puke town especially for like it's probably a lot of people's first vr experience and they are just gonna just puke all over the place okay okay oh oh i feel like the world is falling away from me right now oh okay more really yeah oh seriously i have to eat all right stop i don't know if this is my favorite game ever but boy do i ever like this headset whoa hi there oh i'm okay it's not always grabbing an arrow for me here now one disadvantage to inside out tracking that is using cameras on the front of the headset to track where your hands are is that if you play a game like say for example hollow point or this one that requires you to grab arrows out of your quiver it's relying temporarily on just the gyroscopes that i assume are inside the controllers and those drift so you can end up with inaccuracy and then it'll kind of like freak out a little bit when it comes back within range of the trackers as it corrects it it's just the nature of the technology and there's nothing you can really do about it overall i wouldn't describe it as terrible but when things are fast paced the last thing you want is you see that did you see how my hand drifted there look at these apples yeah i'm i'm trying game look at this oh how did i manage to bite it there i want to eat the core some people eat liqueur you're in a dystopian future and you're gonna leave that much apple unbelievable if i had to guess i'd say it's not running at 120 hertz but it's definitely running at a smooth 90. no it won't let me jump off the edge i try oh i didn't try that hard apparently yeah there's no jump button as far as i can tell okay sorry sorry sorry all right let's try something different i want this display on my index and i want it so clean why can't i break things oh well supercharge this plant's ability to grow that t yeah that's what a cup against a flower sounds like welcome to the star tenders academy oh my god it's riley yeah i knew i knew i'd heard of this game for a reason and i am delighted to inform you that your application was head and tentacles above the tens of others we received awesome now these do a pretty good job of blocking sound but alex you're 100 right they are not the best in-ears i've ever heard quality fine but sound stage yeah it just everything sounds like it's coming from inside my skull okay i mean that's probably enough of this anyway yeah something notable is that while sony is plugging into a usbc port just like we did with the metaquest 2. it's not using the usb protocol i'd be able to tell because there would be compression artifacts and blocking all over this and there is not it's clean it's got to be displayport over usb or something like that it could also be hdmi i guess oh it's right on drive that yeah sure makes perfect sense oh i need to hold on all right well i'm inside the car can you guys see what i'm seeing not bad field of view it's 110 degrees not the best not bad i don't want to even focus on what i'm doing i just want to look around in the city while i'm driving you know what i found was really good was that i was able to focus a lot further down the track than i can with other vr headsets yeah it's just because the resolution is so high and the screen door effect is so low i did find it not quite as far down the track as i would have want but like on the rift s i had to do the ipd like super weird so i couldn't even focus on stuff that was close to me so that's because on the rift s i don't think the ipd adjustment is true ipd adjustment it's software ah oh man those headlights in the mirror behind me it's not the brightest display ever but the hdr effect is very very believable same thing with this little blue led on the console in front of me like it's annoying not in a i can't play this game kind of way but in a it's realistic kind of way you know [music] reflections on this car like what are those reflections being rendered at like 30 fps yes they are huh i wasn't even like noticing that though just ah it's so pretty hi the cold hard truth is as much as we might try there's no way to make an apples to apples comparison between this and any pc vr experience whether it's a more budget oriented one like the quest 2 setup that we've got here or my index setup at home there's trade-offs right on the one hand neither of those pcvr headsets has a display that even begins to touch the one in the psvr too but right now the experience is available on the playstation 5 are fairly limited compared to the vast library of games that you have access to on the pc that also ignores the additional utility of a pc it doesn't just do vr it also does well okay this can run solidworks yeah that i was going to say 2d gaming but it can do all kinds of other things it's just that back to that gaming thing the inconvenient truth here is that it's just plain not as good at it either in 2d or in vr as the playstation vr2 not for the price anyway it also took me like eight hours to set this up that was like four so as much as it pains me to say you know what yeah i'm gonna wear the hat at least until i get a good oled headset on pc then sony would have a very hard time getting me back just like you're gonna have a hard time not loving this segue to our sponsor bessie do you ever struggle figuring out what to wear in unpredictable weather
