ladies and gentlemen at long last it is my pleasure to welcome you back to another episode of elo swap elo swap is a series that i started about a year ago where a lower rated player plays some games on chess.com against higher rated opposition make some mistakes gets a worse position and then i would take over and either save the game or maybe even win it save it meaning draw it now i only ever recorded one episode with the person actually who's sitting right next to me and staring at me it just just so happens to be my wife and she's around a thousand 1100 strength and we're back on vacation and we're gonna bring back the series and record episode number two you hyped outstanding she's extremely good they're gonna think that you like hate me and you're being awesome we're being held hostage right now in the mountains of europe yeah anyway we have two subscribers who volunteer to play and she's gonna play and she's gonna beat both of them and i won't even have to take over but this is kind of like to show how a higher rated player would take over in a position and maybe defend or convert or something along those lines both players know they are playing a higher rated player don't do this if you're actually like sitting at home and you know sneakily magnus is playing on your account or something but these games are unrated both people have been informed that you know they're going to be playing against me at some moment in this game and this is mostly for instructional purposes account sharing is frowned upon and not allowed and yeah first game should start in a second the internet has been a little bit weird here in my hand is hovering over the mouse i'm ready yes i understand i have like mildly disconnected from chess.com but hopefully we should have a there we go nice first game is in let's just make sure the the crop is good i have horrible internet we're about to disconnect i have one bar here from that oh my god oh this is so scary oh this is really scary oh no i'm not gonna play my gambit okay i know a very cool gambit that you don't know me or no the audience okay i gotta move fast yes blitz i guess i'll hang out like here so okay i'm kind of on camera okay you're playing the juravlov counter gambit obviously who doesn't know that see my opponent is stunned already oh all right we trade no problem so far so good so far it's going incredibly well you can explain your thought process oh i have none the only opening i learned with black well that's not a true statement i know the england gambit and i proceeded to forget so see that move does nothing his move yeah okay i'm not afraid are you afraid let's go here because if he takes i'll take and i'm kind of attacking his queen so he'll be forced to move it i know i'm right can you click this icon which icon this one yeah just real quick okay i just want to make sure i'm in the camera pane okay and click on the outside on the outside okay yeah yeah very complicated this is very good we're on a laptop recording and i i usually have more monitors than that all right what does that do if anything absolutely nothing well he's trying to remove my attack on or my defense of this oh oh okay okay i know i know i know i will not let him spook me explain that move to me i wanted to maintain my defense of this pawn okay and so if he takes my knight i can take back and i will not lose this pawn for free very nice okay now now chad has to guess my elo or comments sorry sorry it's okay oh man the travel setup is okay well that's a clear that's a little huh i just move nice i think he's more spooked than i am because he doesn't know who he's playing correct yeah while the players have been informed that if they achieve a very very good position that i will swap in at some point right but we also deliberately didn't tell them who they're playing and how strong i am she's trying to castle i'm trying to remove this really annoying bishop i'm contemplating this move or this move yes let's go here no put it back jadoob okay i'm gonna go with my first first first instinct did i use it well yes you should do it it's fine i'm not afraid if take then take then take then take he won't take i have many attackers my husband is gone so but opponent is still spooked i don't know if you're here mumbly russian in the background oh my god he's just going after my horse but that's all right because i take those were our those were our hostage takers they told us that our laundry was done that was pretty nice that was that was grandma letting us know that pretty nice hostage if they do our laundry i invited her to the video but she said she's too high rated to play elo swap your grandma is a very talented lady thank you that is there is no doubt all right what was the idea there the idea there is that i wanted to open up my bishop okay huge [music] i think it would be really pog if we made some trades you know because before the world invented money they traded goats so we're gonna trade some pawns okay you know that's how it worked for corn you have i want you to go oh i just did i hang that wait wait wait oh i absolutely did well you have the option by the way you can keep fighting or oh i'm gonna i'm gonna keep playing okay he's not that good i was just a lucky oh he's incredibly lucky okay this this pawn i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna go here it's like you wordle i was i don't know how you consistently get the word in two tries because you're just oh he did not take anything else with mine all right okay okay i'm gonna do a very basic one move attack which is no hang on here here seems okay oh no i'm catching up to his this time yeah it's not it's not very good you're kind of blocking me oh sorry that's okay sorry it's okay you can be your channel for this i didn't realize it was your video it's our video you can yeah but the mic is blocking my half of the boards that's why i'm so close to the camera oh i see i'm too short did you move he moved ah but okay what do you think about a queen trade i think it's a very bad idea because i'm down material oh but at the same time you know what you know what i'll just put it here yeah still want to protect my pawn okay i'll just put it here you have the option to to tag me in at any moment okay i mean preferably before a checkmate in one happens that would be checkmated one is played and then you're like oh husband sub in and then if you lose it lose it's your problems yeah if if i take or whatever he's gonna open up his rook which i do not like at the moment i can sub in now if you want no no no no no no okay it's kind of the point of the series but okay okay let me make one more move yeah okay i'll go here i'll go here okay okay now it's my turn now it's your turn oh i just realized the problem with that one yes you lose your pawn right you want to swap like you you okay yeah we can't okay can i see you you can do what i did we can pan the camera a little bit there we go you good you good with this i'm good yeah you should have i mean that was a really good move by the way f4 all right so oh this is tough let me yeah you did you did you you actually had like a big advantage from the opening i think all right if he finds one of these night jumps that's gonna be really bad oh he doesn't know that you did no but i told like i told the players like when they get a winning position they should expect but do you trust them to know that they got a winning position maybe maybe up from the minute he got a winning position and also i would be subbing in yeah all right we're gonna activate the rook the probably the only chance we have here is to keep as many pieces on the board as possible and try to avoid big exchanges so this move i don't like it he should have went in here because now he gave up respawn yeah so his queen used to guard the spawn he should have went in a move ago he should have went queen d6 should have done this and try to trade and try to cause me more problems he should look for a queen trade and he should also look to attack my king right now he has a he has a very bad mechanical problem here like he can't move his knight he can't move his bishop and if he puts one of the rooks to defend then i can just go after the rook not there though what's the problem with bishop here high five very nice okay yes except the night in the beginning of the game that was on purpose i understand okay so now i go here the rooks see each other his rook is hanging and this is hanging if this was not yes so if this was not a check i could actually throw in taking there now he probably should go here if he finds that move i'll be kind of mad but that's life and i can't really move my queen anywhere because then he's gonna take my bishop so this is a really good defensive move because it's also an offensive move this pawn at four by by our opponent was really good okay now i can start maybe going for his king whoa whoa see like he he weakened his back rank that was king has to come out and that's very scary oh so that's a free pawn yes this is a free pawn this is also a free pawn that's unfortunately not checkmate although i really wish it was i gotta like also worry about this maybe i go for his rook maybe i do bishop e4 i'm doing this because it's like again you're always monitoring your king but i'm trying to make sure he feels really uncomfortable like okay so he counter-attacks my queen but now that doesn't hit that anymore this is a very tense position maybe i bring my queen all the way back but i really don't want to bring my queen all the way back just take the free pawn i guess yes you're a bad influence though wait what don't listen to me you're you're right actually it's i i really shouldn't be taking the free pawn all right let me hang out here let me hang out a bit closer to my king because again he has all these different ways to get in and also time is of the essence now it's a blitz game like you're playing a blitz game so you have you have to play fast efficient moves look at this he's sneaking in he's trying to sneak in he's trying he's trying to cheese a little bit so now what we're going to do is we're gonna make a little left this is a big like this is a very sneaky move you got to be very careful at this level always look for checks he still does it he did it and he hangs his queen backwards you see he was trying to open up my king but he completely forgot about my rook and like spotting this is part of being okay he goes for my queen so i'm gonna rotate check his rook is hanging his bishop is still hanging now his king is hanging of course i go for the rook and now he's totally losing i didn't even have to swap in i was playing the whole thing the whole time now very easy just simple simplify obviously i mean i should have moved my bishop there but i now just go for his pawns and don't and don't hang a fork this is exactly why we made this series by the way because like it helps you with just kind of understanding like the level difference right i kept the tension i kept pieces on the board i took advantage immediately i'm gonna give him a check i took advantage of the tactical opportunity presented and i'm just gonna go make a second queen unless i disconnect and he wins anyway nothing he can do yeah nothing he can do he doesn't have enough firepower we're actually lagging a little bit because we're on european mountain wi-fi but that's okay i told everybody like we're in the european mountains so they're trying to guess where we are in the world i see somebody okay two queens this is gonna be very easy now that's maiden one yes very impressive so that was okay what are we at we're at like 15 minutes recording that's really nice so your opening was fantastic like you didn't know anything that you were doing this is also not the opening that you play i understand that i didn't want to play the england gambit and i don't remember the king's indian so you put scandinavian yeah yeah i think feel like you might have had a little like nerves that's correct because you don't you so you usually play this yes but you were like i'm gonna play e5 and then you just developed and you did normal stuff which is good like you i'm saying this is good because you don't you don't know this opening and you got a completely good position this was a great move here you actually could have already opened up but you decided like to respect his threat of bishop takes knight yes this was fine it's not like the most accurate or whatever but in general you should probably step out more so your rook always can go here this was fine though like you should try to be a little more active if takes takes you have takes yeah fork but if takes takes which pawn should you take back with to defend this the d-pawn yeah to open up the queen take take take boom now you win a pawn all right okay see so you can't the way he did it was not great and then that this this was the best move on the board i think his top engine move c6 top computer movement because you're fighting back for the center this was the right decision okay this was good i'm complimenting you you should i and d5 was actually i think also the top computer move by the way but after this you had to develop the bishop you said it was to develop the bishop that would have forced the queen to move and then you could have taken back for example bishop here here you can play like here you could also do this now because of this what do you take i take night yeah and then you yeah so you blundered i mean you made two blunders and then he played okay this was not this this was not a huge blunder but yeah his move at four here is a ridiculously good move to open up this one last thing how do you keep the center closed here push the pawn yes high five i thought about that but i was like if i push my pawn it's very isolated it doesn't have a defender keeping the center closed was better okay then isolate upon because this is like really really bad situation for black all i did here was i tried to activate my pieces his best move was definitely to try to trade queens i decided to do this and he was already in some serious like trouble he had to play very accurately his last moment was right here he had to play probably some queen move although i'm pretty sure i have rookie eight yeah i was going to continue to try to attack these loose pieces that's all i was trying to do just like loose pieces if i if i don't target those loose pieces he's gonna lose sorry i'm gonna lose like i i just i have nothing else and he got his king a little weak he tried to cheese he went for like a big cheese here one important move i played was bringing my queen back look top computer move making sure i because if i go here he has this which i think wins on the spot because that threatens mate mate this and that oh wow so i just that's the move that i was trying to prevent right and that that was what went into my decision i just had a great idea what we should do reverse elo swap one day like i start a new finish yeah but then okay like i get a good enough position then you convert it reverse elo swap yes okay perhaps one day i don't know i feel like okay it'll just be funny watching the lower rated player throw i eat you i'm gonna get the winning position okay i have a crazy idea okay why don't we end episode two here and we record the next game for episode three that's like a pretty okay because i feel like 20 minutes is nice yeah so they can stay tuned for episode three which will drop in a few days no problem okay terrific we'll end this recording now and then you're this is gonna continue but it'll be episode three you don't have to explain to them okay okay bye bye see you in episode number three this was very fun hopefully it was very useful for you to understand how to fight back from a worse position and avoid one movers and watch episode three which will be out very soon
