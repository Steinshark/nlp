ladies and gentlemen in today's video you will experience something that we don't get to see very often in the world of chess and that is magnus carlson losing a chess game but it's not quite what you think many people have defeated magnus carlson in the past but when has magnus carlson defeated magnus carlson in the past and i might confuse you but that's good because your interest is captivated you would like to get to the conclusion of this video which i will bring you along this journey you will laugh you will learn something and it will be a pleasant viewing experience and for those of you that are watching this video over the last few days here in july june 2023 you will know i have been traveling if you're watching this in 2024 none of this means anything to you but right now i have left the house for the first time in like 27 years of living and i'm traveling a little bit and today i actually encountered some very cool people on my trip i was at an airport and i just want to give a shout out to josh who i met him at a couple of other people who never gave me their names took some photos very very cool to be traveling the world and chess fans coming up to you because i'm used to it in america 30 to 35 percent of my viewing audience is from the us let me know where you're from it still blows my mind every single day that people watch chess from all over the world and it's really crazy to be getting recognized in tiny airports around europe this was not designed to be an intro where i tell you about being famous that's not really the point it's mostly to tell you that i still am not really used to or prepared for this and i just want to thank you all for playing chess allow me to show you how magnus carlson defeats magnus carlson now you may have already noticed that that says levon aronian yes magnus is currently playing in a tournament called the global chess league it's an indian organized tournament being held in dubai it's an esports style team event and today magnus very cleanly and wholeheartedly defeated himself in a game of chess without further ado here we go on to b3 magnus plays the nim so larson opening he's looking to fight for the center with his dark squared bishop he'd like to play e3 knight f3 as well sometimes f4 and sometimes you go back to more traditional setups levon plays pawn to d5 the move b3 is a high pressure move for black because black basically has a cornucopia a plethora of options if you will on the first move have you ever been to a restaurant or a deli or a store and there's like 47 options and they all look good that's the way it feels like playing against the nim so larson levon plays d5 and then he develops his knight to f6 magnus plays knight f3 he could play the move e3 he could play the move knight f3 there is i think literally no difference between the two moves i think the move knight f3 in some cases can dissuade putting your bishop out so for example knight f3 bishop f5 e3 e6 you can play like knight h4 you can try to like go for the bishop but i don't know i i don't think there is any difference between these two moves and levon plays a move bishop g4 bishop g4 is an extremely provocative move it's a provocative move for two reasons number one the bishop is just the target for the pawn like it's much more common in my opinion to play a reverse london because the london is good with both colors don't clip this and put it on anarchy chess but if you have an opportunity to go for this type of setup with wider with black you'll probably be fine i also made a video called magnus carlson crushing gms with the london system which shows you how to play the london like a very strong player go find that video go comment on the video here from the gotham video of magnus beats magnus i always enjoy seeing those comments the second reason why this move is very provocative is not just this it's also knight e5 it's also knight e5 it's also that the knight can jump into the middle and immediately hit the bishop but black is basically arguing that this is a waste of time because then you will just immediately get that knight targeted and the knight can't actually do any damage on its own so e3 magnus volunteers himself for a pinning e6 magnus is not going to be playing knight e5 he can play c4 d4 bishop e2 those are his next few moves he chooses h3 which is one of the reasons why i told you the move bishop g4 is extremely provocative because if white wants to get aggressive and create a position that has a lot of imbalance he's going to do that you can't really do that with the bishop on f5 bishop h5 this is not a trade that white the black wants right now because white will go here you don't want to give up a bishop for a night unless you are getting something tangible that you can explain in return and in this case you are getting absolutely nothing tangible in return like literally nothing you can argue that the queen has left so then i can go here here here maybe that will work against somebody 2829 points lower than magnus it's not gonna work against magnus bishop h5 doesn't take on a three now magnus can once again play bishop e2 d3 excuse me d4 c4 freudian slip he plays d3 which is definitely a weird move right it's definitely a weird move he thought for 20 some 30 seconds about it he gained 10 seconds back plays the move d3 blocks his own bishop but he wants to put the bishop on e2 maybe he wants to put the bishop on g2 so he's okay not going this way he's also okay not blocking in this bishop this bishop this bishop there we go i drew the diagonal correctly he's h6 the idea of h6 is to be honest with you i have no idea what just kidding if black had just developed with something like c5 the idea of this was actually to block this bishop's activity and then to go here and then take the bishop that was the idea you see if magnus had just gone for that with something like g4 and this black would go here potentially and the well the computer is claiming that this is wrong because apparently you can weaken your king but from what i understand magnus played d3 to probably stop that and then g form knight to e5 and life is good now we have the exact same plan but aronian has played the move h6 in this position and he's done it in order to play bishop to h7 okay place bishop to h7 and gets the bishop out of the way otherwise he is just going to take a really big damage to his structure and that is not something that he would like so he goes here magnus plays an id2 lavon plays this so we already discussed this this move was played because you are trying to trade off the knight that white has put into the center of the board and you don't want white to exert any more pressure on the position and white takes black takes bishop g2 c6 rock solid light squared structure right so the bishop is staring at nothing the bishop is also staring at nothing it's a very very kind of boring position but we're gonna see if magnus can do typical magnus things and win the game but the video was called magnus carlsen defeats magnus carlson right this magnus defeats magnus i don't know what i named the video i think i named it something along those lines i'm still deciding as i'm recording this and magnus plays queen e2 he can castle this way he can castle this way he can play f4 he can play e4 he can play c4 he can play all of these different moves and black does the same queen c7 so far so good i mean really nothing special the bishop is staring at this pawn which is making it a little bit difficult to develop the bishop here but that's life and now magnus plays f4 just trying to take a bit of space the move f4 of course weakens some scores behind the pawn every time a pawn moves some squares a week behind it that used to be strong but it's taking a little bit of equity in the center black and of course still castle queenside but he chooses to play the move f6 the move f6 has one very very clear idea and that idea is to disallowed the bishop from seeing g7 that's it i mean black basically just wants to play a bishop move now he could have played something like rook g8 this is also fine but i guess levon just didn't want to be honest but that's it actually i think he just didn't want to i think the move f6 also has an auxiliary idea which is to play the movie five like you cannot play the movie five if you play rook g8 if you play the move e5 i will play f5 probably i can also maybe take and just below the center open so he plays f6 i mean the position is still like very boring it's not boring i mean it actually is the opposite it's like very tense but there's nothing really happening i mean it's a game between two grand masters where we still have a game and a half ahead of us right and both of them still have 14 minutes 12 minutes on the clock magnus plays castle's queen side levon can also play castles queen side and the position will remain very tense but first he chooses to play queen a5 and attack the pawn on a2 which magnus has a very easy response to which is king to b1 there is one very interesting line here where the computer just says you can sacrifice this pawn completely you could just lose this pawn i don't know why you would do that i guess you get a counter attack and if black does this you have like take this is not made because of this king b1 and i guess this this is actually way too powerful so you can actually play queen a5 e4 you can also play king b1 right well he's magnus play z4 yeah now black actually cannot take the pawn so black castles long and white now plays king b1 black can continue going over here to justify his plan levon a move ago right a move ago he played not a move ago a few moves ago he played the move f6 which blocks the dark scored bishop's view and allows him to play for e5 so seeing as though magnus committed his king he puts his queen on a5 then he puts his bishop on a3 and magnus plays bishop takes a3 magnus decides to play bishop takes a3 because he could preserve his bishop but i think he he doesn't like this he just really feels uncomfortable with the prospect of the dark square bishop having such a strong post on that square not to mention the potential drilling from this side of the board if magnus ever like takes on d5 he's just gonna get in a big world of trouble because this is going to open up this is going to open up knight c5 like you you can lose very quickly i mean knight takes d3 and and it's just mate i'm not saying magnus is going to lose like this but you don't want to get crisscross applesauce like this with the bishop on a3 just not smart so king b1 mission bay three and he takes the good news for magnus is that while the queen is very strong and while the dark squares are weak there is absolutely no way for black to get there the black knight cannot ever get to c3 it can never get to c3 because they get to c3 would have to go through b5 or d5 and the only forward move that you have for example is knight b6 and yes if i am really trying to lose i will allow you to get the knight to c3 but that's not gonna happen so magnus is completely confident here and he can turn his attention to marching forward it's a little bit unnerving that both kings are castled on the same side it makes it a little bit harder for white to play for something but magnus thinks for a little bit and he takes on d5 he decides to do this because it opens up the e-file i can't draw arrows while on vacation that's okay mildly drunk from from flying and if c takes d5 of course very easy you take the pawn then you probably win this one too so we have this so we have the exact same seven pawns we have the exact same material of knight and light squared bishop and both pawns that have been traded are e-pawns literally any move you make in this position maintains equality white can play rookie one knight f3 white can play root the other rook two you want i'm sure white can play queen f2 okay and that the very worst it gets to minus point one which is basically equal black might want to play a5 a4 maybe knight b6 knight c5 but there's no way that you can't do anything even if you succeed in playing a5 and then i play like here and you play a4 literally nothing happens the only way that i can lose this position is if i allow you to go here then i allow you to go here and then i allow you to go here and even then i will go there stop mate and i will continue the game with queen c1 okay like yes i'm obviously completely lost but it's not possible to lose this position so magnus plays rookie one lavon thinks for a bit and plays the move f5 he spends two and a half minutes on this move and it's not a great move because it's really relying on breaking through this side of the board f5 is trying to open up the bishop and it's trying to open up the f file and it's trying to play knight f6 that was the purpose of the move f5 if white plays g5 then black can play take take and maybe even f4 in some positions to reopen the position so magnus plays knight f3 he doesn't spend a huge amount of time it's it's back in levon's court he takes on g4 his time is ticking i mean he is spending a lot of time trying to open up the position and transform things and now he plays this but this plays directly into what white wants because white wants to play a five white wants to get rid of this bishop so levon now is losing a little bit of the grasp of the position in a slightly surprising fashion magnus spent some three minutes here it was probably because he was calculating queen d2 but also probably he was calculating queen e7 because queen e7 is not just an aggressive move it's an offer of a queen trade which would disallow the queen any attack so after this this this this this white has a very pleasant position where he pressures the bishop but i think magnus just decided he doesn't have enough of an advantage here like the position is pleasant but black will play knight f6 everything is defended you can play rook h1 but then i just play rook g8 take take if you play rook h6 i take on g4 it's just a draw we have the exact same four pawns it would be more impressive that lavon lost this with black than it would be that magnus won it so magnus thought and played the move f5 and again visually this position looks very very nice it looks like a very comfortable position it looks like magnus is going to go knight d496 it looks like he can play queen e7 i just said this queen trade could potentially have a devastating effect on the black position because it allows the rook in and then this and then this and then all the pieces are getting in very very uncomfortable so f5 levon fights back against the pawn on g4 but he is weakening some of these squares over here right now in this position magnus should play the very natural knight e5 it defends the pawn here it doesn't do a whole lot black will probably try to play for d4 and knight d5 but white can even sack the knight and if you do this i have queen e6 and then i have queen c6 if knight d7 i have queen c6 if rook d7 i have bishop c6 and this is still very nice for white the attack continues for white for sure but magnus thinks for a little and plays bishop h3 he loses a touch of his advantage but it's very clear what he wants he wants to go here he wants this defended he wants to open up this and now comes the moment you've all been waiting for which is magnus defeating himself in a game of chess what does that even mean right like how do you defeat yourself you lose the game by completely of your own doing not even a mistake not like a blunder not anything of that nature you do something that it was completely unnecessary that was essentially a health help defense i've used those words and i called it a health health offense help you you you lost the game almost on purpose like in this position again 95 was the best move maybe he had some knight d4 please bishop h3 completely fine and level one plays d4 we've discussed this already his idea was knight t5 and knight c3 this has always been his idea this has been his his idea since here i showed you like you have to find a way to get the knight so he does he played f5 he then proceeded to play knight to f6 and now he played d4 facilitating this journey now magnus can still in this position play queen e5 can play queen d2 can play queen e6 check and the point is that even if you play something very passive like this like this is capturable and if this c3 and everything is defended and queen b2 is coming and 96 is coming so everything is still okay but magnus goes g5 which was his idea but now levon can put the knight on d5 but he takes first he didn't have to take first but he takes first and now before he plays the move knight d5 because if he plays this now it looks really nice but this is very scary and then this is very scary and by the time the king runs away no more knight c3 queen v2 game over so bishop goes to g8 another piece has entered the battle knight d5 knight c3 and here with both players having two and a half minutes on their clock magnus played bishop to g2 and the idea of bishop to g2 was to do something very very simple it was to meet knight d5 with a capture that's it the idea was to play knight d5 bishop takes d5 and it doesn't matter if rook takes d5 to try to checkmate knight e6 if you take i get in if you play rook a5 trying to mate me i just play c4 you can unpass on me but then i take a rook you can do this but then i play queen e8 and actually it's me who's winning because i force a queen trade so bishop g2 knight d5 bishop d5 levon in this position played a very nice move rook d5 and the idea is very very simple the idea is if you play bishop d5 and i play knight d5 i win that's the idea you can't take on d5 because if you do i play knight c3 i get there so what you have to do here is you have to play again this queen move because it guarantees a queen trade magnus saw this move and f5 is not hanging not because i'm gonna go here but because i will win your rook which is a significantly bigger problem magnus certainly saw the move queen e7 he didn't miss queen e7 he has to trade the queens because it stops the attack his plan with bishop g2 was to play knight d5 bishop d5 lavon played here magnus took and then he resigned what but but he had like 100 seconds and the idea has been clear the entire game i mean from the moment the queen arrived on the a3 square we have talked about getting the queen some help like damien lillard in portland i don't know about the jeremy grant contract but hopefully it works out the queen on a3 just needed assistance to get to the dark squares levon's entire game plan revolved around getting the knight to the d5 square what happened this is what happened magnus had calculated that in this position he could play knight e4 and that stops knight c3 then i can't go there because it will get taken so he thought lavon would do this and then he would play here and then levon would move his king and run his king out and knight c3 would be a thing and after c4 here here here here magnus evaluated that he had better chances in the end game was he right yes plus 0.12 he was right if this sequence of moves had occurred his evaluation was correct but with limited time on the clock he had a moment of chess blindness after bishop takes d5 knight takes d594 black has absolutely zero obligation to pin the knight to the queen the move knight e4 in no way shape or form stops knight c3 because even if you take you lose that's it queen e6 i take queen 8 i take i move my king and it's game over magnus carlson from a completely even position in fact one that was a touch better for him calculates miscalculates and literally captures into checkmate and resigns it's news when magnus loses certainly but because of how great he is but it's just fascinating that even the best players in the world literally blunder checkmate which is exactly what he did because he thought knight e4 rookie 8 all of this he just forgot it's mate you lose so don't feel bad after watching this video when you boot up a chess.com game and you blunder checkmate or a queen or a rook or a bishop or all of those in the same game because even the best player in the world is more than capable of doing that it happens he went on a calculation none of it had to happen because black played knight c3 and none of this had to happen either he just took the rook and this is how magnus defeated magnus i hope you enjoyed i haven't showered yet so i'm gonna go do that and i'm gonna go walk around a little bit i can't tell you where i am maybe you can figure out from the stones behind me but we continue this hostage situation our captors have allowed us to change to a kitchen setup and probably this will change in a few days but for now at least we can make some food for ourselves get out of here
