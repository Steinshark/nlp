hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be learning about the very clever suspension used in the ford gt okay so first let's look at an animation of the suspension and i do apologize for the low resolution but i think this is a pretty helpful animation as far as understanding how the system works before we get into the different modes so this is a double wishbone push rod suspension so you can see the upper wishbone the upper a arm control arm right here and then the lower control arm right here and connected to that lower control arm is a push rod now that push rod as it moves up forces this rocker to rotate about this pivot point now this pivot point is connected to the springs as well as the damper so there's an electronically controlled spool valve damper this is the first time this has been used in a production car up here pretty neat little device and we're going to get into more about how this spring system works so there's a torsion bar spring system right here so that's the first spring and then there's another spring so this torsion bar rotates this right here so this rocker is connected to a spring a coil spring as well as a hydraulic actuator so as this suspension moves up and down as that push rod forces this rocker to rotate you can see not only does it rotate this torsion arm right here which is one spring rate but also you know compresses and expands this spring right here which is the second spring now what's truly unique about this suspension design is that there are two unique spring rates for each ride height so with the highest ride height both of your springs act in series so as that push rod acts upon that rocker it goes through the torsion bar as well as the coil spring and so the equivalent spring rate of these two springs in series is less than either one of these two springs alone and so here's just the equation for calculating that equivalent spring rate but basically what's important to know is that it's going to be less than just this torsion bar so then when the vehicle lowers itself 50 millimeters to its track mode where the ride height is 70 millimeters what happens is a hydraulic actuator locks this coil spring right here so that's no longer moving it's out of the equation completely and you just have this torsion bar which is a higher spring rate than these two combined in series and so why do you want this why would you want a higher spring rate at a lower ride height well at the higher ride height you're going to have more suspension travel this is going to give you a more comfortable ride it also could provide you with more mechanical grip but as you lower that vehicle and you get closer to the ground you of course now have less suspension travel so you've lowered your center of gravity you've improved your aerodynamics but you're now closer to the ground so you don't have as much suspension travel and so to compensate for less suspension travel you need to make sure that your spring rate is stiffer so that it doesn't bottom out so that's what they do and this torsion bar prevents that from happening so super clever you know as that core is going to reach these high aerodynamic forces these high down forces placed on it you want to make sure that that force pressing down on the vehicle doesn't you know press the vehicle down into the ground that the spring rate is high enough for it at that super low ride height which is ideal again for center of gravity and aerodynamic purposes for creating downforce but you don't want the of course the suspension to bottom out so firm spring rate for the low setting softer spring rate for the higher setting unique design to this ford gt super cool what they've done if you guys have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
