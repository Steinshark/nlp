the more people refer to the science the more you should suspect that they are engaged in some crazy religious activity this kind of wrongheadedness leads to all kinds of policy errors because people have focused on the satisfaction of asceticism it's very significant that in our lifetimes governments have got worse at dealing with disasters not better despite the accumulation of scientific knowledge we seem somehow collectively to be worse at scientific [music] thinking hello everyone watching and listening today i'm speaking with historian and author neil ferguson we haven't spoken before although i've wanted to for a long time we discussed the historical and deeply myth ological president of world-ending narratives how the global doomsday ethos abdicates local responsibility while empowering the elite class the outof control gigantism plaguing our administrative states today and how we might strive as individuals to deal with the genuine tragedy of life morally humbly and religiously so i was reviewing your book doom this morning and i've been wanting to talk to you about it for a long time i'm i'm very interested in the apocalyptic vision and its implications for political organization and and psychological organization as well and i thought i'd just start with a couple of comments to get us going the apocalypse in some ways is always upon us and you write about that in your book i mean because people might ask well why has mankind always been consumed at the narrative level with notions of the end of the world and the answer to that is at least in part because we always inhabit demarcated conceptual worlds and even embodied worlds and all of those worlds do come to an end and so the idea that there's a universal end is built into the fab of reality and it's something that we have to permanently contend with and so it's there as a lurking existential abyss but it's also there as a practical problem that we have to contend with and the grand apocalyptic visions the book of revelation for example are in part attempts to structure our apprehension of the what would you say the eternal apocalypse and to also help us determine practically and politically how that might be at least staved off although perhaps even managed more comprehensively and so i guess i'm curious like why did you why did your interests do you think coales around the conception of doom and it's been a couple of years now since this book was published how have your conceptions changed and and what did you learn as a consequence of investigating this narrative trope so deeply there's a great sketch in the beyond the fringe album which goes right back to peter kook and and dudley moore jonathan miller and alan bennett in the 1960s and the sketch is the end of the world and it's essentially a sect of millenarians who gather on a hill to anticipate the end of the world they have a long and quite amusing discussion about what it's likely to involve will will the veil of the temple be rent aunder and the the time comes they they count down to the end of the world and nothing happens and peter cook who's the leader of the sect ends the sketch by well never mind lad same time next week and i always thought that was very funny u because the end of the world has been consistently overpredicted by human beings for millennia we're fascinated by the idea the end of the world and i think it's for a slightly different reason from the one that you hypothesized we have the reality that we as individuals end to contend with that that's just one of the givens of of human life even for billionaires in silicon valley right now the end of their individual lives is inevitable and that's really the hard hardest thing to deal with about life that it ends and we also know how it ends we know what that's like because some time or another in our lives we encounter death the death of a grandparent a parent of a friend we also see things being destroyed we see buildings collapse or bridges we see fires consume areas of woodland so we know what dissolution looks like not just for us as individuals but we know what it looks like like for expanses of land or or edifices and i think we therefore infer the consoling thought that it's all going to go down in flames at some future date and and the great monotheistic religions have as one of their centerpieces the the end of the world it's it's there in islam as well as in christianity and i think it's also exciting i think we find the end of the world kind of in cinematic prospect which is why there are so many movies about it as well as works of science fiction so we're fascinated by the end of the world because it's clearly a spectacular prospect but it's also consoling to us we may die as individuals but everything's going down at some point and the issue is when so many christians at successive periods in the history of christianity have anticipated quite an imminent end of the world and and of course they're always disappointed like peter cook and dudley moore so so the consoling issue i mean the easy read on that i suppose is that the end of the world is the precondition for the establishment of an ever more glorious paradise and you can understand a consolation in that but you're pointing to a different kind of consolation i suppose which is it seems to me correct me if i'm wrong that something like shod and freud is that the fact that we end is easier to swallow if we understand it in relationship to the potential end of everything so i i don't exactly understand why you why you highlighted consolation i can see it in in the heavenly vision let's say post-apocalypse but you're you seem to be pointing to something else well of course religion offers an afterlife that will be better and resurrection in in the case of the the great monotheistic religions but don't think that's always what's in people's minds when they contemplate the end of the world i was very struck as i was researching the book how many times in the midst of a localized disaster individuals said it felt like the end of the world so when you're in the midst of a massive configration the biggest wild far in us history or when you're in london during the blitz when you were in the midst of some localized disaster it seems somehow consoling to say oh it's it's clearly the end of the world so i don't think it's just that people say and therefore i can look forward to being reunited with my ancestors in some happy afterlife i think there's just a sense that if everybody's going down that doesn't make it quite so bad as if it's just me well you know that there might be another element to it as well i mean i'm think i the the terminator movie series came to mind when when you were walking through your discussion i suppose in reference to the science fiction representations of the end of the world and all of our conceptual schemes when they encounter an obstacle undergo a collapse into a kind of chaos and then a potential regeneration and that's the st same as a stage transition in pedian child development and it's the same as the scientific revolution and every act of learning is is simultaneously the death of some set of preconceptions and there's pain in that which is partly why we don't like to have our ideas challenge but you know there's also adventure in it and part of the reason that people do go to watch movies like the terminator and the plethora of end of the of the world movies that do make themselves manifest is because i think we can see in the confrontation with cataclysm an adventure i mean that's what people are doing in a theater when they're watching the terminator series i mean it's it's a dreadful adventure but it's a total adventure it's completely engrossing and it might be that you could imagine and i think that this is part of the emphasis of the judeo-christian notion of ultimate sacrifice you could imagine welcoming the apocalyptic reality of the world with open arms being willing to undergo that adventure of continual death and transformation and that transforming it that entire death and rebirth process into something like the most exciting possible adventure i mean you know what what you do see in the biblical corpus there's always a wrestling with the apocalyptic reality of existence socially and individually and there is the insistence throughout the text that the appropriate way to deal with that is not to run from it or deny it but to really to the degree that it's possible to welcome it with with open arms now that's a very tricky thing to manage obviously the the death how do you welcome the death of everything with open arms but in some ways it doesn't matter because it's a reality that people have to face i think what's fascinating about the book of revelation is that it it it's so spectacular it it's an extraordinary visualization of of of a cataclysm and it's it's really very elaborate it's worth it's worth reading and trying to picture it in your mind and you realize that you would need the most advanced computer graphics to to realize it on a on a screen i think it's partly that you need a spectacular prelude for the kingdom of god to be plausible because the terrible truth about the kingdom of god is that it does sound quite dull i mean the reality about the the the saints and and angels and and god himself is that they don't really know how to throw a party and we need more than than that to excite us so i think that the apocalypse is attractive because it's so much more exciting than the ultimate outcome the utopian outcome of heaven now what's interesting about science fiction is that it really discards utopia there's some utopia in science fiction but most of it's dystopian and you gave the example of the terminator movie series that's part of a long tradition of visualizing an end of the world which is dystopian where an apocalyptic event occurs and all you really left with in the case of the terminator movies is a a pile of rubble in which a few surviving humans are picked off by killer robots the interesting thing to me about science fiction is that from its birth in the early 19th century as a genre it provides the apocalypse without the prospect of some ultimate reign of god and and the saints and we find that hugely exciting so the paradox at the heart of the book is that we spend a lot of time thinking about the end of the world of course environmentalists are the latest heirs to the millenarian tradition they love to say that the world is about to end it's in 12 years it must be now eight years and counting that's part of a long tradition where secular movements embrace often unwittingly religious ideas about the impending apocalypse and that's exciting to people so they're drawn to it greta tunberg is just the latest profit of the of the millenium and i i think that's a a very important reason to be skeptical about stories about the end of the world because while we spend a lot of time discussing the end of the world in its latest incarnation a catastrophic climate scenario we kind of miss the much more likely smaller scale mediumsized disasters the key point the book makes is we're getting worse at handling those so we spend ages talking about the end of the world endless conferences on climate change and the apocalypse and we utterly bungle or what was in fact not a particularly disastrous pandemic and we're we're going to bungle our way through some geopolitical disasters we're we're doing that right now i think that's the critical argument of the book and that's why the subtitle of the book is so important the politics of catastrophe the key argument the book makes is that that most disasters shouldn't be thought of as either natural or man-made disasters happen and then we as a species collectively bungle them or not and that's the the critical point disasters are in many ways politically determined even if their origins are natural so that's the argument of the book as a holiday season unfolds it's a time of joy gratitude and reflection in the midst of all these

the first is you you you interestingly pointed out that the dystopia and the apocalypse is more interesting than the the the subsequent heaven and that's the problem with socialist visions of utopia that people like dovi laid out in the late'00s know in in notes from underground dovi famously pointed out that if we did bring about the socialist utopia and he described that as the endless opportunity to sit in pools of bubbling water busy ourselves with the continuation of the species and eat nothing but cake that human beings would break it all into a chaotic mess at the first opportunity just so that something exciting could happen and so there's there's the problem with a a satiation v vision of heaven so that would be a vision where everyone has everything they need all the time is that precisely when when you do that with an infant or when you enter that state after thanksgiving dinner christmas dinner all you do is go to sleep there's no reason to be conscious consciousness demands something like an adventure and the classic vision of heaven does seem lacking in that it isn't obvious what you would do there so that's something we could delve into then you pointed out that one of the additional underground advantages to being an apocalyptic doomsayer is that you can i'm i'm modifying your argument slightly but that you can present yourself as the ultimate virtue seeking redeemer by claiming to be obsessed by nothing but large-scale disaster you can construe yourself as virtuous because of the depth of your concern and you can abdicate your responsibility to actually deal with less self-dramatizing problems with the less self-dramatizing problems that actually constitute problems you could solve and address if you put your mind to it in the real world you know and there's there's psychological reasons for assuming one of the things you see when people's lives go seriously astray is that they don't generally people generally don't run off a cliff immediately after doing brilliantly what happens is they make one error and then they make a more serious error and then they repeat that 10,000 times and then they're in hell and they're it was their failure to rectify the mini crisis all along the way that brings upon the apocalypse in their life and i do see a lot of that political posturing characterizing the modern world you know that people act out the role of world redeeming savior but they're not actually attending to genuine problems that are right in front of them that they could address if they acted responsibly and then the final theme you develop veled you said this is very interesting you said that there's that the notion of natural disaster in some sense is ill conceptualized because there's there's a ambiguity about whether when a disaster occurs it's a consequence of the hand of god say in the earthquake or the flood or the utter failure of the authorities to have prepared properly for a foreseeable disaster know i thought this very clearly when katrina hit new orleans because a hu and cry went up about the catastrophe of the natural disaster but you didn't have to dig very far before you realized that the reason that that hurricane was so devastating in new orleans was because well the dkes hadn't been maintained and they'd only been built to withstand a one in one century flood and that the entire infrastructure of the society was corrupt and so you know in in mythological representations in deep narratives there is an identity between the evil king and the wicked queen of nature they're the same thing and so if the king gets wicked enough the evil queen of nature arises and that's a representation of the fact that if your state is corrupt natural disaster will definitely make itself shown and that you actually can't distinguish there's no distinction between lack of preparation and a natural disaster in the final analysis and corruption and blindness facilitate that that nexus so the egyptians had a story it's the story upon which their whole culture was funded that the state corrupted that's osiris the state corrupted and became willfully blind as it aged and then it was overthrown by that's osiris is overthrown by seth who's the precursor of satan and then he rules so now the tyrant rules and then isis who's the queen of the underworld she's nature she makes herself known again chaos right with enough disintegration at the sociological level then chaos makes itself manifest again it's one of the most ancient stories of mankind playing out that dichotomy between the tyrant and natural disaster that you just described let me take those points in order if i if i can i think the the most interesting thing to me about fantasies about the end of the world about the various millenarian cults through history is that they are often accompanied by certain forms of of behavior that one might characterize as athetic so the aestheticism is an important part of many religious and secular movements so the the end is approaching the the apocalypse is nearing and therefore we should fast or perhaps even flog ourselves like the flagellant orders at the time of the black death and it seemed to me very interesting how many similar patterns one one could see in in our time whether you are preoccupied with climate change or systemic racism doesn't matter you should engage in some kind kind of atic atonement in advance of the great reckoning and and this i think infests a lot of of contemporary progressivism the desire to eat uh rabbit food to be constantly trying to eliminate things from one's diet the desire to engage in uh abstention from reproduction we mustn't have children because climate change is so cataclysmic and so you have these sorts of aesthetic behaviors which you can find in in medieval and ancient religion so i think that's an important first point the second point is that mythology of the sort you described in the case of the ancient egyptian myths makes a lot of sense if you imagine yourself living in the prehistoric or very ancient world life expectancy was very short individuals were extraordinary at risk from a whole variety of of premature forms of mortality and the natural world was deeply mysterious because there was no scientific framework for understanding anything the the fluctuations in the level of the river nile the periodic droughts that afflicted uh early agricultural societies and so you end up with ways of of making sense of an extraordinar cruel and capricious world so i think that's that's an important reason why myths persist they're deeply rooted in our in our premodern experience and i think that if one tries to think about our present predicament it's odd that such things have such enduring power over us because since the scientific revolution and the enlightenment we we have a much better handle on the challenges that a species like ours faces on a planet like ours so what's odd is that despite having really quite a good understanding of say infectious disease or the the ways that hurricans strike the eastern seaboard of the united states we seem to be getting worse at handling pandemics and hurricans and that's a really important argument that the book makes compared with the generation of the 1950s the generation of of the 2010s and 2020s seems really quite bad at disaster management in most western societies not only the united states and it's explaining that that takes us into new territory because i don't think you can explain the diminishing competence of the modern state without having a theory of its degeneration and that's something that that is a really important part of the book okay so i want to pick up on two of those topics so the first is you point out that as the apop apocalyptic vision predominates there's a turn to asceticism and then you describe we could say veganism and vegetarianism and well and the insistence by the environmentalists that we must engage in degrowth and that we must reduce our standard of living and and yes okay but there's there's a very interesting psychological rationale for that as well which is that if the old state of being has become corrupt so that's the old king and now we're threatened by its collapse then the proper thing to do is to engage in repentance and atonement because what you want to do is you want to offer up your stupid preconceptions to be destroyed so that you can rectify the corruption so that you can stave off the disaster and so now it's interesting a because with the millenarian and apocalyptic movements on the left you have a simultaneous insistence that all sorts of impulsive pleasure seeking licentious behavior should be centered and prioritized and celebrated but at the same time you have this insistence that there's a certain kind of aestheticism that's also necessary and i see in that as a psychologist i see that as a a proper mechanism of repair gone astray right is that well you should always be cutting back in this aesthetic way on your idiot excesses locally to improve the manner in which conceptualize the world that's the continual sacrificial offering of your own insufficiency and your own stupidity and that does renew the world and so but now we've got this dynamic where we globalize the apocalypse we view the end of the world we assume that nothing but a kind of universal asceticism and atonement will suffice that enables us to set local concerns aside as we already discussed and to act irresponsibly and maybe that's part of what's producing this inability to actually respond you know locally and effectively to genuine problems you know in in the old testament there's a the second commandment is to not use god's name in vain and what that means as far as i can tell is that you shouldn't claim divine motivation for doing things that are actually self-serving right you shouldn't attribute sacred motivations to your own to your own instrumental impulsive and self-serving behavior and then that's echoed in the new testament with the insistence that you shouldn't pray in public now if you take on the apocalyptic burden and you're virtuous only in consequence of your compassionate concern it gives you a perfect excuse to dispense with local responsibility and if you dispense with local responsibility then you're no longer able to engage in the concrete problem solving activities of the sort that you described i mean what did you conclude when you're i mean you have a chapter on developing political incompetence and also one on you know a sort of a belief in scientism and that seems to me to be part of your attempt to assess the local failure while we're concentrating on the global apocalypse and so what what do you make of that that concatenation of causal forces there are two things that that are going on i think one is is that the more people refer to the science the more you should suspect that they are engaged in some quasi religious activity because the notion of some settled body of knowledge called the science is is at odds with the reality of the scientific method which is a constant struggle to falsify hypotheses through experimentation during the covid-19 pandemic but i think predates it it was already going on and debates about climate there was a lot of spurious invocation of the science and one might as well have been saying the gods or the the deity because it was in fact quite un unscientific thinking that was going on i'll give you an illustration of this a great delusion is to imagine that we can prevent the rise of average temperatures by large scale asceticism in the west we must give up internal combustion engines we should give up eating meat and so on if we end up buying electric vehicles and solar cells manufactured in china with electricity generated by burning ever larger quantities of coal the probability of of reducing average temperatures is zero because that that is in fact the the the perfect illustration of of wrong-headed in in action if one accepts the premises of the debates on the causes of rising temperatures it makes no sense at all for us to behave this way our our asceticism will make no difference if if it manifests itself as increased burning of coal in china so that that's the first thing that's going on i mean like ger well or increased burning in coal in germany because that's what's happened with the green revolution in germany ex they shut off the nuclear plants and started up the li night so this this kind of this kind of wrongheadedness leads to all kinds of policy errors because people have focused on the satisfaction of asceticism the virtue signaling that comes with getting rid of nuclear power stations or internal combustion engines so there's a kind of generalized failure which embraces the policy elite to think rationally about the problems that we're trying to address the second problem which i think is just as important is the way the administrative state functions if you compare central governments today with their counterparts of half a century or 70 years ago they've become much larger they bloated in terms of the numbers of people employed they intervene in many more ways that an enormous there's an enormous corpus of regulation in all western countries and this administrative state unwieldy regulatory is very inefficient it's very bad at achieving intended goals and i that has to do with the way that bureaucracy works and the sclerotic tendencies that the modern state suffers from so between the science as a quasi religious way of thinking and the administrative state we have a very very dysfunctional approach to nearly all the problems that confront us and that is really the central argument of doom it's very significant that in our lifetimes governments have got worse at dealing with disasters not better despite the accumulation of scientific knowledge we seem somehow collectively to be worse at scientific thinking the holidays are rapidly approaching but we can find peace and calm in the craziness of the season

magnify the size of the bureaucrat state because you have to in order to deal with that apocalypse okay then because the state is so global and large and so central it loses its connection with the real world it has no subsidiary organization and then it flails about pointlessly now i'm going to walk through a couple of narrative representations of that and it'll tie it back to the imagery of revelation you might find this interesting so you see that dynamic play out in the opening chapters of genesis because what you have is the descendants of cain so cain makes improper sacrifices and he becomes bitter and resentful and he turns to technology it's cain's descendants that turn to technology first they build the first cities and then the city becomes corrupt it becomes corrupt in the direction of the tower of babel now the tower of babel is a zigurat right it's a it's a stepped pyramid and at that time the potentates of the middle east were competing to build the largest ziggurats they were trying to build towers to heaven to glorify themselves and that's the subtext of the tower of babel story so what happens is that an the ultimate tower of babel is erected to reach to the sky and that's a challenge to the supremacy of god and the consequence of that is that the cosmos the spirit of the cosmos the creative in producer of the cosmos makes all those who inhabit the tower unable to communicate with one another so they start to lose even the ability to share concepts and this structure collapses and it's because that tower of babel is too large it reaches too high it's too uniform and it's destined to failure of course that begs the question you know what's the alternative to that but i would say the entire remaining biblical corpus is actually an attempt to answer that question but it's very germine now that imagery is picked up again in the book of revelation so one of the central images in the book that i think is very relevant imagine that the book of revelation is trying to conceptualize the apocalypse as such the manner in which things deteriorate before the ultimate disaster and so one of the main images is of a seven-headed beast and on the back of the beast is the of babylon and what h it what it it's an image of a centralizing state a centralizing mon a monstrous centralizing state that's a good way of thinking about it with multiple heads with something like disin disin disinhibited lous as its partner that's the image and so the notion there is that when things deteriorate to the point where apocalypse is likely you have the construction of monstrous state likee apparatuses aligned with individual fragmentation down to the point of lous atomization that's a good way of thinking about it so you know you're you're striving towards it seems to me in your argument you're striving towards the hypothesis that there's something like an outof contr control gigantism that's that's a that's a causal that's causally related to the inability of these bureaucratic organizations to actually respond to actual occurrences in the world so two two thoughts there's only one law of history i'm i'm a historian and that's the law of unintended consequences and so what typically happens is that well-intentioned people come to power identify a problem which they they feel they must address and they undertake measures to address the problem which have unintended consequences this was true when back in the 1960s and70s people persuaded themselves that there was a terrible problem of overpopulation that malus was going to be vindicated and therefore there had to be drastic population control especially in asia and that turned out to of all kinds of unintended consequences in our time fears not just of climate change but of dangerous technological developments have given rise to a view which my friend nick bostrom and oxford exemplifies that we need to have very very powerful surveillance powers to prevent bad things from happening whether it's to prevent co2 emissions uh in breaching the levels of the net zero program or whether it's to stop dangerous research being done with artificial intelligence we we need to empower the state to have even greater powers of surveillance than the mid 20th century totalitarian regimes had and so one of the key arguments in the book doom is that actually totalitarianism is the thing most to be feared in the 20th century totalitarian regimes cause way more premature death than anything else and so the last thing we should want to do in the 21st century is to create new forms of totalitarianism out of a belief that only an allseeing state can prevent disaster so this is a really really important argument that that the book makes and i think it's become even more relevant with the major breakthroughs we've seen in artificial intelligence in the two years since the book was published the other thing that i would say is we want the universe to be moral we are very strongly inclined to think when bad things happen to us that they may in fact be retribution for sins that we committed in the past and even the most rational individual is susceptible to this idea i i know this because my parents did the very best their very best to raise me as a product of the scottish enlightenment an atheist and a devoted believer in the scientific method but when bad things happen i have this uneasy sense that i may have brought it upon myself by transgressing in some way illustrating that you can't really escape the christian legacy unless you travel a very long long way away from from post-christian civilizations now it's not in fact a moral universe this the bad news it's really not i mean a lot of the bad things that happen are random uh they're governed by power laws they're extremely difficult to predict wars are in fact pretty randomly distributed there's no cycle of history that tells you when a war is coming same applies to financial crisis wildfires and earthquakes are not normally distributed they can't really be thought of in probabilistic terms and so much of the terrible stuff that happens to us has nothing to do with there being a moral universe cancer may strike one of us down in a much shorter time frame than we are both tly assuming we have and and if we are diagnosed with a a terminal cancer how will we react to that news what if i hear this tomorrow it'll it'll be a tremendous shock to me mainly because it will it will render my younger children much more vulnerable in my absence but will i be able to resist the temptation that i brought it upon myself it'll be there in the back of my mind because i've just inherited from generations that way of thinking and it's worth adding one little footnote to this my friend the historian tom holland wrote a nice book recently dominion arguing that christian ways of thinking about the world have outlived christianity in these secular times that we inhabit a very good illustration of this point is how much calvinism is still out there the belief that you belong to the elect the people because of predestination who are insured of salvation is a very powerful one and it persists long after people have ceased to attend calvinist church services i'm always impressed by the presence of the self-appointed elect in academic life people who have a sense that they are morally superior to those around them they they do belong to an elite and their behavior should be as it were fitting to that preeminence now i i am a kind of calvinist atheist i come from the west of scotland where that kind of thinking was very well established now i can see the people who think they belong to the elect all around me in american academic life and of course the critical idea which robert l stevenson gets at in the master of balant tree and and james hog gets and the confessions of a justified sinner is that the elect are the worst people it's the people who think that they belong to the elite who turn out to be capable of the most diabolical acts so you know if you have that feeling that you might belong to the elect disabuse yourself of that notion

[music] jbp i presume that's why the gospel en joiner is that the last will be first right and the first will be last it's pointing to something like that there's a couple of themes you developed so you pointed out that it's often the reaction to a crisis that's worse than the crisis and you pointed to the law of unintended consequences as the cause of that and and that's i think there's something technically true about that in that there is an a very large number of possible consequences of any given act and the probability that you can specify the consequence you want and only that consequence diminishes with the complexity of the action okay so and you know you can see even systems as sophisticated as the immune system falling prey to the law of unintended consequences because sometimes people die when they're infected by an organism because the immune system overreacts and the covid overreaction was was a generalized social immune system overreaction and it was much worse than the the the hypothetical crisis itself now but what i wanted to focus on was the reason that that overreach occurs now i'm going to i i've been writing a book about biblical narratives so they're very much on my mind and that's partly why i'm bringing them up but i talked to a good friend of mine and his brother jonathan peio and and matthew pagio about the first cataclysm the first apocalyptic cataclysm as it's laid out in the book of genesis and that's the sin of eve and the consequent sin of adam and their view is that the sin of eve is one of pride is that she encounters the serpent who turns out to be satan so it's it's it's it's it's the possibility of predation and natural catastrophe allied with the possibility of evil that's a good way of thinking about it so symbolically and her first presumption is that she can encompass that and hearken to it and listen to its voice and integrate it and that's what produces the fall and adam's consequent sin is he agrees with eve and i would say mostly to try to impress her which speaks very deeply to the motivation of men and so there's this notion it's a very very interesting notion and i i'd like to know what you make of it is that the fundamental reason that cataclysms occur and i guess this is an an objection to your theory of an amoral world so we'll see where this goes is that it's people's overreaching pride that is the eternal precursor to the fall you know pride goes before a fall but it's this notion that we can bite off more than we can chew that we can encapsulate and control more than than are we're really competent to we have an overexpansion vision of our competence we trumpet that to parade our moral v virtue it motivates us to overextend ourselves in places we shouldn't and the con constant consequence of that is the is systemic collapse you know at different scales and so it begs the question you know i've really wondered about this and you know if you i think it's something to meditate on if you didn't overreach in your life you know if you if you were properly humble in your claims of mastery if you only dealt what was what was with what was local and that was within your bounds of competence you know maybe extending yourself a bit to learn maybe you wouldn't bring on yourself a continual sequence of relatively apocalyptic catastrophes right it's like and and you pointed to that at the end of your last sequence of comments you know you said there's a tension there you said well the universe is full of random events and it's not essentially moral but you also said but we overreach constantly and that does produce you know various forms of cataclysm so i would say see there's a there's a paradox in those two viewpoints because how about this is how about our immorality makes us more susceptible to the random fluctuations of the world right that joins those two visions together i think it's rather rather different from the way you've put it it's often people with a strong sense of of morality who overreach humility is important we need to be humble about our ability to predict the consequences of our actions it's a nonlinear world but we are quite linear thinkers and we love to say other things being equal this act will have the following consequence but of course other things are not equal u in a complex system let me give you an illustration of this point which is currently in people's minds because of the success of the movie oppenheimer opie oppenheimer was a very moral individual at least he felt himself to be rooted in in an ethical education that he'd had an at an elite school in new york drawn out of those ethical those ethnical premises towards communism in the 1930s but when given the challenge to build an atomic bomb in order to win world war ii he embraced that challenge and and achieved it with astonishing brilliance brilliance both as a scientist and as it turned out as a leader of scientists but he quickly began to see after the bomb had been dropped on hiroshima and nagas aki that there were unintended consequences he was unable to prevent the arms race that soon broke out between the united states and the soviet union he was unable to prevent the invention of the thermonuclear bomb the super he lost the arguments about the development of of nuclear weapons and if one looks back at that era the the the single most amazing thing to me about that breakthrough is that we have sub quently made so much more use of the destructive potential of nuclear fish than of its productive potential we've built many many more nuclear warheads than nuclear reactors that illustrates i think very powerfully the law of unintended consequences but it began with an individual oppenheimer who was filled with a sense of his own morality and and took that sense with him to the grave right okay but but but maybe that okay but but you're pointing to something there that that that is akin to a point you made earlier is that you said you know that he was filled with a sense of his own morality and that and i can understand why that might be associated with the totalitarian temptation of religious dogmatism and calvinism let's say but i could say perhaps i could say in response he should have been filled instead with a sense of his own potential sinfulness right and i would also say that and you can tell me what you think about this because these are ideas that i'm just you know trying to develop is that you already told me that as far as you're concerned it's the very people who regard themselves as the elect and the saved and the already moral who are who are most likely to overreach and who present the biggest danger you follow that up with the description of oppenheimer right this incredible luciferian intellect and that's the proper symbolic representation who engaged in this world destroying scheme and then was potentially world destroying scheme and was was unable to control it but you characterized him as convinced of his own moral virtue so i would say okay well if that's the problem maybe he should have been convinced of the opposite of that which would be his intrinsic insufficiency and sinfulness now there is an continual injunction throughout the biblical corpus to do precisely that and the reason i'm bringing that up too is because something else that you said begs a question you know if if the law of unintended consequence rules then under what conditions is action any action not overreach right because you could say this is combinant oal explosion you can't predict the consequence of any action and yet you have to act and so then that the question emerges well since you have to act but there's the danger of exponentially cascading unintended consequences in what spirit should you act and you've already pointed out well it shouldn't be in the spirit of smug self-satisfied calvinistic dogmatic certainty in your moral right well then what should it be well hopefully it should be the opposite of that you know and and that is a kind of radical humility right it's it's an openness to the possibility of error i mean i i don't know exactly how those things should be calibrated but because we do have to act and it does seem to me that there is a domain of action like what do you think it was that open heimer did wrong fundamentally i mean i characterize his intellect as luciferian right it's he's reaching he's reaching for a power that in in principle i don't know if it should have been forever off limits i i have no idea how to adjudicate that but you have a sense that oppenheimer himself recognized that he had it was it that he had too much faith in the comprehensiveness of his intellect that he was too tempted by the power that was offered to him as a consequence of being developer of the of this immense weapon where do you think he went wrong i haven't that's key to the question of where science itself goes wrong i should be clear i haven't watched the movie but i read the the book american prometheus i i prefer books to movies and the book makes it clear that what oppenheimer got wrong was to flirt with communism and and that was wrong because it was the moment when he set aside his scientific judgment and and drank at least some of the snake oil that the soviet regime was successfully exporting in the 1930s this was a terrible mistake that ultimately undermined his credibility and limited his power to to steer the course of of the nuclear race what he got right was to to develop a bomb that could end world war ii without the need for a large scale conventional forces in invasion of japan which would have cost untold numbers of american soldiers lives and i think it's very important to emphasize that if oppenheimer had said to himself i must be humble and resist the temptation to win this this race and of course a number of physicists did take that view and refused to participate in the manhand project it might have been disastrous i constantly try to remind people in the work i've done on the second world war that the axess powers the totalitarian powers nearly won that war and it took tremendous creativity by a whole range of scientists not only oppenheimer but think of turing those cryptographers who did such crucial job of making sure that the allied pars cracked the axess pars codes it took a huge effort to to win that war the critical thing i think comes from from another secular jewish intellect henry kissinger whose biography i've spent a large part of my career writing in the 1950s and 60s kissinger before he entered the realm of power came up with the idea of the problem of conjecture it's an extremely important idea that should be communicated to any decision maker whether they're in the private sector or the public sector and the problem of conjecture says that at any given moment when one must take a decision there is a kind of asymmetry and the asymmetry allies arises from the fact that if you act let's say if you had acted in 1938 to prevent hitler's takeover of of czechoslovakia there would have been a cost the war would have begun earlier and even if you had successfully prevented a much larger war the world war that broke out in 1939 you would have got no real gratitude for that you you get no payoffs for the averted catastrophe you you your preemptive action has a cost and that you're held responsible for the tempting thing particularly in a democratic system is to do nothing hope for the best because that has a low cost and if disaster nevertheless happens if you're unlucky then you you say to yourself well anybody in my position would have made the same error so the cost of preemption is high and you have to take a decision conjecturally because you can't know that in acting in 1938 you avert a much larger and more dangerous war you cannot have that certainty and there are no data that will tell you so i think decision- making under uncertainty is the hardest thing of all but it has to be done and i think what i've learned from kissinger is that you will be held responsible and judged very harshly for those actions you take even if they they avert disaster you won't get thanked nobody ever will thank henry kissinger for avoiding world war iii uh no nobody will i think ever thank any statesman for avoiding calamity they will only blame them for the actions that they took and here's the final point that kissinger makes most choices in the realm of power are between evils you just have to decide which is the greater and which is the lesser there are very frequently no good options i think that's very clear today in the middle east since we're talking at a time of of of fresh disaster in that region there are no good choices facing the israeli government or even the government of the united states but there's no option to do nothing i think that must be clear let me take apart what you just said and so the first thing you brought up is that oppenheimer flirted with let's call it radical left utopianism now that's very interesting because i would say that's true of intellectuals across the west and has been since the what i don't know the last 100 years and it's certainly something that characterizes the academia academia at the moment i mean larry summers came out two days ago the former president of harvard savaging harvard as a consequence of its descent into this radical leftist statist utopian vision so there's something key to the presumptive presumption of the intellect and belief in a state imposed utopia so that's one thing then you said sequence of things that were very very complicated the first was well in inaction also produces a combinatorial explosion so we're stuck with the necessity of action so that's a big problem that brings up the issue again is then under what conditions is action appropriate then you said you're also not rewarded for preventative action because in part because nobody can tell what you prevented if it doesn't happen right and so there's no public virtue in that and that that entices the the the leaders of modern states to forestall action because they'll be blamed for action and then maybe to react precipitously once it's too late so then again we're back to the we're back to the central question here at least in part which is how do you how do you organize your attention and sequence your action so that overreach is least likely now you you discussed kissinger in that regard and said that you know he was constantly choosing between evils and and regarded that as a necessity of states craft you have to conduct yourself we talked earlier about this idea that you know that there's a tremendous moral hazard in praying in public and signaling virtue to yourself and demanding recognition for your positive actions and you said that prevention doesn't produce public claim that what that has to mean at least in part is that you have to be oriented to act properly despite just fite its reputational advantage or cost right see that's exactly it is that something other than reputation has to motivate your action and then the question is what should motivate your action if it's not status power and reputation right that's exactly right that's where that should eno pa eno pa said all political careers end in failure i think that any leader should reconcile himself or herself to ultimate failure because doing the right thing averting disaster will not get you rewarded and i think this is just to so then why bother why bother doing the right thing and how do you even determine what the right thing is if it's not associated with public acclaim what would right be because it must have ultimately been right for churchill to speak out against aasman as he did throughout the 1930s to take the helm in 1940 when all his predictions had been fulfilled and britain had been brought to the brink of catastrophe to lead britain to an ultimate victory in 1945 and then suffer a massive electoral defeat this is a noble story and i think that's that's what any leader should aspire to to be right to be right on the basis of historical judgment to accept that there will not necessarily be triumphal processions that there may in fact be ignon at the end of the road but to have done the right thing to save your nation and get no thanks for it that seems to be the most that any leader can aspar to okay okay okay well i've got i've got two comments about that and then we'll wrap this part of the interview out i understand that you have a hard out you describ churchill's actions in terms of ultimate right and so you made reference to a concept of ultimate right and then you turn to a particular concept of ultimate right which was a form of extreme self-sacrifice with no public acclaim i got to say those are strange things for someone who also said during the same discussion who proclaimed a kind of central atheism because i can't help seeing echoes in that of while the christian passion for example is that you're called upon to do right at your own expense even your own ultimate expense with no hope of public acclaim and you do that in the service of some of something that's ultimately right and so let me well that's a parallel that that occurred to me when you made the shre observation i'm a lapsed atheist jordan i go to church every sunday precisely because having been brought up an atheist i came to realize in my career as an historian not only that atheism is a disastrous basis for a society atheist societies have probably committed more violations of human rights than any others but also because i don't think it can be a basis for individual ethical decisionmaking churchill was a christian and i think has to be understood as such so i i am a lapsed atheist and and proud of it ah okay well you know it turns out i wanted to talk to you for the additional half an hour that i usually use but that's actually just a perfectly fine place to bring this part of the conversation to an end and i would be more than happy to talk to you again in some greater detail there's obviously many other things that we could explore for everyone watching and listening most of you know that i'm going to continue to talk to dr ferguson on the daily wire i want to understand more deeply where his interest in such interests in such topics arose during the course of his life i usually use an autobiographical approach in that half an hour so if those of you who are watching and listening would like to join us on the daily wire side that would be great otherwise neil thank you very much for a very stimulating conversation thank you to everyone who's who's paid attention and devoted some time to walking through this podcast with us thanks [music] jul
