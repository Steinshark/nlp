hey quick question let's say you have two cars they both weigh basically the same they're both on basically the same tires one has 755 horsepower the other has 670 horsepower which one's going to be quicker to 60 miles per hour well clearly it's the one with more power right wrong hey quick question say you have two v8 engines one of them is a bit smaller just 5.5 liters and it's naturally aspirated then take that engine you make it a little bit bigger now you've got a 6.2 liter v8 and you throw a supercharger on top which one's going to make more power well bigger engine supercharger that means we've got more boost both of those mean more power right wrong hey quick question see you have a naturally aspirated engine that revs really high or a supercharged engine that doesn't rev quite aside which one's going to have a wider flatter torque curve well usually naturally aspirated engines are really peaky so it's going to be the supercharged engine which just raises up that whole curve right wrong okay one more question say you have two engines one makes 650 horsepower one makes 670 horsepower which one's going to be using 25 percent more fuel to do so well honestly it shouldn't be either right they're very close in power but yes surprise you've caught on at this point it's the one with less power using significantly more fuel hello everyone and welcome in this video we are sitting in the corvette z06 this is the latest generation z06 and i think something that we're kind of used to as core enthusiasts is that you know as you progress through the different generations of vehicles you know you get a little bit better each time you get slightly better each time but the combustion engine is somewhat played out at this point right we've figured out a lot of their technologies we've gotten it very close to you know peak performance peak efficiencies that sort of thing so it's very rare that we see these monumental leaps in performance when you go from one generation to the next you know maybe five or so years between each generation well that is not the case with the c8 corvette over the c7 so i want to analyze these four questions i started with at the beginning of the video and look at one key technology that helps with each of those questions so let's start out with that 0 to 60. how in the world is the c8 corvette z06 quicker than the c7 zr1 which had significantly more power well let's take a look at the c7 corvette and just analyze it for a moment let's say we know what the wheelbase is and we know that it has about a 50 50 weight distribution and let's say the center of gravity is it maybe you know 17.5 inches and let's say our tires have a coefficient of friction of 1.3 very sticky tires great so if we do a little math to analyze this vehicle with these dimensions we can find out that the maximum theoretical 0-60 is about 3.3 seconds with a maximum acceleration of about 0.83 g's so no matter how much power you throw at you can say look we've got this beautiful corvette no matter how much power 10 000 horsepower it doesn't matter it's not going to get quicker than that about 3.3 seconds based on this map well what did car and driver get for the 0-60 of this previous zr1 about 3.3 seconds right the math checks out and so you can say oh you know marketing department can say hey let's throw more power at this thing the people want more power and sure that means it helps with top speed it means it helps with acceleration at really high speeds but in the useful range that you'd be driving the car you may not really notice any improvement so throwing more power isn't necessarily the best solution in trying to make a car perform better okay so now let's take that same c7 corvette with that 50 50 weight distribution and let's take the engine from the front and put it in the back so all we've done is we've changed our weight distribution from 50 50 to about 40 60 about 60 percent of the weight in the back now that may not sound like a huge difference but if you you look at the maximum theoretical acceleration we've gone from about 3.3 seconds down to about 2.8 seconds with a peak acceleration now closer to about 1 g with all the other variables kept the same all we've done is change the weight distribution and so what's 0 to 60 the current driver get with the new z06 about 2.8 seconds so again the mat checks out and this is something where it's just a very fundamental design feature where where you put the weight matters in a two-wheel drive car as far as the performance are going to extract out of it in a straight line so i love this because it shows the power of clever engineering right you don't just say okay we've got a new variant now it has 808 horsepower and suddenly it's better right because of that but it's like if you look at the numbers well maybe it's not actually any better in performance so in this case the performance is dramatically better and yet you know not a significant difference in power versus the previous generation so let's talk about that power difference and that's crazy right the previous z06 supercharged larger engine and it's making less horsepower now why in the world is that well part of it is a revolutionary technology called dual overhead camshafts where you actually put two camshafts on the cylinder head and it allows you to have something like four valves per cylinder unheard of in the automotive world now there's lots of reasons right so power doesn't just come from one small thing there's many reasons and many iterative changes which they made to this engine in order to have it make so much horsepower but one of the big ones in the key one that i want to talk about is that it revs really high and that's really exciting so has a high red line about 8 600 rpm this thing screams and you know you get peak power at 8400 rpm so that is 670 horsepower now in order to do this you need to make some changes to that engine and i think one of the common ones people like to talk about is flat plane versus cross plane crankshaft now that is true this does have a flat plane crankshaft but you know the e92 m3 had a cross plane v8 that ripped 8300 rpm when it was making peak power this is making peak power 8400 rpm basically the same right one's flat plane one's cross plane so flat plane versus cross plane alone doesn't necessarily mean oh one can rev high okay well what's the advantage of flat plane then well they're commonly associated with very free revving engines they're having to rev up very quickly and why is that well it's because they have lighter crankshafts well why do they have lighter crankshafts well this comes down to the engine balancing between a cross plane versus a flat plane and i have a video explaining this in detail but basically a cross plane you have your crank pins at 90 degree angles and as a result your primary and your secondary forces are balanced which is really nice however there's this rocking moment where if you look at it like one inline four-cylinder that inline four-cylinder wants to shake like this back and forth that is the case with a cross plane v8 you've got two of these four cylinders that want to shake like that unfortunate right how do you solve that well you use counterbalances on the crankshaft and you can eliminate that rocking moment great so now you have this very smooth revving engine unfortunately it means you have a heavy crankshaft so that thing isn't as quite as free revving now with a cross plane you have your pistons like if you were to look at a four-cylinder where they're just going like that they're all in a line you've got'0 degree split between your crank pins and so as a result it looks like you know a flat plane as you're looking at it from the side wow clever naming and so as a result of this your primary forces are balanced out yes but your secondary forces are not and so unfortunately these things do shake but because the primary forces are balanced out and that rocking moment is balanced out because the outside ones go up while the inside ones go down and vice versa well great that means you don't have that rocking moment so you don't have to use how be counterweights to balance that out and as a result you have a very light crankshaft and as a result again very free revving spirited engine that you you know you give it a little bit of throttle pull flies up great now this doesn't explain why it's a high revving engine right so how do you get a high revving engine well if you want a high revving engine you need your piston speeds to be under control at a certain point things just shake apart right the materials can't handle it so you need to reduce your piston speeds how do you do this you reduce your stroke so it's a short stroke engine wide bore and this is fantastic for high revving engines because it means you've got a lot of space for intake valves you can get plenty of air in it and then your stroke because your stroke is so short it means you can keep your piston speeds down and rev up really high now of course it's important to have lightweight components here which chevy did with this so lightweight pistons lightweight connecting rods lightweight crankshaft so the key to making all that power is that you're revving really high which means you're pulling in more air into the engine and the higher you rev the more power you make power equals torque times rpm and so because power is a function of torque times rpm the higher the rpm the more power you make as long as you can hold on to torque and this engine has some really impressive features in order to achieve a volumetric efficiency of a hundred ten percent meaning it's putting more air into the engine than you have atmospheric pressure and it's at the mercy of atmospheric pressure right it's relying on atmospheric pressure in order to say how much air can we put into the engine and yet it's able to put in about 10 percent more basically like a little baby turbo charger very cool okay so the intake story leads us to a very interesting discussion about the torque curves and so if you think about what is ideal with the torque curve basically you just want it to be as wide as possible and as flat as possible and with boosted engines especially turbocharged engines this is much easier to do because you can control how much boost you have going into the engine by control showing how much boost you have you can have more in some parts less than other parts so you have this nice beautifully flat torque curve and you'll see that on many turbocharged engines now the story is similar with supercharged engines it's not quite as simple you don't have a wastegate like you do with turbochargers but you do have a bypass valve and so you can bleed off some of that boost and again help achieve a more flatter wider torque curve so then how in the world would this naturally aspirated engine which we have now the challenge with that being you can't control boost right you're at the mercy of mother nature whatever pressure you have outside that's what you have to deal with so usually they have a point where they're the most efficient and the torque curve tapers off on the left and right side of that so when you look at the torque curve for this z06 how in the world is it basically flat above 4000 rpm up to redline i mean it's a beautiful torque curve and if you look at the previous and co6 which was supercharged it's much more peaky in comparison so you can overlay these you know side by side and it's a really interesting look at just how well done the torque curve is with this z06 the new z06 with a naturally aspirated engine and how in the world did they achieve this well again if you have no variables you can't achieve this there has to be little points that you can play with little levers that you could pull on in order to adjust this torque curve like you have with a supercharged or a turbo charge engine well in this case you have variables in your intake manifold three of them in fact so you have three intake tuning belts two of which are connected but this gives you four possible options with these intake tuning valves you can have all of them closed you can have one open you can have two open or you can have all of them open so within your intake chamber you're going to have these pressure waves bouncing around and by using these intake valves these pressure waves differ at different rpm they're going to be ideal at certain rpm with one setting they're going to be ideal at a different rpm with another setting and actually gm shows us this curve which is an absolute beautiful graph to look at so what you're looking at the black line is the final torque curve but the other dotted lines are showing you what are the different options by having all of the valves closed one of them open two of them open or all of them open and you can see what gm did is they just pieced together different parts to make the maximum torque curve so it starts with all of them closed then it opens up one of them closes that one and opens up two then opens all of them then closes all of them and again you can look at that plot and you can see how that traces the ideal torque curve by using these different settings by taking advantage of those pressure waves bouncing around inside of that intake chamber that is extremely cool and no this is not the first engine to use this kind of technology but it's very neat to see it implemented and it's especially cool to see the actual graph of the different options and see how that changes what the overall torque curve would look like foreign [music] okay let's move on to the efficiency story so how is this engine making more power with 20 less fuel and you know there's tons of small iterative changes and the thing that i'm going to focus on is not the key element but it's very cool and worth mentioning here if you don't care about fuel economy whatever it doesn't matter this thing doesn't get great fuel economy but efficiency always matters because the more efficient your engine is the more power it makes so that is critically important and again chevy provides a very cool graph and you can actually look at the fuel flow rate for the previous engine versus the current engine and you can see as you reach peak power this is using about 20 percent less fuel and it's making more power like it's just wild so yes higher compression ratios dual overhead cams you don't have the parasitic losses from things like the supercharger there are many reasons why this is a more efficient engine but the one that i want to focus on and what's really cool about this engine is the oil strategy so your oil system has seven total pumps you have six cabbage pumps and one supply pump so there are four scavenge pumps one for each pair of cylinders then you have one at the front of the engine one at the back of the engine and then the supply pump now what's really cool about these scavenge pumps is that they're able to pull a vacuum within the oil chamber so these oil chambers within the crankcase they're basically circular and they have these sealed bays and these circular bays mean you can kind of have this like centrifugal action where you sling out the oil and then you have these scavenge pumps pulling that oil out constantly and they run a vacuum as high as 75 kilopascals so you have this really high vacuum that's being drawn from within this chamber now what does that mean well where your crankshaft is spinning because it's spinning in a vacuum less dense air it has less aerodynamic drag and also you know of course it is a dry system so it's not sloshing in a pool of oil that also saves you energy but also these are sealed chambers and this system each pair of cylinders has its own sealed chamber that's separate from the others so each one has its own oil pickup as a result but a huge benefit of this is as you have your pistons moving up and down of course that's pushing air around and it's going up and down that crankshaft with a normal v8 engine well with these it acts much more like an air spring because as one piston's going down the other one's going up so you're just pushing that air back and forth in that single you know chamber with just two pistons rather than down and back along the entire length of that crankshaft and creating all this turbulent air and and thus creating more losses within the crankcase itself foreign so what is it like to drive well intentionally i've not spent much time talking about this and that's because this thing has crazy sticky tires it has a ton of grip it's got a ton of power and i'm just not going to get anywhere near the limit on public roads if i'm going to be mildly responsible so if you really want to play with this thing you need to get on a track but that said if i were to compare it to the previous z06 the things that come to mind really the quickest summary is that the previous z06 was violent and unstable this z06 is still violent but stable and that's the quickest easiest summer you can use the power in this one and it's not sketchy when you put your foot down it's very well controlled and it just goes i mean even if you're down at low speeds in first or second gear it really puts the power down well and that's really impressive because the last one's just sliding all over the place and it wasn't able to really handle the power that it did have even though it had slightly less than this so the power delivery is exceptional another just fun little thing that they do is you can hold both paddles puts in a neutral and just let's free rev the engine again you can get a taste of how pre-reving that flat plane crankshaft is it's just very quickly flies up to that peak rpm it's toy you know they've kind of included for you to show off when you pass someone by instead of honking you can give them a little and as far as most of the inputs i like it when i first got in i thought the steering felt a little light especially at low speeds but that's fine and as i've gotten into some better roads i've noticed you know it does actually have a good feel to the steering so i like the steering i love the throttle i mean here's the thing naturally aspirated engines are simply the best when they're done right it's so amazing to have that immediate response of course there you have to wait for this shift but once you're in the gear you like oh man and again there is a violent nature to it right it's not this light like purely purely just super refined thing there's a violence to it that's very exciting and yet it handles it really well so it doesn't feel like you're out of control but there's still this just shaking violent nature to this beast very race car engine like and that's partly because it is coming from a race car and the engine is just such a beautiful thing in this machine i like the brakes it's break by wire i know some people have mixed feelings about that but honestly i really like the way it feels nice progressive as you dip into that pedal not much travel required and you get really good braking i like the brakes i like the throttle i like the steering the shifting sometimes it gets a little confused and takes a little time on the shifting so again if you just put in sport mode you're flying around you're leaving an automatic it's gonna do pretty much everything you wanted to do really well where i've noticed is you know especially if you're in touring mode even in sport mode though sometimes you just catch it a little off guard you want to switch to a different gear and it takes a little while to get into that it's rare and again if you're already going flat out in that scenario it's really good and so that's really what you want but there are times where the transmission i've been in other cars that do it better at literally any moment you flick it and it's just perfectly there immediately this one sometimes there's a delay depending on the scenario all right let's just take a moment to listen to this engine because this foreign [music] [music] [music] okay i'm sticking with my summary of a violent but stable the thing puts the power down so well it is so much fun to drive i would love to get this thing on a track and really explore its limits but honestly it just puts down the power so well and it sounds so good in doing so i have absolutely loved driving this thing thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below um
