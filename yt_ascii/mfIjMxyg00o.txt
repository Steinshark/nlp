hello everyone and welcome i'm sure you're all dying to know jason what's under the towel what's your new car and we're going to get into the reveal in just a second but first i want to say thank you 2 million subscribers there is nothing powerful enough that i can say i love my job i love learning i love teaching and it's because of all of you that i get to have what i consider to be the best job in the world thank you all so much i am incredibly grateful for every single one of you except for you jared now as i've mentioned in a previous video i've been in the market for an electric car i think they're super cool and i've actually been debating for the past several months which electric car i was thinking about buying i'm super happy to say that autotempest.com has teamed up with me for this series on my new electric car it's my favorite website to look for used cars i spend way too much time on it and what's cool about it is that they take all of the major used car sites and they put all the search results in one spot i will include a link in the video description and i'd highly recommend checking it out if you're in the market for a used car or if you're in the market for a new car they also have a tool to help you get competing quotes from multiple dealerships which is perfect because i bought a new car however there's one company that doesn't sell through traditional dealerships are you guys ready for the reveal yes i've bought a brand new tesla model 3. yes one of the only cars you can't find new on autotempest wait well there goes that sponsorship so as far as the spec this is the mid-range tesla model 3 it is rear-wheel drive tesla claims on a full charge it will get 260 miles of range and has a 0-60 time of 5.6 seconds now there are two ways of looking at the model 3 mid-range the pessimist will say that it is the lowest range model 3 and it is also the slowest model 3 currently sold and both of those are true however the optimist would say that this is the lightest weight model 3 currently on sale and it is the only model 3 that has rear wheel drive currently on sale and to me i think rear wheel drive is super cool and i think losing weight is super cool which is why i never eat as much as i love the practical aspects of all-wheel drive i think rear-wheel drive is more fun and combined with the lower weight i'm super excited about the driving dynamics of this car so let's start with a tour of the exterior of the vehicle then we'll hop inside check out the interior and then we will go for a drive now tesla calls this color here multi-coat red it's a very clever name that they came up with because the color is in fact red now the model 3 comes in five different paint colors personally i think red and blue both look awesome because i went with the slowest model three i thought i might help myself out a little bit get some red paint speed things up everyone knows red paint's the fastest also now that i have a red car i also have a blue crosstrek and a yellow s2000 so i have all three primary colors and my perfect garage is complete let's talk about the wheels for a moment the car comes standard with'-inch wheels now these are the 19-inch upgraded wheels i chose them not because of the way they look but rather the tires that you can fit on them i'm probably one of few people that chooses wheels purely just because of what tires are available for that wheel size so that's what i did it comes standard with all season tires you guys know how much i obsess over tires i will certainly be changing these out and you know this is actually one of the reasons why i was deterred from buying the bmw i3 the i3s are an awesome deal used i really think they're awesome vehicles the disappointment for me is that there's really only two tires available there's like an all season and a winter tire available for it and that's because it has a very unique wheel size and because of that unique wheel size none of the tire companies make tires for it and because i love tires so much i decided to not go with the bmw i3 even though used they are a crazy good deal now one of the things i really like about the exterior is that the roof is entirely glass so it's actually three sections there's the front windshield a center section and then the rear window and i guess that's kind of cool you know because if you were to get a crack or a scratch on one of these pieces of glass you don't have to replace the entire roof you can just replace that individual panel but also i just think it looks cool you know from the interior it's got a heavy tint to it so you can't really see through it much from the outside but from the interior especially if you're sitting in the back seat and looking out of it it does look quite cool up front there is a frunk and frunks are undeniably awesome even my friends who don't know what a car is are like well wait a minute there's a trunk but it's up front that's awesome it is awesome and in fact you can open it up using a smartphone so here we go i'm just going to hit the trunk button there pop that open and voila and now you're thinking wait a minute jason that space is kind of worthless what could you possibly fit in there well hold on hold on check this out and you could fit two of these the big ones you also do have a nice large rear trunk so checking out the trunk here we have the charging kit and usually these charging kits annoy me because they're flopping around as you're driving and you need to have it in the car with you if you want to charge well tesla actually thought about it so there's a nice textured surface here on the bottom of it and as you can see it won't slide around on this surface additionally there's a huge storage area underneath you can drop that down in it won't slide around down there and you've still got your full trunk space fantastic now as far as charging check this out so there's a button on the charger right here i push that next to the charging port it opens up and then just slide that right in and we start charging there's additional controls on your phone as well so you can flash the lights if you would like you can oh man that was loud you can start it you can open the front trunk you can open the rear trunk and then you can of course you can set some valet modes if somebody else is going to drive it you can also have it preheat in the morning so that it's warm when you get in it the car has 5.5 inches of ground clearance it weighs somewhere around 3 700 pounds i haven't actually seen what tesla quotes the weight is for the mid-range but it is going to be lighter than the long range it has fewer battery cells and now the long range only comes with all-wheel drive so it won't have the motor up front like the long range does as well it's also one of the most aerodynamic vehicles sold today so you can see the very smooth body shape it's got the flush door handles a drag coefficient of just .23 all right let's check out the interior now as far as getting in and out of the vehicle there's no longer an actual key like you have with traditional cars there's not an ignition to start up so your key is now actually this card or you can use your phone so you can leave the card in your wallet use that as the key or you can use your phone to unlock get inside that kind of thing so as far as the interior there used to be two different options there was a 5 000 upgrade which you could do for the premium interior now all of the cars come with a premium interior and they do have a hike in price for the base price of the vehicle now that premium interior means 12 way adjustable heated front seats and i love these seats usually seats are a bit too firm for me because i don't weigh all that much but these are really well cushioned and you kind of sink into them and it's a super comfortable seat it also comes with their upgraded sound system and the sound system is actually fantastic it does an awesome job with low frequencies the bass is really good good mid frequencies it is lacking a little bit in my opinion on the higher frequencies i think you know some of the higher end like mark levinson systems in lexus vehicles actually do a nicer job with the high end frequencies but overall it is a fantastic sound system one thing that is a little bit weird about the sound system though is that the bass seems a lot heavier in the front seats than if you're sitting in the back so there's a big difference in what the bass sounds like depending on where you're sitting in the vehicle as i mentioned earlier you've got the glass roof i think it looks super cool especially you know sitting in those back seats you also have auto dimming heated and power side mirrors now for adjusting the mirrors and for adjusting the steering wheel there's really no buttons or controls in here there's a few you've got these two stocks right here and then you've got a few buttons on the steering wheel everything else is controlled through this touch screen and so you can actually adjust where the steering wheel height is and you know whether you want that in or out using these buttons here on the steering wheel and you use those same buttons to adjust your mirror by selecting that on this touch screen now you may be disappointed to learn that pretty much all of your functionality all of your controls are done through this 15 inch touchscreen but the good news is is that it's actually a really good touchscreen so you know it's got a lot of the same functionality like a phone does it works a lot like a smartphone unlike a lot of you know the modern infotainment systems in cars now where the touchscreens are not responsive at all this does a really nice job a good way of demonstrating that is showing the heated seats so you actually have heated seats in both the front and the rear seats so all five and if i push three of these buttons at once they all activate if i just push those two on the sides those go in let's see if i can turn each of these off and then hit all of them at the same time and as you can see it activates all of them so it's a really good touch screen it's capable of recognizing multiple touches on the screen there you just demonstrated five touches and it worked with all five so it is a nice touchscreen now there's all kinds of stuff going on with this display and i'm not going to get into all of it but a few highlights one of the things that i think is pretty cool the climate control system here you can see this large vent across the front of the vehicle you can actually direct the air just using your finger here and show choosing where you want that air to flow which i think is really cool and it changes the directions of those fans there so it's got those two air blades which it uses to change where the air actually goes and you can do that for the driver and passenger side in very different ways i think that's pretty neat i also like the charging screen and the way they have this set up so you can set a limit for the charging of the battery so tesla recommends keeping it below 90 if you're just driving it around town and then if you need to you can set that limit up to a hundred percent and you can charge it if you're gonna go on a long trip make sure it's full you know the next day after you get in your vehicle but to keep the battery health long they recommend keeping it you know around 90 i'm just leaving it here on 80 percent and one of the cool things about this you know even at 80 it's got 206 miles remaining or about 330 kilometers so plenty of charge even just leaving it at 80 percent all right enough about the interior and this screen let's go for drive now looking around i certainly can't think of any reason why i would have wanted to opt for all-wheel drive nature's certainly not trying to give me any sort of sign here are they so anyways what's this thing like to drive well you know it's an electric car so it's super boring there's no sound nothing about it's good except when you put your foot down it seriously pulls i mean this isn't like you know the p100d this isn't crazy acceleration but it is quite good you know for where this car is at and being rear-wheel drive and you know putting your foot down on these icy roads nice jason cool is yeah this thing is quick it is quite fun you know again not going to blow your mind it's not supercar stuff but it is quite good and very responsive acceleration so when you put your foot down you get that torque and there you can see the rear end sorting out a little bit of ice back there but figuring it out with the traction control quite cool one of the things that does feel different about this versus for example the leaf or for example driving a tesla with ludicrous mode so there's two acceleration modes here there's chill and they're standard and i've got it in standard here which is a lot more responsive you put your foot down you get that torque pretty immediately what there seems to be though and this is how i felt when i was driving the tesla p100d with the ludicrous mode is that this standard mode this standard driving mode has a bit more of a delay and it's not a long delay in acceleration but there's a slight delay between when you put your foot down and when you get that full torque and then if you put it in chill mode you know it's kind of a relaxed and it doesn't have quite the same amount of acceleration and it eases into it but it doesn't have that snappiness that you have like in ludicrous mode and even honestly i think the leafs response the nissan leaf that i had long term was a bit quicker but this certainly has more acceleration so once it's hit that peak torque it's there and it's not a long delay i'm kind of making it sound like there's a long duration i mean it's certainly very quick and it's faster than an internal combustion engine but it feels like there's kind of a little bit of a tuned in delay in getting that peak torque either way the throttle response is absolutely fantastic and the control of the throttle is great i mean varying your foot and just varying how much torque you get exactly when you want it that is super super cool the brakes you get a good amount of regen and there's also two modes for regen so you can do standard or low you can also have creep on so that you know at a stop light or whatever you'll just kind of creep forward it feels kind of like driving a vehicle with a torque converter i leave that off and just let it hold itself at stop lights but it is cool that you have you know all these options to play around with i've got the steering in standard mode the steering itself is i'd say somewhat i mean there's no there's no effort required it's fairly numb but that said it's very responsive and so you know you turn in you get that immediate turn in and part of that might be that it's freezing outside and so the tires are kind of hard and they adjust very quickly to that rather than kind of this gooey feel that you might have with like a winter tire regardless the steering very responsive so that's good just you don't get a whole lot of feeling through the steering wheel and there's not a lot of effort required you can increase the effort you've got sport mode or you could decrease it and put it in comfort mode as far as visibility it is fantastic large windshield up front nice windows to the left and right looking checking your blind spot good big window back there and then looking out the rear i mean of course the whole roof here is pretty much glass so looking back you've got plenty of visibility out there i love that so many cars today are sacrificing visibility in the name of style and you know personally i'm willing to sacrifice a little bit of style hence the hoodie and and have better visibility so i like that this car has fantastic visibility all the way around you can see what's going on and that is quite nice now as far as the ride comfort this really isn't the best road to be testing that out on it's pretty flat but overall i've been quite pleased with it nice cushion suspension feels quite good this road does have a lot of tight corners and so you can kind of get a feel for the body roll there doesn't seem to be a ton of it and that of course is helped by having that heavy battery as low as possible you know at the bottom keeping the center of gravity low of the vehicle the noise is another weird thing i mean this thing is super quiet on the inside and when you're just driving around town especially kind of below like 35 miles an hour it is really quiet in this thing one of the things that's kind of weird is as you come up to a stoplight you know you've got the regen braking so you've got motors that are slowing you down if you just let off the gas pedal coming up to that stop light and then when you start to get on the brake pedal to just come to that final stop you know those last five miles per hour you can actually hear the brake pad press up against the brake disc i mean there's no sounds coming from this thing and so when you do have a sound like that brake disc you actually hear it and so usually that's going to be muffled up by an engine you're not going to hear it because you're going to have an engine idling and that's going to be louder than that brake contact you can actually hear the contact on the brake pads meeting against that brake disc which is just kind of crazy at those low speeds at these speeds right here you don't really hear it if you get on the brake pedal but at a very low speed when you're just creeping along and there's no other noises you can hear that brake pad and that's a bit strange now one of the things that's quite different is not having any information displayed directly in front of you so you're used to looking through your steering wheel seeing all the information your different clusters and there's nothing here you've got your speed on the top left of the screen here but aside from that you know you really don't have much driving information and that's a bit weird and when you're sitting in the course stationary and you're not actually driving it definitely feels weird at first and you're like what i don't have any information to look at but once you are driving actually i've been surprised that i kind of feel less concerned about it and you know you're just focusing on driving you've got your speed you've got the one important thing it is a little weird that you have to look to the right you know perhaps it would have been cool if they included a heads up display and you could have that information directly in front of you but i have been surprised that you know not having anything here doesn't feel all that strange it kind of feels natural there's a kind of a beauty to the simplicity of everything here where you just look out the front windshield you're driving you're doing your thing you've got the speed if you need to look at it but there's really no information that you're being given i think for car guys it's kind of a little disappointing because you want to see those gauges flying and all that kind of stuff but that said it seems very natural and i'm surprised by that i didn't expect it to actually feel all that natural another thing that i like is you can actually feel that this car is rear-wheel drive so going through these tight little corners here and then getting on the gas as you come out of it you can feel a little shakiness there to the back end where it's trying to figure out traction and have it all controlled so there is a little bit of a playful nature that it maintains being rear-wheel drive and yes the traction control will kind of assist and send torque where it's needed and make sure you're not getting sideways but it's cool that you can feel that it's actually rear-wheel drive and it sorts out that traction and it gives you that little playful nature of rear wheel drive cars so i do think that's fun and you know i'm glad honestly that it has that feel as a rear wheel drive car that you can tell as you put your foot down especially when it's cold out here you know like this conditions aren't ideal and it's got that playful nature which makes it fun now when i drove the p100d some people were like dude you didn't even talk about autopilot and guess what i didn't even buy autopilot turns out i love driving no that's not that's not necessarily all the reason why here's my thoughts on autopilot you know until regulations are at the level where it's actually legal to do and cards are at the level where it's safe to do and everyone's doing it and that's the norm cool i think that's great perhaps i will you know enter into it then and you know pay for the fee to get the upgraded software the core comes with all the hardware for autopilot you pay a 5 000 fee to kind of activate it and to me you know at this time it's just not that worth it i can change lanes on a highway just fine i don't mind it comes with regular cruise control so i don't mind that i enjoy driving especially around the city you know i don't mind doing all the driving myself if it comes to the time where you know i can get in my garage say go here and i don't have to do a thing and that is the norm then sure i'm all about it and you know if regulations allow for it then i think that's kind of cool and perhaps i might opt in then but until then i enjoy driving i don't mind doing it myself and it's got regular cruise control so you know as far as highway driving not too big of a deal to me personally now you know perhaps if you live in an area that just has a ton of traffic and you don't want to sit there and deal with you know stop and go stop and go stop and go you can let the car do it for you i do think that is cool so don't get me wrong i think it actually is a pretty neat feature i just personally i'm not all that interested in it overall i am stoked excited to be driving this thing around make some content with it and again a huge thank you to autotempest.com please check out the link in the video description it's an awesome site that compiles all the main used car sites in one spot and a pro tip if you're looking at buying an electric car a tip of mine would be to look in states that actually have really high incentives so for example colorado has a 5 state incentive to buy an electric car so if you're buying a car from someone in a state like colorado or other states that have these incentives then you can probably get that price down a little bit more than states that don't have these incentives buying out of colorado you can get up to twelve thousand five hundred dollars off an electric car so people are likely going to be willing to part with their electric cars for far cheaper and you can even save some money even considering that you need to ship it to your house so that would be my recommendation check for a state that's close to you that you could have it shipped from that also has these heavy incentives so you can find a good deal on a used car also if there's any specific content you would like to see on this model 3 i would love to hear about it let me know in the comments and thank you all so much i cannot believe it 2 million subscribers that is just awesome thank you thank you thank you have a great day thanks for watching
