have you ever wanted to take your technical skills and start a business it's actually a fairly common desire among a lot of programmers because when you think about it we have a lot of skills that lend themselves to building businesses we like to build things we're experienced in going from idea to actual working thing we have a love of solving problems puzzles sure but also especially problems that make a real difference to people that delight people when we finally solved what's been bugging them and we know as well as any sector how do you create a repeatable system that delivers something valuable over and over and scales up we've got a lot of skills that lend themselves to businesses but there's one area i think traditionally we're fairly lacking as programmers and that's the sales and marketing side i think kevin costner has something to answer for here we were told if you build it they will come for anyone who's tried knows that's simply not the case no matter how great a product you build you've still got to build the bridge from your product to the outside world and back if you just build it they won't come they won't even hear you so if you want to go from working the feature factory to captain in your own ship you've got to learn the other side and that's this week's topic coming from a very much a technical mindset we're going to talk about how you bridge that gap to the outside world and my guest for this has very good form i'm joined by michael dragalis he's already sold one technical business and he's now embarking on his next and he's got a novel idea for it instead of rolling the dice once he's going to attempt to start four tech businesses in the next four quarters and publish every step of the journey put himself under the spotlight and show people how it goes given that he's keen to bear all and this is a question that will face quite a few of us in our careers i thought i'd bring him in to discuss the practical steps of turning an idea into a solution people actually want the external staff of sales and marketing and price discovery and all that and also that more difficult sometimes the inner game of understanding and empathizing with your customers making good decisions but not making decisions so perfect that you paralyze yourself and never do anything not making a decision and then second guessing yourself next week all that external and internal game stuff that's just outside the realm of software so a meaty topic let's get stuck in i'm your host chris jenkins this is developer voices and today's voice is michael dragalas joining me today is michael dragalis michael how you doing hey thanks for having me doing great good you're an exciting adventure these days i am i am i've recently left confluent and i'm kind of embarking on a journey just to see what i can do as an entrepreneurial software engineer what can i build what am i good at what am i not good at and it's been an exciting journey so far about three weeks in my three so we're going to get into this but if we're going to talk about tech people giving up their day job to go and start their own business we should really note that you have passed form on this this is not your first rodeo as they say over there right you've sold a business before yeah my story starts maybe 10 11 years ago i left college as a software engineer and at the time open source was was really culturally big and i knew that kind of i wanted to be a part of that i wanted to have some ownership in something and so i had started an open source company all right i'd rather i started an open source project and and that was kind of moderately successful i ended up founding a business on top of that which i eventually sold to confluence and i spent the last you know five years at confluence so now now that i've exited confluent i'm pretty keen to try it again and sort of see you know how much of that was skill and how much of that is luck and try to tilt as much of that to the the skill bucket as i can yeah but presumably when you sold that company you made enough money to take a risk not so much money that you decided to never work again in your life so you've got a bit of a safety net going into this i guess but the thing i find interesting is with that comfort you you then moved to confluence for like five years you didn't say i'm gonna immediately jump out and do thing number two what was behind that decision why did you stay there for five years and then what was the trigger that actually made you say i want to roll the dice one more time that was the plan actually was when i joined i was like you know okay i'll spend two years at conference and then i'm i'm a flight risk i'm gonna go do the next thing i'm gonna relax and none of that came into fruition i joined and it ended up being a pleasant experience i i learned a lot i think it was a good place for me to like watch what happens after you get out of like day one and day two of a company and sort of watch how you go from 200 people to you know several thousand people and so i i learned a lot through that experience it ended up also being kind of a good place for me to be at a transition phase in life i had two children during that time and it helps to kind of have a less work chaos than you would doing an early stage company and so it ended up being sort of the right set of people to be around the right set of lessons to learn and now you know five five years later i i never lost that itch but it just ended up being kind of like the right alignment of stars to try it again now why what was the trigger i think you know as as confident got kind of bigger i sort of learned a little bit about myself like one of the things that i liked and one of the things that i didn't like you know i i realized that i really prioritize working in a small setting shipping fast making quick decisions large companies can do incredible things that small companies can never do but i realized kind of what was the thing that i wanted at the end of the day i really wanted to try try something with with quick quick iteration quick decision making and that's kind of what led me you know back to just trying this on my own it's sort of like kind of tipped up the balance point of you know benefit and and benefit and cost yeah yeah i think a lot of programmers can understand that wanting to get back to just building and shipping software quickly and working on your own thing and the freedom of it yeah yeah absolutely but you another thing i find unusual is you jump ship and you you didn't have a specific idea in mind you had what some will say is a crazy plan for what you were going to do as soon as you left and i'm going to let you outline what your plan is for the first year yeah i'll kind of tell it through a quick story basically my plan while i was at confluent was to spend my time deciding what's going to be the next company that i build i would probably do a venture back company like i had attempted to do before and try to take it further than i did the last time and so i spent years being like all right what's what's the problem that i'm going to solve what's what's the billion dollar market and i i got pretty far down several different paths and as i got closer and closer to doing it i sort of realized i felt a state of anxiety about choosing one problem and saying i'm going to try to take the next 10 years to go and crush it and you know just spend my life on this something about that just didn't sit well with me and i you know actually i still don't know why but i i sort of respected that and i paused and i said all right that's not going to be the plan i'm going to try something else and i sort of concocted something rather different instead of doing one big company i formulated the plan of you know what would it be like to do many little companies and so i i sort of put together something that i call for startups and four quarters which is basically what it sounds like you know for the next year each quarter i'm gonna attempt to launch a little company a little startup with its own product and to see if i can make that succeed and i think this this ended up sort of feeling more balanced to me it gave me the freedom to try different products to try different domains to not feel bad about throwing things out that that weren't working and so far you know it's been a pretty successful framework for me it's it's not easy but i think it it it gives me a bit better you know internal alignment feels like i'm doing the right thing with myself at this time okay i don't know i mean that's it's such a thing to go out on your own that you have to feel somewhere deep inside that you're doing the right thing right and it's you're well suited for it i know that if i did that with the best will in the world i probably spend the first three months trying to decide what problem to solve in those three months how do you how do you say well maybe this isn't the billion dollar company but this is good enough for now how do you how do you crystallize a problem so i i think that's the key is i i don't want the billion dollar company i actually be much happier making less money but doing something that i'm happy with and saying that this is enough and it's pretty counter-cultural to all of silicon valley i like to say i'm actually going to aim lower but that's that's what my goal is right now i so i think i think that's part of it and then i think the other part of it is saying you know i've signed up in a public commitment i've gone on linkedin i've gone on twitter i've told all my friends in my family i'm gonna ship something in 90 days it's it's the the sun tzu death ground strategy you know i've taken my ships and i've burned them i put my back to the the the sea or whatever i i don't want to look bad if i ended up not shipping in 90 days i feel it's important to try to you know honor that commitment even if it's there's no serious consequences to me backing out of it i i think it's internally important so it's a motivator for me to just pick a problem that i think is interesting admit that i actually don't know the market size and just say i'm going to try my best in 90 days and it's going to be what it's going to be maybe there's going to be some traction maybe there's not but it gives me the license to attempt fail possibly and move on or succeed and just see what's there and kind of open the box and find out what's inside okay will you best tell us what your first idea is and then we can chew through that so what's what's business number one i've got like yeah a list of maybe 10 ideas some of them are more big than others but i thought okay this is going to be a pretty challenging year what should i do i want to explore all kinds of different domains i might as well you know not delude myself and make it harder than it already is so i thought i'd start with what i know my entire career has been in data infrastructure why don't i do something that's adjacent to that so i've spent many years working in event streaming systems real-time systems and i've sort of noticed that just sort of getting these systems running from scratch is pretty hard what i've observed is something that i call the ten thousand dollar demo problem which is that anytime anyone wants to build any kind of a real-time demo it easily costs ten thousand dollars in people's time and the the the the cost is actually not configuring your software it's injecting the right data into your system to elicit the behavior you want you need data that looks realistic that is a relationally joined across many data sets you need it produced into your system at an appropriate cadence and there was just nothing else out there that that did this i've seen teams construct these over and over and internally what i notice is that every company ends up building a little data simulation tool to try to power their system and they do it for like every project every conference that comes up all right let's build the demo it just gets done from scratch over and over and so that's the problem that i want to solve in my first quarter i'm building a product that i call shadow traffic to basically solve this it's a a a container that you can download it has a declarative api to say i want my data to look like this it should be produced at this distribution rate it's has relationships that join in this way and so it sort of solves that problem of figuring out how do i go from nothing to actually building a system that's based on event data in a pretty quick way okay i think we can all understand that problem and then the need to solve it but do you so you say you're not aiming for the big billion dollar problem you're not doing a lot of market research up front what what made you say okay of my 10 this is the first one to tackle was it like the burning personal need or the feeling that it might be the one that captures people's imagination or yeah i i'd be lying if i said that i knew it's kind of just intuition based on you know my years of experience i think a lot of this is just an admission to not knowing like i realized even the best people in business are wrong a lot of the time but the way that you end up being right is you you rapidly experiment and you learn you just say i i don't know but how can i figure out the answer as fast as possible 90 days while is a decent chunk of time you know it's certainly a lot a lot less time than you know two or three or four years you can spend trying to build a startup all on its own and so you know i think a lot of the philosophy that i'm trying to take is to figure out like how can i take anything that i want to do and turn it into as rapid of an experiment as possible and and not feel bad about the results if it doesn't work out that's fine i've got you know 15 other things start up in the queue i'm ready to try again and eventually one of them is going to be a winner okay if you throw enough darts you'll hit the dartboard yeah essentially one of my friends stanislav said i expect failure in the short term but i expect success in the long term because i'm just not going to stop and i think that's exactly the right mindset yeah yeah that's something nice to hold on to when the storms are going yeah idea yeah okay so how do you break down 90 days because you've got a lot to do you've got a certain amount of marketing some business a lot of software to write and it's just you right yeah yeah just me as a you know a solo entrepreneur i i don't really have the benefit of having done a full quarter of this to say what works yet but i would say so far the key has been to have a high degree of automation and i i don't necessarily mean that in the software sense so that is certainly a factor you can think about it this way you know every day that i wake up i have to make a bunch of different decisions and the less decisions that i have to make with effort the better and so what are those decisions do i work on this or do i work on that do i work on the riskier thing or the safer thing do i do marketing today or do i do product work today i've kind of automated my routine enough to make very few of those decisions or at least when i make those decisions the decision is automatic it doesn't take any energy from me and so i've got myself in a cadence where the first three days of the month i'm working on marketing every other day i'm working on product i've kind of automated the marketing from that sense my marketing may or may not be good during the month but i've sort of committed to you know this is what i'm doing similarly with planning as i build the product i've got a road map i'm dynamically deciding what's in and out of scope but i sort of have a policy of like this is the minimum bar i need to hit to ship everything else can wait and it's it's required the discipline to keep coming back to that and sort of say i'm not going to look at every decision and spend five minutes 10 minutes an hour deciding what to do i'm just gonna go based on what's on the plan and it's going to turn out the way it is i can always adjust my policy later but this is what i'm doing right now and so far that's been the key to staying sane i'm not working hours i'm working 40 hours a week i have a family but it's been having that disciplined plan and automation in place that's let me you know be effective so far okay so you're treating yourself like an employee almost of some higher plan yeah i i think you kind of have to you know the when i was younger i could succeed by basically brute forcing any problem like it's like you know take as long as i want i can try all the options i can kind of come in and out of whether i'm working on it right now i don't have that much time and so it really really depends on having a plan to execute and there's something comforting about that too like in the past i may have failed at something and i'll i'll feel bad and you know this time around i i have a real plan and the plan may fail and that's going to feel kind of crappy but at least i had a you know well reasoned plan and that actually is comforting all on its own i i think that's probably like you say something to lean on as the storm's rolling yeah that kind of hints at something like larger is there anything from your previous business that you regret doing and like if i ever do this again i'm gonna do i'm not gonna do that i'm gonna do this i think we could spend the next six hours talking about things like that yeah what are the big things that come to mind i mean certainly i i committed the biggest error you can make as a first-time entrepreneur which is having no marketing and no go to market plan believing that if you build a product the customers are just going to come if it's good enough and unfortunately to say that it's not true you can build the greatest product in the world the greatest product does not always win it's this the product that has the most sensible story has the best go to market has the best usability there are so many other things besides building the best set of features that make products succeed and so i didn't do any of that in my first company we we just thought we'd just build a product and we'd tell a couple people about it and then it would go viral from there and i think that's kind of the you know the the the cardinalson that every technical founder makes because people like us i mean you've you've done a company before you know what it's like you you have a great engineering idea and you kind of expect the rest of it to take care of itself because that's not really part of your your initial skill set and so it's easy to kind of punt that problem up the road yeah yeah it's the same you can see exactly the same structure of problem from the like stereotypical other side of the fence where someone has a great idea and a great business plan and they think actually building it will be trivial i'll get some i'll get some students to do it in a weekend or something yeah then i'll be the head of the new facebook so yeah you won't do it so yeah and i i think that's kind of like to me the best possible outcome of this is developing a balanced skill set where you fall into neither of those traps you're able to to build the ideas that you want but you also have a balanced perspective where you you know all the other challenges to getting your product to market and the things that you don't have to do you actually don't have to implement every feature you should spend more of your time coming with a better story better pricing model a better way to connect with your customers and i i think the people who have those skills i just admire them so much because they have such stability in what they're doing yeah yeah there's there's something if only it were easier to figure out the path it'd be wonderful if we could just as developers spend most of our time solving problems in a way that the market responded to so we would make enough money to carry on solving problems that interested us right that's right yeah yeah it reminds me of and i'm gonna i wonder if the book i'm thinking of is up on my bookshelf no it's not oh yes it is hang on god what's his name austin austin cleon austin cleon who wrote steel like an artist right he one of his ideas and i think his second book was if you want to actually be an artist then you're just going to have to accept the fact that you're going to spend half of your time doing art and half of the time marketing your art talking about it right reaching out making it happen in the world as well as living in your cave do you think that holds true for tech as well like if you want to spend half your time if you want to be a programmer an entrepreneurial programmer you're going to have to spend half your time putting the code away and talking to people i'm not sure what the right balance is but i think the idea is right you're going to go through different phases where it makes sense to kind of get heads down and build once you have a good idea of what you're doing and at other times you spend a lot of your time just talking to people i think the trick is to develop the kind of the sensory feedback of when you're out of balance like last week i realized i haven't talked to potential customers in a while this is a problem i have to get on it but yeah i i think i think it's absolutely crucial almost no matter what you're doing to just make sure that you're you're out there and you're talking to people otherwise you're going to commit the air of building something that that nobody wants and i think it's something that people don't want to hear when they're just getting into a career of making things because i mean often it ends up being people who are i i'm a bit more like insular i'd rather just sort of like have a quiet setting to work on my thing and i didn't think that was supposed to be part of the job but if you sort of want to take you know charge of your own product and say and i this this is the thing i want to build i want to get it out into the world it's just an essential part of it it's it's a it's an area of skill that has to be developed and it can't be ignored okay so how do you develop it give me some guidance as a geek trial and error i mean it's it's pretty painful at first and i i can't say that i'm you know still great at it but i i kind of rewind what's in my mind i was you know could be only described as a software engineer and maybe 2014 or even 2015. i had an idea and i really wanted to get it out there and so i think a lot of the skill just comes from trial and error and storytelling you have to be able to hold a conversation with people and and see if they're interested if you can't at least do that you know it's sort of a warning sign about whether you're really on to something big or not and so i think getting yourself out there and exposed with enough volume of those conversations is important just to get comfortable with it and then i think the other part of it is to get more skilled in doing it in a variety of mediums so there's kind of the elevator pitch can you tell people in 60 seconds about what you're doing can you not use the terms that you know about that they don't know about that's a whole other thing can you design a website that packages up your pitch so you don't have to rely on doing it over and over so that you can basically you know pitch in your sleep can you put together the pitch deck for people who want to see in the room walk me through the five-minute ultra polish presentation and you learn skills there the the secret to giving a really good pitch is to anticipate the next question that people have in their minds and to answer those questions one in a row and it makes people feel good because you sort of feel like you're connected with that person like you're speaking the same language and so i i think if i was going to wrap up all this it's sort of volume just doing a lot of it and then also doing it across all different kinds of situations there's a lot more than what i described but i think those are kind of the basics yeah yeah it's painful though when you're probably naturally an introvert right yes certainly people in our industry attend that way yeah i mean any kind of new skill is painful to develop that it's probably more so when it sort of moves against your inclinations is your personality but i i think the more you succeed with it you sort of realize what's what's the reward out there the reward is you take full charge of your own creative vision it's not that you just wrote the code you now control how do we talk about it how do we think about it how do you price it to me that that's kind of the ultimate power so just be in control of what's what's the essence of what you're building it's not necessarily the case that you need to take this career path and to do what i'm doing which is say i'm going to do a small company to do it all you can have that kind of power at a larger company where you you've got the vision for how do you want it to look how do you want it to feel i feel like those are the people who are to me the most exciting to work with they just sort of are able to pierce through every layer of building the product from the sales the market the engineering and you have these really rich discussions with them and i feel i feel those produce the best products in the end if you can work with people who have that ability yeah yeah they're rare but they're fun to work with when you meet them so how do you take me through that with what's the name of the product again is that i know it's solving the ten thousand dollar demo problem what are we calling it yeah shadow traffic and actually what you just said is a great example i've sort of wrapped up you know what i'm working on in a story you remember the story you remember the problem and that's mostly what matters i mean if if you have the problem you're eventually going to come back to me and it doesn't really matter what the name of the product is but the the problem was memorable and i think that's actually right there is a good example of you know wrapping things up in that particular way yeah yeah i feel like you've you've injured me somehow you've done some judo jedi mind trick that's what i'm clawing at yeah but yeah the product name is is shadow traffic i tried to come up with something that was sort of a visual representation of what what i'm trying to do which is to help people take what looks like realistic data and and apply it to their own you know safe settings staging environments testing that kind of thing okay so i faced this problem before when i'm like trying to start something up which is there's the chicken and egg problem right you you want you can't sell the thing to people until you've built it but you can't really build it until you've got someone sell it to because you need that kind of market feedback and i've tried what you've suggested which is building a website which kind of makes it look real but it's always kind of hollow unless you've got a product how are you clawing your way between that left leg right leg chicken and egg evolution thing to actually get to i assume you're trying to get the first customer i assume that's goalie right yeah yeah yeah i think the the key is to figure out what what is the what is the essence of what you're building what's the most important part it does feel hollow when when you're really good at products like you are and you can you can vision are these these 10 or these 15 things and when they all come together something great happens and that's true in your head but the trick is to sort of unwind it and say all right what's what's the one or the two things that are really really important and find a way to put that on display for me with shadow traffic the key is the the declarative api i've come up with an api that is shaped like your data and so the the overhead of interacting with shadow traffic is actually really small you take your data you copy it you paste it and then you change some little values in the end it actually ends up being very similar to what your data looks like and so that that's that's the key to it and so i tried to make a landing page that really emphasizes that that sort of shows shows that on full display and to me i kind of have to take a little bit of a leap of faith and say okay that that one unique feature is what's going to get people excited and it's going to allow me to go build the next 10 or 15 features on top of that that i think are also important and so i i try to stay motivated by figuring out yeah what's what's what's the new thing that's happening here that nobody else has and just focus on that hmm a key to this is empathy right you've got you've got to imagine the world from your customers point of view and there's no way around that exactly that's right do you worry that like design you're doing design by wishful thinking actually you're imagining how it would look and and planning to implement that do you worry that you're going to make a public promise that the api will look like this and then two weeks in find out that actually that's really hard and you can't deliver it yeah not so much i think this comes down to the the the build in public philosophy so there's two ways you can build products you can do the traditional way which is to say i have an idea i'm not going to tell anybody about it because i'm very worried people are going to steal it i don't want to make any public commitments otherwise people will will you know come and be mad at me and then you spend six months or a year or two years building it and then hopefully that's the thing that customers want more times than not that takes way more risk than the rewards you get the risk is it's actually not the thing that customers want people wouldn't have been mad if you put mock-ups in front of them in the first place and it just ends up being harder the diametric opposite of this is build in public which is to say nope i'm not worried anybody's going to steal my idea maybe somebody does but like i've got a bunch of other ideas in the queue that's fine and you just talk about it incessantly tell people what this is what i'm thinking what do you think give me feedback and so i'm three weeks into my first quarter of building four startups and four quarters right now and what have i done i've built a landing page and i built a prototype of the first product i've actually already gone out there over the last week and asked for feedback from as many people as i can showing my basic sketch of the api and what did it cost me i got tons of feedback i spent a week sketching that api i got some feedback that i need to change this this and this i'm gonna go do that and i'm certainly not gonna go try to sell anything fake that like i don't believe that i can do where i haven't done yet but i am going to constantly try to bridge that gap and say this is what's in my head what do you think and then get that feedback and sort of close close the the interface to the product over time what's it going to look like what's it going to feel like and i feel like this this is actually way more balanced i'm just i'm no longer worried that anybody's gonna steal my ideas people either think my ideas are dumb which are fine or they've got their own ideas which they're actually much more motivated to go do and yeah this has kind of been better for me in the long run i think you sound like you're actually enjoying marketing hey maybe i mean it's i if i look at kind of my overall skill set it's the the weakest thing but i do think it is the it's the gatekeeper to succeed you kind of have to try really hard at the thing that you know you maybe suck at but if you can get good at it it's the key that's going to unlock everything for you so yeah i'm leaning into it i don't think i'm very good at it right now but i completely believe that if i can build traction with marketing it's a key ingredient to success yeah something i realized years ago was that to make a successful business your best sometimes you think naive programmer you think the way to build a successful business is have to have a fantastic like product right or a fantastic idea actually if you can just it's more like building a table if you've got four reasonably stable legs you can build a table but you need all of those legs right so you need the products you need the marketing story you need a pricing structure you need you can't miss out any pieces but they don't have to be absolutely the best in the world that's totally right and i think the other way that's comforting for people like you and me to look at it is it's all building you know we sort of think of engineering as the building i write the code i compile it i've got that feedback loop i'm making something but marketing and sales are actually making things too just like to give you a quick example with marketing i built the website i've built the funnel i've i've built the messaging it's all being designed very carefully it's not like i'm sitting in a room throwing darts and saying i wonder what kind of like you know uh you know business marketing words i can use synergy and stuff i'm actually selecting words out of the thesaurus that i think are really good it's very very reason didn't end in detail and it's the same with with sales how do you construct a pitch that's going to lead people through that cycle of i wonder about x the answer is why i wonder about a the answer is b it's it's building all the way through and i think if you can think of it that way you can have a lot more fun because every day i wake up and i build something no matter what the domain happens to be that's a nice way of thinking about it for those of us who are in engineering persuasion fundamentally yeah yeah do you it sounds like you've done a fair bit to de-risk this process and one of the things you seem to be doing in de-risking it is by having this for startups in four quarters thing you're probably building an audience which will carry through even to if the first three ideas fail you're carrying in a natural audience across to the fourth one is that a happy coincidence or a deliberate plan yeah that's that's deliberate and i think it's something if you look around you know all your favorite people who are successful in business have built audiences for themselves i'm not trying to do it in a greedy way where i'm like courting attention at all costs i'm trying to make it win-win where the win for me is i have an audience but the win for anyone who follows me is you'll get a transparent log of how am i running my businesses you get to look at my successes and failures and learn from me and i think that's absolutely crucial i mean just i like to think about building an audience and making products succeed as communicating with a graph just picture a graph in your mind there's all these nodes that connect if you want to take a product to market you have to go to each of those nodes and say hey do you like my product or do you want to buy it the more tightly connected those nodes are the faster it is if you can just go to one big node which is like your personal network boom you're you're able to move pretty fast but if you're you're loosely connected to all these people how much longer is it going to take to go to every person and introduce your product convince them you have the problem see if they're willing to try it it just takes significantly long and so yeah i think there's real skill in this idea of audience building and particularly for the people who can make it you know win-win it's not not just sort of a one-way everyone listen to my ideas but to sort of build build a little bit of a community around what you're doing yeah yeah it's i would find your approach very scary but i can certainly see the logic to it like why do you think it would be scary for you so i know some people who are deeply motivated by public commitments right i'm thinking of a particular friend of mine who anytime he wants to do anything first thing he does is declare it to the world that he's going to do it that works for him it really doesn't work for me i find that it just either i succeed or a fail as i was going to either way but if i promised it and i fail it just hurts and all of my motivation is intrinsic the things i want to do it comes from just this burning need to do it yeah yeah i think i think power adds the pressure i don't need no yeah i think there's a lot of power in having lived enough years and and just having enough experience where you sort of know what you need to succeed the the route i'm taking of public commitment doesn't work for you totally fine if you know what works for you that's great you need to spend zero extra time figuring out how to motivate yourself and i think that that's really important because someday the pressure is going to be on the line and you want to be able to select the tools that are best going to equip you to to get to the finish line and i i think yeah the more you know about yourself in advance the more likely you are to succeed yeah one of the best things i ever learned about management was that there's no secret to motivating people because every person has a different way of being motivated i i always remember i worked with this guy who he in his spare time he was training for the olympics and he wasn't doing that well in the day job right and we were trying everything to try and get because we knew he had talent but it wasn't really working out and eventually one day i realized that i mean this is i'm going to sound like a manipulating people psychologically i just i figured out what made him tick any any work he would do i'd say that's great i need you to basically i need you to give me five more drop and give me five more you've done a good job but you need to push it harder and that was exactly what motivated right he was the kind of person who needed a coach that said run an extra mile and then he did his best work it's like that's not how i motivate myself but figuring out the different ways people motivate themselves was like yeah and then you realize you can apply that same rule to yourself and suddenly you can unlock something in yourself it's funny you bring that up i just finished a book called the talent code that talks about kind of why why are people good at different things and what's the process to getting there and there was an entire set of chapters about coaching and it was exactly what you said the best coaches in the world you imagine these people in the movies who are like giving motivational speeches in the locker room in this author's view it's mostly not at all like that in the real world with the most successful teams the best coaches are the ones who are adapting to every player and giving different kinds of feedback using different kinds of motivation and more often than not it's a quieter thing it's sort of like hey what do you need how can i communicate with you in a way that makes sense and it's usually not by by barking at someone it's sort of by figuring out in that case i need you to push a little bit further in other cases you need to be a little bit gentler and say hey you don't have to put so much pressure on yourself and i think yeah this is the hard part about business there's not really coaches i mean there's executive coaches out there i'm a little skeptical of them but a lot of this is trying to find your own way through a very almost every time you've got a unique set of problems and this is what makes it so fun you wake up every day in a business you've got such challenges that probably nobody else is exactly faced and you need to figure out how to you know wind your way through the maze and so there's value in doing what you say which is kind of learning to be your own coach learning what makes you tick and the people who can figure that out i think i think those are the ones that are you know most likely to succeed when pressure's on the line yeah you've reminded me of something else i quite liked talking back to your idea of building things something else i quite liked about the kind of mid phase of building a business which you end up as well as building these software systems you realize there are processes processes human interaction systems ways of dealing with particular needs of customers you end up building soft systems with the same architectural principles you'd use for building software systems right and that's a lot of fun and i shall envy you when you get to that stage yeah i i used to actually not like people management very much and i still i still wouldn't choose it for myself but a friend did kind of describe it to me in a way that made sense he said it's sort of like building an api you have this many teams okay what's the contract between them what's what's the purpose of these subsystems and then what's the output of each subsystem and how are they going to talk to each other the more you can kind of define that in a way that you could write on paper and say you can explain it to somebody in 60 seconds that's good people management i really respect that that actually changes my perspective from being okay i'm gonna lord over people and say you do this and you do this no it's it's a it's a design and the ones that that work really well they're the most consciously consciously crafted yeah yeah it's i find system architecture very satisfying and the fact that you can craft systems in completely different domains and it's still the same principles yeah that is satisfying let me take another thread through this because i think you're planning to build four businesses and here's another thing i would find very difficult okay so let's say you're at the end of quarter two your second business is an obvious failure you drop that and of course a three it's an obvious success okay cool then that's the one you run with what if you get to the end of a quarter and it's kind of ticking along and it's doing okay and maybe if you've got another couple of years in it will grow something sustainable how do you choose whether to put all your chips in or kill it oh i think i'll have to get back to you on that i consider a pretty maybe fortunate outcome if i was at least able to get to that level of traction where i was like maybe you know in three three months of effort maybe there's something here that that's actually a great outcome i think the exercise i'm gonna have to go through is to figure out okay how how much faith do i have in that idea based on just my intuition and the situation and then how small can i size my next bed it's not like i have to make each of these startup bets equally size i have some pretty small ideas that are sort of consumer oriented and i can do rather quickly in maybe six weeks for example and so i'm kind of just going to have to go through that motion but i do think in the end i'm either going to end up with a small set of multiple businesses that each do just a little bit of revenue and i'm kind of happy with or i'm gonna find the one that you know i i just i want to go all in on and maybe still keep it small but decide that this is my area focus but i mean this is probably the theme of this podcast it's an admission of not knowing i mean i've got a bunch of things i like i don't know what the market wants i don't know what's going to work in that particular moment i'm just going to try and then whatever kind of feels right to me at the time based on on my intuition and my judgment i'm gonna go with it and just knowing i don't have to stop at four and four i can i can do five six and seven if none of those work out too and i'm eventually going to succeed at this i'm pretty pretty determined how do you how do you deal with i mean okay so you can you can say i don't know for sure but i know today but how do you deal with the fact that you you're sure it's the right thing to do for today and next week you wake up and you're unsure and the week after that you're sure again and human emotions they're very fickle they flow in and out like they're tired and how do you take the average of how you're feeling one thing i was hoping to do a little bit better than the last time i did this was to to get off the roller coaster everybody talked about the startup roller coaster one day you feel incredible you've got a new lead for customers it seems like you're going to close a deal the next day or the next week something terrible has happened a critical employee has quit the customer lead fell through it's just awful i was sort of hoping i'd be able to get off that roller coaster this time so far i really haven't i actually sort of feel the swings in my emotion but i do feel like a key to succeeding at this over time is to neutralize that and say it's not it's not going to have no emotion but oh i've seen enough situations where i i have a customer lead i know there's still probably like a 15 chance that i'm going to close them as a customer if they end up walking away that's 85 of the time i just know that that's going to be the case and so you know i think it's going to be a combination of just doing this enough to get like the volume kind of stabilize me and then the other is is sort of like a mantra that i have is like just just ride the road in front of you like there's a lot of miles up the road that i still have to kind of go through i'm just focused on today and i think it's the only sane way to deal with it i'm selectively blocking out the long term and saying i've got this situation that i need to do if i do it really well that's great and if i do it really well tomorrow that's great and if i have a month or two months or three months where every day i just do great in what i'm doing i'm gonna have better long-term results because of that big long-term successes are just lots of little short-term successes chained together and so yeah every day i feel a little bit overwhelmed i just say to myself just ride the road in front of you the marketing thing that's not working well i'll deal with that next week the the customer email that i need to respond to another day right now i need to solve this problem of of this bug in the software and just kind of having that that selective vision i would say yeah it's funny it reminds me again it's like something we're very used to as programmers which is sundays as a programmer you feel like a genius and some days you feel like a and you just keep writing the software until it works right you keep plugging with it yeah i think some of that is overcoming beliefs that are not true i mean like why why do you feel like a on some days well maybe you did a typo that like is incredibly obvious when you wake up the next morning but it's some it's some part of your subconscious you kind of believe hey at my level of seniority i should never do that when clearly that's not the case everybody does that and so some of this is defeating those subconscious beliefs that just frankly aren't true unfortunately i i think it's a bit like pulling dandelions in a garden where you pull them out one day and more show up the next but the more you kind of till the till the weeds back the you know the clear of a mind that you can have yeah in a way you're talking about depressuring things for yourself mentally and that makes me wonder if someone came along with a vc fund and said michael i think you're a genius here's a million dollars now that comes with the main string that it's higher pressure would you take it no definitely not i think it comes back to knowing what what are your goals for yourself so for me i i don't want to have that external commitment even if the the reward may be higher yeah i'm just can't say that i'm all that interested in it i'm actually not sure at this stage the kind of person that i am whether the pressure would really be higher like i've managed to put a fair amount of pressure on myself to succeed with the public commitment thing but i think yeah it's kind of like knowing what your goals are and what you respond to so in this moment my goals are to run a small lifestyle business and the the pressure that i work well with is to have public commitments and so you know i use the word depressure but i think it's sort of like how do you set yourself up in the right situation with the right motivation and when you kind of get that into balance between the right i'm working on something fun that i love and i'm also properly motivated by it that's this sweet spot where you know it's allowing me to sit down for eight hours a day during the week and just totally focus on what i'm doing and and not second guess it for the most part yeah okay so avoiding pressure but aligning it to what suits you i can say that this also plays into i mean talking about pressures and motivations let's talk about your your support system here specifically how does your wife feel about this you just quit the job when you've got two small children and as far as she can tell you're in the shed noodling on marketing plans yeah i think these things are a household effort so when i was doing my first company i hadn't yet met my wife but it was kind of fortunate in that i got to spend a whole bunch of time when i was younger just as i said brute forcing the problem i had as much time as i really needed and at the time when i met my wife i was sort of at the end of my my company she had met me as someone who was like clearly an entrepreneur like this this is what i want to do with myself this is what i love i get up and i try to make things and show them people and see if i can be funny and so when i went to work at confluence she kind of understood that like that was going to be a face of life for me that i was eventually going to get back to it and so i think you really do have to have the people in your life who are going to route you on with this i mean i i talk about you know waking up and being focused but i do have many moments of self-doubt and i think without the people around me who are gonna can help get me back up you know even even companies that are composed of one person they're not really one people they're they're you and then they're all the people who are rooting iran and keeping you going give you an example from my last comment we had just a catastrophic moment when our our initial product just didn't work we were basically running out of money we didn't know what we're gonna do i was just like on the floor i didn't know what to do our corporate lawyer of all people basically picked me back up and and helped talk me through how am i going to make this work i'm going to turn this around and it was a key moment for me and i think without those kinds of people in your life you just really need them to help you when you're down because it's going to happen you're going to have the feelings where it's just like i'm in the darkest possible place and you need a mixture of your your own drive to get out of it and then people to also help you along the way because it's it's never just you yeah if you hit that point again are you going to stick with this commitment of publicly talking about that as well in your in your marketing i i think so i've gotten enough messages where people have been thankful to kind of see a little bit what's on the inside of my head as i start this and i'm trying to balance you know what's what's going well well i'm i'm starting to build a little bit of traction in my product what's going that well i have moments of self-doubt all the time and and people kind of like hearing that that balance perspective if i just sort of get to the end of this and i'm like i cannot do it anymore i can promise i'm not going to go out you know quietly i'll talk about it because i i just think there's so much value that can be created by walking people through your mindset of like okay i failed at this why what are the consequences what can i do now and i hope not to have to do that but it'll be painful if i do but yeah i guess it's just kind of my way of maybe giving back to all the people who helped me it's sort of a scalable way to help other people to say here's here's my journey here's why i ended up make of it what you will maybe you can use some of this for yourself maybe not yeah it seems like a very non-silican valley way to behave though success yeah with all the love in the world silicon valley i think sometimes the priorities are a little bit skewed let's say that yeah i mean it's an example of that i noticed kind of everything that's celebrated in our world a lot of it is is fundraising how much money did you raise and this was certainly true before the bubble i mean so many companies raised just insane amounts of money and and that was the thing that was celebrated much less what product did you build and what traction did you get and i i was just kind of sick of all that i mean people can do what they want but what am i going to focus on myself i really want to build businesses that i know succeeded because of my own skill that's the thing that i care about and so i'm trying to build that culture around me that set of people who who values that kind of success yeah do you hope though to reach the point where you're hiring people and this becomes a larger concern maybe i think at least for the next year i'm pretty eager to try to just take a solo run at it and say how can i take this automation thing to the the highest possible level how can i as an individual put my skills on display of building marketing selling storytelling writing i i'm kind of like the person who wants to do decathlon i want to do all the events and yeah maybe i'm not going to have as big as a paycheck as i could if i was going to like found a larger company but at least for a year or two i really want to do try to see if i can make all my skills shine i know i've got weak points but in the worst case this next year is going to be education for me i'm paying for my tuition i'm failing at this and that but i'm going to get better at it and the worst that's going to happen is i'm going to patch over those rough areas and i'm going to come out of it a lot stronger for my next thing yeah yeah and and we get to watch along for the ride which is interesting i i have to make you promise to come back at the end of one of these experiments and be retrospective let's do it i'll give you the whole thing you know if people want to follow along i'm writing you know once a week on a sub stack i just write a little short column what did i do this week what worked well what didn't but yeah i think it would be a lot of fun to come and give the maybe the the verbal full-length overview of what happens i i've already kind of got you know a bit of a bit of a story so far about you know shadow traffic how is how is build in public helped me how is my marketing working and not working i think it'd be really fun to to kind of yeah unpack all of it all after after 12 weeks yeah especially seeing that from programmers mindset that i think certainly i can relate to more easily than someone who's got background in marketing writing out their technical experience yeah absolutely yeah cool well we will definitely get you back and in the meantime we'll put a link
