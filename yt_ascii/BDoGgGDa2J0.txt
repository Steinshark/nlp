ladies and gentlemen if you know anything about chess then you obviously know grandmaster hikaru nakamura now if you got into chess at any point in 2020 2021 you may have associated myself with a lot of hikaru's content i was doing a lot of commentary on his twitch channel alongside international master anna rudolph we were covering his tournaments we were doing a lot of sub battles and collabs but at some point after about a year year and a half of doing a lot of collabs together i informed them that i really wanted to focus on my own thing i wanted to focus more on youtube do a little bit less streaming i didn't always want to be associated as the guy who was like trying to you know ride hikaru's coattails or far more offensive things that involved writing of a certain variety and i decided to focus on my own stuff and since then anytime hikaru and i stream on twitch it's always questions about the other person it's always you guys have a beef do you guys have this and that no in fact the purpose of today's video is to let you know that we have teamed up gotham and hikaru have formed the gotham knights of the pro chess league and online 4 versus 4 rapid league where your average rating has to be 25.50 and today is a recap of our first round matchup it's gotham knights led by hikaru nakamura grand master liam lay and the two international masters andy woodward who is the world number one under 12 years old player as well as natalia buxar who's a like a top five ukrainian woman that was our lineup for the first week versus a stacked team of grandmasters from berlin so it's gotham versus berlin and folks when i tell you that today's recap is not what you expect i mean you just saw magnus nearly go down let me tell you something right now it's really this is some wild stuff stick around all right for the first recap of gotham vs berlin now i don't know what's going on on chess.com today both he and karo and his opponent have been relegated from u.s and germany to god knows where this event began and hikaru played this this is known as the baloch defense and let me tell you something right now when i saw this i damn near had a heart attack now i hikaru played this a couple of days ago in title tuesday and of course he just demolished people and i was like all right listen i trust the guy stockfish is having a little bit of an aneurysm but as it turns out if white plays too passively which his opponent did and you may you may ask yourself why is he playing her everybody plays everybody in the protest league so if a team of four team of four there are 16 points up for grabs so one plays four and then it keeps rotating and there's a link in the description if you want to see more e5 and hikaru just did normal things he developed all his pieces he played long castle and he had an excellent position and he still had nine minutes on the clock and i was like all right you know what hikaru is playing this goofy opening you know he's a little little bit of maybe a little bit the disrespect speed run but i saw this position i was like oh my god i mean he's just completely winning like how does he do this to people really like it's ridiculous i mean this is a 2350 feet a rated woman like i mean how should destroy all of you he just plays the blog defense and he's doing this i mean h5 g5 i'm like look at this look at this position now the computer didn't like g5 computer thought he could play a little bit more accurately hikaru decided all right i'm gonna take the knight g4 and knight d5 like oh just galloping into the position and she just defended i mean she was doing her best right g3 hikaru plays she plays f3 and then hikaru went here and right at this moment i was on the broadcast with danny wrench and robert hess and the car was losing now i was like well your car is losing because it's probably like a 10 move sequence well hikaru played queen f6 because he decided that he was going to invite this move and he was going to checkmate his opponent he was going to play take take here here here just mate how do you stop that you stop that like this first you do this and queen h4 is stopped and when black goes here this is mate this is checkmate but you know who saves the day the night and i think when hikaru played queen f6 and then saw this whole sequence he just forgot two backwards night moves and folks i got news for you not all blunders are the same some blunders take games from equal to slightly worse hikaru is dead lost c4 game over like the worst type of blunder it just ends the game it doesn't matter that she has two minutes hikaru wins a hikaru just down a rook and she just pulled she sacrifices she goes check queen d6 and literally just makes a new queen and he resigns resigns resigns resigns the game like i was like what what just happened hikaru laws to their board fall oh my god no now in the back of my mind i had a feeling we would be all right i had a feeling but let me tell you something right now if you ask me how would i like to start this match it's not a hikaru losing to the board for i'm terrified i'm like what is so we lose the first man 3-1 hikaru loses liam on board on board two wins andy woodward and natalia both go down so we're down 3-1 now what do we know about being down 3-1 well if you're the golden state warriors a whole hell of a lot but i don't you know three one is a is a scary score line so it's now i mean we gotta we gotta bounce back in the next round right in the next round we have a matchup dimitri colors gm dimitri versus natalia buxa their ratings are much higher than this these are their chess.com rapid ratings and nobody plays nobody title plays rapid online because we play blitz and bullet because we all have adhd nobody can focus for that long so all these ratings are fake i mean dimitri is like 2600 natalia is like 23 something or 2400 feet and this game was an anti-sicilian like knight c3 trying to play for d4 we will have multiple hikaru games later fret not d3 d6 and i mean natalia you know she she she's getting super gm'd here all right he he's trying to give up the second bishop and he's trying to just grind out like a solid positional victory and she's like ball i'm not gonna take i'm gonna play rook c8 and then i'm gonna play here in g6 and come back all the way to b8 and now to d7 rock solid position for black dimitri plays bishop d5 she plays here and here and he has a lot of good going for him in this position but in chess it's not about having a lot of good going for you like you gotta win the game so he goes for it d4 d4 doesn't come without risks they both have 250 on the clock and the position is dead equal right so he understands that he he's got it like he has to win the game that's that's that's basically all it is and well his risk is quite handsomely rewarded pawn takes knight takes takes takes and i mean the clamp is beginning and he's playing fast dimitri is a 3 000 rated bullet player but natalia will not be denied f5 hitting the center three times and now queen hits the knight rook b4 queen goes to f7 we have a trade but here comes collars she takes he takes she takes queen b2 pinning the rook to the king f4 all right and now colors is winning if he plays check and takes and i don't know how he didn't see that that's just a free pawn queen b8 he's got no time on the clock so he goes here i mean they got 20 seconds right so blunders are gonna happen knight d7 he still infiltrates he's getting closer knight f6 takes takes rook d6 queen a6 was better here but here she gives a check natalya has forced the draw in a crazy time scramble 10 seconds each she plays queen g3 and here here is a draw take here and back but here is mate rook e2 [music] you can give a check the king is safe colors had to go here because this is rook g1 he plays the wrong move and loses and our board four beats their board too as far as i'm concerned colors is their board one i think he's the best player on the team so the board fours take down arguably the best players well on our team hikaru is the best player collars and savannah are very close but as far as i'm concerned before beats board one what what is going on in this match this is crazy so we have to so first of all that happens first of all that happens second of all in the second game yeah i mean liam was just liam was just unbelievable like for us he was in the early going after hikaru's setback liam was just playing smart solid chess he was just doesn't matter queen's off the board sending us to an a multiple piece middle game end game equal material but just grinding it down grinding down positional game look at this poor night look at the poor knight he wins upon rock solid he's gonna win a second pawn he wins the second pawn he's now up to i mean he was smooth like butter criminal undercover like oh my goodness was so good in the first few rounds he was not to be denied he played i gotta show you this game i gotta show you this game he had a game against rasmus funny who was there board one all right it was a catalan rasmus mana rock solid you know catalani's defending the position and then my guy liam plays knight e4 brings the knight back brings his queen out brings his knight back brings his rook up and over in a couple of moves and he just launches a monster attack on russ massana he plays knight into f6 h4 knight drops back h5 d five and the black position is completely falling apart takes takes queen e4 g4 you move the knight it's made you move the knight it's made five seconds on the clock for ross misfonic he plays queen g7 and liam ends this game in style he trades rooks he opens it up who he doesn't take the queen he doesn't take the queen queen h7 and the arabian mate he checkmate at him and he said habibi good game rook h7 liam getting it done liam in his first three rounds was 3-0 and it wasn't even close he was so good he was so so so so so so sharp and while liam was taking care of business all right you knew hikaru needed to bounce back so what did he do what did hikaru do in order to bounce back he played akg aggressive opening against frederick svana so they're brothers all right we got frederick and rasmus it's like playing an anime team and the engine always thinks that these king's indian style games are very very promising for black all right so b3 a3 c4 and so on now knight d4 knight f3 and he had a nice position but look at hikaru hikaru was like all right i lost that first game time to go g5 full steam ahead on this side of the board black trying to defend himself hikaru bringing the rooks over knight takes e5 he's got the rook taking on c5 and queen g4 and the black position is hanging on by a thread there's this pressure rook c7 bishop d5 this this f4 you know i'm trying to do my best of hikaru impression bishop d4 back and now there it is f4 if bishop takes f4 queen takes f4 you can't take because of this if checked then i drop back so bishop h6 and hikaru just went in and found this beautiful little idea to hit the rook and bishop f5 and a powerful bounce back win from hikaru who makes sure that first round game was nothing but a fluke he and liam were just doing wonders and you know who was also awesome all right this dude i don't know what happened to their flags they just completely remove their flags that's weird so philippians 46 bible verse that's not andy's official name his name is andy woodward see the guy playing with black his name is right there so frederick savannah this was a last round game berlin needed to make a comeback the only way that they were going to survive this match was by making a comeback and andy had a nice position with some decent pressure so you know the the grand master opponent playing with black he's got a he's got to he's got to fight back he's got to play for a win and then andy finds this really nice idea sacrificing his pawn to play this and knight f6 knight h5 this is so smart forcing a draw the king cannot escape if king goes here i have this and i win and if king g8 knight f6 and if this then this andy woodward with the white pieces in the final round we're winning so draws get us to the end taking down the grand master the the seasoned veteran with the with the nifty little trick to jump his knight in and sacrifice it knight h5 if you take check and it's a draw it's a geometric draw you cannot escape super clutch idea from him andy was nice in the match he had he ended up with one and a half out of four i mean he did what he had to do as a board three against the tank three grand master lineup andy woodward was no joke and when you needed him most when you needed him most the big boss the big boss came back all right this game encapsulates everything it is to play against hikaru all right like knight f3 d5 is a board once all right these are the gladiators the board ones dead symmetrical position hikaru play a car's opponent plays c4 he takes and hikaru played this against magnus he actually played this in a recent match against magnus knight a3 c5 and so on dc knight a6 here here knight d4 knight d5 and knight c4 now if you just take a look at this position it's completely symmetrical after 10 moves i mean hikaru was going full meme mode full meme mode all right knight c4 knight b4 take take and then right here something happened there was a forcing sequence hikaru went for which is bishop d4 ab4 cb2 now a lot of things are happening here hikaru's bishop is hanging right so this sequence after cb2 queen d4 the engine gives an absolutely stupid move here which is knight c3 the queens face each other if you take knight e2 but if this then black has take take take take queen d5 f3 take bishop h6 here here and like king f8 and draw ba five pawns each draw but hikaru plays this first he does not play knight c3 and suddenly i've hikaru started like seriously doubting the position on stream it was being relayed to me because he he doesn't stream with the chat because of fair play but people were saying hikaru thinks he's losing he just thinks he's straight up lost i was like what and i think he thought he was losing because of knight a5 with really big problems for the black position like if black just tries to fight like this suddenly this and mate and if you try to stop mate rook c1 and whites pieces are just absolute monsters i mean every piece white has is asking pro is asking for problems it's a really really really tough position all right i mean it's but this is like no joke absolutely no joke so bishop h6 knight f6 bishop b7 queen b7 is what gets played in the game hikaru thought that after queen c7 knight a5 yeah that's i mean he he thought it was understood now the computer here finds a way it finds a way to defend the position but ross must find it plays one move that's not accurate when you play one move that's not accurate against hikaru it's over remember his first round game that he lost to the board four that blunder there was no coming back from it was like a catastrophic blunder a one in a million blunder lightning strike type of blunder rasmus funny gives back the advantage hikaru very quickly consolidates dead symmetry right oh oh oh equal game is a draw not when you play hikaru he sneaks in rook comes out queen comes out queen comes forward and suddenly two minutes 19 seconds and hikaru does what he does to people all the time he gets an end game he absolutely freezes the white pieces and white has 10 seconds to defend himself in a dead equal end game but it's not that equal because hikaru grabs the pawn and he forces the white knight back infiltrates with his rook in his knight and it's over the pawns all fall like dominoes and it's the d-pawn that's gonna walk forward and hikaru seals the deal for the gotham knights seals the deal folks night in the corner and gotham knight's win 9-7 in our opening round matchup against the berlin bears score breakdown hikaru ended with three lost the first game won the next three liam won his first three games he was three for three but he lost in the last round to kolars who i think is probably the best player on the team kalar said great positions like the whole day really he had really really tough games he is he's definitely the superstar i think on the on the berlin team tough match but i would be willing to bet that hikaru and liam hikaru and ferisev who was also on our roster are a nasty one-two combo the canada chess bras have magnus and geary we have hikaru and liam and i got news for you we got the world number one under 12 andy woodward he had one and a half points and natalia buxo was clutch beating collars in a time scramble we also have nurgus
