when i saw that someone stole a billion dollars in nfts by right-clicking all of them i instantly wanted to steal them too after all it's just kind of funny the idea of having every nft in existence contained in one single hard drive lucky for me the person who created it hosted the project on something called nft bay and he offered a torrent for anyone who wanted it yes i know lock me up i was here to steal all your nfts that was the plan except well there's a pretty big file now looking at my current disk size i decided that would be kind of impractical and even if i wanted to download this it would take me like six months with my current internet speed so my next idea was just to contact the creator jeffrey and see if he'd be willing to help me find some way to get the files faster i told him to think of the kits his response was this he said it's dangerous to actually get them ipfs is essentially dark web downloading images from dark web and distributing them on mass would be a lovely way to get to jail fast especially if you're talking about blindly just downloading them all now i was confused he had downloaded them why couldn't i he replied i took steps to protect myself and anyone who jumped on the torrent it's funny actually maybe we can catch up tomorrow i decided that would be a good idea maybe he could explain how he could get this billion dollar nft heist but when i got on the call our conversation took a totally different turn and i want you to hear it wait a second the nft bay holds all the nfts but doesn't no it doesn't when i created the project originally i said it was an art project and i along the way i realized to demonstrate the message that needed to be conveyed to teach people about nfts the actual data did not matter what is the message i mean you have a 17 terabyte file well the message is what are people actually purchasing with nfts coffee like what do you what do people think that they're actually purchasing i imagine they think they're buying a picture basically right the rights to a picture most of the time most of the time that's most what most people think of in a teaser yeah the one way i like to look at it is you've got one side that's essentially selling a treasure map or directions on how to get to treasure and the other side thinks that they're buying treasure the actual treasure on one side we've got people that think that they're buying the artwork the treasure right and that's what they think is value and the other side we have people exploiting those people so and selling treasure maps how to get to the treasure so what i wanted to highlight in in the project is a lot of people were saying that the image is valuable the artwork is valuable because it's stored on the blockchain it's not stored in the blockchain it's just a hyperlink wait wait hold on a second when i buy an nft of a board ape or a lazy lion i'm not actually purchasing that picture what am i actually buying no you're essentially buying a a piece of data and that data is has a link to where the image can be located so like a url is that what you're saying it's a url go look at e for scan and look at the contract and have a look at it literally people are buying a link like directions on a treasure map to a treasure and they're saying that the treasure of the artwork and the only reason people are buying stuff is for the treasure or the artwork but what's actually been sold is the directions to the treasure wait a second i know a lot of people like why not just host the file on the blockchain why not just host the picture on the blockchain because the cost the cost in 2016 it was calculated it would cost 76 000 per gigabyte to store on the blockchain oh it's gotta have gotten worse way worse there's been block chain size increases and the costs have got worse it'd be nice to do that calculation again but yeah so back to your original question what's in the torrent well it contains chunks of blockchain data the nfts themselves and it the rest is if you're from a unix background f allocate now when i launched the project i said specifically that this would be uploaded to internet archive and it's now on the internet archive and it serves as just an example of of the art project of spreading the message of what people are actually purchasing and it compressed from' terabytes down to 12 gigabytes you're gonna really people off with this one i got to tell you geoffrey finding this out i do find it ironic that number one i was so excited about this i just took it at face value but also i noticed a lot of media companies did too i mean you got the bbc the verge vice and many more to run articles about this nft heist i guess you heisted the nfts but everyone's thinking of you like right-clicking nfts but you didn't do that no it's actually quite dangerous to heist or the nfts because if you think about it what's actually happening is that nft by definition is essentially an artwork is a linking to a file yeah right and if you were to download all the links to file and then you were to share that with the world that's actually quite legally dangerous oh right well because it could have anything on there anyways it's the internet it can have anything ipfs is essentially the dark web right and anyone can put anything onto the blockchain anyone can put anything onto the blockchain and so if you're talking about downloading all the links from all the blockchain and then serving that that's probably a bad idea was that an intended effect of this whole project is that like most people would not only confuse you but also just take you at face value sort of like what people are doing with nfts where i'm buying a board ape i see a picture of a board ape so i assume that's what i'm buying but in actual fact you're telling me i'm actually buying a like a hyperlink or like a pointer to that file which i technically do not own i mean i or do i it's confusing you don't own it yeah it is confusing there actually are some nfts and to be clear there's some nfts where the quality of the nft is so poor it's like pixel art that they don't need to link it to elsewhere they don't need a link as a hyperlink but that is like the exception most are actually hyperlinks to an image kotaku described it as the heist of the century right because like all the nfts have been downloaded it's always was a performance artwork just to write that their unpopular culture of everyone one side is saying these have value and the other side is saying they don't have value and it was just this beautiful pop culture piece to like focus the narrative on educating people what they're actually buying so in some ways yes it was a heist but it wasn't the highest of the actual images well it was actually somewhat of a media heist yeah and also kind of the highest of what the nft's actually are right because you you did actually download the blockchain in the the the nft bay so in a way you actually have the what actually those people own which is the hyperlinks but you don't have the files which they also don't have which is kind of yeah that i get i get what you're doing you're going to mix a lot of people off with this one but i do have to ask okay do you own the ifps like address like let's say i buy i buy a pudgy penguin do i own that domain where the file is located what do i own you own a entry in a database that directs you how to access that image on ipfs that's it so theoretically someone could go in and change the data at the ifps or the drive link or wherever they're storing the data it happens all the time if you're following nfts and the developments it's called a rug pull they sell the database entry on blockchain and blockchain is immutable and it cannot be updated but they host the image elsewhere say on google photos or google drive and then once the art is art is sold the database entry is sold they just switch it to a picture of a rug okay so yeah so it's a play on the rug pool that's good that's really is that common it's super common so this was this isn't a rug pool this is something else this is originally and always was meant to be something that's a little bit funny it's a pop cultural reference and also spark conversation about intellectual property ownership and is the nft valuable it is funny that all these people who see themselves as like seeing through what an nft is covered your piece but didn't understand actually what it was myself sort of included here's my thought if this is all true like doesn't this mean that people who the joke of like right click save as you know of somebody else's nfc picture whatever it's kind of like they own it more than you do as the nft owner you own the blockchain like database link like you own a link they own you don't even own the link you just have a link they own the actual data who owns the pudgy penguin more the guy with the actual data or the guy with like the pointer to the data that's exactly that's what's so funny that's why i use the expression treasure maps and treasure right so if you have the treasure the pudgy penguin you have the treasure meanwhile everyone is selling links or links to the treasure now this is the funny thing let's say the pudgy penguin exists on a web host somewhere there's nothing stopping people from creating multiple links or multiple nfts or multiple treasure maps to that treasure and it happens all the time there is no proof of authenticity you can create it's you can have one treasure and a thousand treasure maps i guess they would argue oh it's just about who's creating the treasure map if it's like yeah this is what's confusing to me look i'm gonna play devil's advocate for a second here i think a lot of people would say okay this is very cute but everyone just sort of accepts nfts have value and there has to be a place for digital artists this is where i'm at i think it's good that we can digital artists can make a living i just think it's been hijacked by a bunch of scams what do you think this means for what nfts are or could be sold as it's a tough question i suppose we have to look at where we are right now in society if we look at things very carefully we have over a billion dollars in venture capital invested by venture capitalists like a solid billion of venture capital has been poured into the technology industry to find a use for blockchain our technologists have yet to find a proper use for blockchain we're still trying to find the use at the same time we have social media influencers that are available for purchase and then finally we have the final final thing which is the communities we have dowse which essentially you you buy a token the token the best way i can explain that is timeshare so to join the community you buy a piece of timeshare and now your ownership of that timeshare you're now incentivized to promote it so we've got companies who invested money in company we've got venture capitalists convention a lot of money into companies incentivized to promote we've got social media influencers who are getting paid to promote and get a cut and now all of a sudden we've got communities themselves that are now incentivized to promote so it's really hard to tell what is natural if we we look back historically at how communities formed people turn up around an art project because they love it they think it's cool it's got a vibe it's got what else have you but now with tokenization of everything people are turning around and turning up because they can make coin they're financially vested in this thing doing well i do think it's weird too look sometimes when i call out scams the community freaks out i mean because they are financially sort of vested they're activist investors basically is what they what you can create if you sort of have these communities like spring up do you think nfts are worthless i don't know i do know that a lot of people are being exploited aiming left to help hold the bag it's funny you mention any criticism because any criticism automatically gets said that's that's fun right right they just they just dismiss it all as fud yeah it doesn't matter how rational of a of an argument you can put forward that even the technology industry is seriously divided about these technologies and we've yet to find a util a usage for it but meanwhile we've got art galleries with 1.4 million twitter followers about to do an nfc gallery sale and we've got people i'm getting emails as a result in a t bay of people like i don't have a job i'm trying to put my son through college i've just got some coin i saw i got the the crypto the crypto.com wallet i've got the coinbase wallet which coins should i purchase can you give me some free nfts i want to i want to change my life i think a lot of people are going to take issue with the idea there's been no use found for it i think a lot of people are gonna say okay yeah it's a new technology they're gonna liken it to the internet look the internet you couldn't have expected much early on you would have missed what it's gonna become and how it's gonna change everything they would say look same thing with crypto give us 10 years we'll build that future you kind of got to just like trust us it's factually correct that we've yet to find actual use for this technology yet does it mean that in the future we make like money i mean like for guys like as like a currency i mean as like these these smart chain things they they're really interesting i think there's some cool uses of it i think you could make the argument oh you can do everything that you can do on a smart chain in like a website or whatever but i guess the idea is that it's you can decentralize it you don't have to have anything running it you can replace a lot of fin stuff with like new fintechs i don't know i think you could find something yeah but that's i i'm open i went through the early internet and i see a lot of things that people are building it reminds me of the early internet so i'm hoping that there could be value in the future but the thing that that worries me right now and especially in the nft space i'm getting emails from people who are essentially saying i'm buying coins because i hope to change my life right so we still haven't found utility and meanwhile the the these coins are increasing in value there's these if you go to twitter spaces coffee and just any of the twitter spill twitter spaces you'll hear the scams are so brazen oh i absolutely agree i mean i share your your deep concern that a lot of these coins are going to just wreck people i suppose what i'm getting at is is now the right time for those type for those people who are desperate and who could be exploited to be getting into crypto no but you can't stop them from you can't stop them from trying and people are all very excited about the technology yeah it's very interesting i think a lot of people who missed the tech boom are trying to get in on the blockchain and get themselves rich without understanding what's sort of going on and this is why i find this project actually so interesting is because you're sort of uncovering that like a lot of us do not understand nfts too well like when you here's another question when when i buy an nft do i own the copyright to that nft some nfts yes there they there are things like board api club they specifically have gone out there and said that you do and this is why you're starting to see things like bought at your club on shoes etc right they they are the they are the exception the majority of the things that you're seeing now that are created that is not the case do you think some people say not even the picture right right right you're all right yeah you you own the hyperlink to the picture it's so confusing do you agree with people like garyvee who think that in the future all contracts are gonna sort of be signed on the blockchain or done on the blockchain or you know stuff like this like nfts basically are going to be tokenized versions of ownership that could represent anything a house insurance contract anything i've been thinking a lot about that actually i've been actually thinking of v2 of the nft bay we've got something cooking but that's not for now but specifically been thinking about gary vee and what he's saying there if you look at how people use their devices right now like the younger generations they create alternative accounts they create sock puppet accounts they're not they're not under their real names yeah right so the way they're using technology and their privacy model is very different so if we go to that go to that idea that everything's conducted on the blockchain if we're talking about what the blockchain is it means anyone can read anyone can read how much money you have where you shop where you where you visit which place which which airline you use like if everything is on the blockchain as they talk about that essentially means anyone can read anything about your lives and if we look at where we are right now in society we're seeing a lot of pushback over facebook and how facebook is run and how they're using that information in bad ways and if we if we hit this blockchain nirvana where everything's on the blockchain that we've created a world that is much worse than just facebook instead of a singular company owning our data no one essentially owns your data anyone can read your data and that's anyone right because i guess right now we just have a bunch of wallet addresses and so it seems like everyone's anonymous we could fast forward this five years most of these wallet addresses are gonna have names attached to them you're gonna see the macy's you know if if the utopia comes true i guess you're gonna see the target blockchain you're gonna see so when you see your buddy's wallet you're gonna see everywhere they shop well right now there's there's actually two real huge identifiers you can buy an e s domain or dot eth and that will actually assign a name to it to a wallet and that will actually de-anonymize the wallet i've seen videos of yourself copy where you've looked at nft scams where they've actually like like that's the name it's no longer a wallet address it's a name you can talk over the radio with right and the other thing is you can always see what currently you can see how much money is in a wallet or how much money someone owns or has and how much money was transacted but with nfts it's not necessarily just about money it can be a contract and right now the contract is a link to an image what happens in the world that we talk about the the benefits of immutability and data on the blockchain is immutable and that is a great thing but is it really like if anyone can publish anything as a link and send it to your to your wallet is that a great thing for society yeah i mean you could send all sorts of crazy stuff anything and we we learned a lot of lessons in web one web two about spam did we not sure yeah well you already see that in wallets where like open like an open sea they've had to make it possible to hide certain parts because people were getting all these basically fake collections spammed into their wallets famous people's wallets so that other people would see that and see perceived value to that collection that's exactly it so what we've managed to create right now in the nft space is a world where you've got to spend money to get rid of images that someone has sent you in the spam now individual like open c they have the ability to hide said images and wallets but that that data is always there on the blockchain what happens if that that what is said to you is not what is what was sent to you was not just like some art to try and pump their own collection what happens if it was something worse like a legal material basically well i'll give you an example we we had things like the fappening right or the celebrities they their nudes got hacked sure what happens when some person publishes the fappening and essentially right now you can publish that information onto their social media profile and it's like them nude and it's immutable it's always on the blockchain and you can never get rid of it quit talking to us about the negatives jeffrey i want to hear about how to pump my bags i'm just yeah so that's an example that is that is an example so we built these systems where essentially you have to pay money yeah to burn the nft or the nft which could be abuse material yeah but even if you burn it it's always going to be attached to your name right the record the record of it will always be there yeah somebody i guess somebody theoretically could send you a token with your address in the metadata like your personal address yes you could craft a token to docs oh my god against your name that's terrible and then everyone can see it it is everyone can see it we will see tokens for doxing so we built this open world of utopian nirvana and people are so focused on making money now i'm kind of kind of getting into some of some ideas i have for future things to demonstrate points but hopefully through this where i also sit down with educated people as well that yeah in the future it's very possible we'll have tokens for doxing people and it's permanently attached to your wallet address and so the idea is okay i'll just burn my wallet i'll get a new wallet it's easy to get a new wallet right and then some person you see the stuff that happens on youtube and the drama like some person just like oh they've got a new wall all right let's dox them again and there's no mitigations there's no spam filters there's no nothing anyone can write anything on the blockchain and send it to your wallet it's a inbox a spam inbox that anyone can write to with no mitigations right now i guess that except that it costs them money if you can get your casino advertised on kanye west's social media profile is it worth 100 definitely so cost isn't even even a barrier so you're highlighting all these problems of a technology do you think that the innovations will scale i mean i think with all things like usually technology tries to innovate to solve technologies problems that it sort of created and you sort of have all these knock-on second-order effects you didn't expect like you built a blockchain oh great oh and then someone got docs on your blockchain okay well let's build some way to do that do you think that's that's viable or are you like pessimistic about our ability to do that i don't know what i do know is it's way too early for vulnerable people to be to be buying into an ecosystem where there is a billion dollars of venture capital in there's in social media influences creating hype and getting paid for it and you've got communities who are incentivized to hype right and if someone isn't aware of these three factors in the ecosystem they could confuse that for an ability to get rich now as a result of the nft bay i've actually had regulators from different governments contact me because they actually want to know about nfts they're finding it very hard to actually find someone who is not incentivized by nfts because everyone they speak to has either got a company or they've got entities they're trying to sell so they can't even get a straight answer from a legislative point of view meanwhile they're getting cut calls from people in their country saying i invested all this money and i'm left holding the bag and i got scammed can you please do something well why are they going to you you have all the nfts you're very heavily incentivized to you got all of them to talk well about them that's really interesting yeah i imagine from a like a country standpoint it's very hard to see it does feel like people are divided either you have nfds and you love nfts and you're bullish or or you you think it's all a scam you know it's going nowhere i mean for me i think 99 of what's going on is a scam this is try like a little bit it's not really brave to say this is sort of a common opinion i do think there will be some future uses for nfts i think that technology is pushing its way there but i didn't know the the data limitations just how steep they were on fees that really changes what i think like maybe some of those innovations could be because if it's going to be on chain if it's going to get the benefits of on on-chain the [ __ ] it just costs so much money exactly that's actually the kind of the dirty secret of the web 3 movement is how much exists on standard internet infrastructure like they claim everything's on chain right but the way to know if something's on chain or not is really simple when you click a button did you get charged for clicking that button that it's it's that simple data changes hands you had to pay for it on websites exactly so that's how you know if if you're using a product say open c and you click a link and you don't get charged for it you're not that means it's off chain it's that simple so and you'll know if you're paying because i had to register an ens domain a couple weeks so i'm bullish that something will be found right but i think it's too early for the general i think that's a good message pushed into this right right where they don't even know and and like you said even the experts are struggling to know where it's going why is the general population having this like sort of shove down their throats why has this been mainlined into society when even the people who build the technology don't even know how what we could do with the technology and we're trying to still figure out the technology and that's an underlying message really to the nft community they need to police their own community they need to call out scammers in their community and obvious pumps and dumps and actually work to make sure the name of nft is not tarnished because if they don't regulators will step in and regulate for them and that's going to be a worse thing and they may never actually find utility yeah yeah i agree sometimes regulators step in and they misunderstand the technology and actually make the situation worse yeah i think i largely agree with you here jeffrey and i think your nft bay is a really interesting project whether or not the pictures are there or not the nfts are there that's the crazy thing is i'm really having a hard time parsing from my brain that you own the nfts but not the pictures i've just thought that the nfts are the pictures and vice versa and that's that's one of the reasons that i've been laughing for a little bit it was two weeks ago since the launch that one half is saying thank you for backing up all the nfts we we fully aware that the artwork is not backed up on chain thank you for backing it all up and at the same time they're also saying that the artwork has no value it's the contract the nft the contract that has value meanwhile the other side is the other side is saying oh we're just going to right click save the treasure the nft and they're saying that doesn't have value so essentially the nft bay it's upside down it contains the actual nfts not the jpegs it does it does make me wonder what happens when all this web 2 infrastructure breaks down let's say you have a google drive link that has your image right and somebody forgets to keep paying google for you know their extra storage space or whatever your file gets deleted now what is your nfd worth it's happened it happens all the time people have dropped millions on these contracts that link to an image host and that image host goes offline like if it links to an internet domain name and that domain name doesn't get registered anymore that means anyone in the world can go register that domain name and they can put any image in that person's art game oh boy oh boy that's gonna go bad i know that's gonna happen and when it yes it is that is gonna be funny so is it true that somebody screenshotted the nft bay website and sold it yeah it's true it's actually hilarious vvd vincent van doe took a screenshot of the nft bay and then sold the hyperlink to the screenshot of the nft bay made eighteen thousand dollars for selling the the treasure map to the treasure with the image and then i took a screenshot of his auction result and i turned that into an entity and called it the collector becomes the collected and that is likely the only nft that i'll ever create in its current in collection and form and well if you're going to be talking about these things you you have to be authentic you've got your actu how can you talk about if you unless you have done it so i created an nft of the nft of the nft bay that can hold all the nfts very interesting you're you're a very interesting man jeffrey i will link the website i hope you guys learned something that was the whole intention when me and jeffrey got together we said look we want this to be educational i hope you guys learned something thanks for watching and yeah find out what you really own thanks see ya
