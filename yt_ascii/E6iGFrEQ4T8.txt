a few years ago i got asked to document a caravan of central american migrants crossing mexico and i pretty much agreed on the spot it honestly sounded like a dream assignment for me and without thinking about it too much i packed a bag and jumped on a plane for the guatemalan border what i didn't know is that this assignment would grow from 10 days to nearly 40 days and would be one of the most impactful experiences of my career for over a month we walked and hitchhiked and slept in parks and even rode la vestio or the beast which is the nickname for the dangerous freight trains that migrants use to get through the most dangerous parts of the country as quickly as possible there was even a moment where i found myself having to decide if i was ready to fight for my life but a little bit more on that later anyways i guess it's safe to say that this was not the average shoot and in this video i'm gonna get into four of the key filmmaking lessons i learned on the migrant trail foreign [music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer if you're into that kind of thing like subscribe and all that good stuff because i've got new videos coming out every week before i get too deep into this story if you don't know what a migrant caravan is i'll give you a little bit of background information to make it as simple as possible the us is a rich country with a lot of opportunity and a lot of central american countries are not so fortunate the why of this is incredibly complicated and it's largely not the fault of the people living in those poorer countries but this isn't a video about geopolitics or the wrongs of colonialism so i'll go easy on that stuff for now but no matter who's responsible the fact remains that many central american people face violence political persecution and poverty on a daily basis and when things get too bad to bear they come north to try and look for something better for themselves and their kids the problem is that to get to the u.s border from say honduras you have to cross all of mexico and if you've been paying attention to the news for the last 20 years you'll probably know that parts of mexico can be really dangerous i mean if a tourist just as nervous for their safety when they're checking into a resort you can only imagine the risks faced by an individual with no documentation no money and no support who has to walk and ride trains for weeks on end from falling off the trains to being kidnapped by cartels it's an insanely dangerous experience from start to finish and there's no guarantee that when they get there they won't just be sent back to where they came from to make things a bit safer migrants band together because a large group is harder to prey on than a small one and when that group gets big enough it becomes a caravan so when we arrived in tapachula which is a border city in southern mexico where most of these caravans form up we could see that this caravan was going to be big even still we didn't know that within a week it would be officially considered the largest migrant caravan in history and that over 1500 people would be marching north together when i say we it was just me and a writer that the outlet had sent down and at the time we were the only international media there that changed pretty quickly and i'll get to that in a second for a couple of weeks the caravan made slow progress through the mexican states of chiapas and oaxaca mostly walking in a long column down the highway though sometimes people would manage to hop on a passing truck or hitchhike to the next migrant shelter most people had almost no gear at all just a small backpack and a lot of them didn't even have food or water or even shoes just like plastic flip-flops i had it pretty easy by comparison i had a real backpack and boots and even though i've done a ton of hiking and outdoor adventure stuff in my career it still wasn't easy i mean if my feet were hurting after a couple of hours i can't imagine what it was like for someone wearing walmart sandals since the progress was slow we spent a lot of time talking and day by day i heard more stories about why people had left everything behind to travel thousands of kilometers towards a country where it seemed like half the population didn't even want them there some were running because they voted the wrong way in recent elections and were being targeted as political enemies of the state some had family members who've been kidnapped or killed by gangs or maybe being extorted to the point where they'd had to close down their businesses and run one mother even told me that they'd had to leave because her teenage daughter was too pretty and she was terrified that she'd start getting raped if she stayed where she was that's super heavy stuff i know but hearing these stories every day for weeks taught me the first lesson that stuck with me you might have no idea what the people in front of your camera have gone through so treat them as people first and subject second my photographer's brain just wanted to shoot and shoot almost like these people were objects to be used in a beautiful frame but once i started to understand what they were running from and what they'd been through i realized i needed to be a little more careful with whose faces i showed and what personal details i revealed i mean if the wrong person saw my photos or videos i could end up putting people in real danger and that's never the point this all might sound obvious but there is a difference between intellectually knowing something is happening like i know there's gang violence in central america and actually hearing dozens and dozens of first-hand accounts of what that does to people's lives as a photojournalist and later a documentary filmmaker i'd like to think i've always treated people with respect but it was that assignment where it really clicked like i realized properly for the first time that my creative ambitions were nothing compared to what these people were going through so tread lightly and talk to people and don't be in such a rush to make a nice frame that you lose your empathy treat people like they're animals on a safari because those people could easily have been you in another life it was almost two weeks into the march and the caravan was camped out in an empty sports complex in a small town in oaxaca when things really started to get crazy the reality that this was the largest migrant caravan ever had started to surface in the media and our editors asked us to publish a story to prove that we'd been there first journalism slang they didn't want to get scooped by another media outlet who hadn't been there from the beginning which did make sense considering how much they'd invested in this story by that point so the writer put together like a thousand words and i borrowed a laptop from someone and sent in a selection of pictures to go with it that's all pretty normal in media but what happened next was something i'd never experienced in my career to that point by the time we filed the story it was super late at night and so we had a quick dinner and went to bed not really thinking too much about it but in the morning when we woke up we realized everything had changed overnight while we were sleeping our story had been picked up by fox news and then the even more conservative breitbart news network and from there came to the personal attention of then president trump he went to twitter this pre-ban and i guess now pretty unbanned and tweeted something along the lines of a huge caravan of migrants is on the way and we need to stop them or something like that by lunchtime that day the press started to arrive by dinner time cnn had two crews on the ground and every hour more and more press were there and we realized that the story had become major news and was starting to become the center of a national debate the writer and i started to get flooded by social media messages from both sides of the political spectrum some people were sympathetic some people were furious that we were humanizing these people and called me a traitor to my country even though i'm not american they're goddamn traitor sir suddenly migration was front and center in every news cycle and i started to get interview requests from major news outlets and if we'd known how big of a deal this would become i think i would have spent way more time on that initial story now it's not like we did anything wrong or we did a bad job but it definitely was something we threw together quickly not really expecting it to have much impact and this was the next lesson i learned you never really know what impact your work is going to have so make sure you get it right even if you're are just starting out in your documentary career and you don't think anyone is paying attention you just can't predict what's going to happen when you put your stuff into the world so be careful be sensitive and do things the right way because you never know when your small project could be in the middle of something way bigger than you ever anticipated there was a direct link from our story to the president of the united states and by the end of the year the entire american and mexican policy towards migrants had changed forever now mexico won't even allow these caravans to cross its territory and while i'm definitely not saying that i'm responsible for this i can't ignore the fact that this whole thing partly started from something we threw together in a tiny hotel room if it happened to me it can happen to you even if it seems crazy so one morning just as the media circus was really kicking into high gear the caravan organizers approached us to ask if we were planning to ride la bestia or the beast which like i said is the nickname for the freight trains that the migrants ride to get through some of the more dangerous parts of mexico we said yes right away and if i'm being honest it was one of the things i'd been looking forward to most when i agreed to take the assignment looking back back it's a bit embarrassing to admit but i wanted to have that story to say that i'd done it and i was looking at it almost like an adventure it was totally ego driven and i'm not proud of that outlook considering how deadly serious the trip was for these migrants but there it is once we said we were going the organizer told us the first train was going to be leaving at 4am the next day and that we should get ready the whole thing was more formally organized than you might expect and we were assigned a kind of group which was basically just 15 or so people that we were told to stick with when the boarding started some of the people in that group had done the trip over a dozen times i want to say 17 times was the most i found and so they knew what to expect and late that night we all got together in a circle and they went through what was about to happen and when he was done he pointed to a nearby construction site and told us all to arm ourselves with whatever we could find basically he said that if the train stopped in the middle of nowhere and kidnappers came after us we should be ready to fight now i definitely hadn't been expecting this and since i was working as a journalist there are some real ethical gray areas when it to carrying weapons but we went with them anyways and watched as they all started grabbing pieces of metal to use as like makeshift clubs and i'd almost made up my mind not to take anything but then i started to feel weird about expecting all these other people to fight off a cartel kidnapping for me while not being prepared to do the same for them so i just decided to do it i grabbed a two foot long piece of rebar and i'm not gonna lie i felt pretty dumb violence isn't really in my nature and the thought of hitting someone with it actually seemed ridiculous i'm not sure if it was the right decision from a journalistic standpoint but in that moment something sort of became clear for me i'm not quite sure how to explain it but it was the realization that even though i was there as an observer i had no right to be treated differently than these people and if things went really wrong no one would care that i was a journalist or not i've talked about privilege a few times on this channel and when i say that i don't mean that i grew up rich i'm talking about global privilege in the sense of growing up in a safe stable country to a middle class family it was totally privileged and naive in that moment to assume that i wouldn't have to be responsible for my own safety and as i held on to that piece of metal i understood clearly maybe for the first time what it might look like not to have that privilege working for me does that make sense it's like having to confront the idea of fighting for my life against armed attackers and i got a quick glimpse of what it might be like not to come from a position of privilege where i expected that i would be protected either by my canadian passport or my status as a journalist so i took the rebar and went back to the train station to find a place to sleep near the tracks now in the end nothing serious happened but the train did stop in the middle of nowhere for an hour and since no one knew if it was a scheduled stop or if the cartels had bribed the train engineer which they do a lot there was some really tense time there where everyone had their hands on their weapons eventually the train started rolling again and everyone relaxed but that feeling is going to stay with me forever it was so powerful that i actually kept that piece of rebar and this is it i keep it on my camera workbench as a physical reminder to stay humble and appreciate how easy i have it in comparison to a lot of people out there in the world as filmmakers were often drawn to tell stories of people in their darkest moments and the takeaway here least for me is that the people you're filming could easily have been you in another life we're so lucky to even begin to think about making a living from filmmaking and so stay humble practice empathy and don't take yourself so seriously because if you think you might have to fight to the death to save yourself suddenly your creative career doesn't seem so important i can go on and on about this experience forever because that whole project had a massive impact on the way i see my life and work but before i wrap this video out i wanted to share one last lesson that trip was really intense and in the end when we got to tijuana and the u.s border more than a month later it became obvious that after the whole ordeal a lot of people we traveled with were going to get denied entry and sent home to whatever they've been running away from but what's weird is that no one was complaining no one was telling me how unfair things were or resenting me for having a lucky passport that would let me walk across that border whenever i want it now i'm from canada and i'm guessing that most people from canada if they were treated that way at the u.s border they'd have something to say about it but literally no one i spoke to said anything like that instead they were overwhelmingly hopeful they were dealing with circumstances and challenges more difficult than i'll ever be able to understand and yet they weren't broken by it there was trauma and fear for sure but they hadn't given up and whether they were able to claim asylum this time or not they try again and again and again until they were able to find a better way to make a life for their children so even if as filmmakers we often want to expose the problems in the world try to stay hopeful i'm not saying that everything you make has to be uplifting or a positive film because god knows i don't do that but people in general can only keep going if they have hope of something better so only showing misery in your films and ignoring hope because we want a more dramatic story just doesn't reflect the human experience at least not as i saw it for those 40 days anyways all right i'll stop there before this video gets way too long but i hope sharing that story and some of the things that i learned helps you gain some perspective on your own filmmaking careers it was really one of the most powerful experiences of my life and i'm going to keep this rusty old piece of metal forever so that i don't forget it thanks for watching and if you like that video do the whole like and subscribe things i've got more like it coming out every week and if you did like that one you might also like this other video i made about what i learned from nearly dying in a cartel ambush see ya [music] [music]
