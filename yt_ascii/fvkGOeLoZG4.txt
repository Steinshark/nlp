amongst the 38 oecd nations south korea has the highest rate of elder poverty 46 of their citizens age 65 or over live in relative poverty this rate is unusually high almost an outlier the next highest rates belong to estonia and latvia with lithuania and mexico next japan a fellow aging east asian economy is at 20 percent and the oecd average is about 12 to 13 korea is one of the world's richest and most advanced countries their gadgets are sleek and their movies are slick korean history is deeply steeped in confucian traditions where respecting the elderly is paramount so how did this happen in this video we're going to look at south korea's elder poverty problem a problem that is getting increasingly worse before we go any further we need to first acknowledge that the problem actually exists after my squid game video i got more than a few emails telling me that everything was fine in korea they strongly denied that korean poverty existed and i needed to stop reading non-korean sources poverty is defined by the oecd as when a person's income falls under half the median household income of the total population rising elder poverty rates are part of a general trend of rising poverty across the entire korean population in 1996 8.8 percent of korea's people suffered poverty as of 2019 that percentage is now 16.7 amongst older adults the number has gone up from 28.7 in 1996 to 40.8 percent in 2014 and the after mentioned 46 in 2019. there is no one reason why elder poverty is so prevalent in korean society rather there are a number of reasons reflecting multiple failures in the social net let us first look at their working income in korea many elders still work and the jobs they work are pretty terrible in general elders are at a high poverty risk most of them are unable to continue working as they age in the oecd the average employment rate for those age 50 to 74 is about 50 in korea that number is 62 percent that number has only grown in the past few years elder koreans keep their jobs for far longer than their oecd peers working until their early 70s some 33 percent of the country's population age 70 to 74 are still working over twice as high as the oecd average of 15 percent this is in part due to early retirement policies that saw most workers leave their jobs in their 50s but upon retiring from their main career korean seniors often experience a drastic drop in income a drop serious enough to force them to start a second career one that can last another 20 years or longer now work participation among seniors is not necessarily a bad thing after all a lot of older people find themselves struggling to adjust to retirement idle hands can lead to worse attitudes and depression the problem is that many korean elders work because they must in a 2016 study nearly 60 percent say that their primary reason for working is to earn living costs less than 10 percent say they do it to stay occupied or to stay healthy furthermore the quality of the work accessible to them is very poor because many of these people came of age in a different time they are not well educated less than 20 percent of them have a university degree as of 2016. thus many of them are only qualified to hold low wage and low skilled jobs in other words jobs of a precarious nature mostly in the service sector which means retail transportation accommodation restaurants and business facility management they work longer hours than their peers but mostly in part-time or temporary jobs which they don't stay in for very long 33 of elders aged 55 to 64 hold down an individual job for less than a year they are your street vendors disinfection service providers security guards and cleaners these are not jobs that a retired person looking to keep themselves busy would take it can be argued that korean elders are not exactly living the high life so despite their precarious employment status and low earnings they probably can make due with regards to daily living expenses the key issue however would be living arrangements housing up until recent years elder parents lived with their adult children usually a married eldest son in 1990 the share of adults aged 65 or over living with married adult children was 67 this can be considered a form of privately provided pension accordingly so during korea's developmental years many couples use their savings on the educations and marriages of their children with the expectation that their children will in turn support them in their declining years a confucian tradition however attitudes have changed and the youth are having troubles of their own too thus the share of seniors cohabiting with their adult children has declined to just 32 in 2015. and the percentage of older adults living apart from their children went up from 17 in 1990 to nearly 60 in 2015. this is an old stat from 2005 but when asked 42 of korean elders attribute their poverty to the money they spent supporting their children i don't want to say that the adult children are horrible people seventy percent of korean elders still receive money from their children they're doing their best even so what they get makes up less than 25 percent of their already low income less than 331 usd a month in one sample the opinion of the adult children has generally been that responsibility for taking care of the elders should be shared amongst all parties the government adult children and the elders themselves hard to disagree with that the third major income source for people in their old age are transfers from other parties in other words a pension there are two types of pensions those from private companies and those from the government early on korea's pension systems mirrored that of japan the assumption would be that a worker would have income from an occupational pension provided by a large conglomerate ichibl the government would provide a second public pension but that would just be a garnish rather than the main course korea's system is in contrast to the public pension systems of china and taiwan where the government provides the majority of penchant old age income singapore and hong kong for their part run their retirement systems kind of like 401ks with provident accounts financed by both the workers and their employers singapore's 401k for instance is called cpf so if they're running similar systems then why are korea's elderly poverty rates still so much higher than japan's two reasons the first reason is that private pensions failed to live up to their name following the 1997 asian financial crisis the korean government revamped corporate pensions there were suddenly a surge of bankrupt companies unable to pay the pensions they had promised to their employees and the employees had little recourse to recover that lost income the government had passed the national pension insurance act to try to make up for the lost income but the scale of the 1997 crisis forced them to reduce the pension income replacement ratio from 70 percent in 1988 to 40 in 2007. this policy also disadvantages working elder women because pension benefits are calculated from lifetime career earnings and housewives experience career interruptions due to child raising the second reason for korea's relatively higher elder poverty rates compared to japan has to do with the immaturity and general inadequacy of korea's public pensions with families and the private sector unable to fully support the elders by themselves it is up to the government to pick up the slack there are three major public transfer programs in south korea the national basic livelihood security which has provided cash and in-kind benefits since 2000 the national pension scheme first introduced in 1988 is the country's major social insurance scheme and a tax-financed pension called the basic old age pension scheme or bps it is not funded by contributions and has been around since 2008. as of 2021 it has provided about 252 usd a month of supplemental income the bps system in particular has been the most effective of the three in reducing elder poverty which makes sense since it is the most broadly targeted distributing to 70 percent of korean elders or 4.9 million elders the major problem with these programs is that they only provide a modest level of income the impact is not big enough to affect the overall poverty level and as korean society continues to age the government will have an increasingly harder time finding the money to fund it the military personnel and government employees pensions are already in a deficit japanese pensions have had more years to mature and develop which is why japanese elderly are able to receive 80 of their income from pensions korea's rapid development has not given it enough time to do the same korea is also one of the world's most rapidly aging countries the population ratio of the elderly has gone from just 5 in 1990 to 13 in 2005 to 16.5 in 2021. furthermore it is estimated that by 2050 43.9 percent of the country will be elderly people this aging trend is mostly driven by a decline in fertility in other words there are not enough young people being born south korea's total fertility rate has not gone above 1.3 since 2002 and the speed with which that fertility rate has crashed is frightening this is worsened by underemployment dynamics in what remains of the south korean youth population in south korea both the young and the old find that the only jobs available to them pay very little and are not stable unable to support a family or buy a house with these jobs the young opt to go back to school their delay into the working force further constricts the economy's ability to fund the growing fiscal burden of supporting elderly pensions it also jacks up the price of private education and exacerbates the korean over-education problem private education costs in korea are so high that certain economic models actually favor lower birth rates over lower mortality rates for at least the next 20 years the old on the other hand have no choice but to take up these jobs these are 70 year olds doing work meant for 20 year olds they are treated as such too which to me is pretty sad so what can be done about it in the short and medium term nothing can be done to keep the elderly poverty from needing to work thus the goal would be to improve the working conditions for those service level jobs certain accommodations will need to be made to better suit the elderly including vocational training and job creation programs over the longer term the korean government should look to find some way to fund and improve the social welfare net japan is the only east asian country where its elders do not rely on their children for the majority of their income with fertility rates crashing the way they are across the world i think confucian-styled governments need to re-evaluate the expectation that the elders to come will be supported by their children it would not be fair to them or anyone else elder poverty is a problem that almost all the aging east asian economies must face in the coming years china korea both north and south taiwan hong kong vietnam thailand and the philippines this is all coming for them i myself out in taiwan cannot help but notice the large number of aging seniors sorting my trash sweeping my streets and cooking my food even after many years they are still working i know the concept of retirement is a relatively recent one but if you ask me this is no way to treat the people who have built up the country to what it is today yet the situation is complicated and the simple solutions are fiscally unsustainable alright everyone that's it for
