- [jimmy] here's a $100,000
worth of scratch-off tickets. - holy crap! - [jimmy] each of these tickets was $30. scan your first ticket. - wow, it's nothing.
- nice. - [jimmy] so you spent
$30 and you won nothing. i'll take that. - well, you just gave me another 60 bucks. - [jimmy] ooh. - ka ching! - 30.
- ooh, okay, okay. - 100. - [jimmy] ooh, okay. now this is where it gets interesting. you literally have $50,000 of tickets and so does chris. - yeah. - and whichever one of
you makes the most amount of money off your scratch-off
tickets, gets to keep them. so you've spent $90 and you've made 130. so you're up $40 profit so far. - all right. hey chris. - mm-hmm. - i'm about to beat you! - [jimmy] one of you is
gonna walk away with nothing. - me. no, wait. (men laughing) no, i've jinxed myself. if this first one's not a winner, i lose. i mean, this next one is
not a winner then i lose. - [jimmy] so currently, your $390 worth of tickets have lost you $70. - wow, great math there buddy. what are you, a computer? - [jimmy] i'm gonna go
to chandler, he's nicer. - i love you. say it back.
(crickets chirping) (upbeat music) - [jimmy] chris, so far,
you've lost around $700. - thanks, it's not like i can turn my head and see or anything, appreciate that. - [jimmy] but you are scanning
way faster than chandler. - it's 'cause chandler's
not very fast at anything. (chime ringing) - [jimmy] do you wanna know a fun fact? you're actually winning even though you've spent less than him. - yeah, keep lying to him
and tell him he's winning. - oh wow.
- yeah. - okay.
- he's down $700. - no, i'm not. - [jimmy] so you're down 360. - you hear that chris? - [jimmy] oh, wait, what? wait, turn it. - [chris] i reckon i just won it. - [jimmy] 50x. - [chris] 50x. - [jimmy] what's 20 times 50? - [chris] 1,000. - oh. so he won $1,000. hey, you're profit now. (cash register ringing) dang, you're down $400? - oh, it's not scanning. it must be big. it takes a long time to load. (somber music) no, nevermind. - [jimmy] now remember,
chris is beating you and chris might win $50,000
today, but that's fine. who cares if chris wins $50,000? - you think he'll gimme some? - i'll ask. chandler was wondering if
you won, would he get any? - i'd give him about 236 bucks. - i'll tell him. he'd give you $236. - that's a deal. - [jimmy] all right. - just know, when i win,
that's all you're getting. (sinister music) i'm freaking tired of you. - why are you in my room? (chris screaming) he's cheating. - [jimmy] stop throwing things! since you pelted chris with
an apple, i'm gonna have to take a ticket as a punishment. - not that one, not that one. - [jimmy] nope, sorry. - please, no, not that one. - sorry.
- please, not that one! (chandler screaming) - [jimmy] did you just
throw a water bottle? all right, we're taking another one. all right, we have two. chandler threw an apple at you. - yep, he actually threw two apples at me. - [jimmy] here's two tickets. - okay. - no prize, okay, no prize. chandler, he didn't win anything. you got lucky. (upbeat music) - wow. - [jimmy] the magic 8 ball. - should i give chris two tickets? - "as i see it, yes." wait, is he giving me two? - [jimmy] it said no to him. - "my sources say no." - oh wow. (upbeat music) - 50 - $30. - 100. - $100. - 30. - [jimmy] chris, i brought you a present. both these guys are named jake. which one would you like? - left jake. - nice! - [jimmy] there you go. do you want a friend? - you know, i've tried for many years to acquire some of those. - [jimmy] chandler, i brought you a jake. let's see if he brings
good luck and fortune. - all right. - i got it. - all right.
- it's a winner. - 40! - told you, blew up instant. - are you sure this is the one? - instant, yep. - 50. ka-ching, come here. - okay. - you lose me money, you lose kneecaps. - $300, boy! i'm keeping my kneecaps. these are my knee caps
and you can't have 'em. - less talky-talky and
more scanny-scanning. - what? - that's a good point, i
never thought of it that way. blitz mode! - oh, okay, go. (upbeat music) - [jimmy] so at this rate
chandler, chris would win and he'd walk away with the tickets. only one of these tickets
has to be worth $10 million for you to walk away a winner. - well, here it is. - [jimmy] okay, let's scan it. - it's gonna say just winner. - no prize.
- all right, i'm leaving. - [jimmy] stop trying. (chandler grunting)
(upbeat rock music) - i can't make the rest. - [jimmy] you could win $50,000. - get this thing off me. my throat hurts. - [jimmy] i think you need to just throw an apple at chris. - yes, i do. - why are you shirtless? don't throw that apple at me. - ha! - [jimmy] chris, are you okay? - that was the knee i had surgery on a couple of years ago. - ooh. - [jimmy] if this makes
you feel any better, i took a ticket for you. - chandler's ticket is $60. - [jimmy] would you let someone pelt you in the knee for 60 bucks? - no. (upbeat music) i promise you $300 if i win. - i appreciate you, i'm out! - [jimmy] hey chris. - yeah, what's up? - [jimmy] see this? - [chris] yeah. - it's gonna timelapse you starting now. (cheerful music) chandler, you look tired. - you look tired. - hey, got him. - nothing, i'm just
tired of saying nothing. nothing. - $100. - nothing. - $100. - nothing. - hey chandler, how's it going? - nothing. - that doesn't really accurately describe how things are going per se. - yes it does. - i am- - 30! - okay, best of luck to you, i love you. - love you. - love you more. - 50. (upbeat music) - [friend] you almost have $20,000. who cares? just look at the earned, stay positive. - 60. - what i'm hoping is, chandler
really has not been sucking so that way when i win, i will
get a decent amount of money. - this is true. - chris, i've been doing exactly that. - you've been doing what, chandler? - exactly that. - all right. - nothing. - all you need is one of these to be worth 10 grand and then- - oh, is it that one? $40. - okay, so yeah, i'm
gonna go get you a ticket. your lead is too big. i gotta even it out,
giving this on the channel. - hey, but i've done nothing wrong. i can't help that i don't suck. - chandler needs help
mentally and card wise. - 50, woo! - i hate you, you're a thief. - woo, winner! - $500. - winner, winner, winner, 500. just kidding, it's nothing. - chandler, grab five tickets. so you're gonna scan all five and whoever loses the
most, wins all 10 tickets. - if i lose, i win? - yes. - $40. no prize. - okay. - no prize. - okay, two losers. all right, so-
- i win. - four out of five of his tickets lost. - [chris] i win. - all right, we're off to a good start. nothing! nothing. 50! - [friend] he's up 50. - you won $50, he won 40 which means you did better. i set this challenge up so
whoever did worse would win 'cause i wanted to help you but... - so you want me to just? - i'm just gonna look for it. - thanks, man. could've just saved that. - do you see that? i'm so good at winning, i
can lose when it counts. - do you wanna do it again? - nah. - [jimmy] i'm trying
everything i can to help you- - dude, i believe you. - i really am. (upbeat music) - yeah, you get two in a row over here, it's a big deal, right? - 40, better. - chandler, i'm gonna
pull out the big weapons. you're clearly losing, so walking under a
ladder's bad luck, right? - yeah. - i'm gonna have chris scan
tickets under a ladder. hopefully, that will give you an edge. - okay. - i'm doing this for you, man. - thanks dude. - all right, chris, we're
gonna have you scan tickets underneath a ladder. you're luck's been too good. (jimmy chuckling) - i guess that's a reasonable request. - [jimmy] i need you to lean
under the ladder, please. - i won $40 by the way. - it's not working. good thing that one didn't win. the ladder worked. - all right, chandler, i'm happy to report after we put the ladder over
his head, he lost two in a row. - really? - [jimmy] mm-hmm. - that's close to my 25 i lost in a row. (upbeat music) gimme a million, gimme a
million, gimme a million, gimme a million, gimme a million, 30! close enough, nothing yet. i need a nothing counter on this video. (upbeat music) - [jimmy] here's a mirror, i'ma need you to break it, hold up! all right. (hammer booming)
(mirror cracking) - that's a pretty tough mirror, man. - [jimmy] throw it against the wall. (glass cracking) - it breaks.
- it broke. - [jimmy] now, scan a ticket. - $50. - i give up. (crew laughing) for every losing ticket, you now have to tape it to your body. - is this just to show how bad i am? - no, i'm gonna do it with chris. - oh, every time he wins? (men laughing) nothing. - [jimmy] all right, you now have to tape all the losing
tickets to your body. - is chandler sticking
them to his body right now? - yeah. so we gotta take care of your elbows. - oh, elbow pads? - 50, 60, 100. (chandler shrieking) - [jimmy] chandler, chris is
on an eight losing streak. - those are rookie numbers, chris. - well, how am i supposed to
go about living my life now? - [jimmy] all right chris. - 40 is cat in black. - [jimmy] dude, honestly... - that one's pretty good. - [jimmy] we're pulling out all the stops. (cat shrieking) - that one's, wow, who drew that one? - your armor is looking thick. - yeah dude, they made it pretty fast. - chris is scanning tickets
under a ladder, he's covered in glass and that black
cat crossed his path. maybe we're going about
this the wrong way. what do you think would
give you good luck? - i need a four-leaf clover, a leprechaun, a pot of gold and a rainbow. - got it, i'll be it back. - 30! (intense orchestral music) - [jimmy] you feeling lucky? - well, seeing as how i just got no prize, no i'm not right now. - [jimmy] well, there's a
couple black cats behind you. - there is, there's also
a black cat spelled out. - [jimmy] i see that. chandler, how's it coming in here? - dude, i don't even wanna talk about it. - i'm a loser.
- you're almost done. - it's quick when you lose, nothing. (intense orchestral music) - [jimmy] chandler, so
far, you've spent $42,000. - what do you want me to do? - [jimmy] well, so far
you've lost $26,000. - i realize that. - [jimmy] do you know what
you could buy with $26,000? - no, i've never had that much in my hand. - here's 50 grand in cash
because you won a challenge! yeah you did, i gave
you 50 grand one time- - in my hand. - [jimmy] i literally gave you 50 grand, $38,000 and only won 27, chandler scratched off $42,000 worth, you've only scratched off
38, so you need some help. - i'm a little slower. - [jimmy] can you help him? - yes. (intense orchestral music) - [jimmy] chandler, i
brought you a present. - what is it? - [jimmy] i brought you a
leprechaun like you asked. - i need you to touch
every ticket on the table. - [jimmy] also, here's a four-leaf clover. - thank you. (traditional irish music) - [jimmy] all right, now, slap him. (hand booming) all you need is one $10,000 ticket. let's see if it helped. - 40. - [jimmy] okay, chandler,
promise me you'll win 10 grand. - 200. - [jimmy] okay, okay. all right, now, i need you to curse chris. i want you to run in
there and just kick him. (traditional irish music) (ball smacking) - the leprechaun just hit me? - [jimmy] yep. take the ping-pong ball. - nothing. (ball rattling) - ooh!
- there we go. - if chris misses it, you
get 10 of his tickets. (upbeat music) chandler? - here we go. - [jimmy] let's see, what
did you steal from chris? - 50.
- $50. - nothing, this is
tired chandler, nothing. - 50.
- $50, nothing. $100 to chris. - whoa, chris, you won 100 bucks. - 60. - 60.
- 60. - i got seven outta 10 of those. - you won $320. - thanks jim. - there's only $6,000 left that you have to scan outta your 50,000. - yeah. - and if this number's lower than chris's, he gets the tickets. just wanted to remind you. - all right, yeah, 30 bucks. - [friend] talk to the ticket, yeah! - that's what i thought! that's what i thought, ticket! you know what, i'm
gonna give you a ticket. how about that? nothing, he didn't like that. - this is all your recent
losing tickets, right? this is the most expensive
trash you'll ever see in your life. this is why you shouldn't gamble, kids. this would be you. you've lost about $17,000. - mm-hmm, mm-hmm, not bad. - you guys have lost about $15,000, which means in total, we've lost $32,000. - good job. - my mom is so proud of me, i bet. - ooh, i rim jobbed did. holy crap! chandler, one of your tickets
i won from you is $400. - [chandler] no way. (chris laughing) hey man. - hey man! - which one was it? oh, you mix it up, huh? - have a ticket. - [jimmy] chandler, you still
have a chance on winning. you know this, right? - if i can pull out some big numbers, i might be able to beat chris. - [jimmy] you both have 67 tickets left. at this rate, you're gonna
walk away with the money. - that makes me happy. - [jimmy] but chandler could still scratch off a $1 million ticket. - he could. - [jimmy] the odds are
very low, but he could. - don't say that, though. i don't want that to happen. - [chris] chandler, scratch
off a $1 million ticket. - stop saying it out loud, it'll happen! - you know the deal. you have about 46 tickets
left, it's a $5,000 deficit. you need to scratch off
a $10,000 or $50,000 or $100,000 or a million or $10 million ticket, if you wanna win. - so those are my options, huh? - yes. - [friend] look at the
frustration on this man's face. - nothing.
- that's the sadness. - we're bringing home this bread, $50. hey, the squeak works, man. (chair squeaking) $300, the squeak is insane!
(dramatic orchestral music) - so, you have 14 tickets left, do you want me to help you scan 'em? - yes, please, $30. - 60. - $60. - nothing. - nothing, three left. - 50. - at least, give us $30 on the last one. - this is chris's last ticket. - $40. - so your total was, $35,630. go check on chandler. - all right. - so chandler, chris's total was $35,630 which means if you got a
$5,000 ticket, you could win. if the rest of these are losers, chris will walk away with over $30,000. - okay. - [chris] my heart's
actually kind of pounding. - five tickets for me. - technically, you could get $1,000 on all five of these tickets
and you would win by $20. if he got $1 million
here, i will do something. - please win with this one. - it's $1 million. - 30. - [chris] $30. - it's like deal or no deal, this one's the $1 million one, okay. - let's see.
- huh, two more. this is your final ticket. - [friend] oh my god! (intense music) what's it gonna be? - nothing. (dismal music) - yeah boy! - all right. - good game, bruh. - so for those of you wondering, we spent $100,000 on
lottery tickets today, and we won 66,000, which means we lost $34,000. your tickets made you $35,630. here you go. since you won more than
chandler, you get to keep 'em. - dude, thanks so much. - how are you even gonna cash them in? - i'm gonna need a couple of days off. - you wanna go give chandler some tickets? - i actually do. - so this is his bucket
of winning tickets. - i'm gonna give you this many. - this many? - that many. - wow. - and you spend 'em on
whatever you want, buddy. - all right. - we gotta hug it out. - thanks man.
- good game, buddy. - good game. - [jimmy] yeah, hug it out,
chris only won 35 grand. - all right, see you guys, going to the... - [jimmy] also, just so you guys know when this video's uploaded, all the tickets will be cashed in. we don't just have 35 grand in tickets, just so you guys know. - that is not how we
roll, this is how we roll. (mellow orchestral music)
