you look at our culture today and the number one thing that's under attack is the nuclear family right and the us i know gender might be attack under attack but that that that itself is attacking family yeah yeah and all of it leads back to the nuclear family and the bible tells us honor thy father and thy [music] mother hello everyone watching and listening today i'm speaking with a couple of stellar young men josh and nick alexander who are both advocates for the save canada organization we discussed their political activity oriented towards christian ideals and family values the abor response from administrative busy bodies mainstream media and law enforce ment the threats and physical violence levied against them and what their battle really means for canada and for the world at large all right gentlemen thank you for coming in let's take it from the top josh you can start with this so you ran into trouble with your school public trouble with your school how long ago now well so i actually used to go attend the public education system and i got in trouble during the freedom convoy mainly just over the mandates and the vaccine requirements and all that but i left that school and i went into the catholic board and i really started getting in trouble around october november of 2022 so how do you know this is not just you well i i mean looking out across the entire education system you can see that any student that stands up gets in trouble and then i watched what happened just to my little brother last week he was suspended for simply wearing my hat so i know it's not simply based on what me as a person but what i believe in he was suspended for wearing your hat yeah okay explain that yes so a particularly evil hat i presume apparently so it's it's the same hat that i've worn for i guess three years now it was an organization started by a bunch of students in halifax actually and we picked it up here in ontario and it was against the mandates and it was just about restoring a traditional culture in canada what does the hat say save canada save canada yeah and it's and you got thrown out of school for that okay so tell me that story and then we'll go back to to what happened with you how okay so what's the rationale here for you're wearing a save candidate hat why are you actually it was our younger brother he's 14 who got kicked out of school for this oh was oh i see so they're trying to get rid of all the alexanders now are you still in school nick no i'm done i'm done school you're done y and what grade are you supposed to be in i should be in grade 12 the highest i have is grade 10 though uhhuh uhhuh okay so let's go back to the trucker convoy what sort of what what were you doing at that point in the public education system and why did you get in trouble can you make a case make a case for yourself first and then make a case against yourself because i presume the teachers and the other hypothetical professionals assumed that they had some reason for giving you grief and misery so why don't you lay out both sides of the argument yeah sure so basically i went into the education system and it was obviously it it was quite crazy the the lockdown restrictions and everything that was going on and as a young person that was weird we'd have the cops calling us for playing football with our buddies at a local park right and so i ended up just being fed up with it and a couple of my buddies at school and myself and student named monty walker started doing walkouts in our school and that spread across the province and after that we started organizing them for nova scotia and bc and all across canada and our school didn't like that they suspended us and us being how many of you i think on the last walk it we did it was about 10 students from my school they basically told anybody who did wouldn't put the mask on and joined me on the street would be suspended and a bunch of kids just said all right that's it now previously we'd have like we had about 50 students coming out from the 300 student school and then we'd have crowds outside from parents and stuff supporting so it it became too much pressure and the school just started kicking us out how old were you when you started organizing those protests i guess i would have been 15 you know one of the things i was surprised about watching what happened with young people was the fact that so many young people actually put up with it now of course i'm not young obviously but and and i might be deluded in my belief but my sense is is that when i was that age 14 or 15 the people that i was associating with in this little town up in northern alberta i don't think we would have put up with the masks now that might just be wrong but young people did put up with the masks and for a very long time and you got sick of it yeah i mean everybody put up with it and that's what shocked me i'm from the the riding run through nipping pemrick which is famous for being the most most conservative writing in canadian history i would have thought it would have been immediate no but apparently not and everybody just went along with it that it was the new normal apparently and i wasn't okay with it and i knew that there were some people who weren't okay with it in private but none of them were willing to take the risk of you know maybe getting arrested or even like i would go shopping and i'd get the cops called almost every time just because i refuse to wear a mask and you get looked at differently when you're disobeying the rules as a young person yeah yeah yeah so why do you think you weren't willing to go along and well let's let's do two things had you gotten any trouble in school previous to your political involvement no i hadn't i was actually an award-winning student for i i received the citizenship award i was previously homeschooled went into the public board how how old were you when you went into public school i was grade seven so i guess i would have been 13 okay so you were in the public school for a couple of years before the mandates came in and before you started raising trouble yeah so i was i went there in grade seven i ended up like the mandates only started to come in right at the end of our grade eight year and we graduated not in person it wasn't that wasn't allowed but i received an award i had a good reputation why do you have a good reputation just because i have morals and character which is not something that should be lacking in an elementary school but it is and i mean my dad was also a teacher and he had a really good reputation he actually got to teach me in a couple of my classes and i i graduated from that school went into high school and everything just changed right so you weren't a you weren't a kid with a pattern of troublemaking behavior who used this political opportunity to like elevate himself in status that wasn't the game yeah never okay so what do you think the mask mandates and the lockdowns over those couple of year period did to people who were essentially your age i think it had a terrible effect on my entire generation i mean you'd see the stats on the news about the suicide rates and the depression and anxiety or whatever but you could actually see it in person as a student you go to school and there like it was i' had never seen anything like it the morale was so low and i mean i i guess people just didn't think it would have effect when you take young people tell them they're not allowed to hang out even on good terms and it just puts kids on video games and porn and social media and that's becomes their life and it's completely unhealthy well i again you know i was trying to think about how i would have reacted when i was say 15 or so man i remember just my my my father grounded me one weekend when i was a teenager around 15 and i still remember being at home friday and saturday night when i wanted to be out with my friends like that burned itself into my memor it's like that's not really that much of a punishment you know and i'm sure i deserved it but it drove me crazy and i thought i just can't imagine what it would have been like to be say between 14 and 16 and locked up essentially wrapped in a mask unable to communicate it must have been it must have been extremely difficult on the dating side of things too i imagine for of course young people have sort of given up on that favor pornography so maybe that wasn't such a catastrophe but yeah i know like young people they just they sto being relationships whether it was dating or just basic friendship it just it was all online and that becomes a very serious problem and then whenever it did return to school you couldn't see each other's faces you had to stay socially distanced and all that and i mean it's it may seem like a small inconvenience and to most people they just allowed it but when you understand what the greater plot is and you're looking at it you i just wasn't able to tolerate it was a small inconvenience at all i i think it was an absolute epidemic of tyrannical authoritarianism and as far as i'm concerned good it good for you for standing up against it okay so now how how did you decide to make your first political move that was the walk out essentially or so you were going to school were you wearing a mask when you were going to school for the most part yeah i i would have been wearing the mask i still get in trouble because like if i was not in class or something there's no teachers around i wouldn't be wearing it but i i would for the most part wear it but i would still be getting called to the office i even got called to the office once because a student reported me for not being vaccinated which wasn't even a requirement at the time but yeah it was i i would get in trouble for the smaller things and just because i would voice my opinion on it and you know put questions and students had like what's actually going on and why they're forced to cover their faces and stay home and so yeah the the faculty didn't like that and how many times do you suppose you were called to the office at like around the freedom convoy it was almost every day if like not several times a day okay and so what were you doing during the freedom convoy so that was really what sparked the change in me i guess i i had been semi complying all all the way around at least in school elsewhere i didn't really care and in fact i got fired from my job for not wearing a mask and whatnot but what was your job oh i was just making coffees mh was 15 had a job spread a lot of germs making coffee you know so yeah they they fired me there but like i was i wasn't complying outside and school was really the only place i was doing it and then we went to the freedom convoy you we meaning who well my brother here and our friend monty and we even at the very end brought a few other students to help out but and you went to ottawa yep and we we were down there for a while and it was weird going to the convoy and seeing everything free and everything normal and seeing the country come together and then going back to this just depressing tyrannical state and i had enough and that's we we decided to start doing these walkouts it was as simple as me i think i just put up a photo on snapchat or something one of those app students talk on and i just said meet me at my locker at whatever time we're we're we're done we're walking out were you were you a reasonably popular kid at this point with your peers or or had or was it polarized like why did people why did anyone listen to you i wouldn't say i was incredibly popular like i i had a pretty good reputation still but my opinions certainly weren't popular but i mean in grade n9 and 10 that isn't as big a deal as it is further on in life but some students they like they did respect me because i was respectful even when i was being shouted at by my principal and all that so i just remained calm and i gave the students the best advice i could in fact i would i would spend hours negotiating with the principles when i was supposed to be in class they'd bring the board superintendent down to my events and i just i would tell them what were you negotiating well they would for instance they wanted to suspend any student that walked out with me mm and i told them look i'm the organizer of this thing you're obviously talking to me for a reason and not every other student that's walked out suspend me do whatever you want to me and each of those students has a right to walk out and you can spend me for u non-compliance or disobeying authority but i don't care i'll i'll take the fall for it and oh yeah pr annoying that's for sure yeah so nick you were in ottawa too eh yeah i was y okay now but when when the freedom confoy made itself known were you still in school or had you graduated by that point i wasn't in school so at the end of grade 11 i dropped out and switched to online school cuz i was running a welding business at the time so i'd work in the days and do my high school online at night time so yeah i was doing it online so what was your impression of ottawa when you went there and why' you go i thought it was incredible it was a real break from the tyranny we've been living under and yeah it was one of the most incredible incredible few weeks of my life and had you been politicized at all before that no i wasn't especially political no and you when how old were you when you started your welding business and what is that business exactly it's bas valley welding it was a mostly agriculture equipment welding so break a lot of whether it's harrow or plows whatever it is it breaks down i would do offer a mobile welding service and i was 17 when i started that and is that a business that you're only involved in or do you have employees no josh is a coowner as is monty walker oh yeah so you you can weld too way i've done a little bit he does the majority of the mechanics we also we would do we als like that under that business name we had all sorts of different jobs going and we'd just work anywhere and any any time we could this is while you're in high school yeah yeah how's the business going it's we've had to put on pause the last couple months we' been pretty busy with with our current situation but we're looking at getting back into it this fall and firing it back up to life so what how would you characterize your relationship with your brother and and how are you two involved in this this trouble you're generating together yeah me and josh are very close it's kind of a a triune kind of work on a triune way me monty walker and josh and running this running to safe canada and trying to wake up the youth here i see okay okay and now so you posted a a picture you said on snapchat snapchat and then you you asked people to meet you at your locker and they met you this is the first walk out so so walk me through that how did you organize that exactly you said in about 50 50 kids participated one out of six is that about right yeah i guess so but yeah i had actually i had never announced walk out before it organized one but earlier on in the fall there was a movement going on i saw it online and it was a walk out from your businesses and your employment and all that and i said i'm doing it and actually three guys walked it with me so we were four guys and then i think maybe six community members came out and it was really small but it was just like that the first one this is a small initiative i didn't start it i was like but i i i'll support it and i walked out and a couple guys followed me and then months later we decided to actually organize them on our own and yeah i i had no idea what it was going to look like the last one three guys f right right but i started to i started to hear some chatter and all this around the school and i'm waiting at my locker at the time and around the corner i see a bunch of kids holding the the gadson flag and canadian flags and all sorts of stuff and they had signs i was it it was amazing to see yeah you seem happy about it still yeah it why why were you so pleased about that well it was it was it was just refreshing to see after watching you know relationships get strained over the issue and myself be like i'd be sitting in the office for like 3 hours a day just arguing when i should be in class learning and i'd be getting yelled at by my teachers non-stop and like just disciplined constantly so now you had a bit of a crew yeah and now we now we're walking out with numbers and we we just decided to go around i had my crew following me and we just went to every classroom and said all right we're walking out let's go and students would get up and they'd follow us out and so they left their classrooms as you walk through the school y and how did the teachers and the administrators react to that some would yell at me some would slam their doors some would i mean there there was a couple who wouldn't say anything which i would i would take their their silence as a bit of support or some of them would even be smiling under their masks while watching the students walk out of their classes and they didn't mind it all that much but what percentage of teachers do you think were neutral or on your side very few there was very few but there' be a couple and what was there a how would you distinguish the teachers who were neutral or on your side from the ones who weren't nowadays teachers make it pretty clear what their stances are they're supposed to leave politic and all that out of the classroom but they don't and like i basically the ones that showed at me aren't on my side okay that seems pretty straightforward nick why do you think what is it about your brother do you think that put him in this position well i think there's a few a few different things that attribute it but he's naturally a very strong leader people will naturally follow him and why i couldn't tell you there's guess guess he's very intelligent he's well spoken he's very confident people follow confidence especially in a day and age like today where you look at the youth there's no confidence true confidence i believe absolutely you think he's competent very competent do you think he's honest very honest very honest he has a long how how did he learn to be honest do you think well we've had a fairly good role model from her father father he's a veteran he's now a school teacher he's pastor of the church we started the church when we were younger down in arizona yeah he set a very high example for us he raised us right i i believe and corrected us when we were wrong and do you have a good relationship with your father yeah it's a very relationship yes you respect him abs absolutely absolutely well that's quite a lot of respect why do you respect him well i mean you look at our culture today and the number one thing that's under attack is the nuclear family right and the b tells us i know gender might be attack under attack but that that that itself is attacking family yeah yeah and all of it leads back to the nuclear family and the bible tells us honor thy father and thy mother and both of them have been excellent role models and i love them very much and i i respect them and they're they're good leaders and they've stood by me through all this and now both of them are out of their jobs because of me but yeah yeah so nick maybe you can pick up on that so what happened what happened with your parents your dad was teaching your mom what what was her job she's also a school teacher she's all yeah she's all so you guys are really in this all the way aren't you okay so what happened to your parents as a consequence of the political action that you guys started to take right yeah well i think i believe the board is targeting them merely because of our stance they want to retaliate in any way they can in their parents jobs as government jobs are obviously the their first target so the dad was suspended from his job when when was when would this it would abandoned last spring i don't remember the date i believe it was late spring okay yeah and a few weeks after my mom was also suspended and what was the justification for that so my dad was suspended because the on paper the justification was because of his online actions which was funny because at the time he had no social media it wasn't until after in response to that that he actually got social media so they put him on leave from his work they said was for his online actions on social on social media and he had no twitter no instagram so what were his online action he had none it was blatant lie blatant li by the board and so afterwards he got his you can look up the date he got it that's fine that's when he got it he got it because of that and and yeah a few weeks later my mom was also put under investigation because somebody went up to her door and posted a pride flag on her classroom door which no one has the right it's her classroom there's no reason to do that so she went up in the morning took it off the door and she was placed under investigation for that and and for on what grounds touching the sacred object like what exactly was the problem there the fact iess i guess it's considered hateful to not want to play she was a danger to students and this was a kindergarten classroom that they posted the flag on a better question is why is there a pride flag on the door of a kindergarten classroom that's my that's my question not not the fact that the teacher took it off but yeah well it's the mob for you buddy the october 15th tax deadline has just passed i know many of

convoy not especially political no all right so i i would have had i would have had fairly strong beliefs but i wasn't i wasn't very active and now i whether whether you consider it politics or morals i'm quite involved in what's currently happening and how are you involved now we're running a lot of different pro test and meeting a lot of students we're really trying to wake up the youth in this generation cuz that's what has that's what has to happen they have to get you got punched here a little while ago didn't you everyone thinks it was a punch it was it was a blade of some sort i'm not sure i believe it was a bladed glove it could have been a knife but a lot of the anti tell me exactly what happened now this was a recent protest yeah june or sorry september 22nd yeah so tell me exactly what happened that day yeah so we were j billboard chris obviously organized a protest against gender ideology near victoria's park i believe right yeah victoria's park collegiate institute yeah and so we had a decent c decent turnout not as big as we were expecting but decent turnout there's also a large antifa crowd and right off the get-go so we got to the event maybe 45 minutes early m and right off the get-go about 30 antifer across the street and at this point it's just me josh were they all masked up masked up masked up signs yeah yeah yeah the contemptible lot that and okay so josh is doing an interview with one of the media companies i can't remember who it was we do a lot of interviews but as he's doing this there's only about five of us there we're early and the antifa crowd comes running up the street crosses the other side of the street and just swarms us instantly goes physical right off the bat charges into us okay goes physical meaning what what are they doing physically charging into us pushing us back and there's about five of you guys five of us yeah so we're just in there's me mon dy media a couple veterans for freedom guys so he just made make a line in front of josh he's trying to do an interview they're clearly trying to trying to get out him and so we're not we we never and get physical back we stand our ground but we don't punch we don't respond we don't retaliate so they're they're attacking us and one of the guys was actually on on a video one of them has a baton he starts swinging the baton i caught the baton midair and chucked it out behind me but so that that was that was how it started right off the getgo and as this is happening we're clearly being attacked toronto police are there they and we had a meeting with the liaisons about half an hour prior and they stated that they had 100 police officers on the ground at 60 public order ready to go to keep things keep things peaceful so as we're as these antifa guys are attacking us we look behind me i see all the toronto police drive by stop multiple cruisers guys on bikes and then look see what's happening and speed off continues leave us right there in the street so shortly after our crowd really started showing up in numbers and so once how do you explain the fact that the cops left they don't like doing their job they never do well it's strange he because you'd think you'd think that the police the natural sympathy of the police would be more aligned with what you guys are doing you think especially especially after all the events in 2020 but no not at all they're they're very much very much favorable towards the towards the radical left and their the violent r that's top down command absolutely and in fact i've been told as much by certain officers a trend we've been seeing at a lot of our events is that the officers will make a line in between our crowd and the in the woke mob and the officers will be facing our crowd with their back to the woke mob and i' like i' they've said they're they're they're quite nervous i've i've been like have a relationship with a handful of officers and they're nervous having that violent crowd behind you that knows no bounds has no moral no moral compass and no it's absolutely a command from the top town too so when you're being put pushed and shoved by 30 people and there's five of you and some of them have batons let's say how do you keep your temper under control i've honestly never had a problem or very really have a problem getting with temper under control with that there okay there's they test you sometimes i'll say that much but i think in the end our it's it's a lot it's more important that we stay grounded and on on what we believe in and then and truth and take the high ground as opposed to the violent an easy thing say until there's you know 30 people pushing you and being as provocative as they possibly can i mean and you haven't you haven't broken that be before a you haven't let your temper leap out and i've i have lost my temper but i i haven't lost it in public you haven't lost i think we've all lost our temp tempers here and there yeah yeah yeah but you haven't lost in public how about you no i i mean there was a clip that got aired on fox news a while back i was in al berta and good blm and antifa surrounded me outside of high school and they just started throwing me around they were punching me a kid tried to set me on fire they were choking me with my i had a cross on my neck and they were trying to choke me out with it oh yeah that's symbolic one of them one of the ladies with the blm leaders taylor mcn i believe went into to the back of my pants in this struggle anyways the police run in they arrest me but i i just have my hands up in the air while they're doing this and like there there's not much you can do because my goal isn't to run in there and fight with crazed activists i want to get through to students and i want to be a responsible role model to them and be able to bring them the truth in a way that they will listen to it so when a student watches me get attacked not retaliate continue to talk to them while i'm being attacked and then get arrested be told if i come back i'll be charged the breaching the peace oh yeah they interrogate me about what scripture i'm using and stuff what do you mean they interrogate you but what scripture are you using they so they arrested me while i was handing out students handing out bibles to students and i got attacked the police ranan arrested me after watching what had happened i had my hands in the air get getting thrown around and then they had me in custody for a while and started asking me about what's which verses i was using and whether i had violated a conflict bylaw regarding the alphabet community and violated it how by using verses that would target that community and so that was a complete that's fun yeah that was a complete free speech violation but no it's worse than that right that's a freedom of conscience violation that's a freedom of religious belief violation mhm right yeah but yeah anyways that happens they tell me if you return you're going to be the one that gets charged whether it's you that gets assaulted or not and they even told this it's you that gets assaulted or not they said no matter what they said even if i don't get assaulted if i do get assaulted no matter what if i step back if i walk back towards that school i will be arrested and i knew that i had to make a decision there because these i i'd been there four minutes these students were walking out it was a walk out called the iand with josh alexander walk out and it was organized by liberty coalition canada these students have come out all the way across the country to support me i flew down to see them and to visit with pastor arthur pelosi and anyways i go to see them and i get arrested four minutes later so i wanted to return four whole minutes yeah i lasted four whole minutes in calgary and then i calgary has a pretty woke mayor yeah to say the least and and the the calgary police department is just brutal but anyways i i get released from custody they tell me if you return you will be arrested and i said okay and keep your damn bibles out of here yeah and they told my lawyer they said so yeah if you're if josh just leaves the premises now we shouldn't have to to arrest him again there we we won't have to talk again and my lawyer said okay talk soon so right right i i grabbed my bibles i went down the sidewalk and even more students hundreds of students come out now because they've all seen me get arrested with the police now following me as i get closer to the school if i get within their boundaries they'll take me down and just before i was going to walk right in and just before i crossed that line the whole crowd rushed towards me and i started getting attacked again but i was in a location where i was able to maneuver around a little bit more and get students to talk to and we were there for hours just talking to them and they they are able to respect your opinion more so when they've seen how much of a risk you'll take to express it who's more likely to respect your opinion students and and just how confident you are in portraying it and so that was that i would certainly say that was a success but had i lost my temper it would have just completely failed one thing with today's students is they will follow anyone with with like i said confidence and courage nobody that's really lacking in today's generation so any youth with that they will follow okay so let's go back to when you got cut all right so you said you guys were there about 40 minutes before this particular demonstration that was that was at victoria park yeah right near victoria part okay and that was do you remember the date of that september 22nd september 22nd okay okay so so you showed up early there wasn't there very many of you you guys got rushed the cops were ignoring you you were getting shoved around and pushed that's that's how the day started off okay so continue from there yeah so we were there for what maybe two hours before that that went on throughout the day the cops refusing to do their job us getting assaulted went on yeah for a couple hours and eventually the cops cops started actually splitting up our crowd they kind of locked a smaller group of us behind uh behind the police line with antifa behind us and the police on the other side and the other side the rest of our crowd on the other side of the police line and which really isn't right because we we were the ones that arranged the protest we talked to the as we talked about for months we announced that we have a crowd there we don't get it's it's not right to shut our side out because a group of violent violent t have showed up and decide to take over the street but anyway so be it so what good was the liais on absolutely nothing so why what did the charade occur why did they even bother with the lea own that's a good question well i had i had bugged the police for two months in fact i called them before and i i've organized rallies in toronto before they know who i am they know my name yeah i bet they do i i phoned them they asked who it was and i said josh alexander and they immediately had to transfer the call and they give me to some special constable and i talked to him and finally like after 2 months of trying to communicate with with these these guys we get a meeting on the ground the day of with these liaison officers i inform them i want the crowd split it up i know that there's going to be a violent union supported protest oh that's right the unions came out right on the antifa side and so did jag meet sing he marched with antifa yeah right he's such fun yeah no when when that was on the 20th but that day when jake meat showed up he was mthing a whole pile of words at me and nick and he was making gestures with his hands at us looking at doing this at us he was was he yeah yeah were you terrified not at all no i was it was entertaining yeah he's quite the piece of filthy work as far as i'm concerned boy he's got all the faults of trudeau and none of the virtues and the virtues of trudeau is a very short list that's for sure so if you have none of them and all the faults boy you're quite the piece of work oh yeah so he was actively engaged with you was he oh yeah that's real heroic you think a political leader of one of the biggest parties in canada would have a little bit more deorum decorum yeah you might think that right if we weren't led by a bunch of like delusional 13-year-old girls yeah yeah yeah it's quite something to see okay so so you the this this protest was quite aggressive right at the beginning and you guys weren't you not only were you not experiencing any real police support you you as far as you're concerned are actually putting you at a disadvantage absolutely okay strategically okay so what happens to you so i was standing at standing down kind of behind their lines i was in the smaller group that was separated and they would allow if my group wanted to go back and join my crow i could but they wouldn't allow anyone else to join me so i was just having there were talking with an some antifa i start sharing the gospel as we always do make a point it's regardless of whether you're on my side of the of the ideological war or on their side i still want to see everyone there saved i don't want to see i'm i believe absolutely that they're all every all of us are sinners and we all need jesus and so i want to see all of them saved so i i was talking with them sharing the gospel with them so what do you when you sh say you're sharing the gospel under those circumstances what exactly are you doing telling them the truth what okay how do you do that by explaining to them that me them you all of us are sinners destin to an eternity in hell le unless we turn to the cross of jesus and receive his full and free gift of salvation we will perish will pay the wages of our sin it's it's the only hope that that there is for this world is jesus christ and his sacrifice his blood is atoning blood and so i was sharing that message with them which really isn't a message of hate that's a message of love it's that you you've wronged the creator of the universe but he never a good idea never a good idea but we've all done it and he loves you enough to come down and die for you to pay for your sins all and offers you free salvation all you you're trying to make that case in the midst of this m absolutely yeah so what do you think what do you think is the relationship between let's say the positive relationship you have with your father and respect for him that you have perhaps with your mother too your religious belief and your political action as far as you're concerned how are those things tied together well i think my political action are based on my moral compass my moral compass compass is based on my biblical beliefs the bible and the outline that there for us okay okay okay so let's go to to when you get attacked what what happens so yeah i'm talking with them and we're one of their one of the guys on the front of their line dives out and tries to tackle me so i kind of push him off he's mask mask they're all always mask the the physical ones are always mask usually they all are but if they're physical they're guaranteed to be masked see i see so do you suppose that the people who are masking up like that like they're planning physical violence and that's why they're wearing the mask or do you suppose it's the fact that they're mask disinhibits them when they're at the r that and also because i don't think they're proud of what they're standing for i can go there without a mas on cuz i'm proud of what i'm standing yeah oh yeah i think the same thing like if you if you have to show up to your protest in a you're a narcissistic coward right and a dangerous one too yeah and the police should be using that as a marker for for true psychopathy right that's that's absolutely inexcusable so okay so this guy comes after you yeah so he into the crowd just a little guy tries to tackle me and so i'm trying to grapple with him trying to get him off me i have one hand up in the air to show this cops here i'm not assaulting him i'm being attacked here so you're protecting yourself with one hand yeah well first went he as soon as he tack me went two hands on him put him down trying to get him off may have one hand up in the air trying trying to keep him away with one hand and while i'm dealing with this another as salent literally dives over the over their line with whether it was a bladed gloves a lot of them were wearing bladed gloves or a knife or whatever it was tell me exactly what a bladed glove is it's a glove with blade on the fingers a blades coming up the hands here and a blade on the thumb and are those visible from a distance oh yeah so the cops don't do anything about that cu i don't imagine those are legal weapons i haven't looked into it i presume they're not legal but i haven't looked into it but no the cops don't don't do anything about that we which and this isn't a new thing they've were bringing we've had antifu bring knives to our events for a long time yeah so so any yeah so this guy dives across and i kind of in my peripheral i see him coming so i back my head out of most of the hit and he just grazes across my eye you can probably see this gu there it's just five or six stitches i can't remember what it was but and how close is that to your eye maybe an inch and oh yeah that's pushing it it's pushing it yeah especially yeah yeah so okay so you now you're cut yeah so i'm cut i kind of stand up i i watch i can't i can can't see a lot a lot of blood in my in my vision it's kind of blurry but what i believe i the cops picked up the guy who attacked me and put him back in his crowd and kind of closed in all around us everywhere they picked him up and put him back in the crowd they didn't arrest him they didn't arrest him and so i see the cops everyone's kind of closing in around me it's hard to seeing the cops start ordering me to leave like no i was just attacked with a blade i'm not i'm i'm going to stand there how did they do that exactly their particular officer came up to you like how did they order you to leave yeah well they started out they do want medical attention i said no i'm all right i'll just keep doing what i'm doing perfectly and and another officer walks up if you don't leave i'm going to arrest you so i said i said i have every right to be here i'm going to continue standing here and talking i'm on a public sidewalk every right to be there and so i continued talking continued sharing the gospel to members of the opposing side and there's this one girl on the other side that i was talking to and it was like she almost snapped i saw it in her eyes it was like what i was saying was registering with her i don't know if it was the fact that i just got attacked and covered in blood and i'm still talk trying well that would add a little more drama little to yeah and so it seemed to hit home so i just contin talking to her and there's a veteran beside me we call him wild bill he's met he's a combat veteran he's airborne and the cops tell him to leave and he says he's not leaving my side and at this point he's bleeding too cu so what they did is they had an umbrella and they broke the umbrella off it it had a a spear point like that at the end not an actual spear point but very pointy umbrella and they basically fabricated into a spear and they were trying to stab us with that and they caught him in the hand he was hand was all bloody from and so the cops tell him if you don't leave you're you're going to be arrested and he says i'm not i'm not leaving aide don't imagine they were scaring him that much no i think he's seen a lot worse in the antifa and the toronto police but so yeah they arrested him placed him under arrest and then 30 seconds later placed me under arrest and and on did they tell you what the charge was well that's a funny thing so at the time they told me it was obstruction obstruction of what of well that's a general charge obstruction of justice how exactly i don't know and then when i got when they went to book me into the cell to the holding cell they told me it was breach of the peace and they told the crowd that it was for assault so for assault yeah so put that together okay so they trot you off to jail and so you're wondering what's going on i presume yeah i mean i was on the ground here trying to do interviews and somebody runs up and they they tap my shoulder they tell me that nick is being assaulted on the wrong side of the line and wrong side of the line meaning meaning the police have like excluded him in with the counter protest and like he was saying they blocked off certain members of our crowd and at the time it happened to be him and wild bill so i run over there and wild bill he's a character ridiculous man you guys wild bill and billboard chris and the alexander brothers right out there causing trouble so yeah i i run over there and i tell the police i say who's in charge here is there a sergeant i need to talk to somebody and they all just stare blankly over my shoulder as they always do and finally like i have a megaphone so i just start using that to make it very clear there's cameras there's reporters all around me and i'm like i need to speak to a a officer in charge so finally a sergeant comes up and he starts talking to me and i tell them what was the tenor of that conversation again because we have this weird situation where as far as you guys are concerned the police at least secretly are somewhat predisposed to be positive to you and so now you're putting this guy on the spot cuz your brother's arrested like how he isn't even arrested at this point this is where i realize that something's about to happen and i go up to him and i tell him look the policeman yeah i tell my i tell him look my brother's across the line there i'm the organizer of this event i've been talking to you guys for two months you've already kind of betrayed us here and i need to go speak to my brother so let me open up the line let me go through if you want to bring an escort cuz you're worried i'm going to start agitating that's fine do that so they refuse that they say i can't talk to them and they're keeping their line closed and why can't you talk to them they don't give an answer they never do but i so i walk away and i tell them look something's going to happen you've been warned and then i start looking for a a even higher officer and looking for my liaison officer somebody that can pull some strings here and make something happen but anyways about 10 minutes later as i'm doing my thing somebody runs up to me again and they're like your brother's bleeding so i go over there and i see the blood pouring down its face and i asked the cops what happened and i mean i was pretty mad at the time but i hadn't lost my temper i was still fully under control and i'm actually still conducting interviews while doing this and and then i get a hand reach is over from the other side of the police line and taps me and it's wild bill the veteran and he hands me his keys and he says i love you josh but they're arresting me now and i got to go he says can you hang on to these for me i said sure so i take these and they arrested him on the same kind of charge as they arrested you i presume despite the fact that he'd been stabbed with an umbrella yeah yeah we're both bleeding and yeah yeah so bleeding without a permit yeah yeah crime right right well you got a good battle scar out of the deal so this is true you true yeah right yeah okay so well yeah so he hands me his keys and i look over at nick we make eye contact and at this point i know okay nick's being arrested too i've seen it too many times and so then i see nick get arrested and the cops are shouting at me now and they're yelling that i'm going to be arrested i'm not even on the the other side of the line i'm on my own side talking to them asking what's going on and anyways they arrest him they start they throw me around they actually grabbed me and fir me into a young lady while i was talking to them the police did that and anyways so what do you mean exactly tell explain that in detail so you're standing there talking to who the police the police yeah okay then what happens and they start to move wild bill and nick towards the patty way again which is they have to break through their own line they have to let open up their line let the officers take and bill through and as they get closer to the patty wagon i'm talking to the police and there's some that are just standing around there's some that are walking with with the escort and anyways one of them just grabs me i was wearing a a vest and a dress shirt he grabs me from the vest and fires me into this young lady and they start shouting at me they were telling me i was going to be arrested why do you think he did that they're just i mean a lot of them they they take unnecessary violent measures just because they can't a few of them enjoy it like they've been they've been standing here in the sun with a bunch of crazy counter protesters screaming in their ear and they're they're frustrated they've done their they've done their crowd training their their riot control and they just do whatever they want and'll be no repercussions and yeah they know there will be no rec cussions look what happened at the freedom convoy anyways so they do that and nick goes in the patty wagon and me and monty who was also on the ground we go running after this patty wagon a bunch of students from the school follow and i'm trying to talk to officers and i'm trying to figure out where the patty wagon's going whether he's being given medical attention what's going on so anyways monty actually on were you worried about him at that point well yeah i mean it it looked pretty bad at the time i couldn't tell face bleeds a lot there was a pool of blood on the sidewalk where he was standing so he was littering maybe that was the j so monty runs all the way down the the road after this patty wagon all the way to the police station he followed it the entire way i followed it right till it was like around the school and there's a pile of students chasing the patty wagen and reporters and other police and i'm like okay monty's going to follow that i'm going to to go back and talk to the police try to get charges try to figure out transportation get my crowd under control and give them an update and how many people were were there for your protest i want to say it was a a couple hundred yeah like usual there was a a large counter protest but we we definitely outnumbered them wow you had all those union people there yeah but we outnumbered them and then when the students came out for lunch break it was it was much bigger and anyways we we start running now was singh at that protest or when we talked about him earlier sing was at the the the million man march on two days beforehand okay okay and that one was in ottawa but yeah we i i start doing interviews i finally get through to an officer they refused to file any of my reports i i tried your reports being what i tried to make an assault report and i tried to in like inquire about u my family member's arrest and see where he was being held because i was his only point of contact at the time and yeah they they refused to talk to me and so that went on for a while until i just i wouldn't give up i kept following them and i have a megaphone too and a whole pile of students that are echoing whatever i say so there we we're just yeah it was hard it was impossible so finally after they have all these cameras on them they know it's a really bad scene and they finally send me another officer and they give me his where he's being held and what he's being charged for and they told me they told me it was breach of the peace and assault so anyways i i just went about i addressed the crowd again and we tried to visit him at the station after the event was over and i got on the well first as we're walking up the steps to the the the stairs of the police station the security guard locks the doors on us on the the station that's open 24/7 so there's a help number on the door and i call that and it's on camera they hung up on me and then they refused to answer any of my other calls and so then after waiting for about half an hour i get another call from a police officer and they're like you're not allowed in the station but we can put you on the phone with your brother for a bit and we got to talk on the phone and it turned out he was at at the hospital and they dropped his charges so you never were charged with anything no they dropped the charges yeah in the hospital well they so they kept me they took me like i was bleeding a lot they had me in the patty w for about two hours and appar right when i got to the to the precinct i heard a couple officers talking outside the door and they said that the ambulance is here they want to check me out but they wouldn't let the medics in for about an hour and a half before finally they took me out okay so oh so that actually answers a question i had because i thought well you know you want to give the devil is due every time you can i thought well maybe they bundled you away from the protest because you were bleeding oh no no not at all no way that's well the fact that they had the medics like detained away from you for 90 minutes seems to indicate that medical treatment on your behalf was not the reason yeah and the paramedic so yeah so they after about an hour and a half of waiting maybe even longer the the paramedic they take me out to the ambulance they go in the ambulance i'm still handcuffed in there and the par the par medic looks at me and goes oh wow you're going to need statues we have to get him to the hospital and at at the it still isn't like it's still bleeding because there's there's a lot of blood a lot of blood loss and so the paramedics wanted to take me to the hospital in the ambulance and the cop said no that's not we'll take him in a cruiser later so they take me out yeah they take me out put me back in the patty wig and leave me in there so they refused to let you go in the ambulance refused yeah wow i guess it was too big of a threat to society to have me yeah fair enough fair enough so yeah they take me back to the to the patty wagon put me back in there i'm in there for maybe 20 minutes 30 minutes before they take me check me in put me in a cell i was in the cell for a little under an hour had you been in a cell before no i've been i've been arrested before but always whole new thing jail food's not good they take your shoelaces they yeah no no i was wearing cowboy boots they they checked they they said takeing shoelaces and then there's where they saw my boots and they said they don't need to take so i guess they would have been a suicide watch too but yeah so yeah that i was in the cell little under an hour probably so what are you thinking when you're in the cell when am i getting out of here yeah i was hungry i was quite hungry actually so yeah after upset or worried no i i wasn't worried no why not i didn't have a like what's what's the worst that's going to happen i'm going to be locked up for a few weeks before a cork date and at best i'm going to be let out in a few hours with charges dropped and i know i didn't do anything wrong so i'm hoping there's still a little bit of hope left for a justice system that would be let out no charges questionable there's it's it's quite corrupt it's quite corrupt from the top but yeah it's quite corrupt all the way through all the way through yeah i guess if you get a good judge you can be lucky but so anyways they took me after all that time they put me in a cruiser and took me to the hospital escorted me into the into the hospital i'm still handcuffed i'm covered in blood so so walk into a merge and like people are start freaking out i guess still handcuffed yeah i guess they thought i'm a murderer right a guy walks in covered in blood in handcuffs and police escort by him and the receptionist says you're going to have to put a mask on so i look i look i say i'm not going to do that they and they said no no you have to put a mask on its policy i said what are you going to do call the cops good you said that oh good man that make the whole day worth well just to be able to say that and so the cop the cop beside me just starts laughing that's good man that's really funny and so they let me through they took me took me i sat me down i can't believe they told you to put a mask on that's so perfect e it's like it's orchestrated yeah yeah yeah that must have made your day i i was it was quite comedic yes yeah yeah oh my god okay okay so let's go back a bit here to your parents so while all these protests and so forth are unfolding both your mom and dad now they've been suspended okay now were they they were were they suspended with pay or without pay well they were suspended with pay and then they were basically told that they have to abide by the by what they basically have to comply with measures that don't go along with their religious beliefs it's wrong it's harming kids so in your mother's case exactly what does that mean so someone here someone puts a pride flag on the door of her kindergarten class she takes it down okay what is she supposed to abide by exactly she supposed to put up a pride flag like what the hell what what's exactly the issue here what's she supposed to do i guess she's supposed to publicly advertise sodomy on her kindergarten classroom door and she's not going to do that and anyways they basically said that i i don't even know they probably pulled up a bunch of different policies and they told them you have to abide by these things and it's all woke radical left ideology it's being forced on kids which is exactly what i'm fighting and why i've been kicked out of school for over 10 months now and yeah so well you're getting an education oh yeah much better than i was at school but definitely but yeah i've been kicked out since last november of 2022 so and what's the rationale for i'll get back to your parents but what's the rationale for your continued suspension exactly i mean that's a big that's a long suspension i don't know what you'd have to do on the juvenile delinquent side to warrant that sort of suspension but it would have to be something pretty damn serious maybe you'd have to knock a teacher unconscious with a metal chair for example like happened last week in the us though i doubt if they'd suspend that student for 10 months i guess we'll see so what's the rationale for the for for keeping you out of school and this is catholic school right makes it even more blackly comical as far as i'm concerned you think they might be on the side of the you know the scriptures just you might that was what i thought like i'm i'm personally not catholic i'm a born again christian but going into the catholic board i would have assumed that they would maybe sympathize with my views a little more than they did but anyways we get in there and actually it was on one of my first days in the school this wasn't why i was kicked out but this was kind of where i realized that wow this is not a very biblically based school when my math teacher started saying that creation was a myth and it was all hypothetical in the bible and he started saying the entire bible is hypothetical and so i challenged him on that a bit but as opposed to the unalienable truths of woke doctrine exactly so he anyways that that teacher ended up being the one the the teacher whose classroom the debate broke out where i actually got kicked out for a extended period of time and it was because he was shing at me like i was in a classroom of 30 students i'm in the back right corner and i have all these students turned around their desks and the teacher just shouting at me and and what did you do to provoke him so st students beside me started asking about an interaction that had happened earlier in the day because i had been called to the office and whatnot because i i challenged my law teacher where she was talking about how students can be whatever gender they want and all that and i challenged my law teacher on that and that was something that me and that teacher we would respectfully go back and forth like nonstop from from the very first day i was there the first five minutes i was in her class she went on to say that the freedom convoy was unlawful before it had even gone through the court so we we started that was the first one and it just went on every single day we'd go back and forth and it was always poite and it was always fun but we never agreed on anything and anyways some students heard that there was quite a controversial debate in herass class the other day or the other morning and they wanted to hear what happened so these students are asking me questions i'm answering them giving my opinions on it and the teacher gets involved in it and long story short he says that there's like 73 genders or something and it's a spectrum and we can be whatever we want to be and i should explore myself and males can breastfeed children and all sorts of just crazy stuff and at the at that statement that males can breastfeed children i i responded to that and said that's pedophilia and this is where it got really awkward and the debate kind of started to turn he said what do you mean that's pedophilia and i had to explain to my entire math class that my math teacher was defending and promoting grown men forcing a baby to suck on their nipples and i'm i'm in the math class so this is it's completely ridiculous and it's a pretty awkward topic to be having with all these students watching anyways he starts to get like really agitated because now i've used a fairly strong term and he's he tells me that i'm just really not tolerant and i need to be more thoughtful my surroundings as and i i i don't think tolerance is a virtue it's the virtue of those without morals right and so i i don't believe in tolerance at least not to the the level that it's at today but anyways i i ended up quoting mark 106 in response to a student who i've now learned after the fact identify differently stood up at their chair pointing their finger at me like walking towards me shouting in math class saying that i need to be more open-minded and people can be whatever they want to be 106 what's the mark 106 i said god created them male and female it's not simple and i said look i don't have a problem with you identifying differently or anybody but that's up to them the board should not be pushing that teachers should not be promoting this stuff in their classes and lying to their students it's harming children and i said you have your right to do whatever you want to do in private but don't bring it up with students here and it it certainly doesn't change biology in reality and anyways that was it that was the that was the verse that got me you out and they said that i was bullying that student by saying that oh yeah and yeah so that that allegation has been going on for 10 months now okay and what's the rationale for for the duration of punishment i guess you haven't learned your lesson is that so actually at this point they know that they can't justify kicking me out for 10 months so what they did is they suspended me for in indefinitely they called it to an end after 20 days and said look josh can return to school if he abides by our conditions and their conditions were that i was i would be banned from math class i would be banned from religion class and i wasn't allowed to speak to any students who identified as something other than what they were born as and a bunch of other smaller conditions none of them which i agreed to i said look i've done nothing wrong i' oh so it's on you now is it because you're not abiding by the rules yeah so i said i've stated my religious beliefs this is a catholic school if you don't agree with my stance on biology let's open up your bible you you claim to hold the word of god as as the supreme text in your in your own statement of belief and so i said let's open up the bible i said and he said well we can't do that without priests and bishops and stuff here i said bring them all to the bible i said bring them all i said we we will open a bible i said we can have a whole conference meeting if you want and i said we can do it monday and he said no we're busy then tuesday wednesday and we went through an entire week and he wasn't busy once or he wasn't available once apparently and i said okay well i've offered the the offer still stands i'm i'm happy to this day i'm happy to open up the the bible and argue with these heretics but anyways i i they they refused to take me up on that offer and so they kicked me out i then got in contact with liberty coalition canada and they provideed me a lawyer james kitchen and we went back and forth for a while just with the school board's lawyers in mine and they said that because i refused to abide by their conditions of return i'd be excluded yeah yeah i see okay i and so it's not disciplinary it's not disciplinary oh i know no that's like my my the actions against me with cp ontario it's not disciplinary it's like it's just we don't trust you looks like discipline and it smells like discipline and it sounds like discipline and it's in fact discipline yeah but you're not going to use the word it's like yeah okay you guys we know what you're up to and the funniest part is that they told me the that the school board cannot exclude anybody and that's why they have such an an open bard policy on all the washrooms in the school right right and i said oh really then why am i under an actual exclusion order under the education act it's called an exclusion order and but apparently this board can't exclude anybody and i've been under that order for 10 months and they just informed me just recently that i'll be under that order for another year another year yep and maybe longer if i don't agree to their conditions or if we don't come to an agreement so what are you doing to salvage your education you your credentialed education let's say at yeah at this point for credential education all i can do is well i suppose i could withdraw from the school and try to enroll at another school and we all know that wouldn't yeah i wouldn't go that wouldn't go very well you could do it though i could and i've consider move strategically but i' i am fighting against the board right now and i we went to the ontario superior court of justice on whether i had standing to appeal all the decisions made against me and i won wow wow that's good news yeah it was it was a it how are the legal how are the legal bills going so that one that one obviously paid for self because we won but like i said liberty coalition canada supports me and so they cover all the costs on that end of the against the school but we won that case so now i believe it's at the beginning of november i will be going in to a hearing a two week long hearing to are you pursuing damages yes we are how much i don't remember what the damages were my lawyer would be the better guy to ask about that no i wouldn't know i wouldn't know the number but so let me ask you about your parents again so you said to begin with they were put on leave with pay and and what was the spacing between your father losing his job and your mother being suspended two weeks or so two weeks oh wow you'd think they would have been more intelligent strategically than that but my sense of the people who persecute in this manner is that not only are they corrupt ideologically they're absolute morons when it comes to strategy so it usually comes back to bite them okay so they did they suspended them both with pay to begin with yeah and then they put these conditions on both of them i presume your parents didn't weren't willing to abide by the conditions so did they then suspend their pay so at this point right now they're kind of in they're just waiting because the board gave them that deadline to agree with the conditions they didn't they asked for an extension they're working with the union the same that imagine the unions are really working hard on their behalf the un was in that meeting that went viral my parents union where they were naming me and saying that they need to come to my protests they put out they put out emails to their entire union saying go protest josh alexander outside the rcc dsb headquarters and all this so we we can already figure how much support they're going to give my parents but that that's where it's at right now so it's it's really only a matter of time they're they're they're just killing it's the same thing my board's doing too the time is on their side of course is they'll just kill they're not suffering directly from the consequences of the delay yeah that's one of the terrible things about being dragged through a process like this is that it's 100% to the advantage of the people who are using the process as the punishment to drag it out as long as it possibly can dragged out how old are you 17 17 you don't look 17 you look older than that both of you well that's good for you you're not not kids and most 17-year-olds are kids lots of 30-year-olds are kids you guys don't look like kids anymore so that's that's something worth attaining when you're young so what has this done to you i mean or for you and how has it hurt you well i mean it's certainly it's changed my life in every aspect like everything has changed i'm no longer working the the the same jobs i would have been doing i'm no longer in the education system all my other peers are still in in in the system and just going about their regular life and unfortunately complying with the the idiocy that's going on within the board and i mean okay what sort of circle of friends do you have around you or did you have around you you've got your brother you've got monty yeah i i mean after all this and after we've been challenged on a national level i i like to keep my circle small only people i would trust with my life right and so that that's certainly not many i mean i i don't have any friends from either of my schools you don't a no why is that well i mean at my catholic school i had only been there for maybe uh well i been i went in there september got kicked out in november so okay so you didn't have a chance to rebuild a p didn't know too many students i already had a reputation as the as the the convoy kid they actually the kids at that school nicknamed me freedom and well there's worse nicknames there are exactly so like i had a reputation kids were kind of nervous around me for some reason and i just never i never pursued friendship that much because i knew that education's ending soon i just had different goals and i guess in that manner i kind of kept to myself but mh yeah no like i i i also just seen what the education system produces and impressed with it it produces docile weak pathetic excuses for for what what should be people that are just beginning to go into the world and start their life and start their family there's no ambition yeah well ambition that's all part of that patal oppression yeah like everybody's getting married at 30 and divorced at 35 and childless divorced at 35 yeah talking about the education system i think correct me if i'm wrong i believe he's the founder of the cynic philosophy believe i believe he was and he said that the education of the youth is a foundation of a country so if that's the foundation of our country we've got a giant crack line running right through ours cuz yeah well one of the things that really struck me to the core i would say when i started lecturing publicly and and being exposed to a much wider range not so much range a much larger number of people was the degree of demoralization especially among young men now of course if you demoralize young men you also demoralize young women because you know we're in this together and the degree to which that was the case was really quite shocking to me and you know and i i thought it through i mean boys in particular they get they get pillared when they're very young because their play preferences don't match up with the idiot idiot what would you call it false calmness of the typical classroom so that's a big problem and then of course anything that's anything that's heterosexual is suspect on the grounds of power dynamics essentially any ambition is associated with patriarchal oppression and if you managed to escape all of that well then you're destroying the planet so that's basically your destiny as a young man right and any avenue of enterprise you might pursue in terms of ambition is suspect because all ambition is power and then all enterprises evil capitalism and you know you're pretty much left with no with no out and so well so that's demoralizing and and i suppose i think it's purposefully demoralizing because if you believe that human activity is intrinsically destructive socially and with regard to the biosphere then you want to demoralize young men so so what so they sit around and do nothing because that way they're like they're like involuntary buddhists you know their only virtue is harmlessness of course that's not a virtue exactly and if you're part of the elite if you want to tighten the tyrannical grasp in society so to say what's the first thing you want to do you want to soften the men because that's going to be your biggest resistance right off the bat if looking historically it's the young men who will be most resilient to oppression and so a direct attack on their masculinity is the so so you guys are now trying to you you talked earlier about trying to work with young people and so what are you doing exactly what are your what are your goals and how are you organizing that well our main recently we the we've used our platform like you said to just go to schools and that i mean whether you consider it a protest or an event whatever we're able to interact with students and we're able to so walk me through a typical event now how would you organize it well yeah we just how do you pick a school i'll have a student reach out to me or something on social media yeah how can they do that well they just they just message me and they tell me go they they tell me what's going on their school how can they message you let's tell people so in case they need to message you it's on my twitter's official josh a and my instagram's josh. alexander safe canada okay so if they want to get in touch with you they can do that okay so someone gets in touch with you and then you organize something how do you organize it out of school because of course the school isn't going to let you like organize the way we do it is we usually just we talk to the students we ask them for a little bit of a layout what it looks like and if i can get in contact with a police officer or something i'll warn them and tell them we're coming here and then we throw it a post on our social media and it gets shared around a bunch and we just we just show up and show up where like at the school we'll just go on the sidewalk or wherever we we aren't allowed to go on the school property so some place adjacent to the school and z how many of those events have you done quite a few yeah are they growing yeah rapidly they are well like if you look at the numbers our the first gender related protest that we had in ottawa was in this february and it believe it had 17 people show up to it and the last one was on september 20th in nwa and estimates of 8 to 9,000 people showed up giant so that sounds like exponential growth exponential so so 9,000 people and that was to which event the million man march we were we were kind of organizing the one in ottawa and so yeah big like you said exponential growth people are waking up think doing any good yeah absolutely i think what are you doing that's working well i think just giving the students inperson interaction they've all a lot of these students have seen me online they've seen me get arrested but they don't really think much of it it's just kind of a distant figure right something that happened it couldn't happen near me what we do is we bring it to their school we show them how real it is we have the police and the public order units lined up we have counter protests they're watching the culture war on their doorstep and they're watching it unfold and something as simple as a kid taking a photo with me and posting it will then embolden other children right to what emb to what to speak up because all of them are afraid or even just in private in discussion with each other to share their opinions they're all so afraid how many provin have you done this in so far most of what we do is in ontario but we've i did one in alberta that was in calgary yes and then i believe i did some stuff in nova scotia as well are you building an organization underneath this we're we're working on that but it's it's been so busy it's just like we're trying to just be able to run our events of the time and with all the court dates and stuff i mean i've been arrested three times just since february the first one being at my high school and and then he's been arrested three times as well and monty's been arrested i mean it's just it's ridiculous we none of us have any criminal charges because we're innocent but innocent but it's like that matters but it it's that's why you're being arrested by the way yeah yeah yeah yeah well putting a subsidiary organization underneath you might be a good priority because you could multiply your efforts you know so have you found other young men or young women for that matter who who are willing to commit to this sort of enterprise yeah especially in the last last month or two a lot more have been coming out of the woodworks like we like we we said when we kind of started nobody wants to be the first one to yeah step up and and take the hits but if we do that people will probably follow us and it is working young young people are are stepping up behind us and following it following us and political leaders like have have you been have you been reached out to by any political leaders i mean we've already established the fact that the jag meet singh is not one of your fans i which is definitely a testament to your virtue as far as i'm concerned but what about what about other political figures i would say that the politicians have been the biggest disappointment of anybody there's there's not a single mp that has yet public while representing the people publicly said anything about what's going on and a lot of people i myself included when i saw the the conservative party elect their new leader pier pev i i had a lot of hope i thought this guy like he i i had watched him since i was little and i i mean i knew he's really good on the floor with his analytics think he should do well i think he needs to speak up he needs to speak for parents i mean we did that event on sep 20th he he did announce that he was on the side of the parents on twitter during the million what was the million million person march for mar but the the issue was he was on west block parliament right the morning of he was there and he walked by and we have it on camera while the crowd's assembling for the march and we we actually had the crowd chanting for paev to come out and just to have like a sense of leadership right in the political realm and it doesn't exist and it's like i i recognize that it may not be the the wisest strategical move for a politician to get involved in the culture war but the i think that's also one of the biggest mistakes canadian politics has made the american american politics includes the culture war it's one of their biggest talking points but here in canada it's like i said it's just analytics it's all the it's the the price of milk and all this stuff that it matters and it's it's something that our prime minister is failing on right now but there's not enough there's not enough leadership and when i i got to talk with pa the conservatives often there afraid because but i'm seeing that starting to change in canada because you have people you know paev is is is has is showing more spine than conservatives have in the past by a substantial margin you have you have danielle smith in alberta and scott mo they're also pushing back to a fair degree but you know for a long time the conservatives were intimidated i suppose partly because the leftists are very good at eliciting guilt and also because of mob tactics you know and it's the same thing is that a conservative would stand up and say something that was relevant to the culture war and then that particular individual would get mobbed and being mobbed as you guys know is no no picnic and so that tended to put them back on their heels the combination of guilt and let's say fear of the mob and there is reason to be afraid of the mob you know i mean i know hundred people now who've been publicly excommunicated let's say and the vast majority of them responded like they had contracted the near fatal illness you know they ended up in under psychiatric care or losing a tremendous amount of weight or you know reacting as if they're threatened right to the core which of course they are how are your parents responding to what's going on around you and and and what what what are is your family like very well united in in terms of what you guys are attempting to do do you speak with each other strategically how how is your family deal dealing with this and are you guys still both living at home no i'm on the road like almost full-time oh yeah and i mean i would i spent most of the summer in the states and then i was in different provinces and just all over the place so we're from a little town of a thousand people and there's not much you can you can network from there but right so we we haven't been living at home but yeah i'm we're constantly talking our family's pretty close and i mean are you the only two siblings no we have a a younger brother who we were speaking about earlier and then a right right how old is he he's 14 right and what did you say it happened to him he was just he just got kicked out for wearing your hat yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah are you marketing those hats yeah they're they're website yeah that's which website is that save canada. shop so if you need a hat save canada. shop yeah m yeah yeah okay okay well maybe we can scare up some more purchases for your hats see how many kids we can get kicked out of school for illegal hat wearing yeah yeah so what's the plan for the future well right now it's it's hard to predict what's going to happen everything's changing so fast i have like countless court dates coming up and we i mean court dates for what well i mean i have to i have a bunch against my school i have to go back to alberta for i believe like five court dates for the incident that happened at the school different different stuff there like again tangled up in legal red tap i mean like you said the the process is the punishment whether i'm the one being charged or not it's still it's like it's a massive disruption to my life and anyway so we're going to be focusing on that we're going to be continuing to communicate with students we're also going to try to be is that your primary focus the the expansion of your of your network within within high schools in particular right now that's mainly what we focused on but just because that's who we're able to communicate the best with because i am in high school and these students know who i am more than any other group but as as a young person watching what's happening in the world my greatest passion is be able to share the gospel and share my beliefs and like nick was saying earlier that that is the only way we will ever truly be able to save canada and it's not us right but we certainly get to play a part in that and i want to reach people with the truth it's more than saying that there's only two biological genders i want i want people sex sexes if you will but i i want them to be able to understand the the truth of the gospel and understand that we're all sinners myself included and we need we need a savior and so if if if that means means that i have to do it in a controversial manner with constant conflict i will because who else is going to go and reach those crowds and i mean they may hate us and they may call us hateful but at the end of the day we're we're sharing the the greatest love story known to man how did you get tangled up with billboard chris i met him at a well actually he just ended up posting about me on social media after one of the big rallies we did a pile of students came out of a school here in york mills collegiate institute here in toronto and they there was a photo that went really viral of hundreds of students in a circle with me and they were we were handing out bibles and praying together and stuff and this was just happening outside of a toronto school which was the belly of the beast here in canada right and so that was certainly encouraging and it it went everywhere and chris saw that and he reached out to me and we decided to do an event together and this was around the same time where his assault in bc really went viral so what do you think of billboard chris i i i like him a lot he he's he's something that our country lacks which is a father that cares yeah he he is a a role model that young people could use do do you have any idea what how he decided to wear a billboard like when i was okay i i want to hear i'll tell you so when i was about your age the guy with the billboard was like a running joke right he'd be the crazy guy out on the corner and the sign on there would say you know the world is ending and repent repentance is nigh the world is ending and it was a joke right to wear a billboard like that and it was a joke that everyone knew an old joke and so now we have billboard chris with this billboard on so what what what motivated him and what do you think he's up to yeah so basically what happened is he was watching what's unfolding and contrary to what most fathers did he said okay i actually want to do something about with this and his first move i believe he has daughters and he didn't like it and his first move was to put up a billboard that said i love jk rolling after she spoke out right was that in vancouver where did he do that i believe it i want to say it was in vancouver but i'm not positive about that right so he rented a billboard space and it got removed after a day it was too controversial and he tried all sorts of other yeah because what has jk ring done for the world and so they kept getting removed so he said you know what i'll be the billboard so he just put it on himself and he'd go out and he'd start conversations and it blew up quick yeah and yeah it blew up really quick he came from nowhere and and became very famous very rapidly it was a smart move i see so he decided to be the billboard because they couldn't take him down or at least not so far yeah so now the the event that how did you guys jointly organize the event that you were at together he just reached out to me i said look let's let's go to a school together that's what i've been doing and it's been garnering support and you've been on the other side of the country going viral too and imagine the effect we could have together so we we put out this event and i rarely do this but we we announced it like two months beforehand and that gave time for people to book flights and stuff and it was really starting to pick up a lot of support online and sure enough the day came and it was i had never h organized a protest where the our crowd outnumbered the counter protest and it did and we had a massive crowd and that was where was that in that was in ottawa that was in ottawa and is that the one that sing opposed no that was this was back in june singapore was the one in the million man march just on the 20th here in september okay so the fir the one that you did with with billboard chris was before the million march have you been in touch with the organizations organ organizers of the million man mark yes yeah who are those organizers who's doing that it's an organization called hands off our kids that started it and i actually first met them at the event me and billbo chris did they all came out and we got to meet them and i've been them i think they're just concerned parents from what i know people that are sick of watching our country go under hateful concerned parents as trudo would say right right no he didn't say that apparently apart from the fact that it's there like on his twitter feed right so i actually think the fundamental problem a fundamental problem technically speaking is that the faculties of education have a hammer lock on teacher certification and the faculties of education have been for 60 years arguably the most intellectually corrupt faculty in the universities they're their to call their research appalling is to barely scrape the surface the faculties of education generate one idiot piece of society damaging pseudoscience after another and they've been doing that for decades and they attract to they attract the worst students who are in teaching for the worst reasons often because they're confused and don't know what else to do sometimes because they pretty happy about the fact that they get two months of summer vacation dreadful academic records their standards are dismal to say the least and they're unbelievably woke and yet they have a monopoly on teacher certification the fact that conservatives haven't woken up to this or even classic liberals for that matter is a kind of miracle of stupidity it's the same in the in the united states the the education enterprise complex the education propaganda complex right like the military-industrial complex has a hammerlock essentially on 50% of american state budgets because that's the percentage of the budgets that go to the education system and so it's a complete bloody scam right from top to bottom but the the heart of the beast is the faculties of education and if conservatives and genuine liberals had a clue they would take te teacher certification away from them tomorrow and that would be i think that's the achilles heel of the woke movement because as long as they've got that right to certify teachers they have control over a huge part of of the political budgets and so and conservatives have been blind to this well literally since the mid-60s it's a long time right that's 60 years it's like it's time to wake up guys this can't go any farther so now it must be hard for you too to look forward into the future e because your lives are very chaotic and and transforming continually it's like do you have some sense of because you're young how old are you 19 19 so you guys are both very young like what would you your lives they're not never going to be the the same so you can just forget about that but that could be a huge advantage it's like if you could maneuver your way through this properly carefully what do you see yourselves doing couple years down the road what where do you want this to go if if you could if you could manage it properly that's kind of the question i get asked so much and like you said our lives are so chaotic it's it's really hard to tell i don't know where i want to go and i'm kind of searching right now my goal is to learn as much as possible while i'm young and improve myself or whatever is to come what do you want to learn about anything and everything really i've just i'm constantly got my my nose in the book now i've got a great reading list online you know oh i'll have to take a look yeah there's about 150 books i just i just finished your book you did which one the your first 12 rules yeah oh yeah but yeah like i'm i'm just trying to learn as much as possible and whether i continue doing what i am right now on such a public scale i'm i'm happy to do that and i' i'd just as happy be okay to never be see a camera again right but i mean it's it's really about where the lord wants me and i'm how do you decide what to do next what guides you well i mean i i have a role models in my life people i respect who i can ask advice for and i can also i mean i spend a lot of time praying and stuff and how do that just through reading the word and just praying in general and how keeping a relationship and understanding and trying to learn the the word of god as much as possible so i' i've been thinking about prayer in relationship to thought so i actually think that thought is secularized prayer so because here imagine here are the components of thought okay so the first the first thing that has to happen if you're going to think is you have to have a problem okay and you have to admit you have a problem because why think otherwise i don't think there's much difference between admitting you have a problem and adopting a stance of humility or being on your knees so to speak symbolically it's like i've got a problem i don't know how to solve it i'm looking for so that's a lack in you obviously i'm looking for a solution okay so that's the next thing is you're looking for solution you have put that question forward now this can even happen with people who are purely secular so the next thing that happens is you you formulate the question and then you open yourself up to something approximating revelation as far as i can tell you know is you're you're contemplating the problem at hand and an answer will arise now that's a mystery you know people will say well i thought up the answer it's like well why didn't you have the answer to begin with if you were capable of thinking it up up where' the answer come from it's like well i thought it up it's not that's not much of an explanation there buy the answer appears and then you have to critically assess it right that's testing the spirits you might say critically assess it to see if this is a solid if this is a solid idea or if it comes from sources that are untoward right because you want to be guided by the highest possible spirit so to speak and so and you can establish that in part through dialogue internal dialogue that would be part of thinking or di with other people but it is possible to step forward on on a firm foundation right if you do open yourself up it's something like you're you you've got the humility that enables you to receive the revelation and then the quality of the revelation is dependent to some degree on your aim and so if you're aiming up and you're attempting to abide by the truth then the spirit that makes itself manifest to you in that revelation let's say will be reli iable right and then you can feel your way forward one step at a time and not make a mistake you can do that with your words if you're very careful both you guys you're very careful speakers you know i didn't see any sign in either of you during this conversation that you were taking liberty with your speech and like you're actually in a position of some temptation because you have so much public attention focused on you you know there's always the possibility that whatever flaws you have will be magnified by that especially the case when you're young because you know you don't have a tremendous amount of experience and all of a sudden now you're in the public light but i haven't seen any of that emerge in our conversation and you maybe you've been pounded down hard enough by everything that's happened to you to keep you properly humble you know hopefully right because with all the attention that's focused on you you could make some pretty spectacular errors if you wanted to be in cautious right high probability outcome so okay so you don't know you're trying to learn well that's good that's good yeah well it's a tough it's a tough one to see to see through right because things are so crazy in canada at the moment it's not obvious at all what the appropriate pathway forward is know and so what's okay so what's on the immediate horizon on the immediate horizon there's well we've got a couple other protests probably we haven't announced them yet but they'll be coming out very soon how can people keep track of your activities i we post it all on mainly my social media and tell people that again find out twitter official jorea and instagram's josh. alexander safe canada so it's twitter and instagram you're using most yeah do you use youtube at all no but we are starting a youtube channel we're i'm looking to to start a show so i guess that one is going to be something in the near future yeah well there's a niche you know that isn't occupied in canada one of the things you guys could do on youtube and you've probably got the social reach to manage it is to start doing an interview series with people who are in high school right to talk about serious issues but among people who are really young like i can see a bit of a cultural transformation starting to take place tilting younger people more towards a more classic conservatism but it's really young people right it's not people in their 20s even it's people who are well maybe your age are younger and so there's a market there and you have enough reach to already start to publicize that and i haven't seen anything like that in canada there's the odd youtube channel in the us where young people are talking to other young people but you're in a prime position to do that and the thing about youtube is that you can have long and serious conversations you know and so it'd be interesting i i'm not giving you any advice because you've got enough things on your plate but you're already using social media and you're you're not taking advantage of the at at least at the moment of the place where long form discussion is most possible right and it' be very useful for young people to see see a place where serious discussion on ethical and political matters would actually be possible and youtube's a miracle for that right cu there's no cost of entry and so yeah is there anything you guys want to say in closing you you you're going to be talking to a lot of young people in canada nick let's start with you like you've got all your peers out there young men like you what do you want to tell them stand up be a man do your duty as a man and don't bow to the woke mob what's the advantage of that you have honor what's the advantage of that you have self-respect you have respect genuine self-respect right not this false self-esteem and we're all going to have kids in this world someday and i don't know i don't know everyone else but i don't want to bring kids into a world like this how it is right now so if we can change and we can make a change right now i think it's imperative that we we stand up and make that change what's been the okay so so you've done what you could to speak your mind you said the advantage to that at least in part is self-respect what do you think that means that that self-respect that's associated with your willingness to put what you believe to be true forward why do you think that imbus you with self-respect because i know i'm morally standing on the right right side of what's happening because the morals i'm standing for are based on the word of god which is the foundation of my life so i talk to this guy jonathan pasio paso is worth following by the way he's probably the deepest religious thinker i've ever met he's got an uncanny eye for patterns and for for narrative interpretation he said you're supposed to orient yourself ethically in two dimensions so one is collective right it's like in order to get along in the world we have to agree with one another at least to some degree yes at least to some degree right because otherwise it's fractiousness and conflict and so part of what you're doing when you're seeing if you're orienting yourself properly is to see if you can pull other people into voluntary agreement with you now the problem with that is that that's the crowd you know and the crowd can go insane from time to time and clearly does absolutely so so then the the consensus per se can't be the only dimension of ethical orientation and so there's a horizontal axis of ethical orientation that'd be associated with jacob's ladder and the mountain image in the old testament is actually a representation at least in part of the consensus dimension and the and the transcendent dimension and so to orient yourself you need an you need what would you say an alliance with with what's traditional and religious and you need an alliance with your social community siman you have to be able to function in society and yeah right right well be a good man as well you need to have those two dimensions working simultaneously so yeah so josh you you've what do you what do you have to say to young men young women for that matter too and are you talking more to young men would you say are you talking more to young women do you know i mean i'm talking to everybody and it's not just young people my message is mainly focused on young people but i think everybody could listen to this advice and it's not that i'm full of wisdom you just have to look at a a history book look how culture and societies functioned and were successful and it it it was a lot of it was founded in the nuclear family and it was found in the truth and like he was said as as a young man i want to have self-respect and honest self-respect and in order to do that i need to i need to fight for the truth and the fact of the matter is you're going to face persecution for standing up for what's right we're in a world of yeah you're going to face persecution for not standing up for it too though you know you bet man this is the thing people don't understand especially when things start to destabilize is you're screwed both ways yeah and so you can just accept that and think well fine then i'll i'll stick to the truth and i'll take my i'll take my chances with that side of the equation and there's no trouble-free pathway through life you can just dispense with that idea instantly this is why the security seeking that people engage in when they don't say something with when they have something to say is so counterproductive it's like well if you keep your mouth shut you won't get in trouble in the next 10 seconds but the next 5 years might be kind of dismal right as everything you love falls apart and and you pull everyone along with you into the cowardly abyss it's like you might as well just say what you have to say right now and get it over with yeah it suffer now or suffer later right yeah it suffer now somewhat with a certain degree of honor let's say or suffer much more and much more invisibly and with a lot more people later yeah that's a stupid deal yeah so yeah and you sacrifice your soul on that pathway too and that's not a very good idea exactly and yeah i believe like i believe that this life is such a small portion i i truly believe that we're just pilgrims here and we have an eternity to look forward to and i would encourage any young person to i mean exercise and maintain self discipline learn as much as possible and get on the winning side i mean as as a christian i know that we've already won we're fighting from victory and not for it and and when christ paid the price on the cross that was it it was finished that's what he said and it is it it's it's quite encouraging to know that and no matter what happens we win christ already paid the price for us we've already won he's our sins are paid for so so all i can do is continue to fight for what is right and try to encourage other people young and old to to quit running towards eternal damnation repent of what they've done wrong and and join the winning side and like like you said it's it it it you will face a little bit of suffering now but it's a lot better than eternal torment right and separation from god and so yeah i would i would certainly encourage everybody to uphold the truth and focus on improving v just in their own life but also uh sparking change in a world that is just spinning out of control right now mh all right gentlemen very nice talking to you thank you thanks for having
