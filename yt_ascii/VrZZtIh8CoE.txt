your bag all right and i figured there's no better person to start with than gary vee i totally agree dude that guy works harder than anyone else how does he do it what's his secret he's got one secret when it comes to efficiency and that is he swallows every piece of gum he's ever chewed wait he doesn't he doesn't spit nope he swallows follow every piece of gum i've swallowed every piece of gum that i've ever chewed in my life i don't think it's cool or anything i don't think it's amazing it's just the truth i think it's efficiency i don't think i want to give up the 100th of a second putting in a napkin no no this is impossible this man is on another wavelength yep he's not even dude this wow well i thought we were going to start at like how i can optimize for the hours nope we're starting with chewing gum okay because it's it's the little things that add up here if you can cut down seconds and i mean milliseconds in your day you can maximize productivity and get that bag i really have a lot to learn here have you ever heard of that that's step one that child tale where like if you swallow gum it stays in your system for seven years yeah this man is made of gum dude i don't even want to think about like what his bowel movements are like so coffee you know tai lopez right yeah what does he say about the best investment you could possibly make what does it make it in yourself do you make it in yourself did i answer that right yeah it's knowledge all right so so in order to get this knowledge you have to attend some master classes and mentorship programs so next we're gonna watch a video from v con it's garyvee's own mentorship program right and he asked some q a with the crowd and this video i think you're gonna like it oh let's roll it i mean it's so much more like easier to say like oh it's just perspective but like on the daily when things are happening and i know you're in the middle of doing something let's say for your business who do you love the most in the world my fam i love i love when people just they interrupt the thought and they just start their own train of thought like she's like hey you know when you run a business who do you love most in the world it's so obnoxious she's giving like this heartfelt speech and he just interrupts hey that's all cool and stuff but shut up for a second let me shut up let daddy talk okay it works' hours you or me did you swallow your gum on the way to work today i don't think so okay pipe down good who in your family pick one all of them you're very politically correct cool every day like wait wait wait wait he's like stop i know you i know you have a favorite come on literally once a day genuinely sit there for five minutes and make pretend one of them got shot in the face i'm being dead no no no no no no no this is fake no he for real for five minutes a day envisions the person he loves the most with their face shot up yep getting shot in the face point blank why dude what do you mean why you should know this by now that's true how stupid of me to ask dude you got to take risks in life you know business is savage out there it's cut throat you gotta picture your loved ones getting shot in the face to maximize profits it's really rough out there it's really not that complicated it's serious with you every single day i almost i said this today earlier i probably once a week to four times a week sit there truly in the shower on a flight when i wake up some people meditate right some people work out i picture my family getting shot in the face i actually sit and truly try to convince myself that i have lost one of the five most important people in my life and that is the biggest thing i do that leads to the biggest happiness i have [music] wait he imagines his loved ones getting shot and then i just imagine his a smile creeps up on garyvee's face you can't tell me he's not a sociopath okay all right well uh i gotta admit we're off to a bad start so i can't i can't spit out my gum anymore we're swallowers now and we must imagine our loved ones dead i was you know i was kind of hoping for something about working hard you know i got you okay good good give it to me you ever hear of shreds no who's that so shreds was a fitness company probably about five to eight years ago and they got busted for a ton of fraud but that's not important okay wait don't say anything more you had me at fraud tell me his secrets [music] dude there is there there is such thing as being too handsome dude he looks like he was carved out of marble what is up with this face dude this is the final boss is this the jar size guy the guy where you like chew the thing and it makes your jaw super strong oh the the jaws are size no no oh gosh and what's so special guys should be their model nothing i'm just like [music] no you're not dude this guy's built different he's got everything every morning you can either dude look at how many likes it has dude 1.6 likes zero dislikes this is a very well liked video dude we're gonna go and slap a like on it dude oh man this is me looking at my future dude future is bright that's it right there right bro dude look at those traps those are traps of success right there hey what do you think can we do a quick fitness flop is this guy is this guy on the gear what what is this guy he is audi he's on all the gear dude okay i need some of that gear for my face [laughter] i won't tell you what food to eat i won't tell you what supplements to take but i will tell you the secret to success you gotta have your eyes gotta have your nipples out all december there is none that's it coffee there's there's no secret wait what those are all his phones dude he's a traitor but he trades on all those phones at the same time it's just him just that's why well i think you know what i did think i learned something from that and that is to think of working while you're sleeping that's a next level move all right what what else do we have here because i don't i need something for my mind too i mean i'm gonna be relentlessly going through this month of course i gotta have something for just not just my body which will be roided out by the end of this year you will see yeah but i also need something for my mind so we're going to learn from the best now this is forbes you know forbes right they do like the 30 under 30. all millionaires yeah yeah yeah all millionaires yeah all of them very successful very legit so this is a series called the relentless and i mean it kind of speaks for itself i wake up every day at 4 30 i work out shower meditate and get dressed sometimes my meditation is just a quick minute to remind me to keep working hard and always be grateful remember if you're going to three seconds where i think of my dad lying on the cold floor dead also helps a little bit too i'm sorry i shouldn't i shouldn't joke i lie at the feet of the master i'm sorry to make fun of this i am here to learn i don't usually wear a suit to work but this is the time of year when most charities have their annual benefit dinners i plug in my headphones and start listening to my audio books i listen at three times the normal speed and get through a little more than yep you ever listen to audiobooks at three times speed no i have it is that is that the move is that quite literally inaudible like you can't understand it wait i think in testament to this man we should listen to this entire thing on 2x okay i almost gave you by train so i use an absolute my weight on the flat ones i want to train five seconds i'm in the office i try to get twenty five miles an hour in the morning wait there's too much here he's in the office by seven a.m how does he get to work i i've already lost so much he he walks miles after he's worked out yeah so he wakes up at 4 30 he meditates about working hard and then he listens to an audiobook at three times speed as he walks to the train station but he uses an app to minimize the amount of time so he never misses a train he's like never late right then he gets to the office at 7 00 am but he's got a standing desk with a treadmill attachment so he can get some more steps in people have to be roasting this guy let's go check out the likes dislikes oh dude everyone loves it again everyone loves it crazy dude how many people just love no one sees through it i guess no dislikes i mean he's just on that grind setting it's nothing but respect from me you know 15 minutes every day today i'm sorry i i'm sorry i know it's so beta of me but i got to turn this down to normal i can't even hear him hold on i'll i'll let it slide this time but come on okay all of my internal group meetings with three deep breaths it helps me get centered and bring my attention to the meeting then i'm off to grab a quick bite my next meeting's in midtown so i get on the train and listen to music i'm done by 5 45 and headed to the gala i keep my girlfriend posted on my eta tonight we're supporting an education charity for children of lesser means in south africa i'm out by nine and in bed by 10 30. waking up early to do it all again tomorrow there you go i mean what do you say in bed by 10 10 30. so that's six hours of sleep whoa what is this guy this guy's greedy he's a little he's a little greedy little if i'm being honest i mean i thought 3x speed i thought he was something but now that i hear you sleeping what six hours a night yeah it's too much sleep well yeah i will tell you i have been looking into this i've been doing some self research myself and i did find out that this guy obviously isn't worth anything because i heard a quote apparently all billionaires wake up at exactly 4 a.m do you hear about this yeah it's common knowledge it's part of this grind set bible dude well yeah i mean thanks a lot for telling me philly on i mean i appreciate it that's why we're having this master class yeah that's right yeah look at this dude six million people are billionaires they all watch this and they all got on their grind set so we're going to join them absolutely why are successful people waking up at 4am but not oh sorry too fast too fast for me i apologize different hour what is the secret behind it well they know how their brain works and they take advantage of their brainwave states and brain chemistry produces electrical patterns often referred to as waves when you're first awake your brain operates at around ten and a half waves per second yeah cause you're not awake you're tired dude when i wake up i can't think i'm operating at about three waves per second when i wake up yeah that's why you're broke you know that's why you're not a billionaire dude billionaires are at that other level the range from 8 to 13 hertz or cycles per second is the alpha stage it's been called the gateway to the subconscious mind but when you wake up this early you are between theta and alpha where did they get this research the joe rogan institute i mean where did this grow science come from dude i think jocko willink yeah probably the mind is capable of deep and profound learning being fully aware and focused this was just gary vee with like a voice modulator to take off the mask he just has a monopoly on all these motivations yeah now speaking of i want to talk about this for a second because there is a day in the life of gary vee i mean maybe we should check out what time he wakes up it's got to be something like if if it's not 4 am i'm not impressed dude true true true [music] oh 5 15. [music] what 6 am he's playing basketball with the boys dunking on joe rogan yeah dude this is impossible [music] all right gary get the get to the point [music] i just got to know when he goes to sleep let's skip ahead a little bit meeting with drock 8 p.m he's having a dinner business meeting he's still he dude he's still working 9 30 10 45 he's still working 11 15. he's traveling business calls bro if gary vee calls me at 11 35 at night i'm hanging out i'm jumping out the [ __ ] window dude okay so so i guess the answers don't sleep and what kind of products are because obviously everyone here is on something we got to get on something here right the secret is i'm not you know hardcore enough i got to get on something what do you suggest what kind of supplements are we talking we got to get a doctor prescribed billionaire starter juice pack jeff bezos is on it elon musk is on it yes okay basically it starts with a base of testosterone the male sex hormone it'll get it'll get your mood right it'll get you hungry for success and physically you know you got to eat more you got to fuel your body if you're going to be working all the all these hours and then maybe we can start experimenting with some some stuff that joe rogan recommends but you know we're not there yet yeah yeah yeah yeah okay all right all right well do you know anybody who who's on that that regiment any billionaires you know any billion dollar men i just told you jeff bezos and elon musk oh but are they posting videos about it no but grant cardone is i'll do well hey that's enough for me dude let's watch it's just walking around his [ __ ] like colorado mansion talking about how he's just on testosterone it's like the fountain of youth hey grant cardone here and so many of you been asking me what i'm taking to lean up and grow muscle mass i wanted to let you know what i'm doing about 12 months ago i started researching what i could do to take better care of myself now in that period of time over the years i had tried thousands of supplements hundreds of tubs of protein probably like you that i had in my kitchen i've tried every kind of protein possible and i always knew there had to be a better way i wonder what can i do to get leaner maximum energy increased stamina i need deeper sleep and i want to build muscle mass steroids yes the answer is steroids i love how he's just like skirting around the entire like elephant in the room yeah oh this is great you know 60 years of age it becomes more and more difficult and my body was starting to experience lots of stress maybe of time and joint pains and discomforts a friend of mine reached out to me he said i've been working with a group that has a doctor prescribed medication that is a game changer he introduced me to the group i did a survey with them and they prescribed me this medication for deeper sleep increased energy extended stamina and for the first time in years i was starting to grow some muscle mass man i was starting to cut some of the fat that had accumulated i told the group it's streamlined hey you guys got to figure out how to get this to my people my 10x family the 10x entrepreneurs and you have to make it affordable look not only did they make all that possible they called it or they call it 10x health systems and i'm so pumped up oh my gosh he's just chilling just his own stuff is it supplements i love how every it's not even supplements dude because it's doctor prescribed like we're talking gear oh yeah yeah yeah yeah wow he's like we got to make it affordable it's got to be accessible to everyone it's gotta be accessible to our billionaires hey listen dude we got we've got some discerning billionaires here they're tough with their checkbook okay we gotta get got to get the price down okay so so gear so i need to get on a lot of gear [laughter] and so what else i mean i need i need something really to nail this part finish it get me all the way home right swallowing a little gum isn't gonna do it for me philly on waking up a little bit earlier may not do it for me gear probably will if i'm being very dear will get you there yeah gear will get me there what what else how do you feel about mondays well i don't really like them i mean why not well i guess because it's the start of the week yeah and that means making more money dude how how could i have not seen this yeah okay okay sure sure so who better to learn about mondays and why he loves mondays than david goggins okay that's he's sigma for sure alpha maybe he's full alpha i think he's more sigma i don't know the difference so i'd hide you'll get there if you pan it down here you see it's about three o'clock in the morning yes dude finally someone who's working hard at last i see somebody who's not just some beta dude waking up at 5am absolute bum yeah yeah a car or a person inside if you pan over here no billionaires in sight they're not up they wake up at four yeah they wake up before you know where i find my strength at where i get my strength i get it from a lot of places i gotta be honest i believe dave david goggins actually does this i don't think any anyone else in this entire thing actually does the morning routines they say they do yeah i believe david goggins actually does i think he's i think he's really out there doing this yeah i think i think he's the only guy who hasn't figured out that no one else is doing it he's like where are they everybody says they're waking up at three nobody's out here that's funny dude just goes to garyvee's house he's like gary not there not there [ __ ] that's up there's not a car there's not a person everybody's in their bed sleep dreading that it's a monday haters on monday and i'm loving it i'm loving that where everybody's getting weaker i'm getting stronger it's not about the running the swimming to push up the sit-ups it's about what those things do for your mentality you don't get better on the daggone couch you get better by coming out here and getting the [ __ ] after every daggone day stay hard it's got to stay hard dude [music] hey i think i might need some of that grant cardone stuff i don't want to stay that hard okay it's got to stay bricked up 24 7. i got to be honest with you i don't know if i'm capable of the sigma grind set i'm starting to get a little worried your mindset's just not there you can't you can't be having these negative intrusive thoughts dangits how do i how do i fix it are you willing to sacrifice temporary comfort for long-term success probably not but i'll try my best all right we're about to watch your video by grant cardone in which he poses that exact same question to a 13 year old what advice would you have to give to someone young like me and what can i start doing now first of all you're doing the right thing being here give him a hand for just being there imagine being a 13 year old at a grant cardone 10x conference his parents have to be there right oh yeah for sure or bought his ticket dude they're the ones who loaded them up or you think he woke up he offered 13 year old financing does he offer 13 year old financing you'll see

lesson you're watching the grind set unfold before your eyes okay leon i just feel beat down i feel crushed the only good advice i've had all day is the steroids that's probably the best i think we watch one more by my favorite my favorite entrepreneur who is it dan pena that alex wants a case study because he wants to know that behind it because he's stupid and that's why he's [ __ ] poor this

gotta shut up you gotta listen shut my mouth listen up you know what i think i think that finally did it that's it that's all you need why why you're poor unlocked something i think in me obviously i don't have any money i know we did discuss payment but i'm going to have to put it on layaway yep dan pena was right i am poor and i will have no money especially especially after this month the stupid children are getting it i hate to say so i don't i don't know what to say but you will receive your payment sometime in 2032. ten years from now yeah is that is that like i'm gonna get off my
