[music] foreign [music] start with this so you might have seen ai in a bunch of forms all over social media lately like i have whether it's making ai art or doing ai portraits or ai chat bots having conversations and writing poems and all kinds of crazy stuff like that so i have a lot of questions about it but naturally i immediately went to the top of the most existential pyramid of questions which is just can this ai eventually replace me now before we get started i just want to make it clear that i am not saying ai can't do amazing things in fact ai algorithms and machine learning models are capable of some truly impressive feats but when it comes to creating content online there are some fundamental reasons why ai can't replace human creators first let's define what we mean by online creator at its core being an online creator is a creative process right so it involves coming up with ideas developing content publishing it online engaging with an audience and this process requires imagination and creativity and a human perspective on the other hand ai is a machine learning technology it's not capable of imagination or creativity it doesn't have a human perspective instead it's a tool designed to process data and perform specific tasks in conclusion ai might be able to perform some impressive tasks but it can't replace online creators because it's not capable of imagination creativity and a human perspective it's a tool not a creator you wouldn't want to listen to an entire video created by an ai would you except you just did because every word that i just read to you came directly from asking open ai's ai chat bot called chat gpt to write a script for an mkbhd video on why ai can't replace online creators and i simply just recited it it's fascinating though isn't it i just did a video earlier this year on dolly another project also by openai where you input a text prompt and it spits out a realistic high resolution new unique art piece and whatever style you want and the art pieces are surprisingly detailed and realistic and it's accurate to the words you gave it it's such a powerful tool and so now this other tool by open ai is also going viral and it's more along the lines of a robot you can talk to a chat bot so it's called chat gpt and it's capable of holding a conversation back and forth about almost anything and so you can kind of have a normal conversation with it right now but the types of things people are asking of it are getting increasingly more and more complex you can ask it for some fact or you can ask it for the summary of a book or you can have it write a poem for you or ask it to find an error in some code or clearly just ask it to write a whole script for a youtube video it is incredibly impressive what it's been able to do just kind of drawing from the database of all of human knowledge and then having intricate detailed nuanced conversations with people on a variety of topics so here's my actual real human take on the emergence of these new ai tools two things one is that really is just kind of amazing that we're living through this time right now where we're able to see these tools evolve in front of our very eyes and get better and better but two is just that that's all it is is a tool in 2022 that's how i see it it's just a really impressive tool so i think the ideal use of this stuff especially as like a creator like me is not to take my job but to use it as a creative tool to sort of brainstorm earlier in the process and then let me put my human touch on top of it later that's literally how i plan to use it so you can ask chatgpt to help brainstorm video ideas or even titles for these videos and that's what it'll do but then at the end of the day it'll be my human judgment that decides what i actually decide to publish so kind of like how you might already use the ai subject selection tool in photoshop but then refine the edges and the selection yourself or you might use the ai sharpening tool the ai enhanced tool in pixelmator but then go go in and do the rest of the edits to to really match your style so it's the beginning of the process this new stuff we're seeing is just the next level of that the only difference here is this stuff is a much more general ai and it is what we call a generative ai meaning it creates things seemingly from scratch so i think there will be people who ask chat gpt for the summary of a book and it can spit out an answer super fast and you can use that as inspiration for your own write-up i think there will be college students that use it to brainstorm an essay it won't be able to actually spit out a finished essay for you at this point but it is a pretty damn good start like clearly this is an amazing never before seen tool and it's the start of something huge i'll even continue to ask it for video script ideas why not but just keep in mind when i did it did say at the bottom that this should be a starting point for a video it didn't do any alliterations at the end like i usually do and it did get some facts wrong in the longer full version as you can see and that actually brings me to the dangers of something like this of course with any massively impactful new technology you have to at least consider this type of stuff and really two of of them have come to my mind at the very top which are one the error rate and two the complexity of credit so i asked chat gpt to write a script for an mkbhd review of the iphone 14 pro and it made one and it's actually pretty positive it goes over the specs it calls the display bright and vibrant and sharp perfect for watching movies and playing games or browsing the web and it calls it incredibly fast and responsive i think that's true and it says the standout new feature of this year is the camera system i would agree but then it says it has a 12 megapixel ultra wide a 12 megapixel wide and a 12 megapixel telephoto but as we know here on the mkbhd channel the iphone 14 pro was the first one to actually have that 48 megapixel main camera chat gpt was just wrong here and it also shouted out the four colors silver gold graphite and pacific blue except those were the iphone 12 pros colors this year there's a space black and a new purple so chat gpt has a habit of getting at least one thing wrong every time you ask it something or at least every time i asked something now on the you know the whole six paragraph video script thing like that's actually pretty impressive the fact that it got 90 of that pretty pretty well but i also asked the chat about something much more simple what's the fastest sea mammal on earth just curious and chat gpt said the fastest sea mammal on earth is the peregrine falcon although it is not a sea mammal it is capable of reaching speeds of over 240 miles an hour while diving making it the fastest animal in the world other fast sea mammals include the sailfish which can swim at speeds up to 68 miles per hour and the orca which can reach speeds of up to 34 miles per hour now it's been a while since i've been in school but i'm pretty sure only one of those was a sea mammal and to be fair it was is the correct answer it did include the fact that an orca goes 34 miles an hour that is the right thing to say but clearly you can't rely on this thing to be 100 factually accurate it's kind of the same way there's also like a 90 accuracy rate with dolly but it feels more and more impressive the more complex your prompts are like if you ask dolly for a picture of a cat okay that's pretty easy so it is kind of jarring when it messes up some parts of something that seems so easy and obvious but when you ask for a cat wearing a rocket booster jumping over a man watering his garden in space it's like okay it's kind of amazing what it's able to generate from scratch to match the description and then it's also not shocking when maybe it gets one or two of those things wrong kind of just like that longer essay with a few incorrect facts i expect these error rates to go down over time like that's kind of the whole point of these ai models advancing but you know that's something i'll keep an eye on the other thing though is credit and this is something you may have seen pop up a little bit on social media lately which is that ai steals art without consent which here's what they mean by that so the number one app in the entire app store right now is something called lensa ai by prisma labs you might have seen some posts on your timeline it's kind of blown up and the basic premise is you pay a few bucks and you upload a bunch of real photos of your face give it a few minutes and the black box of ai inside will spit out a bunch of cool avatar characters that look like you in a bunch of different situations and has a bunch of different characters some of them much better than others i feel like it's kind of caught fire lately because most people don't typically have a bunch of cool art made about them so like it's kind of neat that you get to see that type of thing but there's some other companies jumping on this too avatar ai is another one so now you are technically consenting to uploading your own face for it to be used to train the models to put in these images but do you know who's not consenting to have their art used for this type of stuff a lot of the artists who are also making the art that's being fed in to inspire these ai images the backgrounds the materials the line work the styling the framing etc here's something to keep an eye on you know how most artists a lot of them will sign like the bottom right hand corner of their drawing or their painting when they're done well one of the telltale signs of potentially copyrighted art being used by these ai models without permission is a lot of people are getting back from this app with the mangled recreations of a bunch of different signatures because clearly many of the source images that went into it had signatures at the bottom like that is wild so the unanswered question right now is how do you give credit to the artists whose work is being fed into the machine that is creating ai art like if i were to just ask dolly for a picture of a cat it could easily just spit out a brand new generic image of a photorealistic cat and it's learned through its models how to reproduce with stable diffusion what an image of a cat might look like inspired by theoretically any image of a cat on the internet that open ai is pulled in actually technically it's learned from the entire data set not just the images of cats but basically i don't think any artists would get too mad at that but you can also ask dali for a picture of a cat in the style of claude monet and it becomes much more clear what source material is making it through to the final input and if i was monet and i was still alive i probably wouldn't be too happy with this now i'm not a copyright lawyer so i'm not even going to try to get into what counts as transformative work or you know copyright infringement what's not but the bottom line is we don't actually really know the exact totality of exactly where these ai models are scraping from like there is some general description sometimes if you dig into it about publicly available images and licensed content but there are also some huge databases like there's something called common crawl that scrapes huge amounts of the internet and creates a publicly available free data set that anyone can use it's called lion 5b and again not a copyright layer but to me this kind of feels like a bit of the loophole doesn't it where technically common crawl they're not profiting from anything they're doing all the scraping of billions and billions of things and then putting it all in one place and then it's available for free and then others can decide what to do about that legal stuff so open ai you know they were using this data set and they were initially doing all this stuff for free but i think now it's like 15 bucks for a set of 115 images something like that but especially like the ones you fed your face into the lenza one the avatar ai one they're just straight up charging people they are making money from the data sets that they just crawled for free like think about it this way here's a here's a simple analogy if i were to make a youtube video and i want to use taylor swift music in my youtube video that's actually fine as long as i don't monetize my video so it's available for free that's cool if someone else wants to use a part of my video and they use the part with the taylor swift music in it can they make money off of that and on youtube there's already an answer to this question which is no absolutely not you cannot make money off that umg is going to be coming after you in two seconds flat but in this world of ai art which is so new we kind of don't have an answer to that yet like there is no precedent set legally or culturally so at the beginning it felt like the biggest question was how do we define art this is crazy question but now it feels like the more interesting question actually is what is inspiration exactly how do we define inspiration like when a human draws something new of course it's a unique expression entirely of their own but of course they were also inspired by previous drawings that they might have seen in their life matter of fact they are technically inspired by every moment of their life leading up to the point where the pen touches the paper and so now ai art basically just speed running inspiration it's just like dumping all of recorded human history into a black box and then making something from it or maybe maybe just everything that's in data set lyon 5b which includes a ton of my own work and thumbnails and images by the way but at the end of the day if i'm being an optimist which i try to be i hope this makes us appreciate human created art more for sure but we got to keep an eye on all these unanswered questions because there's a lot of them and until then let the robots rehearse the revolution you know it's not an unanswered question though the sponsor of this video karma karma is an online shopping tool designed to help you save money at your favorite stores but how do they help you save money so first it's not a crowdsourced coupon depository it scans the entire internet to find
