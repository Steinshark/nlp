that is fast this gpu has four nvme ssds on it it's a trick that amd pulled to make the pci express slot go a little further than it usually does meet the radeon pro ssg the world's first graphics card with storage but this came out five years ago and it's still the only graphics card with storage so how the heck does it work and why didn't this take off first i'll take off to talk about our sponsor smart deploy zero touch zero headache pc management for it deploy windows images apps and drivers from the cloud no vpn required get your free subscription worth over five hundred dollars at smartdeploy.com linus foreign [music] on the surface the radeon pro ssg is nothing special basically a vega 64 with double the hbm2 memory but if we take off the cooler we can get a look at its real party trick look at that gpu business in the front ssd party in the back these guys are literally 2280 m.2 nvme ssds samsung oem each is 512 gigs and each shows up separately in windows although the default setup is a windows dynamic disk stripe which is effectively a two terabyte raid zero so it's super cool but what will we use it for sequential and random rights are far beyond even our pci express gen 4 ssd thanks to the 16 lanes of pci express bandwidth available to the storage even though i can only use gen 3 speeds but only sequential reads scale this way and random reads are far slower than our gen 4 ssd my best guess for why is that unless there's something wrong with the ssds on the card read operations might simply be redirecting through the gpu itself which is increasing request latency and therefore reducing throughput for random but not for sequential reads testing latency with performance tests lends credibility to that assumption but hey since the data is going through the gpu anyway this kind of reminds me of microsoft's direct storage api which enables an nvme ssd to load data directly to the gpu instead of going through the cpu first now will we see a performance improvement then if we run games straight off of the ssg let's give it a shot i've got f1 2021 installed on both the internal ssd and the ssg itself so we'll see now if there's any improvement whatsoever give me a sec i gotta we got an ethernet cable [applause] as it turns out data loaded from the ssg is still processed by the cpu unless it's using amd's ssg api so we're in fact losing some performance due to the ssd array and gpu sharing bandwidth what a missed opportunity as for the api itself well maybe we can test that out when the ssg first launched amd touted its ability to work with massive data sets and well yeah two terabytes is massive but unfortunately for amd massive data sets that benefit from a direct connection to the gpu like this are not super common the example they came up with was running 8k raw footage in real time off of the ssg's internal storage and they helpfully created a sample video player to handle exactly that it requires processing the video files with ffmpeg first to decompress the raw video frames so we'll do that now open the terminal here i've already converted the files and yes what okay let's try directly off of the ssg hmm i've tried everything i can think of at this point from running the player itself off of the ssg storage to compiling it myself same thing always happens looks like something changed between the time they wrote it and today and this whole thing is just broken now seeing as the original sdk was already tough to find let alone find an updated version you can guess it wasn't too popular unlike our brand new cable ties at ltdstore.com check this out we've got 15 new colors there is one ray of hope for us adobe added support for it in premiere pro back in 2018 and as far as i can tell they're the only ones so let's run puget bench's 8k red test and see what we get alright so this is straight off of the ssd i'm just gonna run the live playback 8k and this will take a few minutes oh adobe why are you so slow success look at that playback is 6 nearly 69 times nicer than running from our gen 4 ssd and all i did was copy files to the ssg mind you it's still not full speed we're looking at less than 10 fps at full ak res and less than seven at half res but that's way better than the less than one fps we got before it freaking works but why did amd think to do something like this in the first place the radeon pro ssg is a solution to a uniquely 2017 problem nvidia had the quadro p6000 a gpu with 24 gigs of gddr5x memory amd wanted to make a card with even more memory to compete but dram prices were going through the roof at the time and vram prices weren't far behind their then new vegas 64 graphics cards launched in august bringing with them eight gigabytes of hpm to memory so you might think well how about just expanding that well that's tough because hpm2 is connected via ridiculously wide 2048-bit memory bus so not only is it very expensive per giga bite it's also very difficult to scale it without making the silicon itself much larger to accommodate the extra direct connections to the gpu enter solid state graphics man flash the stuff that ssds are made of may not be nearly as fast but it's pretty affordable compared to vram with radeon ssg amd now had a whole two terabytes of memory to work with your move nvidia or actually our move and they even have standard phillips screws although they're not ferrous i can't pick it up with a magnetic tip oh well yeah it just comes right out and a new one goes right on in now this is tricky because it doesn't have a magnetic properties but then it goes all right one down three to go there we're done this is hilarious you run your system without out any additional storage as long as you're okay with the overhead of sharing bandwidth with a gpu that's not its intended purpose of course putting the ssds so close to the gpu means that like with microsoft's direct storage api it doesn't have to go through the cpu or really any other part of the system if it's loading via the api straight to the gpu get subscribed by the way because the minute microsoft gives us something to test direct storage with we are on it this arrangement tremendously speeds up access times which is a crucial component to anything a gpu does which is why it's such a hot topic today even the high band with cache controller amd included on the vega gpus that allows them to extend vram with main system memory is slow since it has to go through the cpu first as we've seen the ssg concept is sound but only in a world where that much memory is necessary only in a world where people are willing to use the api and most unfortunately for amd in 2017 only in a world where people work in 8k raw and are not used using a lower resolution proxy clips especially considering it was rocking vega 64 specs alongside an asking price of seven thousand dollars when it was new although it quickly fell to 4 600 a few months after release because it's such a niche within a niche within a niche use case i haven't been able to find any examples of it being used in the real world but let's say demand for this feature does come back well the promise of direct storage doing basically the same thing makes this arrangement costly and inefficient i mean there's no reason davinci resolve or adobe creative cloud couldn't use direct storage if games can to its credit you're getting a lot of m.2 slots and a gpu all in one package but the bridge chip and controller hardware do not come cheap and you're giving up bandwidth whenever the ssd is accessed by something that's not using the api the radeon pro ssg is truly a product of its time and i doubt we'll see such a beast again anytime soon but i know we'll
