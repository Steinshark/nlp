ever have a day start where you thought you're 
gonna be so productive and you think it's gonna   look like this only in reality to have it 
more end up like this the good news is you   are definitely not alone and the even better 
news is there are ways that you can combat this   to really actually having that productive day 
that you're looking for that's that yeah okay carol dweck is a famous american psychologist 
who focuses on just this around growth and fixed   mindset actually in the 1970s she conducted 
a series of experiments on children and their   responses to challenges she found that some 
children were more likely to embrace challenges   and view failure is an opportunity to learn 
while other children were more likely to give   up easily and view failure is a reflection of 
their own abilities so how does this happen at   such a young age how are some children already 
viewing failure as a way to grow while others   are viewing it as they're stuck they're in this 
place well she labeled these two mindsets which   i'm sure a lot of us are now familiar with which 
is fixed mindset and growth mindset now the good   news is through her studies and research over the 
years she actually found that the way your mindset   works your fixed mindset can be changed with 
certain interventions and that's what we're going   to cover today ways that you can actually build 
habits to keep you motivated and focused because   a lot of times we like to sum it up as oh it 
must be just the work isn't that interesting but   usually there's a lot more going on related 
to it okay that's great and all but we need   to get into actual tangible takeaways here now 
something that i used to do and i'm not gonna   lie it failed me every single time was you know 
you have those days where you wake up and you   just do not feel like working please tell me 
i'm not alone those days i'd often suppress   my emotions push them down and just say tiff 
you need to be as productive as possible or   you are a failure oftentimes what this would do 
though oftentimes what this would do is because   i wasn't taking into account my emotions or how 
i was feeling that day and instead pushing them   down and turning on you need to be as productive 
as possible and labeling myself as a failure if   i didn't do everything on my checklist which by 
the way was never ending in turn i would get so   overwhelmed and so frustrated with myself that 
i ended up being like this version actually in   a journal published by personality and social 
psychology researchers found that people who   were able to identify and embrace their emotions 
were more likely to be motivated and engaged in   their work and you're probably saying well that's 
great tip okay i won't suppress my emotions but   how do i work then if i feel like not working one 
of the biggest habits that you can create when you   wake up and you're feeling not that motivated is 
to first of all acknowledge it acknowledge that   hey i'm not feeling super productive today then 
what i will do is i will actually go look at my   calendar of what needs to get done prioritize it 
but also keep in mind is there anything that i can   do tomorrow be kind and gentle to yourself work 
in ebbs and flows you're not going to be you're   not a robot you're not going to wake up every 
single day feeling the most motivated possible   and like you can work the hardest or focus the 
most every day it looks a little bit different   and when you can structure your work days around 
how you are feeling and i know i know it sounds   kind of sappy we're talking about feelings here 
but it is so true for example if you wake up   and you need to do a really difficult technical 
task but you're really not feeling motivated   look at the backlog of things you need to do 
and i'm sure there are things on there that   maybe are less mentally taxing on you that you can 
focus on for that day it's unrealistic to try and   get everything done at the same pace every single 
day and rather than trying to do that and in turn   burning out or just resenting your work go with 
ebbs and flows acknowledge how you are feeling   because there are going to be so many days where 
you do feel like taking on those more difficult   tasks that you really need to be motivated and 
productive for no one is going to like hearing   my next tip and i understand why which is keeping 
a clean or tidy workspace now you might be saying   yeah tiff that's easy for you to do because you 
have an office a space to work out of i work out   of my kitchen i work out of my living room with 
kids running around to screaming whatever the   case may be i'm acknowledging that everyone's 
work environment is extremely different and   it's challenging and that's why i included it 
on the list if it was super easy and everyone   was doing it it it wouldn't need to be on this 
list essentially at the end of the day one of   the biggest things about having a place where you 
can focus and having a workspace to focus isn't   about the size or the grandness of it but tidy up 
a little space i've seen a lot of friends of mine   actually who are in the situation where they're 
working from home and there's a lot going on and   they don't have the space to do it what they will 
do is actually make a little corner for themselves   designated corner and put in a little desk maybe 
you buy it off amazon maybe you buy it off of   wherever it is and just own that space that this 
is where you are working the one rule is though   when you are not working do not go in that space 
even if it's you know a corner or a little side   of your your kitchen table whatever the case 
is only sit there only go there when you are   working what this will do is it will naturally 
or subconsciously tell your brain that when   you are sitting there you are to be focused now 
this isn't a perfect cure-all but it definitely   for me anyways i've seen it significantly help my 
office i do not go to do any work on the weekends   and the doors are literally closed to the office 
all weekend long i don't go in here to watch you   know things on my laptop or journal or anything 
like that it's completely off limits and it's very   intentional because then when i do go in on monday 
like okay my body is ready to work my mind's ready   to work and it knows what to do in this space 
another thing that really helps you find that   motivation when you're trying to focus is actually 
creativity now don't give me the tip i'm not that   creative a study that was published in the journal 
of positive psychology researchers found that   people who engaged in creative activities were 
more likely to feel motivated and engaged in   their work this isn't just stuff we're making up 
here this is science for me what i will do is if   i'm feeling very unmotivated and can't focus i'll 
actually just go for a walk listen to a podcast   creativity can come in so many different forms 
that it doesn't necessarily have to be you are an   artist and wanting to paint this gorgeous picture 
or or you need to journal although journaling is a   huge creative outlet and i highly recommend it but 
there are so many different forms essentially take   a break and do something for yourself and this 
will really help break up your day also too it   will help reset your mind okay i hope you enjoyed 
this video going through that a lot of times it   isn't the work itself killing your motivation 
it's the habits or mindsets that you are doing   or not implementing i hope this video was very 
helpful and insightful these are takeaways that   i use in my everyday life and they really help me 
be able to focus and be motivated for much longer   extended periods of time if you haven't already
