one of the most mystifying questions that has endured for years in the pc building community is how much ram speed and timings actually matter and seeing as many of you are making the transition from ddr4 to ddr5 we figured it would' be a good time for an updated video that can help answer this question currently faster ram tends to show benefits when you're using application where the cpu isn't the component bottlenecking you in other words if it's something where the cpu's cores are working really hard it doesn't matter as much how fast data is moving from the ram to the cpu as the cpu is already too busy working on all that data this means that in general terms tasks like video and image editing ai and file compression won't be affected too much by ram speeds on modern systems although exceptions for specific applications do exist however ram speeds can make a difference for gamers depending on what exactly you're playing to be clear the gpu is still far and away the biggest hardware factor affecting gaming performance and it's also true that having a sufficient amount of ram is more important than having faster ram but all things being equal how fast is fast enough when it comes to ddr5 gaming a good rule of thumb is that ddr5 6000 tends to be a good sweet spot between those cheap 4800 speed kits and those pricey modules rated at 8,000 or even higher and if you're curious about what those numbers even mean this is a module's rated speed in megga transfers per second multiplying that number by eight gives you the number of megabytes of data transferred per second but why 6,000 well we'll tell you where we got that number from right after we think i fixed it for sponsoring this video say goodbye to those unreliable dollar store tools from now until may 31st you can save 20% on all of ifixit toolkits their comprehensive protech toolkit has everything from a variety of tweezers a makeo drive kit with 64 bits and their funny sounding but very useful spudger tool or check out the repair business tool kit their repair shop in a bag so head on over to the link in the description check out if fix's toolkits and save 20% until may 31st amd has actually come out and straight up said that ddr5 6000 is a sweet spot for their ryzen 7000 and 8000 series processors intel though has not made a similar statement but 6000 is about right for their processors as as well for both manufacturers getting too far above 6,000 megga transfers can make it difficult for a memory controller to keep up with all that incoming data for amd specifically their current lineup of ryzen cpus uses a linkage called infinity fabric that connects the various chiplets within the processor amd has recommended leaving the infinity fabric speed on auto to get the best performance for whatever you have your ram speed set to but turning your ram speed up too high can cause the clock on the infin inity fabric to automatically drop which can offset the performance gains from the faster ram and also keep in mind that chips with 3d vcash also do not benefit as much from higher ddr5 speeds as that extra cash memory helps make up for ram that's slower than otherwise might be ideal that being said that doesn't mean you can't try to use ram above 6,000 megga transfers but at that point you're getting into the realm of possible instability or diminishing returns depending on exactly how much you're paying for your ram especially if you start pushing into the 7,000 range keep in mind too that 6000 is already past the officially supported max speeds for current gen cpus from both companies and as it is with overclocking other computer parts some of your luck will come down to the silicon lottery this basically means that some chips come off the assembly line with more overclocking potential than others some folks have had good luck with speeds above 7,000 but that doesn't necessarily mean that you will and of course not all games will benefit from faster ram as a very general rule it tends to matter more when you have games that run at lower resolutions and higher frame rates think esport titles where users want as many frames as they can get at the possible expense of visual quality but what about latency you know memory timings lower numbers are obviously better if you can afford them but it isn't likely that you'll see a big benefit from spending a lot more money just to get the lowest timings possible so unless you have some kind of very specific need for the faster memory we definitely recommend getting the higher capacity if you're on a budget especially if you're planning to run other applications while you're gaming maybe you're streaming maybe you're keeping an eye on a video or maybe you're just some kind of demon who can play at fps while sitting through a remote job interview i mean how are they going to know thanks for watching guys if you like this video hit like hit subscribe and check out our
