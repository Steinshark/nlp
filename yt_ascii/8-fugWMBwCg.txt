for the last six months i've been working on my own nft project we've put hundreds of thousands of dollars in it personally the whole team a million plus we had an issue with crypto zoo where our our lead developer took the code that he made fled to switzerland actually fled to switzerland and like held it hostage for a million dollars eddie promised me you know five pursuit of tokens and a billion dollars never you never really never paid me this reporter says eddie's entire story is fake i'm not the bad guy here yeah yeah there's some actual out there yeah and i'm it's not me like i'm here to build [music] welcome to part three so far we've discovered fake orphans millions of dollars stolen and a cast of sleep characters but now it's time to put it all together what is the truth and who's to blame we're gonna start by going through leaked text messages of the crypto zoo team to understand all of their motivation then we'll go to blockchain evidence and show who sold what and finally we'll confront some of the people responsible but before we can do any of that we have to start in march of 2021 six months before the token even launched our four suspects logan crypto king eddie and jeff are in a group chat discussing crypto zoo which starts as a copy of something else quote i like imitating crypto kitties jake the crypto king says logan replies i agree and initially it wasn't called crypto zoo at all it was called crypto pets and they were gonna sell a pets token and pretty early on it became clear this was all about money how they were gonna sell this thing to investors in fact crypto king said he thought it was worth at least 20 million dollars in only six months saying the range is insane 20 to 210 million dollars it's beautiful wherever we land eddie jumped in at this point and talked about how he could sell the project as an investment to a friend matt higgins saying quote he has to spend that 350 million dollars somewhere why not us and logan says i love that idea crypto king i'm in and of course you have jeff saying let's go so you can see right there they wanted to sell this game before it had even launched now later eddie amends the list of investors and says quote investors will be garyvee todd morley james altucher ryan kavanaugh and others confirmed on my end supposedly they had a hundred million dollars of investment interest now i actually went to some of these investors and asked if this was true and the one person who responded denied it ryan kavanaugh quote nope not even a little bit so this looks like it could be yet another lie from eddie ibanez but either way it looks like there was more issues than just finding investors because the team wanted to pre-sell tokens and not everyone was sure it would be legal jake the crypto king mentions that quote if we have a pre-sell it opens us up to sec issues and jeff agrees and says don't want to do anything that brings the sec eyeballs now not everyone wanted to be so cautious though logan argues everyone does pre-sale with coins eddie agrees he says you absolutely can do it i have the sec down private and pre-sell and honestly it was quite the dilemma for this team who wanted money you know do a pre-sale make millions but you know you have these potential legal issues don't do it you make less money so crypto king comes up with a middle solution he says if we can't sell no pre-sale we can still trade them in the liquidity pool and this is the start of a new disaster which takes a bit of explaining now just so we're clear a pre-sale is where you sell investors coins usually at a discount before you've launched and then when you launch you give them those coins now like i said the team didn't want to do that so what they did instead was was they bought the tokens on the open market right after launch but they tried to get clever with it because they didn't actually announce that they were launching this coin at all they stealth launched it on june 11th and didn't announce this token through logan until august'th meaning they had all that time to silently buy up as much of the supply at a steep discount as they wanted and the idea here was that doing this the team could get these tokens extremely cheaply which is kind of like a pre-sale but you know without all the sec troubles and crypto king makes this clear on june 7th when he says quote launch of the liquidity pool is where huge money will be made because you get in cheaper and then says we the team begin buying out the liquidity pool once the team has exhausted funds for the liquidity pool buying we send the contract address to friends family investors who want to be able to get in so obviously the plan is we buy first then we give it to our close friends and family and then maybe the public eventually right and even the day before crypto king reminds everyone quote zoo day is tomorrow i highly recommend everyone get a few hundred to a few thousand dollars in zoo when it goes live it will likely tend to a thousand x so that was their plan rather than doing a pre-sale they were going to do this stealth launch and hopefully get tokens cheaply the same way but without all the legal troubles or at least that was the plan because on stealth launch day this is where things first started to go wrong for the team at first everything seemed to go normal the team sat in a circle and literally bought it out as planned but the next day crypto king says something odd quote a bot is playing with our token kind of cool to watch them work but he doesn't mention who this bot is and he also says the  finished selling but doesn't mention who that is now jeff logan's manager replies upset he says how do we prevent someone doing what they just did again we went from 130 million to 26 million dollar market cap in two hours it's not cool to watch logan jumps in yeah wait how did that happen and he also says whatever how did anyone get this token except for us and none of us sold and i think actually this is incredibly suspicious because the application of what logan's saying is hey we tried to scheme this really well we tried to all buy this without letting anyone know how did this how did anyone else figure out we were buying it right and this is where a fight ensues that's going to become really interesting crypto king deflects the question by saying my buyer pushed it back up to 40 million dollars and logan says no bro f your buyer explain to me what just happened and how there were 30 token holders and jake tries to explain that this was just traders and bots happening to find the token but logan says only five of us knew about it jake says well many people chase volume and new tokens and to some extent he's kind of right but logan replies cap he doesn't believe it quote i can't be the only one who thinks that's too incredibly convenient like someone was tipped off and and look no one's more critical of logan than me but as i'm reading these texts i was kind of like agreeing like yeah it does seem too nonchalant when somebody's ruining your secret plot you know what i mean because crypto king was acting very strange he says we created 40 million dollars out of thin air this is a success logan replies this nonchalance worries me f40 million it was at 120 million which again it's all about the money with these guys but truth be told i did agree that crypto king's attitude seemed strange in these texts i mean he's not wrong that bots are a thing traders are a thing but it sounded like he didn't want anyone to look into it so naturally i looked into it and what i found surprised me because there were bots but there's also unusual human activity during this time so i tracked the five biggest buyers of the zoocoin and lo and behold this is what i found logan was one of the biggest buyers which is is what you'd expect but he wasn't the biggest in fact two of the biggest wallets seemed to be associated with crypto king himself and here's where i pause i said wait a second why did this guy buy more zoo tokens than logan when this is mostly logan's project i thought crypto king was a small part of this team and so to get more info on this i actually got access to an internal meeting note from the day of june 11th which they called zoo day and in it we find actually some interesting information we see that five founders bought in they apparently were quote trading in circles until each person maxed out but on the list of buyers and how much they spend are only four people when we know five people bought we have danny logan's assistant for 20k logan paul for 100k jeff at 100k and eddie at 100k but crypto king is nowhere to be found and yet on the blockchain i have him putting in two hundred thousand dollars worth and this number by the way seemingly is firmed in a conversation i had with crypto king where he said my 200k investment and the reason this is important is because it does imply that something shady was going on the day of the stealth launch because crypto king had a relatively small role in this whole project he was the advisor but it wasn't that big of a deal like you can see from the internal meeting notes they have a breakdown of who's getting what in terms of founder tokens and like logan paul's getting 51 percent eddie's getting 30 percent jeff's getting 10 jake's only getting five percent of tokens but he has the most of these like stealth launch tokens which makes no sense and it got me thinking that maybe what explains this suspicious behavior around like oh don't worry about who was buying at the time of the launch maybe that's explained because perhaps no one knew that he was buying up large parts of the token supply maybe he was buying it to sell later now of course that's speculation so that's why i confronted crypto king on all of this but before we get to that call let's address the elephant in the room logan didn't accuse crypto king of being a scam it was the other way around crypto king told logan paul he was a scamer and the question is why well to answer that we have to go from june the stealth launch date to september 1st the official launch date of crypto zoo september 1st cryptozoo.com now the day of the launch was a bit strange because you might think well they already have a token right but the first thing they did was actually create a new zoo token with a different code but the same name and they actually airdropped all the holders of the first zoo token with an identical amount of those coins on the second zoo token so you might be wondering why did they do that well maybe it's the change the smart contract but maybe it's because of what they did do they blacklisted some of the holders in other words they didn't airdrop to everyone including jake the crypto king they excluded his wallets so it couldn't get these zoo coins jake texts the group about this the next day saying quote the zoo team made a major error this weekend they chose not to communicate mint a new token and airdrop it to whatever wallets they determined fit this decision came from eddie and logan and i had no part in it 11 250 wallets before the airdrop under 11 000 after they chose to blacklist and ban over 200 wallets now who those wallets are i have no idea but he continues quote as a founder like logan jeff eddie and danny i had purchased a large quantity of tokens five plus of my wallets had been blacklisted from the original team's buys now i don't know why he had five five plus while it's there but okay okay he says 80 plus billion zoo tokens were confiscated from me to date without any communication so wow that's why crypto king accused logan of stealing from him or scamming it's because he was frozen out of a lot of his wallets then we get to the text you guys all know he says logan you stole 40 million dollars you're a scammer you're a con artist all that stuff you betrayed your community the reality is you aren't that guy and logan responds oh jake trust me bro i am that guy q in the arms of an angel and look i mean what do we make of this well i i don't know i can't root for either of these guys because it sounds like logan stabbed him in the back but it sounds like crypto king may have stabbed him in the back in the first place right because it does appear like he bought tokens that maybe everyone didn't know about so i'm really not a fan of anyone in this situation and by the way but this whole thing was structured so misleadingly from the beginning i i have to talk to you a bit about it because you might think that these tokens were the only tokens they had but it's not even true in the distribution section of zoo's white paper they say there's two trillion tokens and a quarter of that are allocated to development marketing and founders those aren't even the tokens we're talking about right now because they claim that those tokens were locked up for six months and then afterwards ten percent was unlocked every month and if that's true there would be no reason for these funds to be blacklisted right why would you blacklist something that would be locked up and the answer is because well the founders had more than one set of tokens not only did they supposedly have these founder tokens that were locked up and couldn't be sold these stealth launch tokens were different from that it's like a whole different thing and the tokens that they bought that all of these guys bought they could sell it basically anytime because they weren't locked up which is a massive problem and this fact was explicitly laid out in their meeting notes with only one rule they say quote no selling until 200 million dollar market cap and don't impact the market more than three percent and not impact the market more than 10 percent in a day and by the way like this is basically conspiracy to manipulate a market you know they're literally having insider rules for how to sell but we're gonna not even we're gonna look past that right because these rules eventually kind of changed a text from logan's manager jeff levin came to the group chat zoo founders saying guys new and absolute rules no one is to sell or transfer any zoo logan's gonna make the call when we can make moves and logan replies your tokens do not leave your wallet this is a game now that all sounds well and good don't sell your tokens don't sell your tokens but the reality was i mean they're just kind of trusting each other because these tokens that they're talking about they're unlocked they're not locked up and they could sell it at any time and i guess the question on my mind is is that why crypto kings tokens were blacklisted because they thought he would sell or maybe it's just the fact they found out he bought and they didn't know about all those tokens it's honestly hard to say without knowing more evidence and this is where we're going to jump into the blockchain now attract the wallets of the entire team and identified the largest seller of zoo in the team and it wasn't jeff it wasn't danny it wasn't even logan it was crypto king crypto king sold by my calculations millions of dollars and i know what you're thinking how's that possible right i thought his tokens were blacklisted the day of the official launch how could he sell that much well the answer is that not all of his tokens were blacklisted he had even more tokens behind the scenes and what's worse the cryptozer team actually gave him back a lot of his blacklisted tokens which i guess you can see as a good thing or a bad thing because he then turned around and sold those tokens right and from my blockchain analysis across his blacklisted tokens he got back and the tokens that he had squirreled away the whole time he ended up making six million dollars he did this by sending out tokens from these larger wallets to dozens of smaller wallets selling it and then sending the money to final cash out wallets so i use those final wallets to calculate the amount he made now i know look it's a lot to accuse someone of selling six million dollars in a project that doesn't even work it's a giant scam so i wanted to give him a chance to defend himself so i got on a call with crypto king and here's what he said when i finally revealed that i knew he had sold iers 100 it sounds like your biggest issue with me is that i sold if that's your biggest issue with me that's the truth wow that is a big admission selling tokens for a project that you're an advisor on when the project has never been delivered although crypto king insists that it wasn't six million dollars and he wasn't trying to rug a project in fact you know really he might be the one who got screwed over in all of this which bet i'll be able to show you that i was will be able to show you five percent holder of the zoo token i was promised to be given over the three month period was never given i can also show you that i was frozen adam was never given the 15 billion tokens back that i paid for okay i'll show you all of those things on the record and then you can also say that i did sell which is also true yep as long as it's accompanied with he was a founder that was supposed to be even five percent of the project and was never given the token or paid worked for almost a year on the project as long as that goes in with it then at least that tells my side of the story so people understand that it's not like i was trying to run a project it's like i put 250 000 into a project plus six months of time and the founder never did anything he said he was going to do and then hired a bunch of devs that didn't do what they were going to do and every time i gave advice the advice was i was supposed to pop off so it can be that soy or it can be he sold all this amount and he got in early well yeah that's like one percent incredible he sounds like he views himself as the victim or at least like he got screwed too which just has to win the gold medal for me for mental gymnastics because i mean he literally had put two hundred thousand dollars into this and he says he made millions of dollars even if you take him at his word that he didn't make the full six million he admits to me later that it might be a pretty close guess he tells me via text quote i don't care if you tell people i sold a few million and leave it at that well okay six million dollars a few million dollars it's millions of dollars right millions of dollars when you only put in 200 000 into a project that's never been delivered doesn't work scammed people out of their money how is he saying he's the one who's in the wrong well in his view what he did was not wrong it might have been arguably unethical but it wasn't illegal and what logan did well that was illegal you can say the timing was bad but the reality is i bought tokens open market been sold the open market so there was nothing illegal about that are people the rest that logan did made wrong and illegal now what do i think of all this finger pointing well i think it's pretty wild try to make yourself look like the lesser of two evils when you made millions of dollars and investors lost millions i just do now at the same time i want to be fair to crypto king he's not the only one who sold here but i also have to say not everyone from the founders did sell for example jeff logan's manager to my knowledge never sold neither did logan paul which was a huge surprise all their walls that i tracked you know held on to their tokens which is good and to their credit for a game that doesn't work but you know who did sell eddie ibanez the guy who didn't pay the initial devs the supposed mit orphan yeah from what i could see his initial wallet got a ton of zoo sent it to a bunch of smaller wallets and then sold off kind of like crypto king and for my calculations he made about 1.7 million dollars now i have to tell you that like jake i tried to confront him and give him the opportunity to defend himself but he never replied to my emails or my phone calls and we're just gonna have to leave it there but we're not done with the money just yet because we still need to talk about the x remember we talked about how they profited from zoocoin but they also made millions from x according to their own internal mating notes they plan to make about three million dollars selling these eggs for 0.1 each a piece and that's not far from what i calculated they actually did make which was about 2.5 million dollars in the meeting notes they say they're gonna clear expenses and then do payouts but pay out who they don't say and these expenses are referencing in earlier notes suggesting eddie and logan had both spent three hundred thousand dollars each which i'll say is not a million dollars but okay we'll we'll give it to them right so they got paid back their six hundred thousand but where does the rest of the money go well on the ethereum side there's one payout for 364 000 to one wallet and another million dollars to another both are coinbase addresses so we don't know who exactly that is but clearly someone on the team made a lot of money from these nft egg sales that do not work and on the binance smart chain side where they also made money selling eggs the zoo that was spent was supposed to be set aside for 50 to be burned which they did but the other 50 was supposed to be allocated for wildlife charities and crypto zoo development now neither seems to have happened because all the money is in a wallet that the team still controls so they're open questions about you know where that money is going to go and where the ethereum money went did it go to jake did it go to logan did it go to jeff did he go to eddie we don't know but what i know for sure is that no one was innocent although there are certainly shades of guilt you can argue about because of course not everyone did sell you could look at that as the most important thing logan paul didn't sell jeff logan's manager didn't sell but does that make them innocent well i don't think so because they never built a game they promised people logan paul specifically got millions of dollars spent on this game on the promise of the technology that he never built that his team never built and he never addressed the failure except to blame his developers who weren't paid and you could say he promised to work backwards to fix it but then never did but at the same time it's clearly not just logan's fault either because they're major team issues right you've got eddie selling millions of dollars of zoo and then allegedly not paying developers you've got jeff who was warned about eddie who kept him on the team anyways and then after they fired eddie seems to also have failed to pay developers on time and then you've got crypto king himself who sold the most but claims he was the guy who was scammed which is the stupidest thing i've ever heard it's just like avengers assemble for the worst possible team you can imagine to build a crypto gang and so unsurprisingly it turns out a lot of these guys backstabbed each other and so finding a way to wrap this up was difficult because it's hard to assign exact proportions of blame because if you focus on any one person you kind of miss why this project failed cryptozoo at the end of the day did not fail because the price went too low cryptos who failed because they never built a functioning game that they promised really the number one problem even bigger than people selling millions of dollars of tokens was that they never paid the developers on time as boring as that is and as a result the investors not only got rugged for millions of dollars which is a problem but they just didn't get the core thing they had bought from the beginning which was not a crypto project but something different i'm excited to watch to launch my game you keep using out and you just did it again you keep using a word there game you're not using like a project it's a game it's a game it's a really fun game that makes you money that's it that to me is the biggest scam in all of this yes it's a huge problem people stole millions of dollars but it's a symptom of the larger issue which is people didn't actually care about the game or this whatever you want to call it they just cared about the money and this is ultimately what happens when you have an influencer larping as a businessman it's what happens when you have a liar larping as a developer and it's what happens when you have a shady crypto guru larping as a crypto king you end up with a mess and in my personal opinion a fraud as well and now that this thing blew up in their faces these four seem to be dodging accountability faster than sbf dodges calls with me because i have reached out to everyone involved i've tried to get all of their statements on things so far no one has taken accountability or offered to refund the victims at all they're all hiding pretending these victims don't even exist but they do exist and throughout my investigations they've been the heartbeat of this whole thing so i decided to close this investigations in a bit of a unique way rather than me deciding who's to blame or me deciding what you should think i want to give them the last word everyone everyone's to blame logan in the sense of his people management is his projects he still made these promises to people i think everyone it is to blame including logan paul of course because he was the the one in charge of this and he was responsible for all the all of this mess that everybody has a big part and a massive massive cross to bear each one of them scammed the project in their own way and then and then off after the sunset they went it was his job to check the team to make sure that everyone is working together to make sure that he is giving the funds of the people that put it into his project under his name to people that he actually trusts so in my opinion if the team failed to perform that logan paul to blame the community is destroyed people is angry they just want their money back they just want their normal lives back reimburse reimburse those loyal fans that they have or how to rebuild the project actually deliver on the projects for those who are so holding their eggs like i am for those holding the zoo coins so maybe they could just deliberate what they promised and that would give some redemption to this fiasco does not said a word that's that's that's a that's as bad or almost as bad as taking the money it's the not coming out and just being a man about it at least we deserve to know what was happening behind the scenes while we were waiting for almost a year and a half the fact that we're hearing this information not from logan paul but from pretty much an investigator it really says a lot what did this loss mean to me it meant a lot not just personally because i lost quite a lot of money my kid and also my my wife were invested it was like telling a kid that santa doesn't exist or something like that because she really believed in all that game she really believed in logan paul kids look up to that kind of people so it was some kind of broken dream my mother got my mum was a bastard my sister was also invested so i mean my daughter even had a couple of the the eggs and animals which the loss for them hurts the most because obviously it's just not nice to do for somebody to win somebody has to lose that's a gamble you take whether you get into crypto or not i got in knowing that i could lose which is fun that's on me but i thought if i lost something it would be because i sold at the wrong time or the game didn't earn as much as i thought it would and therefore my things weren't as valuable but i never you never go into it thinking it's not not something that they're going to just sell out from underneath you because they could make so much more if they actually delivered on what they said even if they delivered on close to what they said and that's the thing is you don't think they're going to rugby because there was so much money in a game wallet ultimately at the end the way i see it is it was fraud logan could have could have put out the red flags or people would stop investing more into it because people remember people were still were investing to this project until the very last minute where the ship was still just just sinking down the ocean and people were still putting their cash into it if i was on a call with logan paul i would ask him where did his redemption arc go i think he was in a such a good streak going about his youtube career and boxing as well and it's sad to see that ads because of money once again we have degraded down to stealing from his viewers what will i say to logan paul and his team if i could well actually i i could because i have an nft from from other projects that gives me the right to see logan paul to meet and greet with him and i will actually use that right to tell him this story again show him this video in front of me and see how he reacts when he sees that my family my whole family and my kid are affected with this situation because i think that's not human you would think that logan would have would have told his fellow followers his loyal his loyal fans that hey guys back off red flag things things are things there's turbulence in the water no not a single not a single word nothing whatsoever it's a market products at children and knowing full well that his team is made up of people that he believes are shady characters yeah he still goes on forbes interviews and says the game the game is great for kids it's gonna it's gonna be amazing who loves it most the kids their kids love it our developers kids all of them cannot stop playing the game i think that is inhumane the way that that side of it's been marketed knowing what's happened since knowing that all of the people that were there from the beginning like all of the guys that i'd speak to on a daily basis that we've all just got nothing now ideally i just want to say i'll see you in court
