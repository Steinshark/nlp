ladies and gentlemen why do we all love chess so much chess is a game that captivates the mind it exposes our strengths our weaknesses our insecurities sometimes it makes us feel terrible and sometimes it makes us feel elated ecstatic euphoric and extremely smart and in today's video i will be showing you a game where all of those emotions were experienced by the player with the black pieces who played one of the most sensational games i've ever seen and he got five brilliant moves the game was less than 20 moves long which means over a quarter of the game was brilliant it was an incredible game it's gonna make you smile i promise and before we jump into the game i'm not thanking the sponsor of today's video but some of you know this some of you might not i've written a book now the book is not physically out yet it's in pre-order but today i'm announcing that i have partnered with a massive bookstore here in new york city called strand to give you 500 copies signed by me if you pre-order them only 500 the first 500 people do so i will go to the store basically go to the store and sign the book if you would like you can check out the link in the description otherwise

in the description as well if in case you're not interested necessarily an assigned copy so i wanted to announce that the first 500 then it's gone all right limited edition check it out if you'd like this was a game played between grandmaster pranesh from india and grandmaster zhuyi from china and sometimes you just gotta shut up sit back watch some really nice chess now white began this game with e4 andrew you played e5 julia plays e5 plays it all the time and against knight f3 or already by the way can i can i just say like i look i hate to backseat the grand master i mean seriously no vienna i mean every every god every season gotham just no viewer knows you got it you got to play two knight c3 but he plays knight f3 fine knight f6 by black and juli likes to play the petrov defense so he counter attacks the pawn in the center he doesn't play the traditional knight to c6 this is one of the most reputable openings in chess you could play it in the style of eric rosen where after knight takes e5 you play what's known as the stafford gambit which is a completely refuted opening but not at intermediate levels so after knight e5 black will play d6 and then take back on e4 however in this game pranesh plays the move knight c3 and now we have what's known as the four knights the four knights traditionally is the most boring opening in chess like i don't know if there's another one it's just very symmetrical however recently and it's symmetrical because beginners will play bishop c4 bishop c5 a castles castles ponti free pawn d6 h3 h6 like they just copy each other because that's what you learn when you're five years old that's why i was imitating a five-year-old maybe you're 45 and you sound like that i don't yeah listen i'm not judging i but nowadays grandmasters especially because they get to play much more title tuesday they get to play more online in fact the the amount of games that were played between 2020 and 2023 online supersedes anything in the past so now grand masters are like experimenting in different positions and you know they're going to underground grand master norm parties where they all you know get naked and oiled up and discuss playing bishop b5 on the fourth move and the the move bishop b5 applies a little bit of pressure to the knight and also by extension the pawn on e5 now black has a lot of moves here now in this game black did this which is a very provocative move more on that in a second black can also develop the bishop magnus carlson has played the move bishop before just sort of saying all right you want to play bishop b5 i'll play bishop before and then you know castles castles white sometimes takes then i don't see six and then takes here or white doesn't do that at all white just does this and then black does this magnus has played a game like this so you can just mirror your opponent also recently black has played bishop d6 just like stubbornly and in a very ugly way defending the pawn on e5 from the knight but basically saying look now it makes no sense for you to do this because well you don't actually win my pawn but yeah i mean those are all options but julie plays knight d4 which is which is a very provocative move very very provocative move white here plays bishop c4 back now if you why is this provocative because knight takes e5 is a free pawn but queen e7 comes in like this and that's actually very reasonable for for black it's also provocative move because you're kind of breaking the rules of chess like you're not supposed to move a piece two times in the opening but it works out fine here because of the way that white's position is set up so knight d4 is played and pranesh brings the bishop back to c4 which applies a little bit of pressure there and knight takes e5 now you would think here black needs to play d6 to defend the pawn nope bishop c5 but well what about the what about the pawn now white castle and play d3 and develop and just be solid but he like no i'm pretty sure that's just a free pawn and in this position thinks and plays queen e7 now there's another option of course you can play castles queen e7 attacks the knight on e5 and in the game pranesh went back to d3 targeting the bishop on c5 which looks like a very reasonable move however there is a line here in modern theory that is utterly ridiculous i'm going to show it to you just to show you how completely insane chess openings are in this position white sometimes retreats this way and if white castles and consolidates white is just a pawn up so black needs to act fast so what black will do here is sacrifice another pawn white will capture it with the bishop and instead of capturing backer attacking the bishop black will go here and pin the knight to the queen now white will play the move pawn to d3 stabilizing the center a little bit more black in many of these positions will play something like long castles and why it will do something like develop the bishop to e3 and it looks everything is good but here black will play knight takes d5 knight takes d5 and sag the rook after e takes d5 black won't even do anything right away black will play rookie eight white will oftentimes attack the knight to kick it out knight f3 gf3 now queen h4 pinning the pawn to the king pinning the bishop to the king so white will make a run for it but now black sacrifices the other rook rook e3 fe3 queen f2 check if queen e2 bishop e3 and bishop f3 wins the queen so king c1 bishop e3 check king to b1 bishop f3 is a fork now queenie one bishop h1 queen h1 queen e2 hits this and the game ends in perpetual check because if white does this bishop c5 and it's mate so queen c4 king b1 and the game ends in a draw swear to god that's that's how the line goes so if white goes knight f3 and both players know 20 moves of theory the best thing that can happen is it ends in a draw it's really it's it's utter nonsense auto nonsense d5 bus is all the top engine moving the game isn't a draw so i don't know if they knew that like i don't know all right i don't i didn't ask the players instead pernesh plays knight to d3 all right now still shoo yi plays the move d5 thinks for a while still plays the move d5 because he's not worried about this because after this the knight is actually stuck it cannot return home so bishop takes d5 he still plays d5 right he has to play this move and for a very brief moment he is down two pawns but he's not worse how is that possible how is white not just clearly better despite being two pawns up well that's the brilliancy of the position the knights standing in front of the central pawns actually don't do white any favors white would much rather this knight be over here so he could put this pawn into the center or he would much rather have that knight be over there so he could play c3 but he can't he can't do either of those things until you just backs up he sacrifices a second pawn and just backs up what so sometimes to make a chess game really really brilliant by the way pre-order the signed copy of the book sometimes to make a chess game really brilliant you gotta you know you got you gotta you gotta be deviant all right you gotta be a little bit deviant be a little bit edgy the point is that if white just sort of lackadaisically castles black plays bishop g4 white loses because f3 there is all sorts of nasty stuff here and if you play queen e1 you actually get your queen trapped which is sort of gross that's a really gross way to get your queen trapped just can't go anywhere so seeing that white played bishop to b3 and was ready to meet the move bishop to g4 with the move f3 all right now in this position castles and white castles okay and he castles because the pawn on c2 has been protected remember a moment ago i just told you you cannot castle here because after bishop g4 queen e1 there is knight c2 and you lose your queen which is why pranesh played bishop b3 which would defend the pawn and then after castles bishop g4 he would be able to play queen e1 and defend the pawn right now at this point i am going to be removing the evaluation bar so you stop obsessing over it and instead you just pay attention to what happens in this incredible game so bishop g4 you cannot play f3 because knight f3 and discovered attack so you play queen e1 and life is good right this is defended that's it you got out of it now you're gonna play king to h1 like black is gonna bring a rook you're gonna play knight f4 pawn to d3 bishop e3 and you're gonna be in good shape right welcome to the jungle it gets worse here every day in this position begins the absolute decimation of the white position and the absolute decimation of white soul in this position zhui plays the move knight f3 check the first brilliant move sacrificing a full night okay well you gotta take it otherwise you're gonna lose the queen bishop takes what the heck is the idea like okay obviously the idea is queen d7 queen g4 mate or queen h3 but you can't even do that like let's say we just give the move back to black like if black plays queen d7 to try to play here white just gonna go knight e5 hitting this and this and then taking the bishop so what is the idea well the idea is that it's not just queen d7 queen g4 queen h3 the idea after bishop f3 is black can also move the knight and play queen h4 so naturally to prevent knight g4 we play the move h3 that way when black moves the knight to try to get the queen to g5 we simply run and by the time you arrive with mate i'm there so how can this possibly work i just play pawn to h3 stopping knight g4 and queen d7 doesn't work because knight e5 and i take h3 stopping knight g4 stopping queen d7 brilliant move number two knight g4 anyway oh we got a problem oh we got a problem we miscalculated something well as it turns out the move h3 did not stop knight g4 because after pawn takes g4 there is simply queen h4 and you lose brutally i may add the bishop stands around an entire barracks of soldiers and just laughs at everybody there's nobody can get to the pieces and the bishop on b6 covers that by the way if white's queen could go to e3 like a move ago if instead of the move h3 white could play queen e3 and not get the queen taken white would be completely winning but this bishop serves one purpose and it's to stop the queen from going to e3 it's ridiculous so knight g4 with the intention of playing this or this and going to the h file and delivering a checkmate well white plays the move knight e2 obviously trying to get to f4 because we know queen h4 is coming and queen h3 so i'm just gonna move my knight there and defend the pawn on h3 and now you can't get into my position so i'm fine then i'm gonna play this and this and get rid of your bishop except now here comes brilliant move number three queen h4 anyway three brilliant moves re-sacrificing the knight on g4 because of queen h3 queen h1 excuse me knight f4 though right knight f4 hold on a minute it's not over and if black doesn't find a way in right now like you can't go queen g3 right this is pin but i'll take you can't go here so what does black do now what does black do now i'll tell you what he does g5 forcibly removing the knight from the defense now white still can defend here pawn to d4 it's not over it's not over if i'm successful in creating a barrier against your pieces i will survive this game i will survive this game so in this position black plays the move pawn takes knight and now knight takes f4 now that can still be taken in the future if queen h1's not made now black plays bishop takes d4 brilliant move number four because you still cannot take the knight because of maid all of this pressure is building up the last two brilliant moves were you know a little bit you might say oh it's not really brilliant because you can't really take all this stuff white plays bishop e3 now plays the best move again which is bishop e5 getting out of the way giving this up the square and reapplying pressure over here and it still looks like how do you break through right queen a5 the idea of queen a5 is to meet this this with a swarming checkmate with queen g5 check and potential counter play on the black king queen a5 is a very clever idea but it fails you know what it fails to it fails to the fifth and most brilliant move of all this move order would be too slow so instead zhuyi played queen takes h3 oh my goodness with the intention of playing queen to h1 mate or queen to h2 mate and if knight takes h3 bishop h2 chris cross apple sauce and everything is defended everything hits the cake this is utterly brutal this is so brutal queen takes h3 and white resigned with checkmate to arrive on the next move with international overnight shipping brought to you by fedex fedex sponsor your mans all right not a sponsored piece of content oh my goodness oh oh my goodness queen takes h3 all of this began when white thought the pressure of the opening was over knight f3 arrived on the doorstep and after that it was an avalanche impossible move after impossible g5 the bishop dropping back to e5 and the haymaker queen takes h3 headshot dead spectacular stuff i mean wow this is so beautiful is what you'll be saying if you get a signed pre-order brought to you by strand no just kidding and if you're watching like in the future and the book is out just get the book book is great right now it's not out at the time of recording it's going to be out in five months but maybe it's like 2026 or something what a game i'm just breathtaking just and black was able to do this because white's pieces were stuck in front of pawns so put pawns in the center faster center pawns both block your opponent's pieces out and activate your own cool fantastic now get out of here
