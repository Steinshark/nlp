i'm i'm i'm willing i'm willing to hear you out i good thing i can't see what that is these are the top four reasons why cs is 100% dead number one is competitiveness everybody already knows and agrees with this number two is over oh man wow okay first off i would just like to throw this out there that i thought this was about css not cs okay computer science versus cascading styze sheets are extremely different and so when he said it was competitive i was genuinely confused there for a second it took me it took me a second to get there okay csb and computer science not that other thing wow okay see the thing is is that here's this argument that i find that it's really really difficult to to be made you come out of a boot camp let's say whatever it is you're you're you're coming out of a boot camp you're coming out of something you've been doing it for six months eight months you've been practicing on your own you've been doing your own thing you've been building your own stuff you've been effectively doing cyber plumbing where you're hooking up clerk i don't know what else people use clerk versel all these kind of things and that's what you can do right you're effectively primed to be a marketing site generator for a startup like devon right because devon has a sign in but you can't actually even use anything useful so you go and do that and you practice that for like eight months and then you go out there and you're like i want to be hired and people are like why should i hire you you you can't do anything that's distinct whereas you can do all of that exact same stuff that i just got done describing and be getting a computer science degree where there is just a foundation there that is also super duper useful you know just like we've been doing right now building our own tcp connection and all those kind of things i based that a off of a lot off of my networks class in which i had to do a lot of these things and then later on i had to build a video protocol and then later on i've had to do this many many times there's a lot of transferable skills but i will say that i do think there is definitely a huge waste of time in college i'm not saying that college is somehow this fantastic place i'm not some some fool that thinks that there is people that go to college and people that don't right that's just not how it works some of the best engineers i've ever worked with have been self-taught engineers it's not that you can't i just think that it's very very diff ult okay watch the whole video first why why would i watch the whole video first we're going to talk about each point one at a time okay if he memes on me at the end that's just what happens okay you accept it you go through it you enjoy it okay but we're talking about this okay we're talking about this no cuz there's four points we're going to talk about each of the four points dude do you guys have do you guys have like goldfish memory problems there's four points here population it used to only be a few people doing this and now everyone and their mom does it number three is grow i don't think that that's a problem here's how i think about that argument okay first off i can't wait for the mils to get into computer science okay that will be great anyways that's for everyone's mom but besides for the moms i will say that this is what happens is that the old curved looks something like this right they're both normal distributions assuming well they're not normal distributions i actually assume they're alpha beta distributions i think at one point it was more of a normal distribution right where there was like the middle of the pack and then there was a approximately the same amount of people that were very skilled and the same amount of people that were unders skilled kind of coming out of college within like the first say the first 5 years of industry right this could represent this but now that we're seeing this huge influx of people that are all self-taught all coming into it i think we're seeing something that looks more like this right where i think we've just shifted that line back and so for you to be able to get a job you have to kind of exceed pretty far into this curve right you have to get over the the mil curve but you like i think this is what makes things a lot more hard in today's world is that we now live in a thing that's been a left shifted normal distribution effectively or a longtail alpha what is this this called alpha beta distribution and it just makes everything super duper hard and i think that a lot of people the majority of people falling into here are going to feel really disenfranchised and this is where you're going to start getting people that they they want new guidelines i think this is where a lot of a lot of the angst in computer science and a lot of against this of degrees comes from is that we should all be able to be self-taught in programming it really it does not require a degree but there's most certainly some really good things that come out of it and i feel like getting a degree is kind of like getting a cheat code because you got four years to prepare versus six months like just the time alone right just the time alone is just such a huge benefit in comparison to going through 6 months like you get so much more you just get so much more this is not a mils diagram okay this is is guys get off the mils okay okay and i think that if you're in if you're in college that doesn't somehow relieve you of doing side of doing side quests if you're not doing side quests i don't see how this is going to work out find good mentors is greater than boot camper college that's a that's an interesting it's an interesting proposition i don't know how to what to do with that though in the sense that mentors are fantastic during college they're fantastic after college they're fantastic during boot camps they're fantastic at any point in your life but mentors a good mentor should be some sort of force multiplier by you meeting with them they should be able to say take your learning rate your acceleration rate your success rate whatever it is and make it into like a 1.2 a 1.3 right they're able to do something and make you move faster but i don't know if you can say one's better than the other right i think that it's just simply a multiplier more than anything else grinding you have to grind thousands of hours just to be average and number four maybe but true i think it just depends on what you grind do you know what i mean it's true for anything well it's true for anything but i feel like generally in our field the the the the learning curve is a little bit larger and so you can spend quite a bit of time you know like i think of us more like golf it takes a lot of time to get good at it right it does take a lot of time and some people are naturally gifted and so their time is faster some people are not as naturally gifted generally software engineers are paid statistically above average because it's such a hard thing to get good at right if it was simple to get good at you wouldn't get paid a lot it's real talk like can we all agree to that it makes sense right it it genuinely makes i mean this is just you shouldn't have to think too hard to go okay yeah that makes perfect sense which is good it's good that you're in like if you really think about it you want to be in a field that is hard you want to be in a field that people pay you a lot because it's hard to do cuz if you're not in that field man like you're you're living a life where i like the closer and closer it starts getting to like warm body replace which i think is just really hard like that's just such a hard place to work i did that for years man like being a server sure there's really talented servers out there and there are some people that are just genuinely better at being a server but man there's plenty of just low-level server jobs and it is emotionally brutal it is just unfun it just is i've been a dishwasher i've worked a lot in restaurants and it is just hard it is just hard hard stuff all right what's number four four is cheating pretty much everybody does it and it makes it really unfair and so yeah that's i don't get the last one cheating let's just walk through his argument let's just pretend he's saying that everybody in school cheats to get their work done okay let's say that that's true well then they're going to come out completely useless right they do they come out useless there really is no shortcut to learning there just isn't there's ways to learn faster absolutely but there is there's just just no shortcut and so when i hear that i think okay he must not be meaning that he must be meaning something different is he referring to nepotism and what i mean by nepotism i mean that there's a group of people who are the in crowd so they get these in treatments meaning that you're able to say get a job easier because you have friends who are in it so if you go to say stanford even if you cheated your way through school you're friends with the guy that created something therefore you just simply kind of get this easier pass in into it and i'm not sure how much that even is is existing at this point as far as like software engineering goes it's too competitive of a field and too many people are wanting to be really good at it so i am just completely i i just don't believe this like i i just don't and especially this statement right here that says uh higher grades equals more likely to be higher i think that might be true in non-american places i i don't know what that looks like in other places right so i can't really say the difference here but i do not believe that in in the americas it's not like it it does not work that way it just it it's is extremely difficult i've never seen someone ask me a single thing about my college i am from asia and no one has asked me about college i i assume there's there's plenty of places that are more that are more insistent about degrees and grades than there are in other places right i i think that's reasonable that's why the new counter-strike game is just completely dead it has some good game mechanics but other than that it's just inferior to other games this also has nothing to do with computer science by the way he was right though okay i stand by everything i just said okay i ref i i you know what i'm not taking the l here i just refuse i refuse to take the l i liked everything we just talked about i refused dude we had we had the mil charco we had a lot of discussions about people flooding into the field just absolutely absolutely refused to take anything but the but the w here okay just w's all around can we get w's in chat i see some l's i see l's trying to creep in but you know what that was just dubs right there okay mil chart off off the charts all right the name is counter- strike is dead because you know what that game has always been not that much fun okay okay yeah i'm saying it i'm saying it now i never really thought counter- strike was that great of a game okay i never loved it that much i when i was a kid it was all about quake a doom or unreal tournament and as i got older i became a halo guy okay i i loved halo i loved halo i loved unreal i loved those games okay i'm sorry i just never thought cs was all that fantastic i think cs just got really really good because it had one of the best online servers in the earlier days okay that's all that's what i'm saying okay suck on that yeah you want you want an l take there you go there's my l take okay not even like ut 2004 okay i'm talking about ut99 okay the original that's why i use phrase such as do decahedron okay you know why because i played with the level the level editor okay this take is so bad it will turn off the sun and 15 minutes get wrecked on get wrecked a jen
