hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about power shifting no lift shifting flat foot shifting whatever you would like to call it how to properly execute a no-lift shift meaning that from the manufacturer it actually came equipped with no lift shifting or a tuner provided it and also how you can actually make a car quicker in a straight line using flat foot shifting if the engine is turbocharged so it's pretty clever technology i'm not sure actually what the first vehicle was to come equipped from the factory with no lift shift however around 2007 with the chevy cobalt ss that actually came from the factory with no lift shifting and recently i was able to try out the cadillac ct4v blackwing which also is equipped with no lift shifting now it sounds very simple right all you're doing is you're shifting gears without lifting your foot off the accelerator how complicated could it possibly be but looking into what's actually going on with the engine it's actually a pretty clever pretty interesting process and it's not nearly as simple as just shifting while leaving your foot down so let's start off with the basics and talk about how this is done in the ct for the blackwing so we start with the engine a 3.6 liter twin turbocharged v6 so we're just looking at half of the cylinders right here so those cylinders are feeding a twin disc clutch so you can see the two discs in the clutch there that clutch then feeding the transmission of course you've got your manual shifter to select this collar between our two gears for this example first and second and then sending that power to the rear wheels so the standard process of shifting in a manual transmission you're probably well aware of you've got your foot on the gas you release your foot off of that gas you press in the clutch you shift gears you let the clutch out and you get back on the gas now a no lift shift you are simply doing all of these steps except not taking your foot off the gas so your foot's on the gas you press in the clutch you shift gears you clutch out and that whole time you've had that accelerator pressed down now the problem with doing this is that because your foot's flooring it and you've pressed in that clutch your engine speed is going to go very high but then your transmission speed wants to go lower because you're shifting to a higher gear and so what happens is when you then release that clutch pedal and you've kept your foot floored you're sending a really high load through this clutch the speeds don't match up and you're smashing those things together at different speeds at a high torque and so the transmission of course doesn't like that the clutch doesn't like that not a great thing to do if you're trying not to abuse your clutch however there are some things that you can do to kind of change the way that interaction occurs if you actually tune for doing it so let's talk about what's going on with this engine during this very brief moment just a fraction of a second that we're performing this no lift shift so if we have a turbocharged engine you don't want to lose boost right you want to maintain boost throughout the shift so you don't have to restart that process of building turbocharger boost and rebuilding your engine's power so how do we do this well let's first just take a look at what's going on with our engine and this is a simplified diagram so that we can understand what's going on it's not an exact replica of what we have with the 3.6 liter in the ct4 v blackwing so we have our air intake up front that air passes through the compressor side of our turbocharger travels along passes through an intercooler goes through your throttle then into your engine comes out the exhaust passes through the exhaust portion of the turbocharger and then leaves out your exhaust and so what do we want to happen during this shift well while we've got our foot floored we don't need power right we don't need the power is not going anywhere we don't need that power to slam that transmission right when we get back into gear but we do want to maintain boost we don't have to wait for that boost to come back after we've shifted gears so one of the clever things that you do is you want exhaust pressure but not necessarily cylinder pressure so how do you do that well you your ignition timing so you delay when you have your spark fire because instead of that piston being right at the top and then sparking and you have all that pressure turning into useful work pushing that piston down instead you fire that spark plug later as that piston is already on its way down so instead of that exhaust pressure becoming useful work you just send that exhaust pressure right out the exhaust and it keeps your turbo charger spooled up so that you don't have a delay in getting boost again once you've completed the shift now you also don't want to just go above redline right so in this process you do have to cut fuel so if you're just sitting there at the rev limit you're cutting fuel as necessary to keep your engine at its peak rpm however you're still retarding that ignition because when you are firing you don't want to be making power but you do want exhaust pressure so essentially in this state the engine isn't making much power but it is maintaining boost now to optimize this process not only do we need to look at ignition timing but we also need to look at our wastegate as well as our bypass valve and so a wastegate is used to prevent overboost from your engine creating too much boost making too much power and so basically what happens is you have exhaust it's spinning this turbine that's giving you boost it's pulling in more and more air and that means you have more exhaust which spins faster which means you get more air and that cycle just continues right so in order to prevent this you have a wastegate which allows that air to bypass your turbocharger so that you don't create additional boost now on the cadillac ct4v this is actually an internal wastegate not an external like i have shown here but regardless that's just kind of a very simple difference in how you have that exhaust gases diverted they're using a vacuum pump and vacuum storage in order to draw a vacuum within the wastegate itself so the wastegate has a spring that's always trying to open up that valve and so the valve wants to be open and then you use a vacuum and you pull a vacuum to squeeze that spring down and close off this valve so let's talk about different scenarios and how you're using this wastegate if you're on the highway if you're idling if you don't have much load well you're going to open it up so you're not going to have much vacuum being pulled in this wastegate so that the exhaust can route around the turbocharger because in that scenario if you're not making much power this just acts like a restriction so it's just going to cause you to get worse efficiency worse fuel economy so if you can bypass it do it on scenarios where you don't need the power if you're at full power of course you're going to pull that vacuum close this off most of that exhaust is going to go through the turbocharger and then once you reach your desired peak boost level then you start easing this wastegate valve open and letting any excess that needs to go by go by so you just level off your boost at the exact pressure that you want and then for a no lift shift what are you doing well you're actually fully closing this valve so that all of the exhaust gases are forced to go through the turbine because remember we're having to cut fuel if you're sitting at that red line if you're taking a really long time for this shift and even if you're not realistically like say a shift takes a quarter of a second you've still got a bunch of rpm that are going to happen in just that quarter of a second so what you're doing is you're fully closing this to ensure that while you're bouncing off that rev limiter cutting fuel the fuel that is used and the fuel that is used to keep that engine at redline all ends up going through the turbocharger and keeping that thing spooled up so that you still have boost with the engine finally we get to bypass valve so you can kind of think of a bypass valve like a wastegate except it is on the intake side instead of on the exhaust side so you have a valve that wants to be pushed closed by the spring and then by regulating the pressure within this spring you can open or close that valve so why would you want to have this valve open well let's talk about what's going on when you're at full power so you've got your foot on the floor you're trying to maximize power you've got air coming in through your intake your turbocharger is spooled up it's trying to create boost so you're adding a bunch of air within this intake tract right here so all of this intake is filled with boost and then you let off the throttle and you close that throttle valve so now you have all this boost all this air pressure rushing towards this throttle that's now closed so where does that pressure go well the only place for it to get back out is to go back through the turbocharger this is called turbosurge you don't want this to happen so how do you avoid it well you have a valve that sees okay there's a vacuum here it opens this up it allows that high pressure air to escape but basically what you're doing is you're bleeding off all of that boost so in the scenario that you're lifting while you shift so you press in the clutch and while you're pressing in the clutch you let off the throttle well during that scenario you close the throttle all of your boost is bled off from this bypass valve so then when you get back on the throttle after completing the shift you have to rebuild all of that boost within this whole intake tract before it goes into the engine so you're taking time away from acceleration because you're not at full power immediately once you're back into gear so with the no lift shift scenario what cadillac is doing in this scenario is when you leave your foot down this means this throttle is always open which means there's never a time that this bypass valve opens which means you leave boost within the intake the whole duration of that shift so once you then let off the clutch and you're in your next gear well you've already got boost built within your manifold and you're ready to go right back to full power immediately now as an example i have footage going from second to third to fourth and to fifth all while never taking the foot off the accelerator pedal and shifting through on a six-speed manual transmission so you can see this green bar and this green bar is showing you your throttle percentage so it's maxed out the entire time going through these shifts however this is actually a cadillac ct5 the black wing that we're looking at so this is a supercharged v8 not a turbocharged engine so turbocharged engines get a bit more benefit from flat foot shifting because you're able to maintain that boost and not lose the boost through the shift but it's neat to see this process and see footage of it actually occurring overall i just think it's pretty cool how much is involved with this you know the ignition timing the waste case the bypass valves all for simply just shifting years without lifting your foot off of the throttle so pretty cool thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
