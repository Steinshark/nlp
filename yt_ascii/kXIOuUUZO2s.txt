our full embargo has lifted and in just six days the steam deck will ship to end users in a state that can only be described as unfinished which puts me in an awkward position as a reviewer on the one hand i want to be optimistic the kind of zeal with which valve is tackling this project is like nothing i've ever witnessed in all my time covering technology they're on a mission to change the industry come hell or high water and it's no secret that i'm rooting for them every major player in the console gaming space i'm looking at you nintendo microsoft and sony has made enough blatantly anti-consumer moves over the years that i can't help but cheer for a disrupter on the other hand i can't review the hypothetical steam deck of tomorrow one with windows drivers and improved ui and better game compatibility if it's shipping as is i have to evaluate it as is and i'm going to be doing it a little differently than you might expect see this thing has the capability to be treated like a science fair project you can tweak it break it reformat it start over and valve is embracing that good guy valve but most people aren't going to do any of that so today i'm going to be focusing on the out-of-box console experience so ready or not valve here i come this video is brought to you by dbrand the most trustworthy criminals on the internet over the past few weeks we've been testing out dbrand screen protectors for the steam deck as it turns out the thickness of ordinary tempered glass inhibits touch sensitivity don't believe everything you see on amazon dbrand's tempered glass screen protectors for the steam deck are guaranteed to be super precise and work on your display check them out below now i could have spent the last couple of weeks laser focused on running countless benchmarks on the steam deck but really the bottom line is this at its starting price of 400 us dollars the hardware in the steam deck is literally impossible the internals of this thing put in the same performance class as ultrabooks that cost twice or even up to three times as much and if it's a title in steam's game library the deck is almost certainly capable of running it at 60fps if you're willing to turn down the details and that colossal back catalog is both its greatest strength and its biggest question mark i'm getting ahead of myself a little bit though firing up the steam debt cold takes just a few seconds now let's get logged into a steam account you'll need to be online for this obviously and take a tour of the interface at launch all the basics are pretty well covered and i was surprised at how self-explanatory just about every menu was home here contains your recently launched games news and recommended picks from your library based on the taste of gamers with a similar profile one surprisingly jarring feature for me on this page was the friends tab i mean it's a pretty simple feat of games that your friends are playing and recent events you can see mine is empty because i don't have any friends and you can chat with them to play together or view a game that you don't already own in the store that's just pretty normal stuff right but what it serves to highlight is the steam deck's online first design and i couldn't help feeling looking at this like the switch is suddenly this relic of a different gaming era the rest of the main menu is accessed using the steam button you can hold it by the way for a comprehensive list of useful shortcuts or chords then from here you can use any of the four methods of navigation joystick d-pad touchpad or touch screen to arrive at your destination and wherever that destination is there's a pretty good chance that you're gonna find some let's call them growing paints all right then let's pretend i'm a brand new customer who doesn't own any steam games and i head straight for the store no not that store although they do have excellent water bottles in those pads there two valves credit this has already improved a lot in fact it was part of a big long list of improvements that valve sent me just minutes before we sat down to film this video but unfortunately i caught this one already i had this whole thing written up about how the closest thing to a steam deck verified page in the store was the steamos slash linux heading under the categories tab that frankly reminds me of the reasons that nintendo introduced their seal of quality program back in the 80s like honestly climb fall human guys really i wonder if it's a fall guys rip off one of the new and trending games was like elf wives cheat to ride my meat fortunately that mess has been papered over with a proper great on deck header that allows you to browse titles that are verified to run flawlessly by category popularity ratings discounts all the usual fare and this is hugely important because for those who haven't been closely following steam deck news it runs a modified version of arch linux called steamos and game compatibility relies either on the developer to build a linux native version of their game or this super cool compatibility layer called proton or steamplay so this is great but there's a bit of a navigation problem here valve where on earth is the comprehensive list of deck verified games you've got this wonderful page on your website outlining the four different tiers of compatibility verified playable with tweaks or workarounds unsupported and unknown but nowhere on the official site or more importantly in the store can i just browse a comprehensive list of every game that works on the deck and whatever the reason is for this obfuscation i don't care it's a terrible user experience my first google hit for a workaround was this list on digital trends from a few days ago which led me down a rabbit hole to steamdeckverified.avery.cafe a totally credible sounding site that scrapes the steamdb database for verified status flags and then makes them easily searchable big props to the community maintainers of both of these projects but my gratitude towards them doesn't change the fact that neither of them should be necessary if valve is on top of these things i'm sure they're going to get this sorted out in time but considering that valve's core competency is supposedly selling games through a digital storefront it just struck me as a little ironic that i encountered everything from slow page loading to titles not highlighting as i was scrolling making it so that i had to navigate out of the store and come back to it and figure out where i left off to this confusing compatibility error message that i got while trying to download the demo of a steam deck verified game i mean given the importance of selling games to balance out valve's aggressive hardware pricing i hope that the plan is to get this in order as soon as possible or maybe the plan is just to allow me to buy additional copies of games that i already own while i'm at it by the way one more gripe is that while i don't mind the store reloading if i haven't looked at it in a while if i'm quickly switching back and forth between my library it would be really nice if it remembered what page i was on it's just really frustrating heading into the library things take a turn for the better i installed a one terabyte microsd card and found that while i didn't always get a prompt for which storage device i wanted to use it is super simple to transfer games to the internal ssd and vice versa and depending on the game i saw download speeds over wi-fi of anywhere from 30 to 40 megabytes per second and closer to 60 to 70 with spikes to 100 using a usb type-c dongle that's those zen 2 cores going to work love it and the game library inspired by steam big picture is delightful mostly in here we'll find a mishmash of games that i bought years ago ones that i picked up more recently to enjoy on the deck and pretty much every other unknown status game that i tried was a big fat negatory the good news is that according to the third party resources the number of verified games has been absolutely skyrocketing including many games that i would actually want to play while i wait for some of my favorites to arrive and more good news every verified game i tried with the exception of fez which i had some crashing issues with was a smooth enough experience that i would simply never even know that i wasn't on windows smoother actually in some cases let's talk about some really cool stuff the steam deck does better than a windows handheld say i'm on the bus gaming away and boom we're at my stop look at that sleep speed now i'm walking down the street ready to continue and bam xbox sure but i'd like to see a windows pc do that how about sleep battery drain in our rough estimation it appears that the steam deck loses about 10 percent of battery every 24 hours in sleep it's not quite apple level i mean what is but it's miles better than most windows laptops okay so now i'm in my game here right i'm just farming some wild boars or something and i want to hang out in voice chat without going through the hassle of installing discord and desktop mode or whatever steam menu friends voice chat and man let me put it this way i accidentally gave linus a call in the middle of the night while playing around with this menu and we were both blown away by the progress valve has made with audio compression in recent years and adding icing to the cake he described the mic quality on the steam deck as mid-tier which is high praise indeed for a microphone on a 400 handheld that's a couple of feet from your face here's a quick sample of the steam dex microphone through steam voice chat and here's a quick recording of the steam decks microphone through discord the one challenge we ran into was during intense scenes the game's audio could break through valve's attempts at canceling it out but the solution to this was as simple as either boosting the call volume or lowering the game volume resulting in a really excellent social experience all without nintendo gold xbox gold ps whatever thank you very much valve honestly though as a friendless person it's the quick access menu over here these three dots that impresses me the most whether you're in a menu or mid-game the quick settings menu is full of all kinds of goodies you got your notifications yeah nothing really that interesting there a way to more quickly access your friends and you've got your quick settings in here you can adjust screen brightness and you will want to do it this way not a huge fan of valve's auto brightness i think it needs some work you can adjust your rumble and haptics which by the way are still unamazing because they don't have dedicated hardware for it but both of them are greatly improved through updates since our hardware review and you can prioritize your connected controllers toggle your wireless radios all that good stuff bluetooth audio by the way for those who are bitter about years of nintendo apathy was completely painless with both my lg tone free fp8 and my airpods pros and i didn't try much else then there's the boring tab the battery tab that sorry did i say boring i meant the opposite of that this is the coolest one and it is time for the rest of the console industry to sit up and take notes that right there is an integrated performance monitor based on mango hut and it's time for a bit of a side story you could argue that microsoft has good coverage of the consumer spectrum windows for enthusiasts and tinkerers and xbox os for normie gamers but what they don't do a good job of is bridging this gap and when i contacted them asking for a temperature readout for the xbox series x for example they acted like i was from the moon an fps counter why would you want that more like what are you trying to hide this is in stark contrast to valve's approach here which appears to be well i don't know man i mean it's your thermal diode i assume you want the value it's outputting right damn straight i mean why pretend that a performance issue isn't real creating confusion among consumers when you could just give the enthusiast the tools that they need to diagnose it for you and better yet probably solve i mean it's beyond the scope of the video today but the fox is a wizard when it comes to tuning fps thermal and power limits in these handhelds to optimize performance and battery life to the point where he was actually able to beat valve's estimates so if you want to learn more about why this tab is so cool you can go check out his shiz all right the dumbest part of this traditional console opacity is that enthusiast grade diagnostics are such an obviously powerful business tool and when steam deck 2 comes out it's going to be trivially simple for gamers to compare performance which is a powerful upsell mechanism that it is baffling to me that everybody else doesn't want to leverage so this is the proof that you can build something for the hardcores under the hood and also keep it clean for the normies that never want to look at any of that stuff i actually get a lot of bmw vibes to be honest great hardware fantastic out of box experience definitely some quirks but also a ton of thought that goes into weird edge cases for example i ran an update and while the deck was rebooting i went out of network range so it got a little confused for a few seconds when it turned back on then it kind of went oh okay i guess we don't have network just dumped me in the profile selection screen i clicked on it and boom i was on the home page i mean valve has had a much better offline experience than many other platforms for years and that work is paying off in spades here one of the biggest challenges that they face with the steam deck is handling cloud saves with a portable device so to address this they introduced a technology that allows seamless saving across devices and that sounds great for the future gotta run to the can take your deck with you all done pick up where you left off on your desktop for the moment though things are a little more fudgy to demonstrate let's abruptly suspend a game session here the deck goes to sleep we go to launch that same game on desktop and oops we get a prompt warning us that we could lose progress if we continue waking the deck closing the game and putting it back to sleep resolves the issue but it's not particularly elegant for the moment and there are still quite a few rough edges here are a couple of navigation annoyances for example the keyboard doesn't roll over horizontally oh and my precious quick access menu this one drives me absolutely crazy as you are scrolling through the sub menus here okay if you go all the way down it doesn't go into the next parent menu obviously because that would be stupid but if you go up it just carries all the way through some consistency would be nice here but i'm sure valve is going to see this and fix everything that i've talked about before any customer actually gets the device in their hands which leads us perfectly into a huge discussion point we've almost completely glossed over some massive elephants in the room we've hardly even touched on game compatibility especially with third-party launchers and anti-cheat schemes and that's for good reason we just don't feel like it should be our focus today it's not perfect today no don't much of both of our steam libraries are either entirely incompatible or have issues but the steam deck needs to be evaluated for what it is not what we wish it could be it's a console which means it's compatible with the games it's compatible with but unlike any other console in history it's fluid using a compatibility tool like lutrus means it's entirely conceivable that a gamer could flip over to desktop mode on the steam deck and fire up anno'00 using the touchpads but unless they're willing to put in the work and maybe tolerate some inconveniences like the fact that multiplayer doesn't seem to work at all despite a gold rating on proton db it's just not going to be the kind of experience that most gamers are after which is why we feel that most people should probably look at valve's verified list or somebody else's and make their own decision it's an easy one for us we're in if you're on the fence but have a gaming pc fear not because for games that don't yet run natively or through proton steam remote play on the deck is probably the best most responsive game streaming setup i've ever used it's straight up outstanding and we don't say that a lot but we'll also be looking at some of the more hacky use cases in more detail in the future once valve's had a little bit more time to not complete the steam deck ah yes we're back to that what might surprise you about our it's incomplete take is that valve agrees obviously they've been hard at work refining the experience in the lead up to the consumer launch nobody wants to embarrass themselves but they also have no intention whatsoever of stopping here it's frustrating because it means consumers are expected to take whatever valve offers today and trust that someday i'll live up to the vision but it's also encouraging because it means that looking at it like a console once we've worked through the generous 400 some odd game launch titles there's hope that it's going to be better for years to come and honestly i'm hopeful and with that in mind i want to immerse myself in the steam deck experience and i'm going to be switching to it as my only computer for a month starting today during that time i hope to explore the desktop experience browser games apparently controller support is coming to a chrome update which sounds super cool third-party game stores gog for example as outright said we're not going to support it but maybe there could be workarounds for non-validated games i want to look at the windows experience actually windows might end up being a separate video i don't know about that so it's incomplete but i'm not complaining i mean i spent my whole life as a gamer asking for someone to take the guard rails off my console and let me do whatever i want with it understanding that there might be some hiccups along the way and someone finally did it so if you're like me you can see that valve took the rougher path here but damn it that's our path and i couldn't be happier so keep your pre-orders ladies and gentlemen because you're going to absolutely love this thing like you'll love
