okay so this just came in from oppo i'm told its smartphone related so with all that at least any time let's get right into it okay sooo pretty pretty anonymous so far there's no clues here yeah so there is one clear main event in this package so we're gonna take a quick look at some of the other stuff and then we'll get straight on to that so you might know that opera is actually one of the main sponsors of the international cricket council so the first few things are actually related to that we've got a water bottle here which i believe is signed by the vice captain of the england team we got this gym bag over here with hashtag be a shot-maker and believe the coolest part of this whole icc collaboration is what's inside here so there are four tickets to go and see the cricket world cup which i think is awesome now before i get to the main event there are still three more packages inside of here which are probably more similar to the oppo that you know so one more over here and let's get rid of this for now alright two three so first up is the oppo ax7 and there's a good chance that you've never heard of this phone even though it's a pretty unique offering the three selling points here are price design and battery life it is a hundred and seventy nine pounds here in the uk and as far as burns under 200 go it's got a pretty slick aesthetic but really everything here is in favor of battery life the fact that it has a massive four to thirty million power cell combined with the ferns less power-hungry snapdragon 450 chip and 720p display means easy to date battery the next thing is offers vooc flash charge power bank which as the name gives away supports the company's boot charging and 20 watts in both directions so it cannot just charge your phones with 20 watts of power but the bank itself also charges with it and this fast charging is actually achieved by splitting the bank's overall 10,000 milliamp hour capacity into two separate five thousand milliamp hour cells we've then got the oppo oh free which is kind of opposed foray into the fully wireless earphone market and visually they can remind me the back of the optima find eggs when you open the case they connect automatically to your phone and they'll auto pause when you take the buds out of your ear okay now for the flagship this is the oppo renault ten times zoom and i didn't just want to take it out the box and tell you that it's a really cool phone you've probably heard that 20 times already i wanted to show you so the headline feature here is well it's kind of in the name it's the fact that this phone can zoom in with ten times hybrid zoom and all the way up to 60 times digitally it's a massive statement to even enable a phone to zoom in 60 times you have to be pretty confident in the image quality so i traveled to central london to see how well it works on the way i spent some time testing the optical image stabilisation and well the results speak for themselves take a look at how stable the van and the road is in front of me what's even cooler is i was playing around with the zoom in a car moving at 65 miles an hour and managed to get this of the moon with new software trickery if you take a quick look at the hardware you can see three cameras flushed with the body of the phone and this little dot below which prevents them from being scratched when on a flat surface you've got the main 48 megapixel sensor you've got an ultra wide and then the periscope five times zoom camera so i took this phone to regent street in london and right here you can see me shifting slowly from the ultra wide camera to the standard view to a 2x zoom a 10x zoom and before you realise what's happening a 60 times zoom so it's pretty interesting to watch as objects that were previously dots on your screen that slowly becomes the primary subjects of your photo all the way up to about 10 times zoom i'd say things remain pin-sharp beyond that i'd call the zoom optional it's cool to see just how close you can get but you could always just take the shot at 10 times and then crop into exactly what you wanted to see later all right but as cool as the zoom is there are a few other camera features worth pointing out which might actually be a more typical usage case scenario you've got a portrait mode which i was pleasantly surprised by the bokeh is pretty natural looking and foregrounds are reliably crisp the fern has a knight mode or in this case ultra night mode 2.0 a dazzle color option which pumps up the saturation can turn fairly normal scene into something eye-catching and on the front camera the ability to cope with pretty harsh backlighting in every other way this is a full flagship experience the phone's got the design nailed down seamless metal and glass all around with this pivot rising structure that contains the front camera earpiece and the rear flash i've shown the renault 2 a few people now and they are consistently impressed it's got flagship internals and combines them with all oppo calls hyper boost 2.0 which brings a combination of faster touch response times and more stable gaming frame rates the renault 10x zoom has dual speakers it has a large 4065 milliamp hour battery and runs on opposed new color os 6 software now to address this software it is a major redesign vs. the last generation and the best way i can describe it is borderless you'll notice a distinct lack of edges every menu every first-party app extends without interruption to the bezels of the phone and it's quite a tactile experience a lot of the dials or all of the sliders in the ui they all trigger very subtle vibrations that just make it feel a bit more alive and then you've got the massive 6.6 inch 1080p oled panel on the front they call it the panoramic full screen display and it's backed by corning gorilla glass 6 for drop protection so as for what's next i'm gonna be taking this phone to the cricket world cup in a couple of weeks time and i'm gonna try and use the ultra wide use that zoom to see what it would look like in that scenario so stay tuned to the mister who's the boss instagram page to keep up on that my name is erin and i will catch you in the next one [music] you
