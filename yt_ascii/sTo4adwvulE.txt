hi everyone in this episode we're going to be animating a very simple walk cycle so for a walk cycle we just need to animate the character taking two steps on the spot and we can then obviously loop that for as long as we want now the second step is of course going to be a mirror image of the first so we actually only need to worry about animating a single step there are four key poses to keep in mind when animating a walk the first is the contact pose where the heel of the front foot is just made contact with the ground and the back leg is outstretched with a bat foot still touching the ground the final pose of the step is then going to be a mirror image of this in the middle of these two contact poses is the passing position here the front leg is now directly in line with the body supporting the character's weight and the back leg is in the process of swinging past the body note that the head is higher in this pose than it is in the contact pose we now just have two important in-between frames to fill in the down and up positions the down position comes just after the contact pose the foot is now flat on the ground and the front leg bends as the weight of the character comes down the back foot is just leaving the ground and the head is at its lowest point in the walk finally we have the up position coming just after the passing position here you can see that the green leg has swung as far up as it's going to go and is about to start coming back to the ground and the head is at the highest point in the walk cycle this is also just a guideline for a very generic walk but you can build on this to create many different types of walks i highly recommend that at some point you just get up and do an exaggerated slow motion walk around observing each of these key poses in your own walk alright so in blender we want to be able to see both our character and our animation window at the same time so let's go up to the top right here you can see the little diagonal lines and we can just left-click and drag out horizontally to split the window into if you want to join these two windows again you can just right click on the dividing line and say join area and then just left-click to urghhh the one into the other all right i'm going to drag that out again them and just change the editor type from 3d view to dope sheet which is where we can adjust the timing of our keyframes then go to set the mode to action editor and create a new action called walk and just press this f key over here to make sure that the animation data gets saved all right let's select the character's armature press ctrl tab to go into pose mode and from side view here we can see that the the route bone is a little bit annoying in that it covers up our foot bones i'm just going to press h to hide that for the moment and then let's bring our blue leg forwards we're going to want to rotate the foot slightly and then in order for the heel to be on the ground which is the screen line over here you have to bring the whole body down and it's probably a bit much we just want to adjust the body so that the your blue leg is just slightly bent we don't want it to be completely straight just something like that would be okay and we can then bring the green leg back and just adjust the rotation of the foot and the toes so that the toes are flat on the ground all right from front view then we're going to rotate the arms down and maybe just adjust the lower arms as well a little bit something like that and then our blue leg is forward so of course the blue arm is going to be back and our green arm is going to be rotated forwards like so okay that's probably good enough for our first pose so let's press h to select all of the bones and then we're going to press i to bring up the insert keyframe menu and you can see we now have to choose what we want to insert a keyframe for location rotation scaling location and rotation and so on when we're animating a walk really really care about the location and the rotation of the bones so to save having to select location and rotation from this menu each time we can come down and settle default to location rotation so now with the cursor over the 3d window if we press ai that will automatically insert location and rotation keyframes for all of the selected bones now looking down at the timeline here we've set a keyframe on frame 1 and because we've got all these frames visible all the way up to around frame 800 which is a bit excessive we only need to see the first 24 frames for our walk cycle so let's middle mouse drag to put our frame 1 in the center of our view and then just use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in so that we see the first 24 so frames now a single step is going to be 12 frames so 12 frames on from frame 1 is frame 13 so here we want to create a mirror image of this pose we don't have to do that manually we can press ctrl c to copy the current pose and then shift ctrl v to paste in the flipped or mirror image pose and just press i to insert that keyframe if you don't want to do that with keyboard shortcuts for whatever reason the buttons are down here copy paste and paste flipped alright so now if we scrub through this we can see it's interpolating between those two poses you can also press alt a to start and stop the animation now at this early stage of the animation process i prefer it if it doesn't interpolate between the two poses so with the keyframes selected you can just press a to select them all by the way just press t to bring up the keyframe interpolation and instead of it interpolating with a bezier curve going to set the interpolation to constant so now it will only move to the next pose once it actually reaches that keyframe like so ok so going to frame 7 which is in the middle of these two poses we're going to create our passing position so alt are to clear the rotation on the foot and let's put that in the center directly below the body and let's move the body up  clear the rotation on that toe and move this leg so that it's swinging past the body just something like that the arms would of course be swinging past the sides so we can just move those two both be something like that that should be good we can select all the bones press i to insert the keyframe and let's just play this to see what it looks like looking good all right we want to insert our down and up position now start with the down position on frame four so for this i'm going to clear the rotation on the foot just put the leg or rather the foot flat down on the ground the body will be at its lowest point and this foot should be just lifting off the ground now and the arms will be starting to swing but the lower part of the arm will sort of be trailing back so as this rotates this will still be trailing back like so all right select all of that and set the keyframe let's go to frame 10 where we'll do the up position so the green leg is coming forwards and the body is at the highest point something like that this leg is back and the foot can be rotated so that it is on the ground can't quite reach to the ground at the moment maybe need to bring the body a little bit lower down perhaps something like that will be fine we're going to need to swing the arms a bit more forward so just there and there let's grab the green arm and rotate that as well all right select all the bones and i to insert the keyframe let's see how this looks altai that is looking nice one thing that's clearly a bit weird is that on the up pose here the foot is actually higher up than it is on our end frame so maybe we can go here that and just lower the foot slightly like that maybe bring the leg down you might have to bring the rest of the body down slightly as well all right insert that keyframe and then getting onto the end frame we can also just raise the foot slightly just make sure that's flat on the ground okay select everything i shouldn't set the keyframe and obviously we want our last frame and our first frame to remain mirror images of one another so ctrl c go to the first frame shift control v and insert the frame all right that is looking better let's now press t with all of these key frames selected and change our interpolation back to busy a we press play now it smoothly interpolating again it's looking okay the main problem is this blue leg as it comes back it becomes completely straight and then it sort of bends out i don't know it's just looking slightly unnatural for a moment there so we're going to have to go through frame by frame to fix this i think so on frame h here you can see that the leg is completely straight like to bend it a bit by just moving the leg up a little higher and can keep the foot on the ground by just rotating it and rotating the toes as well and then just insert a keyframe on those bones that we manipulated there all right and then on frame 11 here you can see that the blue leg is completely straight once again so you can just give it a slight bend by moving the body down slightly and then insert a keyframe all right let's press also a to see how this is going i think it's looking a bit better now it's just zoom out have another look what is a bit strange still is if we look at the upper leg bone here how far it how far it's moving in a single frame there versus how far it's moving in a single frame between these two poses so we maybe want to bring this further back in a single frame i have to adjust the toes again all right okay we could tweak this indefinitely but i think it's looking acceptable now a few more things i want to do so this foot should come down to the ground much quicker than it currently is so it can maybe do it after one or even two frames but i'll just do it after one frame it's going to be flat on the ground since that frames for that all right and we can see the toes here are clipping through our ground plane so we need to want to go through frame by frame and fix that so let's lift the toes up slightly here just make sure they're not clipping through and that's okay all right everything else seems fine let's play this once more okay i'd like to rotate the hands a little bit to give those a bit of life so on frame one let's set and the initial rotation here select those two bones i should set the keyframe and then we're gonna want to mirror that over to our last frame so ctrl c shift ctrl v and what's the unset the frame now coming forward to our down position we want the hands to sort of trail behind is the arm swings back so we can rotate these forwards and this one backwards all right and set the keyframe then here they can just be straight down by the side so that's fine and then in the up position they should be starting to rotate into their final positions all right press i shall set those let's have a look okay now one thing i quickly like to do is just organize these keyframes with a little bit of color so for example these little fiddly keyframes for things like making sure that the toe always stays above the ground and so forth i'm going to select those and then press r and we can set the keyframe type i'm going to call these jitter it is going to make them small in green this is purely a visual thing it's not going to change how they behave and then can all try to click to select an entire line of key frames and then old shift right click to select this one here this is our down and our up positions press r and set that to either an extreme or breakdown just so that they're different from these or it consider the main frames of the walk alright now that we were fairly happy with the animation or at least i am i don't know how you feel about it but we can go ahead and mirror this single step into a second step so let's press a to select all of these key frames and then i want to drag this window out so that we can see the copy and paste icons here so we're going to copy all of these key frames and then we want to paste a mirror of them starting from frame 13 so moving to our last frame here we can paste reverse it doesn't seem to copy all of them properly let me just undo and try that again okay it worked this time i'm sure that was about so our ending frame is frame 25 and this pose is exactly the same as a frame 1 of course so when we're playing this we wanted to stop at frame 24 and then loop back to frame 1 so start on frame 1 and end on frame 24 let's see this a little bit bigger press alt a to play and we can see our little guy walking just hide that for a moment to get from the front the arms maybe a tiny bit weird but i think for the most part the walk looks quite nice so i'm going to leave this here for now feel free of course to tweak this to your heart's content but don't want the video to dry out too much so i need to end it here thanks for watching and until next time cheers
