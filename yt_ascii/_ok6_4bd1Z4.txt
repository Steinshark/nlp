hello we're in the studio at night out of uniform hair's a mess what's going on well guys frankly i got the second job yes sir i am now part of the vaxxed team i got 5g installed and let me tell you signals better than ever okay honestly i got it all installed right here and i'm excited about it but frankly the reason i didn't record earlier in the day was because i wasn't feeling great look second dose you're gonna feel a little i don't feel so good it hits you honestly if you're worried it's not that bad i was kind of feeling a little bit bad and then i took a tylenol and then we're doing all right okay so i baby myself all day but you know according to some people i might be dead in a few days you guys never understood you never understood the first thing about this i mean you guys know big daddy alex jones he's never been wrong before everyone knows how big of a fan i am of alex jones so i'm not saying that insultingly but let's see who's right here basically anyone taking these vaccines they're all designed to the same thing is going to have neurological disorders within one year most of the people taking the vaccine will be dead within 10 and this john hopkins says it all right here now you guys know why i'm so eager to get these videos out i don't have long voice so i wanted to talk to you guys dude what the heck's up with my hair right now i'm just gonna put it down so i'm just wow dude i look like the kid from spider-man the the toby mcguire dude from the greatest spider-man movie ever here we go boys what do i how do i pull it off yes dude [music] yeah baby anyway we're dealing with it guys look i'm covid i got a coping vaccine okay sympathize with me i'm having a rough time here tough time of it now speaking of actors guys today i'm making this video because a beverly hills man was arrested for a ponzi scheme they got a quarter of a billion dollars from people and he's like a f-less celebrity called zack avery you guys hear about this actor arrested for running film investment ponzi's game boys i don't know like do you did these people watch coffeezilla i'm gonna guess no so how did he do it how did he pull it off it's kind of amazing so apparently he solicit investors saying he would purchase the regional distribution of rights to films and then license the rights to platforms like netflix and hbo now this is interesting specific scams like this they kind of have to be a little specific you kind of it has to be like some weird niche where people are like i would have never thought of that and then they'll go invest in your stupid thing but guys and he's facing 20 years by the way for this he ran something called one in mm capital but two things number one you can never trust actors let me tell you guys that right now if somebody's pretending to be someone else for a living do you know that person ever probably not they ask you how you are you just have to say that you're fine when you're not really fine but number two he wasn't even a good actor his imdb page has like a few movies apparently the biggest movies he was in was probably like fury never heard of these movies i mean you guys fell for this idiot cause you're not watching coffeezilla you're not watching spencer cornelia you could have spotted this guy a mile away i feel like i'm the man of the house now this is the real zack avery by the way and here's the crazy thing dude now he has a million views on this video but only 9 000 likes which means it's almost for sure that he boosted this video to get to where it is like with ads and stuff so he ran ads on his own show deal to give you an idea of this man's mentality you know why cause you're just a [ __ ] child your son was my best friend bro just imagine replace this with like i need you to invest 227 million dollars with me it's a get rich i mean sorry it's a for sure scheme i mean it's a for sure it's a business op it's a business safe save money just replace that with what he just said he's saying right here would you believe him would you buy in do you think he's a good enough actor would you fall for this he was my brother and he was one hell of a soldier come on dude everything he did work it's in the eyes can't you tell that dude bad actors they don't have the they just like sold his eyes it was my brother you don't have the heart baby which is why you probably ran a good ponzi scheme allegedly allegedly though this guy made two checks he may not have lived long but the life he did live it was full and it was lived as completely as anyone i've ever met and i am honored that i was able to be a part of it i am completely bro it's the same eyes no matter what cd is it's the same like i am completely in love with you daniela come on dude we don't believe you but apparently people did for this netflix scheme this whole licensing scheme he said it was safe money he said it's a safe investment because we receive confirmation from our outputs indicating the desire to acquire rights and just imagine him saying that with his 10 000 yard stare we receive confirmation from each of our outputs indicating the desire to acquire the rights to any title we provide bro stop okay please stop look i'm hurting from the covered vaccine and you're giving me a headache okay enough of that honestly i don't know what i'm doing i just released the healing touch video i should just done done dude i feel better already guys that's basically it i just wanted to talk to you i couldn't go a day without giving y'all a video hope you get the you know 5g shot in your arm and if you do get the double dose you got to get the double dose because it'll you know doesn't work otherwise you don't get as good as cell reception that's basically it though thanks for watching and and i'll see you guys that was where you tomorrow me wake up and smell the coffee
