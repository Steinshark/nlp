at some point you've probably gone to plug in one of your newly purchased gadgets and thought to yourself why doesn't everything just use the same charger as you struggle to jam in the connector the right way well you're not the only one in fact so many people have had this frustration that the european union itself is looking to force electronics manufacturers to use usbc and only usbc for charging so what does this mean for the future of electronics let's start out by looking at what the eu's new proposal actually covers mobile phones tablets headphones and headsets portable video game consoles portable speakers and digital cameras are all in there so most small electronics designed to be taken with you are covered but laptops are notably absent as are very low power devices like earbuds and smart watches since these devices have charging and use characteristics that are quite different from the list of covered devices and the proposal also leaves out products that don't rely on charging so don't expect to see any usbc powered hairdryers although that would be really cool now as cool as it sounds to have a single charging standard for all your mobile devices why is the eu trying to force it through i mean even though usbc isn't universal the industry is for the most part moving in that direction already and it's not like there are a whole lot of other charging connectors out there other than micro usb which is disappearing and apple's lightning which is still just holding on you can't kill me well according to the eu 38 of consumers have said they've had issues with not having compatible chargers for their phones when they needed them with 2.4 billion euros spent every year on extra chargers the eu has gone on to say that the situation has resulted in a ton of e-waste more like 11 000 tons every year so it's not a huge leap for the eu to think the solution is to settle on just one charging standard and not only that the proposed law will also mandate that gadgets that support fast charging will use the standard usb power delivery protocol in order to reduce confusion between different fast charging standards the goal is to make it possible for users to get the same charging speed across a wide variety of chargers and also to get information across to the consumer more clearly a strategy that is clearly seen in the usb implementers forms latest table about which usb logos to use now each charger sold must state both a minimum wattage as well as information on any fast charging protocols it supports outside of the standard usb power delivery and unsurprisingly the law will also seek to reduce the number of chargers that are included with electronic devices by forcing manufacturers to sell versions of their gadgets without an included charging brick which is one thing that apple is a step ahead of them on and ooh do we have some thoughts about that which we will address after we thank the sponsor of today's video view conference 2021 from october 17th to 22nd over 200 speakers will talk about the intersection of storytelling and technical innovation including legendary cinematographer roger deakins eccentric riders phil lord and chris miller and the cto of pixar steve may you can watch live for free or purchase a ticket for in-person or on-demand access to all the panels workshops and speakers so learn more and get your view conference 2021 ticket today using the link below now as i hinted at a second ago there's a giant apple sized elephant in the room and you've probably already figured out that apple with its proprietary lightning connector is fighting tooth and nail against the proposed law the company raises the point that the law would only make the e-waste situation worse by rendering a huge number of existing lightning-only accessories obsolete but their position is undermined somewhat by the fact they asserted the rule would stifle innovation i mean maybe but we're talking about charging here and not many people use cables to transfer data to and from a phone anymore when we do need to usbc is more than capable of handling it of course apple owns not only the lightning protocol but also magsafe for wireless charging and this has led some to speculate that at some point in the near future apple may just skip usb-c completely and go straight to a portless iphone with wireless charging only the proposed eu law doesn't cover wireless charging at all so it would at least for the time being get them out from under the eu's watchful eye but wireless charging is for now still significantly slower than having the phone plugged in so apple might be at a competitive disadvantage if they do decide to go this route but although the law is set to cut e-waste it might not make a huge dent in the problem as the eu is only expecting a reduction of a thousand tons per year chump change and if we advance beyond usbc at some point we might have to do this all over again with another change in the law as the directive says nothing about a post-usb-c world we have to go to zombie movies for that if the eu does enact this proposal which is expected to happen in 2022 each national government will have two years to make it law and electronics manufacturers will have the same amount of time to switch their charging ports over to usbc fingers crossed this will end up being a model for the rest of the world if we can't agree on what shape our power outlets will be well maybe we can at least agree on this hey thanks for watching this tech quickie guys like the video
