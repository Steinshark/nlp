so what you're about to see is a discussion i had with john hears from the why are we talking about rabbits podcast john heers runs a foundation called first things foundation which does international work international aid but he's also very sensitive and very open to learning from the cultures that he encounters in terms of noticing the difference between what he calls old world and new world thinking and i found that his podcast is actually a great introduction if you if you guys symbolic thinkers are looking for a way to introduce your family your friends to the difficulty of the modern world and to the possibility of symbolic thinking this podcast is definitely a good place to start because you really take people by the hand and shows them the difference in thinking and so with the lord of spirits podcast and this podcast you've really got a nice little ecosystem of old world thinking that is coming together and i really enjoyed this discussion we talked about everything from you know the encounter with different cultures to also figuring out whether or not i'm really an old world person or if i'm just posing as an old world person so please enjoy this discussion [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world jonathan welcome how are you hi it's great it's great to we met a little bit before and some email exchanges so it's wonderful to see you healthy and back on track jonathan and i were scheduled to do this show right when i got covered which i think i've mentioned on a previous pod and basically what happened was is i tried but i jonathan i was hooking up you know the apparatus and i felt sick and dizzy and i was like i could see it in your eyes that you just weren't you know no that was right in the throes of it so we rescheduled you're here i think a lot of folks who come and listen to our podcast will know you i think some won't so i went to go do a bio then i realized bam this brother's got i want you to do your bio i see you fundamentally as a teacher and here's what i mean i think what happened is your artistry has just broken out of you and it's like a sweat in my mind and what's happening is is your your theory on art is in fact what you're teaching us and the theory on art is tied into i think what we talk about on the show is old world new world so am i crazy is there something like that going on it's i get it's a good it's hard to really i've never felt like i needed to pin down what i was doing or who i was i think that i have a love for i've just developed a love for pattern you know and and seeing kind of the patterns unfurled in front of me and kind of enjoying and and rejoicing in seeing the order of the world and so that happens in the way that i produce icon you know icon carvings but it also like you say kind of bubbles out and becomes this this participation or this rejoicing in the patterns in scripture and in the patterns i see in the world and how the story of christ kind of has permeated all of culture and how it's easy to it's helped it i find joy in kind of pointing out to people you know that this story is just everywhere and you can't you can't avoid it you know so we have this our construct on the show comes from our experiences so i like to call it in line with reality we're we're not idealogging or whatever gnosticizing i'm making up words but our experience as a foundation as a nonprofit working overseas in this peace corps model what happens is we experience something like a new an old world and then we experience the new world that we carry over in our souls or minds or bodies and it's a real divide i wonder if that's a real divide in your mind and your soul do you see something that shifted and that now we're in something new as opposed to the old is that even a thing how would would you i think so i think it's a good it's a proper way to understand it there is there has been the way to understand that there's an old world and there's a new world is to the extent to which people look at the old world or look at medieval art or medieval stories or medieval world and can't make heads or tales of it have no idea what they're looking at you know they they think they're just looking at a bunch of crazy people that must have been insane because how could they produce such images such stories such such legends and so because of that you know you get the arrogance of the enlightenment and the arrogance of the new atheist types who look at everything before them as this kind of this kind of stupid superstition the entire world before me we're just a bunch of idiots because i look at what they're saying and i look at what they're doing and i can't understand it and so i think that that is a testimony to the fact that there definitely is something that happened a break a shift whereas when you when you go overseas or you go to more traditional societies and you encounter people you realize that they have something in common there's something in common about the capacity to to view the spiritual world as being embodied in in reality and seeing how these things and they have their different ways of talking about it or describing it but for them it's a completely natural moment yes i had a funny moment one time when i was in haiti actually i was in haiti and i was talking to a bunch of a bunch of carvers and i was helping them out because i work with artisans overseas and and they were kind of talking and talking and then all of a sudden i said that i was orthodox and they looked at each other and then they started talking and they were saying things amongst themselves and and then i kind of kind of hinted at the fact that i could understand what they were saying they looked at each other and they said oh the orthodox they have a bit of the mystical vision and you can realize that what they were saying to each other was usually when i'm with a white person we don't talk about this stuff because they don't understand it they they don't they have no sense of what we're discussing but all of a sudden they had this weird hint that maybe this guy has a little bit of a glimpse into into the notion that there's this connection between the spiritual world and the the embodied world i took my family with three daughters at the time we were orthodox christian missionaries in haiti oh wow and i know it's super reality what you're saying and you know where it was manifest in their understanding of icon so the protestant missionaries there had struggled it with our icons in our house so you know we're foreigners and they come walking into our house and they're very taken aback by the fact that we had icons and they kept saying why did you adopt the pagan traditions because serious whoa because we had done the serbian tradition of i think more but for sure the serbs do this where they take a candle and burn across just over the over the door over the entrance all the ways just as you know a blessing and they saw that and like oh we had it but you're right it was it was it was we could meet on a different level it's a it can be a scary world though because so talk talk to us about what the new world in your mind or in your work what did it do to the mind the way we think or perhaps even better to art what happened in as you see it in terms of the mind and and then culture well the way that i understand let's say this new world or the development of this new world or the development of the modern world is i see it as a form of of de-incarnation as a form of it's it's kind of like a breakdown of christianity and i think it's part of the story i think it has to happen it's part of the scandal that christ talked about and so i don't you know i'm annoyed with it because i'm in it and i have to deal with the consequences of it but i also think that it's part of the story and the way that i see it is that it's as if the two if in christ the invisible indivisible were joined and if in christ that became explicit like the notion of the invisible and the visible join together in one person perfectly you know with all the ways that we tried to describe it you know in the councils then it also it seems to have opened up a possibility that now that we know about these how do we have clear formulations about two natures and about all this stuff then it's at some point in in the late middle ages you know in the early modern period it started to split apart and then what you ended up seeing is you ended up seeing descriptions of god would became more and more removed from reality you know leading up to deism where this idea is that god is basically so outside the world that he's actually arbitrary it's completely arbitrary there's no there's no connection between god and the and the way that the world you know lays itself out or then or a more kind of a stranger version which is the idea that god is basically just like a super being with a lot of powers you know right and so it's like he's basically like always like the marvel comics version of god right he's like in this super being with a lot of really really powerful and and that's usually the god that these the new atheist types like to attack because some people do really believe in a god like that it's like it's this like how can god listen to all the prayers of all the world because you know how would what kind of brain would he have to process all the prayers of the entire cosmos right it's like that's not possible it's not scientifically possible that kind of nonsense and so those are the two extremes one of them gave gave form to idealisms and and kind of abstraction and the other gave form to brute materialism and and so it afforded us some power like it afforded us real power which is the development of extremely subtle theories of mathematics extremely subtle theories of you know the notion of algorithms all these patterns that people are that the the scientists are able to perceive and also a force in the world to create technologies to create medicine to create all of this so it afforded us a power but because of the deincarnation then it also leads us astray and leads to fragmentation yeah it leads to the breakdown you know the social breakdowns that we see and then the clamp downs which are the reaction so you have a breakdown things start to break down people notice that there's nothing their things aren't holding us together and now what we want to do is we want to overcompensate by creating systems of control so you have totalitarian states coming together at the same time as you have this kind of crazy excesses of your passions and excessive so you have the roaring 20s and then you have the nazi germans right it's like you have the you have the you have these excesses which start to manifest themselves is that what you see when you see you're in canada but you see in our country that there's people marching into the i don't see blue and red there or right and le i see people trying to put together put back together a world that they know is coming apart in their bellies they know it in their gut do you see it is that i say i hear i think that's the exactly the right way to understand it is that is as we've moved away from the thing that unites us as we you know as we've and you can see like the idea that it's like one nation under god is actually a very late statement you know yeah that's right story of america but you you notice that the reason why i was put there was almost like to say we're noticing that he we're not a nation under god anymore oh that's it so we have to say it like we have to we have to say it so that it stays true for a while at least and then that leads to the other opposite which is it's like no we know where we can't be we can't put religion into the state and so all of this it's always like it's always like a move between breakdown and overcompensation and so that's what we're seeing right now is that you have two sides one side which wants to affirm nation identity you know and this close borders all of this type of talk and then you have another side which is basically saying identity is evil you know any form of identity is evil it's all about multiplicity it's all about the outside is better than the inside the stranger is better than the the national so it's like these two it really is these two extremes and so they can't there's no way for them to come together and then both of them can't see the other they can't see they can only see the sins of the other person they can't see the the the let's say the value in the discourse of the other and so when the left is violent it doesn't see it and when the right is violent it's it's so they only see the violence of the right and the right tends to see the violence of the left yeah and so it's like it's it's so you can have you can have an autonomous zone in seattle for months but when the right attacks a federal building it's like oh my god it's the end of the world this has been happening since march this whole this has been going on for months and months but it's like so there's this weird weird important capability of seeing and seeing the other side yeah that's a dangerous place sarah from rose talks he's i mean he's not addressing politics as much as his spiritual life but he talks about a bridge that once you cross over it burns behind you in the sense that there's no framework to see the other we it's not that i can't there's no framework for me to understand what they're talking about because basically everything has become nietzsche and personal politics you know everything's just become what how does that serve me and i find it really fascinating that that in the end i don't know how it stopped like i don't know how it fixes itself and i have a feeling you don't think it does i don't think it's going to fix itself i think that one of i think at least for people who struggle to see it the best way is to try to see it in yourself because we have that same problem in ourselves which is that yes it's like if think of the times where you've sinned or the times that you've you know you binged a cake or you've done some some you get you've given in to a passion somehow and then you know it's like as soon as that's finished and then you look at yourself and you you don't recognize the person you're like who is that person who did that like or you lie and you lie and then you catch yourself lying and five minutes later you're like what what like what did i do like who is that person who lied and you have no way to see that person and that person that's lying also doesn't have a way to see the person that wakes up and wants to confess the sin right it's like those two people in you are kind of fragmented and broken and so and and ultimately the work of the spiritual life and the work of christ and the work of of the church is to be able to reconcile these fragmented pieces of us you know into one person you know in the image of christ so talk about reconciliation it's a little bit of a twist in your work on your podcast you're talking to a lot of non-orthodox christian people i mean you have a you know sizable audience we deal with this too how can you reconcile what do you do with the vocab how do how do you manage the vocab because what i find in modern people is is there's a place you go with certain words you shut everything down yeah i really what led me to your your show was you did this thing that i feel like i've always been trying to do in my classrooms and now with the found and and i loved it you're both and is there a reconciliation process you had to go to do did you have to decide what you're doing in terms of that space and your faith well i think it's weird because i didn't really decide to do this like this whole thing this whole youtube thing i was kind of thrust into it in a strange way you know i but i feel like when it happened in a way i had been mentally i realized that i often mentally playing a mental game with myself where i would always ask i was trying to explain something to someone who who doesn't believe in god at all it's like how can i say this in a way that someone who has no idea about christianity could even know what i'm talking about you know and so i think that i'd kind of done this weird these weird mental gymnastics to try to find ways to talk about it and and it seems like it has that like it has some connection yeah and so yeah and so there is and it's also i think the reconciliation in you is important in the sense that one of the problems we have when we're inside the church is that at some point we have this vocabulary this kind of self-referential vocabulary and sometimes it can actually make you feel like you know what you're talking about but you don't it's just because all these words fit together in a nice in a nice way and you can just quote this father and use phrases that you've heard the priest say and everything so you actually don't know what you're referring to and so one of the things that i was always trying to do is to say what is this talking about like what is deification what are we talking about what is you know what are the passions what are the what is what is all what is noetic like all these words that we use that are that are very technical trying to try to find a way it's like if i can't explain it to an atheist then it doesn't mean anything to me like if i can't because it's supposed to be about our experience right it's supposed to be about the real experience of the world not some theoretical just theological thing this is the teaching part of you that i just am thankful for and and i'll tell you so in the classroom really that's what's taking place all the time and then so my experience figuring this out my very first experience was in peace corps living in mali and i'm what you just talked about reconciliation was is how do i actually meet folks that are using a different cultural apparatus language what do i do because we're actually experiencing the same thing and malia we really were on the same wavelength but there were all these barriers and i feel like in our country we we christians orthodox folks we have to remember this there's something empathetic and beautiful about remembering it but not trying to curate it so much that we're not being real and that space is really difficult to get right in there and i find it's about relationship so i bring a guy in our show who's the bluest cat you've ever met i mean he he's he's just the nietzschean liberal love him he's an atheist in variation he's called uncle seth and he comes on and he just rips he just lets it go and but he's literally an uncle to my kids they love him i love him and everything and then when it's all over you know what stands in the rubble is the two of us somehow we need that can you feel it in canada too can you feel it ripping apart in canada or is this an american gig going on the thing about canada is the thing about canada is that the cultural war is over and so it's not that it's not just so it feels more peaceful because basically christians have conceded every point every single point like they've just conceded everything and so because they've conceded everything then there's no struggle and and so it can feel almost like there's no problem but it's not that there's no problem it's a it's it's that we've you know we've we've had weird moves and that have gone almost unnoticed of removing the removing male like father and mother from the law so we've had these weird moves in ontario where they they people actually did that and you know it barely went noticed in the media because there's no there's no cult there's no discussion in the culture it's just basically the plan is moving along and so we're going towards something and there's no resistance so it's not necessarily better it's it can be better in the immediate term because because it either you you can't see the conflict but you know it's like you can't see you don't have a conflict if you let yourself go to your passions either like if you if you give in to your passions all the time you're not going to have an inner conflict you're just going to keep sinking down into this thing and so it's not necessarily better it just there's less conflict at least over conflict at least so tell our audience real quick you and jordan peterson had a collective moment you you saw yourself saying some of the same things and you know him right personally yeah so well we met we met a little bit like about a year before he became famous and so he kind of thrust he kind of put me out there it was very strange moment you know but it didn't last that long a lot of people still want to really connect me with jordan peterson but it would it lasted basically like a year and a half and then he became so famous that i you know that i could sure did it get dismissed in canada that conversation that he was trying to have well he didn't he didn't i mean the law got passed like in terms of the whole problem of of enforced speech and all that he definitely didn't succeed it just everything just kind of happened i think that he definitely has a he definitely has people who listen to him in english speaking canada he you know he did part of his book tour was here in canada and he he was quite successful so he has the same crowd there here as in the us it's just that let's say in canada the we have state-run media mostly and so we and so it's we don't have you know it's like for all the problem of having something like cnn to fox news at least there's some space for for distinction whereas here we just have cbc basically and there's a little bit like you know there's a few publications that are that aren't completely on board but it's it's not as there isn't as strong so okay so go back with me for a second to symbolism and you know the artistry in africa where i spent a lot of time it's not that hard to explain this but in america it's difficult why do you think symbolic thinking is so difficult for us because it could be seen as weird you're talking about goats and horns and why is it difficult well i think one of the things that makes it difficult for sure is that we're we're very far into the garments of skin you could say which is that we're kind of far away from the more primordial perceptions and so we we we live in a a padded technological world where you know you could not notice that the sun is going up and going down barely like you you don't you don't live outside you don't have you don't experience the cycle of of the seasons as much as a person in a more in an older culture would and so a lot of the symbolism is is connected to these more primordial perceptions up down you know this idea of light dark and the cycle of light and dark with the procession of the of the of the equinoxes and you know all of this is something that you perceive when you kind of live in the natural world so because we were so padded it's difficult it's more difficult for us to to perceive that these patterns are everywhere and that they're kind of part of but it's also just because of a very long process of the mythology the mythologization that has happened you know in the modern world and even within christianity as christians embrace scientism without maybe even realizing thinking that they're helping their cause by trying to defend the scripture in terms of of scientific theories and trying to find science in genesis 1 and all that stuff it's like they thought they were defending scripture when in fact they were basically raising up this weird scientific thinking because of that they they don't a lot of people even are even find it threatening that there are patterns and stories it's like if you if you try to show them that the story let's say that the story of moses crossing the the red sea is very the same it's the same story as noah crossing the flood and that it has the same pattern it's like no no no it can't because it it it happened right it there you convinced events don't have patterns events are arbitrary and then patterns come on top as this thing that's added but that the symbolic thinking obviously says that no the word lays itself out in patterns and it's normal that you will find patterns and stories and you all it's normal you'll find those same patterns in reality in your everyday life the same patterns will be there you know maybe not as concise as in the stories but they'll still be there but one doesn't cancel out the other see this is the per the notion of truth in paradox i think we lost look i don't want to pick on my pr this is one of the great questions i really want to hear you say this is not on my list either this one is really brutal because so many good people i don't know what political persuasion they're in want something like a return and so many good people in the orthodox tradition in america i'm talking about american orthodox now they want something like a return to what we were and i always just want to go but weren't we always now here's the language i don't want to offend anybody weren't we always a heretical country weren't we always protestants yeah and so for the americans it's a really really confusing question because i really don't want to recapture and regain the thing that in some ways is what you just described as the destroyer of the mystical nature of christianity so what do what do we do and first of all was i too hard on the protestant tradition no but i think i think that it's these are these are the hard questions these are definitely the hard questions that is that i think that as kind of traditional christians it's very hard to say that we want to be constitutionalist or that kind of stuff like you hear people talk about because america was founded on a revolt against the king it was founded on a fundamental you know founded on on enlightenment ideals which are this idea that we declare these truths to be self-evident it's like none of these truths are self-evident without god like a lot of these things you're saying are not that obvious and and as self-evident as you think if you don't have this this hierarchy of being as part of your part of the way you understand the world and so i agree that that in a way the united states is kind of like the last kingdom or you know this kingdom of the edge or the kingdom of the end or something away something like that you know kind of democracy before before the fall but at the same time it has something which is i think in american culture will also appear the seed of the new world i think that that's going to there's something inevitable about that i always i like to use california as a kind of microcosm where it's like california has all the worst things in the united states like all the most degenerate worst decadent things are all in california but if you go up in those mountains you'll find some of the most powerful monasteries and you'll probably find weird aesthetics living in caves that praying all day and so it's like it has everything so it also has it has the end but it also has seeds for a new beginning maybe or a new revival or a renewal in that sense do you fear more or welcome more post-modernism or or you know the new the new way of thinking that allows i mean i just did a podcast on priestesses apparently that was a big conversation in 2018 on the internet oh no priestesses are everywhere so so that's i call that some type of post-modern eruption right and so is that what do i think of post-modernism i think post-modernism is useful in the to the extent that it's useful and it's it's horrible and dangerous to the extent that it is in the sense that post-modernism has strength because it breaks down the certainty of atheistic kind of enlightenment let's say the end of enlightenment kind of atheistic certainty and it breaks that and it really does it also it helps it creates a space where suddenly i can talk about symbolism and people can even know what i'm talking about that's right yeah that's right yeah i think 60 years ago 70 years ago the things i say i said would not even people would not even had hooks in their mind to put it like they wouldn't have a place in their experience to place the things i'm talking about whereas post-modernism has afforded that yeah first things foundation it does aid we aid people i hate this concept okay but i want to hear from a symbolic thinker and someone an orthodox brother but i just a person who's made some sense at all this our concept is is that aids is for you so when jonathan pagio goes down to the food bank it's for you and then and here's why it's because when you go down if it's a sacrifice of some sort in other words if you're going into the ground in some ways as a seed what's happening is you're being reborn through the process of aid and so we can't lose track of that and and so our whole model is that you're not really going to aid somebody else unless you're in some sort of modus of i don't like suffering is the word for an orthodox christian for i think a modern person they're like i don't really get it you whip yourself or something but what you have to do so we go and live right alongside everybody who supposedly is suffering and then we live just like they're doing and then we spend two years nobody wants to do this jonathan nobody wants to go do this but what happens is you come out the other side what you did is probably a project or five or ten but what you really did is you you did this thing like talks about glasses you really stripped off a pair of glasses that you thought you had on and you become somebody new and then that is also an outcome of aid and it should be and where a project doesn't have that happening and i again i pick on some people but i love people who want to help but if you're taking a bunch of kids for a weekend to a foreign country and they're putting up a wall and then they're flying back home there's no there's no down in that so they can't come up so am i crazy can you speak to this guy no i agree you know when when when i spent seven years in in africa and i work with mennonites actually so i work with mennonite central committee and the reason why i work with mennonites was because exactly of that perception that they had like they had a very similar perception to what you're talking about that is we lived so we had no salary we had a stipend and we lived in local neighborhoods you know we're the only white people in our neighborhood for years and so and and so and you and also they say they basically tell us for the first six months you actually don't do anything you just learn the language you learn the language you figure out like where you are build a community build relationships and then after of several months like it's obviously flexible but after several months then you actually put your foot out and start to see if there are some things you can connect together and that has been really like for us it was amazing because all that time like you said the first few months you you have the time to break down your your prejudice break the prejudice you didn't even know you had break down the you know the your comfort zone break down all of that so that when you finally have friends and a community and a little bit of connection and you've also been able to discern the people who are just sharks who just want to get something from you you start to kind of find your way to see pearls and people of value and people who are are sincere and then like the project we built in in congo you know since until covet i don't know if it's still going to continue but until kobit it was still going and this was like and this is 15 years after we're gone and it was just run by local people doing their own thing it's just because we had just and it was it's not a tribute to us it was a tribute to the time that we spent to just figure out like hey this is a really good person and like i'm going to invest in this person and then like you said you you put the seed in the right earth and then it just grows on its own you know so you saw that that's fantastic i didn't even know we were doing the mennonite thing we were talking about cereal and methodius when we got very first started with this that's fascinating i didn't even know well cereal methodists are a great example of exactly that because they basically listened and paid attention and then offered to offer offered to the slavs something which was both theirs like both the slav but also added value to what the slavs already had right it's like we're going to give you a written language you know in your own language and it's like you can now use this not just for liturgy this has a whole lot of other applications like this very powerful thing that they offered and and so i think that that's a i think that's a great example yeah using serialization [music] we thought about that and you know we also thought about and i'm sure i've heard you talk about it on your show actually you know one reason america is great or has been whatever that is is that there's all this new blood right there's all these immigrants that come in they come from the outside inside and i always think i would be very odd for the immigrants who've just landed to start to tell people how to do stuff can you imagine you know the latin american immigrant just coming in and started pointing to everybody out how to do it's it's insanity but i do think it's part of why we're we were healthy at least economically as we allowed that outside in and but we don't do it so well going the other way in united states history we tend to not settle but tell we tend to not listen but but speak so yeah and in a way that communion is probably a better way to understand it in the sense that when you like if i go to africa it's like if i go to congo for example that's where we went most of the time we were in kenya as well but like especially in congo it's obvious that there's a massive difference and there's definitely something that i have that can be added value to the people who are there and there's something that they have that is definitely going to be an added value to me and so in that relationship there's like this mutual learning and this mutual exchange which i think and it's also because because the reality is that i'm coming from a place where that has more resources in terms of money like just in terms of the rich being a rich and giving to the poor and so that's a reality which which we don't want to we can't ignore and so coming in as a rich person and then being in communion with people who are who have more poverty and trying to find ways to be able to plant seeds so that they grow not just dropping money on people or you know or or also thinking that the fact that i have money means that i can tell everybody what to do but right rather trying to find points of communion where my resources and your potential are going to create something awesome right if you want it's like you meet someone and you know right you meet someone and you're like if this guy or this woman had resources they would knock it out of the park and you just see it and you see the other person who's like oh this guy just wants he just think that he just wants money or just wants he thinks that that's all that counts but you see someone who's already doing something who's like you know hustling and really trying to make things work his commute is is like a pillar in their community and you think wow that person had resources they would just we have a name for those cats we call them impresarios and really what our job is to hunt them and find them yeah that's that's awesome that's exactly i totally agree with that like all you do is try to find good people and then the rest is gonna happen so we just started doing this in appalachia i don't want to talk about it i want to ask you one more question but i got to tell you in appalachia you know in america appalachia has tended to be one of the poverty zones throughout history so we started to do this in the states in the last year and the angle the angles exactly you can't really say this in appalachia hey this is just like africa nobody really wants to hear that because of all the other historical undertones involved racism and other things but my point is not really to say that they're the similar cultures obviously but the angles they're all the same angles they're out in angles like you talk about there's inside community outside community there's distrust and trust issue it's fascinating it's the same a little bit harder because you're so clearly an outsider in africa you know but same angles same angle so interesting i think it's awesome you're doing it in the us too i think yeah because there is there's a weird perception sometimes it's like i'm gonna go help those people in foreign countries that need help but it's like there are people in the u.s like you said that have some of the some of the same difficulties that you can find you know in war-torn countries or you know paralyzed by by years of dictatorship or whatever it is even though that's not the case in the u.s there are certain dysfunctions in certain communities that are that have been kind of generational and so that that can be that that you can help find the right like you said the sparks that are there and just kind of feed feed those sparks yeah yeah that's where we are we're trying you know we're trying to grow but above all all of these experiences have led me and and you know i was basically converted to christian orthodoxy by muslims it's a long story but but they're they're it's patterns again their pattern of life matched their words now don't get me wrong this doesn't mean they're all pious and you know close to allah but they did what they said they would do on friday and then they lived like that on saturday and then sunday they did their five prayers there was this i was just a young guy and i was like what is this and what i realized is my christianity in any given week was really strong on sunday at the you know listening to the lecture to the homily and then i kind of forgot about it made sure i would you know had a good full bank account and was going to college and then i would go church again there was no connection it wasn't an integrated pattern and when i came back from from africa i said do christians integrate where are those christians i went to a franciscan monastery and i spent a week and it's like okay this is cool and then let's put it this way i met a woman an ethiopian woman who said meet me at church it happened to be a russian church i walked in got yelled at by ayaya and loved it because she was like stand up i didn't know jonathan i was sitting down as the lit as the eucharist came out yeah she was like what are you doing in russian yelling at me and i was like this lady yelled at me i talked to the priest the priest said yeah we stand up before god i was like yeah we should do this for me in in two seconds it when when when you're pressed to try to give answers to folks outside of the orthodox community and you're pressed to try to understand you know who am i to them how do you how do you prepare the the conversation in a way that maybe it invites people in to the symbolism do you consciously think about this or is it in the end something that really it's coming out of you now through your reading and here's one more and who do you love to read and who brought you into this type of thinking in terms of books or teachers or yeah well i think that i definitely do think about it like i definitely think about it because i'm constantly faced with this world you know and i also went through the frustration in college of not knowing what to say and so i i remember i have a very distinct memory once where i had just finished college and i was i was living in a i was living with a friend in an apartment and and he had he had a friend who was like this post-modern you know activist really really just like a cliche of this like type of person it's like really kind of angry but but she was a great person like i really liked talking to her and she of all people came to me one day and she said i'm teaching this class and there's this young guy who grew up catholic who now is discovering science and he wants to completely reject everything he was taught and he's saying how stupid jesus and mary is and all this is all stupid and he said it's it's science it's science it's scientist science and she asked me she said what should i tell this guy like what should i answer she knew i was a christian you know and i had no answer i had no answer for her and i just looked at her blankly and i think i pointed her to some creationist thing or whatever and this was like when i was 19 or something and that memory and i remember that feeling of being there and her like sincerely saying i don't want this person you know even despite her own desire to kind of this kind of activist desire she could see that this person she didn't want him to throw everything away she's like she needs a way to reconcile himself with what he grew up with and she was she was there sincerely asking me this and all i could say was i don't know i don't know and so it's like since one of that's one of those moments where after that i was like that that can never happen again can never happen again and and then it was but it was really like what got me to thinking this way was actually partly the post-modern theory is i was reading who's who's kind of like a late marxist thinker he wrote a book called mythologies where he talks about patterns in social behavior and how social manifestations use mythological patterns but he was doing it to criticize it from like a marxist perspective but i was reading and i was like wow this is awesome these patterns that he's describing are really wonderful and i saw the same with jacques like jacques was using kind of pattern thinking and so it was weird it kind of broke my my my materialism and then i then i went more towards more traditional traditional authors like i read a traditionalist his name is people might know about i know him yeah in the 20s in my 20s and that was really helpful for me to break my modern the hold of the modern world like it just it shattered it and there was no turning back after reading the crisis of the modern world and then i started to look more towards the church fathers and saint gregory of nisa said from the maximus the confessor those are my key key theologians for symbolic thinking when you read the hymns of paradise or you read saint ephraim's hymns in general you find analogical and typological discussion there like thinking that is so powerful you know and applicable today if you exactly use it right yeah you need to tease it out and and i've noticed that too that sometimes i talk about saying ephraim or sam or saint gregory and the people tell me i read the book but i can't like i can't get what you're saying out of it and so so i realized there is some work to do and so you know i do like so i have put out a few lectures where i try to say okay here's here's the hymns of paradise and i'm going to try to help you understand what this means for today and what it means for the questions that are being asked but did you have those are the thinkers and my brother by the way that's really important i need to mention a lot of this was done in collaboration with my brother oh yeah he didn't become orthodox but who is symbolic thinker just you know an amazing symbolic thinker and he he wrote a book recently on symbolism that is just that's hard to beat in terms of kind of symbolic that book inspired one of our guys who was working in the field daniel patternos to write an article for for you guys it's a great wonderful article yeah and your brother did that though it lit him on fire man he has not stopped talking about your brother's book which is the language of creation for people who are watching it's definitely worth a read yeah thank you for that so i real quick and then i'm going to finish up but philip sherrard did much of that bridge work for me rape a man in nature or the eclipse of man in nature they changed it in some of the editions sarah from rose but philip cherard actually inspired not only the first thing stuff but even this podcast because that book what he does what he explains in terms of history and and really the the how this was it for me and you just described is how theology is real yeah it's real like it actually matters what's being said and he shows how it's united in history in terms of manifest like physical form and that whoa that flipped me yeah but the thing it's one it's we're in a great moment right now it's it's actually a really exciting moment because a lot of people are perceiving that and and a lot of the questions that are being asked in the different fields even the scientific field the philosophical fields are all related to the problem of how intelligence or how they use the word consciousness whatever how consciousness is how consciousness participates in the way reality lays itself out and it's like they've hit a wall with scientism and now they realize that intelligence is actually part of how reality exists and so but they don't know how to place it yet they have all these different theories they have different theories of emergence they have different theories like there's a mathematician named don hoffman who's trying to reformulate reality through mathematical formula based on levels of consciousness let's say and so so there's a lot of and this is he's getting massive funding from like scientific institutes this isn't like a woo-woo new wage thing these are these are real university types that are talking about this and asking asking all these questions and so if it's so it's a great moment because you realize no that's what the father's that's what say maximus is talking about yeah like that's these are the things that that's what logos is referring to it's like referring to the manner in which intelligence participates in the way the world lays itself out and how the human person as the the being with logos is a laboratory for things to join within him you know and so it's like we and so there is no world without man or at least it you can't conceive of it it's just potentiality or it's just like a quantum field or whatever you want to call it and so all of this is like it's happening now all these people are asking these types of questions and i'm seeing papers come out recently more and more of even people talking about say maximus or saying diet saying dionysus theopa guy and saying this is actually very relevant right now because of the questions asked in science weirdly scientific right yeah yeah it's intertwined with the with the rational theories the the theory the theorists are finding that it's already been said exactly you know and that's super interesting hey end the show with me but i gotta ask you to take our light-a-meter test on the way out will you do this with me sure sure so this happened this is the fifth episode if you guys want to go back and check it out you'll know what we're doing but i got a lot of feedback early on like what i don't know what you're talking about when you say new world because people are in it it's very hard to define what it is when you're in it and i said well it's sort of a type of being and thinking yaya yada yada and i said okay i'm going to create a test an exam that gives you a score that tells you where you are on the new world old world and i you know i got it from mit we we collaborated that's not true this is a series of dumb questions that are supposed to be fun let me ask you is that cool all right all right go for it so you're gonna answer three two one three three is yes a fully 100 you know gut feel yes i agree two is something like maybe sounds good but and one is that i'm pretty much sure that's not true zero is a total rejection three top end zero total rejection two probably true one not probably true we cool three two one zero then we're gonna add it up and then it's going to be science jonathan that's right let's see it's gonna happen so here we go when you die question one when you die you really probably won't die all the way you'll be something like a sleep three oh yeah two probably one probably not say i would say one one okay one i'm gonna i'm gonna record your scores because otherwise we'll forget okay so one jonathan pageau is answering a one the best way to get to know me question two is to ask someone else about me i would say one again one best way to know jonathan is to ask someone one the when i carry a picture of my friend or my a parent or some image of a person close to me and maybe in my wallet or i put it on my wall the person is actually closer to me they're they're close to me in a way that they're not when there's not a picture of them in the room three i would say i would say two two okay excellent respect jonathan it's very scientific don't forget this respect isn't earned it's owed to you by others sorry it's owed to you but sorry it's owed by you to others respect isn't earned it's owed by you to others okay it's owed by me to others to others you don't earn someone doesn't walk in and earn it you owe it to others to others respect i would say [music] i would say two two two so just real quick we're one one two two here's your last question so what what's your number right now one one two two four six here's your last question you have kids and are your are your parents still with us yes okay so i hope you jonathan hope to and expect to take care of your parents and have them live on the premises with you as you get as they get deeply into old age you are hoping and this is a good thing to have them in your house say as they get older three two one yeah i would say three three okay three so that goes one two three four five six nine would you like to know what you are on our wall sure okay you are not the charlemagne that means your full retro you think old world style big time you drink from a goblet there's a chance you own pre-columbian handmade weapons of some sort you are not the charlemagne that would be 15. you're not the villager that's a really good chance you hate malls you are welcome to places like algeria you're not a villager okay but you are a suburban very very scientific yes what was your number again nine i guess that's what it was i wasn't counting yeah eight to eleven you feel romantic about the old world jonathan but hierarchy is a word that you'd rather read about in a book that's hilarious it feels like you should want to obey your elders a lot more than you actually do that's probably true actually and the individual is not more important than the group except well sometimes you feel more important than lots of dumb groups that's right oh man that's actually pretty that's pretty head-on it's actually pretty good because it's good because i know it's like i know one of the reasons why i talk about some of this stuff is also because i'm trying to convince myself because i'm i'm a very modern person and i have all the bad habits of the of a modern person and it's like i struggle to be in communities but i know that and it's like the mo the times that i've successfully been in communities are i've been very vivifying to me but i do tend to i do have that individualist pull so that's actually probably pretty good it's a it's kind of damning but it's pretty good i scored a nine just like you oh wow that's awesome i thought i was gonna be my sister came in at like 15. she's the highest scoring of all times and my brother was on this show and did it too and he was he was the villager he was a pretty old school but that was cool you took that with us so now we have jonathan pedro score so brother follow us would you and share this with your your peeps and we'll do the same on this end and keep going man i do think you'd i find you to be doing like i said you're teaching us and you're a type of missionary so thanks and i've heard like i have so many people that have been just saying wonderful things about the podcast and you know and the foundation i think the type of work you're doing is the best kind of work in terms of international aid and helping other it's just it's the best way to do it so i really appreciate to find orthodox people working that way yeah man i just people listening i did not know jonathan that you live that way and i knew you went to africa and that was going to be one of our subjects but you you i don't know if you go read our website if you get it you literally were speaking the admissions name it was kind of weird actually i don't think you were reading it but no i don't think i've read it yeah it was beautiful man so that's great maybe that's where we're coming we were having this connection but this connection yeah all right brother so thank you we'll talk to you again soon and have a have a have a really good day man and good weekend welcome back into your house yeah thanks i appreciate it all right all the best okay peace out bye
