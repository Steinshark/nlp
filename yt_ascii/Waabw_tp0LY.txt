when i got roped into hosting an intel extreme upgrade i thought i'd just be building a computer but unfortunately no it's for time in here one of our creator warehouse engineers so it's not just a computer but it's a hardline water cooled computer using freaking copper tubing look at this this is the hardest way to build a computer why did you do this to me not only that this is a capacitor with enough energy to not just murder you but throw you across the room because he built a freaking forge you touch anything in here you literally die this is for melting steel to make swords this is terrifying why have you done this because intel let me thank you intel for sponsoring this video [music] before we get to your new computer i want to take a look at your old one because a pretty major part of the series is the host invades your space plus do that what's your computer look like oh good don't mind the dumpster fire i stepped on a screw there's a lot of crap in here timing yes it's like a fractal pattern the closer you look at my piles of the more is in there amazing oh yeah i'm upgrading it ah so that's why you need the forge one of the long list of reasons yes i'm guessing this at one point in time was a 3d printer yep that was a makerbot that died a sad death and you're just holding on to the stepper motors i guess makes sense do you have a wheel this is supposed to go to my dad at some point but i haven't gotten around to sending it yet i saw that you don't have a chair i sit in all kinds of fun and weird positions on this thing one of the classics is like super wide sure especially when all of the stuff was in here and i had literally no space and like oh this so it's from harman carmen and their smart assistant no longer exists i tried to turn it into a dumb spot it just didn't work razor blaze just chilling cool cool everything is fine what's your computer is that like a 1080 or something no that's actually a titan oh like a maxwell yeah it's not new but oh boy does it still work pretty damn well maxwell's kind of starting to show its age like most stuff is good and then sometimes there's like new accelerators and it's just like nope dice all of the dice a lot of dice ewp yeah that's my partner's band i'm making a nice little logo for them that lights up and looks all swanky also over here i don't think the camera's seen this yet there's a whole drum set which i think is also your partners because she's way cooler than you this is an old-timey scale this is my grandfather's is was was my grandfather's so i'm gonna i'm gonna clean it all up and give it a nice new lease on life it's very well built all right let's build a pc i want to do that let's get this case down and start actually building this because it will take a while yeah how much of this do you have pre-done an amount [applause] oh there might be loose stuff in there yeah it'll be a problem it's fine for the case time went with the o11 dynamic from lee and lee evo it's kind of at this point sort of like the the basic cases because everyone uses it but also that's because it's a fantastic case it's for the motherboard you know it's the mag z690 tomahawk from msi ddr4 why did you choose that i started this build quite a long time ago and ddr5 was really expensive and really hard to get at the time and this is a very nice motherboard particularly when you pair it with a nice little 12 700k so this has 12 cpu cores eight performance cores four efficiency cores and it's the k model which means that whether it's e690 motherboard and a custom motor cooling solution this thing's gonna freaking rip for the cpu block we have the ek quantum velocity squared you can make such beautiful stuff yeah they really do ek 360 rad this thing is a beast and apparently it is missed but special that's really cool particularly when there's a copper later with this yeah how much did you spend on fittings for this i think all of the water cooling stuff is like a grand and a half ah ish around we have crucial ballistics this is 3200 which is kind of slow but also these micron chips are known to be really good overclockers or you can just do what i do and never worry about memory overclocking because it's a stability nightmare probably that one do you want to first get the basics of the water cooling in i know how to water cool a pc that's super easy sounds like a plan to me what's not so easy is you bought this wonderful sony 7.1.2 sound bar which i imagine works really well how do you plan on attaching this to your wall over there or more so you are attaching this to your wall i don't want to do that where are the other speakers so that it is a standalone unit it can have subs it says 7.1.2 it has subs built into it that are up firing as well subs someone here clearly knows about sound like this right here looks like a good setup yes did you like ask anyone anyway do it do it these blocks are such a pain in the ass because you screw them from the back so you have to just like hold it bk has such a fun combination of incredibly well thought out easy things and incredibly difficult very high skill things for storage tie them with a 980 down she goes with the samsung 980 pro fantastic drive pcie gen 4 so if direct storage ever actually becomes a thing it'll be all good to go if you are buying storage right now i have heard that intel optane drives are really freaking cheap while they're trying to sell them all that's just a pro tip for you oh the way that they did the milling on this is so good like not only did they route out the bits in here but they also added designs with it was rgb in it yes yeah along the side that probably catches all of these two that's gonna look so good this is the part where i don't know if it's actually going to fully work or not yet what yeah there's a fun complication for that coming soon oh i see yep yeah that's a that's just a hard connection right now yeah buddy so now we're paying for my mistakes okay we're good well you did it i looked on the pre-builds i did i did leak test everything except for this really jank fitting so fingers crossed is anything going here so option number one is a mirrored piece of acrylic option number two a butchered mesh front panel oh that was an adventure let's go for the mirror unfortunately we didn't get this from star forge there's no digging balls to go there it's not a dick was so mad i know it's so funny a lot of things that look phallic that there's a baseball bat he just ranges like no no it's just a hammer it's like thor's hammer upside down it has nothing to do with a dick no to drink balls and it's not definitely just like helping our publicity here if you want this to be a dick you have to try to make it the forest gpu time has gone with an rtx 3080 for the win ultra from evga rep f this is the same graphics card that i have it's fantastic i absolutely love it and the dog is interested as well here's the actual gpu oh you didn't go for acrylic you went for the pure acetyl it looks sick also blocking this thing was a nightmare these gpus go really fast too when you water cool them you don't even have to like overclock it or anything it just sees the thermal headroom and just freaking goes i absolutely love it when motherboards have the pre-installed io shields because then you can't forget to install it but there also is the problem that their tolerances sometimes stack our problem here is i currently have our i o shield lined up and although the iron shield looks good we're about a quarter inch off on the screw holes here here's how you do this now we just it's a it makes the whole thing stronger okay it's like a rebar in a building where you have to pre-stress it now your motherboard's pre-stressed so your entire chassis is all just way more stiff now before i worry too much about getting all of the water cooling in there and having tubes in my way i'm going to worry about cable management which is where this guy comes in this is the c sonic prime 1300 now this is just incredibly overkill which is much better than what other people like andy and james did where they had their power supplies explode titan's gone the other way and i'd say you're being kind of wasteful buying this but we're pretty clearly not making a price to performance machine anyway i prefer to just have a power supply that is good and overspect so i don't have to worry about it and i've always done that for all my builds you can also thief tall bolts off of it for your project i definitely have done that oh wow this got heavy fast would you like a hand nope bye i'm taking a stab at putting some holes in the acrylic plate so we can attach it to the case and not just have it floating around like one mr cotton balls company i swore to god it's fine it only went through the things that didn't matter it wasn't even tight i have i have a fun i have a fun note here i have cable not cables oh yeah oh my god okay so let's just i'll just think logically about this for a second does it need to be this long your first problem was assuming that i was logical about any part of this build i also got a couple of different gpu cables because i wasn't sure which gpu i was gonna get the good news is the inch and a half that's on this side will look pretty good what yeah that checks out if you happen to have cable ties or zip ties or anything of that nature somewhere i'm a very organized person found them do you have more we're out row before i got too deep into cable management we should add the fans in fortunately these fans have excellent cable management built in they have just these contacts on them so instead of having to run you know rgb and fan power for every single one you just do that for one of them and then they just slept together something like [music] something like that cable management is nearly done and here is where having this much cable is going to become a little bit of an issue oh my gosh my fallback was i'd want i'd rather have too much cable than not enough cable but i may have gone too far hooray for having the second power supply space because otherwise we'd be boned okay i think we are ready to begin the water cooling bit of this but before we do that i want to talk about what we did yesterday this is an induction heater or an induction forge it takes power out of the wall pumps it through a whole bunch of stuff and then on the other side can get steel or other metals red hot or potentially melt them with enough power for very obvious reasons we are not going to be using this in heinen's one-bedroom apartment no so instead we are no longer in china's apartment and instead in the workshop this thing is legitimately very terrifying these capacitors right here they're they're fine you can you can touch them it's i wouldn't yeah don't could you can this guy it won't just murder you it will send you across the room as it murders you how why why not let's have a look at what you've built here over the past one five six months six months oh this thing's actually terrifying there's a lot going on this particular capacitor i had to buy from israel oil this is their smallest one of their smallest versions it can handle the entire power service to the lab oh so that's like considerably more than like the transformer we have for this entire building this is also extremely high frequency so how does an induction heater work i put this piece of steel into this and it gets hot but why one thing in metals their electrons don't like moving around quickly or switching directions what this does is kick kicks them back and forth really fast intel powering your dreams so how many volts are we talking here it's something in the neighborhood of like 200 amps and could potentially resonate up to like 400 volts depending on how it works out so it's more the amps that are yeah having a fun time not the voltage yeah exactly i'm not worried about it capping out really really quickly but this capacitor needs to be cooled that's cooled just by this soldered on piece of copper tube currently yes all right so that is all hooked up and hopefully won't leak water right next to all of the high power electronics i would probably recommend plugging into two different circuits for what we're doing right now it's fine i have the breaker which is currently on i have this switch which is now on so now this is a don't touch anything in here moment this power supply its entire job is to run the fans pump and the control electronics i have it hooked up to another more different switch on the front that is what actually turns on the main driving board and that's what starts everything going i also have a nice display on the front which you can't read if you're outside of the horrifically awful viewing angle so should we try and melt something all right she's on i have no idea how much power it's drying i should probably be in a different place but it's fine it's not heating up a whole lot it's at like 30 degrees right now this thing has an adjustable frequency and ideally it's matched to this coil i'm pretty sure it's not so you turn that potentiometer that changes the frequency and hopefully matches this how do you know when it's matched when it pulls a lot of current at a given voltage ah so we're just looking for oh holy sh okay what it peaked at like 16 amps or something very quickly another fun thing about breakers if you hit them right at the number they're rated for they take a really long time to blow so i think we found the spot i'm awake now yeah that's that's working a lot better yeah it's now at a lower voltage and drawing more than twice as much current no it's over 100 now that's that's getting very hot very fast it looks like 120 okay i need to and it's smoking oh yeah we have problems oh that's really hot now uh-huh that's at a 346 degrees that's a kind of terrifying all right actually i'm gonna just hit that because we can do something really dumb plug it into the router will this blow up it may break but if it breaks it did its job so this is where we start treading into unproven grounds oh you haven't tested this i actually tested that the capacitors weren't going to be over volted they will not blow up however this part i have not tested it's not going to be very exciting at the first little bit i don't think hopefully all right i'm gonna turn on mr fleer what just happened it's fine everything is fine these are really big capacitors when i plugged it in there's enough power going into this then it sparked it's a good thing we have the safety tape on there the editor don't use this but i am the one that assembled this chord it's not rated for this do you see how bright this light is in alex's defense this cable is fine because it's a current limit the dangerous part is the fact this is a standard north american outlet nothing did happen hooray that's a win okay you get 291 volts which means what well when you rectify it out oh it's peak to peak it's about a 2x delta and a voltage i have no idea how that's going to scale with how much current this thing pulls my goal here was to blow the breaker here and not on the wall this breaker dies i don't care the one in the wall dies we need to call an electrician don't replace your own breakers i thought you're supposed to put aluminum foil in there no it's a penny that's why they stopped giving you pennies in canada no do not do that so you want us to have eye protection and you described a face shield why i don't know what's gonna happen if this works way better than i think it's going to and this deal just gets ridiculously hot really quickly i just don't want to risk it oh that's a lot oh yeah oh my lord it's already smoking 200. wow that's going up fast it is drawing 11 amps 11 amps 200 volts 400 degrees celsius by the way we're not using stupid american units i'm also going to just have a little gander at the yeah it's at'0 degrees right now it's smoking mmm that smells awful can we just air cool it like if we just put a server fan right here do you think it would oh it would definitely help i mean my actual solution six of them instead what's happening here is i'm just pushing way too much power through it and it's generating a ton of losses inside of it in the form of heat that is a fix for me later learning time the reason you don't poke around in power supplies and you hear this from everybody is capacitors hold charge for a while so if i turn this on the fuse blows that's fun why did that happen that's the voltage across the capacitors it's not connected anymore oh that's why people say do not open up power supplies because a lot of them will actually have voltages close to this high in them in general when i touch things i don't want to get launched i don't know what i would want to touch less in here i would touch the fan our toroid is currently at 114 degrees with the help of blowing metron oh my god it's dropping but it's not dropping fast honestly i was hoping that it would cool it down a little bit better than that but i think we should still run it when i plug this in it's hot which means we're gonna have spark exciting i hate it okay hopefully that worked 291 volts okay beautiful cool we've removed all bunch of the safety stuff i'm not as concerned about lighting myself on fire so that's good and on oh yep that gets off pretty fast it tends to be pretty quick right at the start and then once it hits a certain temperature of like glowing red hot it'll skyrocket again it's drawing 1400 watts wow the bar is over 500 now hey the power is going up now two kilowatts holy shiza balls 16 amps 17 amps'. yeah you might want to turn it off it was drawing 24 amps the bottom of the toroid is really freaking hot discolored 160 degrees which is concerning for sure it's hot but the bottom where the fan isn't getting is 250. oh wow oh nope that's 100 the epoxy coating yep that is that's a lot of smoke that is just the epoxy turning black thank you pass tire and alex let's water cool a computer this thing still smells like smoke by the way it's one thing you have to remember about hard line tubing is that it's heard as with most of these runs it's designed to theoretically be simple the good news is since it's all running away so that the tubes can't really come out he doesn't have to worry as much about the tubes coming out and leaking because they physically cannot one thing we forgot to do before we put the fill thing here we probably should have pressure tested it yes also do you have distilled water no oh no this is what the uk stops for it's fine oh wow look at this oh it fits that's such a good fit is it too good of a fit no it's a perfect fit oh i'm actually legitimately surprised that there was not any water spillage just now okay we probably don't want to turn on the system or do we care that much we don't but we also don't have another power supply and i don't think this is gonna leak oh my god that looks so good oh that sounds so terrible yeah it's a bunch of air in the pump yeah that doesn't sound right on the right side i have another one oh nice if it's if it's moving for the time being i don't care oh this is empty maybe with a pwm it won't be as bad no nothing is like actually spinning wait how did we hook that up wait yeah what wait hey is this one on yes i'm guessing we need this for your fans which means for you to control rgb on them you probably need to plug in this guy my payoff is just that it looks pretty it doesn't need to work don't hold these for a little bit oh people are always so scared about getting water in their computers that's fine yes i have spilled non-trivial amounts of water in this monstrosity what about we take that piece of acrylic out wipe it and then put it back in so many things to get fingerprints on them that is good enough cool all right now we get to move this beast i'm gonna remove a dog door there definitely wasn't 15 things in the way getting this pc in here that's good it would have been pretty inconvenient if there's 15 things in what yeah kick a chair kick a ball it's fine how it's really sharp yeah we're supposed to test this pc but i have a question why is there a door behind your door to have the drum kit functional there i had to remove both of them you'll notice that that door could not close it's also inconveniently covering the electrical panel in here so i really don't want to blow any breakers it's fine foreign we have one fan spinning oh that's fun that's fun turns out you just have to install their software do you want to do the peels oh hell yeah oh you didn't put the screw in i forgot that yeah i have to say though this is a fantastic looking computer like of all the intel upgrade ones i think this is the best was also a tremendous pain in the ass yeah there's no way i don't want this but i'm very happy it exists can you not wait to have 15 of your cpu just get used to play rgb software and they ask you to install norton no [music] [applause] thank you [music] before we close this out i want to go listen to your soundbar i don't know if we told you but he lost the mount for it so that's why it's not on the wall thank you the dog is very curious about this handbar there's definitely a difference for the max max base yeah but it sounds so much better when it's on mid max is like do you have motion smoothing on yes i do i can't believe this this guy works with linus tech tips what the hell please help your friends turn off motion smoothing your build's fantastic your other build's terrifying i like your dog thank you intel also go check out the floatplane exclusive where there's lord knows too much stuff that i spent building all of this crap hit like get subscribed and if you want to watch something else maybe watch i don't know i guess my intel upgrade sure
