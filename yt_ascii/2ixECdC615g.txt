japan is an island by the sea filled with volcanoes and it's beautiful beautiful like this japanese workstation pc with its bone white steel chassis hot swap hard drive drawer and built-in gpu stabilizer such elegance and grace could only come from a well-known gaming system manufacturer like epson sure they used to make pcs i mean who could forget such classics as the action note apex or geneva but epson stopped building personal computers back in 1996 when their celebrity spokesman was still getting confused for sinbad so how is it that in 2023 i am standing next to this brand new epson desktop it seems that while epson does make all the things that we know them for here in the west in their home country they are all over the road there's not only epson laptops and desktops but also epson watches accounting software and even anime all of that stuff is there and this is here and this raises a lot of questions like is it any good does it refuse to work when the cyan tank runs dry and with pc gaming on the rise in japan can it game oh and also who's our sponsor build redux build redux builds fully customizable gaming pcs suitable for any budget pick your favorite games and see how they perform with the online pc builder it's so easy head to the link below and create your new rig today right out of the gate the included keyboard and mouse are nothing special in true epson fashion it includes laser printing of course they're referring to the laser printing on the keycaps which includes not only roman characters but also what i assume are japanese ones i don't know i don't read japanese what i do read is this fantastic label on the mouse which is the worst thing i've ever seen this is the sm9023 from light on that's the whole review which is fine because the main star of the show is the epson endeavor pro which is kind of like saying acer aspire or asus rog given that they've been using this name so long so the specific model we're looking at is just on this little nondescript sticker right here the first thing that stands out to me about which is the rigidity of the chassis i don't think i've seen anything like this in the last 15 years sure it's not made of the you know latest trendy materials like aluminum but dang it this thing is built like a freaking tank that's not the only thing that reminds me of 15 years ago though check this out five and a quarter inch bays not one but two and it gets even better a three and a half inch bay are you kidding me it has a lock for the power switch this is how my parents kept me from gaming that's how they thought they kept me from gaming i actually had a cute everything about this design is so retro i wouldn't even expect to find usb 3 ports on the front of it and yet here we are okay i'm me oh what shut up it has an actual optical drive in it can't believe i paid real money for an optical drive in 2023. did we buy this oh yeah of course we did yeah oh good and we imported it but in japan that might not seem that outlandish and there are a couple of reasons for this japan made headlines recently for their efforts to finally phase out floppy disks in an effort to reduce bureaucratic waste so as a machine that can be used for business or a workstation for game development for example this could easily find its way into an office that still keeps a lot of data on disk or even worse diskette older home users with disk-based backups would also find it useful for the same reason and even for those without backups optical drives may still have some alert as video rental stores are not uncommon there geo a chain of video rental stores had nearly a thousand locations at the end of 2022 when you consider that one in five apartments in tokyo are less than 200 square feet and the average house is less than half the size of its american counterpart it's not unreasonable to conclude that there are a lot of people who could have an entertainment center or a desktop pc but not both so with an optical drive in your pc even if you don't have an entertainment center you can still watch the latest blockbuster videos you picked up on a two-day rental from the local geo half expecting to find ps2 ports no not so much okay about as sophisticated as ncix was in terms of branding of individual machines probably the most interesting thing back here is this he goes not much to write home about in terms of cable management there epson that actually was our fault well that's our fault yeah yeah it was cable managed just fine did they wrap the cpu fan around this eight pin connector because in shipping if this gets jostled around it can pull out that connector so that's a bad idea the power supply is a 650 watt non-modular unit from delta with a single 120 millimeter cooling fan the cpu is a ryzen 5600x but can be configured with up to a 5950x very high end case fan seems to use a bit of an unusual mount comes to us courtesy of manibia mitsumi fun fact mitsumi who later merged with manibia to create its current form was the company that made the controllers for the ness the snes and several others this fan appears to be a very similar 120 by 38 millimeter fan like you would find in many older dell optiplex units but with just the standard three pin power connector instead of dell's non-standard 5 pin these thicker fans are great for applications where high static pressure is necessary like against radiators or restrictive fan grills not that this is a particularly restrictive drill what i want to take a closer look at here is our gpu and more importantly our gpu support bracket these were commonplace in server chassis back in the late 90s and early 2000s but have made their way out of fashion somehow in spite of the fact that gpus have gotten heavier and heavier as the years have gone by you'll still find these in tier 1 systems or puget systems for example manufactures their own out of laser cut acrylic but this is really robust i would actually be confident putting a modern heavy gpu in this thing knowing that it is not going to come loose in shipping this is great i guess we'll find out how well it works when we upgrade our gpu after because as you guys can see i didn't exactly go with a top spec gaming gpu out of the box don't touch i love the a the times it matters when it's spinning you won't be able to read it anyway and even if you could i suspect many people in japan wouldn't read english like it should probably be in japanese right i could be wrong this is a gt 1030 which is five years old and not a good gpu as we discussed in our surprisingly recent review of it but it's not the only gpu that the endeavor pro can be equipped with in fact it can be ordered with up to a 3080 ti 4500 workstation card for professional workloads but rather than pay a huge markup we figured we would just swap in a more powerful gpu on this side of the pacific fun fact by the way epson's configurator is pretty rudimentary if you select a 3080 ti it won't automatically upgrade you to the 1000 watt power supply option a 650 watt unit should handle this card but i would strongly recommend the thousand watt unit if you want to be safer in the long run yeah what you're going to do well this how's this going to fit in there though because we're going to move these up and down oh wish me luck good luck to myself now that's weird last time i checked epson also doesn't make motherboards how suspicious my first thought was they just put a sticker on there but that's not actually what happened it appears to have been silk screened on at the same factory that did all the other printing on the motherboard i mean this is clearly an asus prime b550 plus motherboard but it's been rebranded for epson curiously the model number has also been changed are they trying to make it harder to track down the original part number for some reason but then if they're doing that why go to the extra steps of rebranding it if they aren't also going to change the lettering on the chipset heatsink which still says prime series on it hey pause the drive motherboard screws how about that we had so many requests for posit drive bits for the ltt screwdriver presumably from people in japan i guess can confirm phillips head works fine-ish maybe the answer lies with the intel version of this tower available in a stylish blue rather than red so you can show off your preferred processor brand is the motherboard from that an asus rebrand as well unfortunately we don't have that one on hand i didn't feel like paying another two thousand dollars plus shipping to get one oh that one's four thousand four thousand yep anyway what we did manage to do is track down a review of it that includes a plethora of pictures at pc.watch.impress.com.jp it's an x 299 chipset system with eight ram slots a pci connector and two ps2 ports on the i o it's also screen printed blue something that gigabyte might do but there's no x299 motherboard on the market that we can find that matches the shape io and the inclusion of a legacy pci slot to say nothing of the color so what the heck is going on here well if you've been building pcs for a while the model numbers on these motherboards might seem familiar not the numbers themselves but the font in the 2000s nearly every asus motherboard featured this font slowly over the course of the late 2000s and early 2010s it was phased out of asus's retail boards this could be attributed to a corporate restructuring that asus went through sometime in 2007-2008 the organization split with asus's branded offerings remaining with asus while their divisions for oem parts and case fabrication were spun off to a separate company called pegatron ironically pegatron would later end up buying asrock which itself was also spun off from asus but back in 2002 very inbred these dell motherboards and these hp motherboards feature the pegatron font and are as far as we can tell made by pegatron it's probably not a stretch then to a assume that this case and any other parts not branded epson are also pegatron if you're wondering whether asus is aware that pegatron is rebranding their retail motherboard designs we emailed them to ask about how the devil all of that works and at the time of filming we were still awaiting a response though awaiting is a word that i'm using pretty loosely here because i'm not expecting them to comment on it every time i've asked them about the history with asrock for example they've just kind of gone let me get back to you and then never gotten back to me it's pretty safe to assume that they do know about all of this though given that they have drivers on their website for this model number albeit with very little additional information oh look at that she's level boys oh i like it laugh at the antiquated approach all you want but that gpu is not flipping going anywhere and i don't even have the pci screws in yet look at this i love it this is not a cheap chassis in spite of the fact that it kind of looks like crap and it's not painted black and doesn't have any rgb this is like solid never deviate from your principles here epson this is awesome so level i could eat my dinner on the back of this 3080 ti cook at first too while we're in here i'm gonna upgrade it with some more memory we ordered the bare minimum eight gigs because i also didn't feel like paying their markup for system memory so let's go ahead and throw some more ramen hey not bad huh it's not particular hey no i don't want that i don't know about these i no i want to use these these came with my gaming pc yeah you ever you ever tried to use a japanese keyboard with with a us layout no oh my god the space bar is fragmented oh this facebook no the spacebar is tiny the rest of those are our keys for other things well i know i know i know i just mean it's in three pieces okay i have a short shift which i can tolerate i hate this enter that space bar though wow can i even yeah well no it's kind of yeah that's kind of where i would hit it most of the time no i should be okay okay just make sure that you change the keyboard layout i mean it's not quality that's for sure i mean it's possible but i shouldn't have been able to do that oh hold on yeah look at that we bent it back right i realized we never talked about the hot swap drive phase in the front these are awesome each of them is just wired up individually to the motherboard so you don't need a complicated backplane or port multiplier or anything like that you just load a drive onto one of these pop it in i wouldn't say that these were popular in the mid-2000s over here but they were certainly more broadly available and it was mostly due to cost that case manufacturers didn't implement them where's my start menu at hello buddy is this their os like did they load this on yes okay did they remove my bloody start menu or like no that's supposed to have a start menu it had a start menu when i left the other building okay cool yeah let's just give it the old the old one two here for a stupid gamery case it's not that bad it's kind of you know classy and i have some hope that that thick 120 mil fan is going to manage to remove the heat from this gpu there's an intake right next to the gpu's cooling fans that i think might help wait that's the boot hard drive yeah yeah we were trying to save costs this doesn't have a bloody ss oh my god you guys are doing the wag hoodie photo shoot hey there we go it booted up just fine this time also i am not having any trouble with this keyboard i will have you know yet where's my tildee you might also have some keys not line up with what they say on the keyboard if you haven't changed the keyboard over to japanese layout no no i got this i got this i don't know it just says standard keyboard okay good luck bottom right corner beside the clock no no i'm good i got this you only have f1 hold on hold on this is the part we're missing oh give me one second oh we're missing something yeah oh we always put our steam games on hey steam drive and there's a no type no front type c that didn't even occur to me yeah that's not the most modern thing oh balls to be clear this is a fairly small problem but a problem nonetheless it is 2023 and i just bought a computer with a mechanical boot drive what yeah it's better than the craptastic ones that we got with the sports team branded mice like i mean i managed to do that i don't even know what the objective is right now oh this is just team deathmatch oh my god it's 15 to nothing right now this is not quiet it's that big back fan that chunky fan in the back is definitely contributing 71 degrees on the gpu though 63 degrees on the cpu while it's not the quietest system i've ever encountered it's not ridiculously loud either and the temps are well under control wow you could warm your hands on this maybe toast some marshmallows i mean with all the exhaust focused in one place and that's without even the highest end cpu that we could configure not that you can configure anything at the moment as of filming this unit was actually discontinued two days ago but that doesn't mean that epson is done updating their desktop offerings it looks like they might be gearing up to revamp their amd machines probably with ryzen 7000. we're going to have a link down below but please note they only ship domestically how much do they ship domestically well at least enough to justify a custom motherboard i guess and pc gaming in japan has been going through a bit of a boom recently doubling in size in just four years by some accounts also our machine handled a high-end gpu like a champ even with that 650 watt power supply our 3080 made it through a stress test in our environmental chamber at 20 degrees celsius room temperature with no notable thermal issues now that doesn't mean i'm necessarily recommending that you buy one of these the amd version like this one starts at 226 000 yen or roughly 1675 dollars with specs that are not great as for the intel one it starts at 360 000 yen or roughly 26.75 also not great but pc parts have typically been more expensive in japan and epson does offer on-site repair for very cheap like really cheap as low as 34 dollars a year for up to to six years you have to be within japan's five most populated islands but that covers ninety nine percent of the population just like 99 of our videos end in a segway to our sponsor squarespace it's 2023 and your brand or business needs an online
