the press release the future of software should be memory save straight from the white house okay hot tub category when not today all right leaders in industry support white house call to address root cause of many of the worst cyber attacks washington today the white house office of the national cyber director w released a report calling on the technical community to proactively reduce the attack service in cyber space once makes the case that technology manufacturers can prevent an entire class of vulnerabilities from entering the digital ecosystem by adopting memory safe programming languages w is also encouraging the research community to address the problem of software measurability to enable the development of better diagnostics that measure cyber security quality i'm pretty sure we just got we just did we just get rust is this a hascal endorsement or a rust endorsement which one which one i can't tell is this hcll or rust rip c c is definitely out the window 100% rust this is 100% rust zig's pretty safe though yeah o i think oam falls largely under the safety side of things elixir javascript it's definitely javascript it's actually javascript that's the most memory safe i would i mean is is this like an anti-c article cc++ article like real talk like when you really think about it javascript is inherently safer than c cuz you can't really it's very difficult to do like a memory attack in c or in in javascript i'm not even sure if it's possible i'm sure there's something i haven't thought of i'm sure there's something that can be done that's wild but like we don't see it you can yeah i mean i know you can do like rex's expansion attacks and you can do some like two large buffers to make the the thing crash but that's not necessarily memory attack in js is called chrome i just had a chrome notification by the way by the way i use i use chrome by the way just so you guys know and just in case you're wondering that was that was me on windows okay the report is titled back to the building blocks a path toward secure and measurable software i'm more curious about this second one honestly like is it surprising that we should write more of our critical infrastructure in a language like rust probably not like you know i can understand why operating systems want to gravitate towards a language like rust right i think zig is a more fun and more interesting language that i think is better in almost in a lot of different ways but it also isn't as safe as rust despite the fact you can technically do a buffer overflow in rust that one that one super cool repo shows how you can do it so i like i get this why this should exist but like all sofware i have a hard time believing that all software should be and then second how do you make measurable right like if technically if you knew how to measure it wouldn't you know all the problems well then how do you measure it right like how would you measure something that's what i'm struggling with because fuzzers yeah but you're still measuring it like yeah it could pass this level of stuff i'm mind blown right now yeah i mean that's the that's what's kind of difficult for me is that i'm trying to figure out a tape measure maybe a tape measure but like real talk like how do you measure the software quality well you can say it passes this level of fuzzers sure but is that i mean do we really need a research community to come out with that two inches is enough i know i keep hearing that we as a nation have the ability and the responsibility to reduce the attack surface in cyers space and prevent an entire class of security bugs from entering the digital ecosystem but that means we need to tackle the hard problem of moving to memory safe programming languages what are other languages i i want to know what he means by this right said the national cyber security harry coker thanks to the work of our once team and some tremendous collaboration from technical community and our public and private sector partners the report released today outlines the threat and opportunity available to us as we move forward or as we move toward the future where softer is memory safe and secure by design the nsa mentioned java and c in a similar memo a few months back okay so so it sounds like this is largely a move move away from something like c++ i think is what how how we should probably read this is that this is don't use languages that are inherently easy to oopsy daisy things oh they do mention okay they will mention it later on i'm also pleased that we are working with and calling on the academic community to help us solve another hard problem how do we develop better diagnostics to measure cyber security quality addressing these challenges is imperative to ensuring that we can secure our digital ecosystem long-term and protect the secur of our nation i like i i actually really am on the team that as a nation and as like a government producing software you should pro like i'm not a okay i have two problems two problems one the first thing is that i think as a nation it'd be good to have the most secure form of software so can i can i buy that they should just write it in rust and prevent a whole slew of attacks you know i'm i'm on that team but i also was alive when obamacare website was launched and it was single-handedly just like just like the the the worst website in the universe so do i have any confidence that the government can solve this problem i don't know like real talk it was a disaster like disaster is kind of an understatement mr mr bobby tables over here telling us all about it like real talk it was skill issues and so so so when you put those two thoughts together you must you must remember like do we want the government attempting to write software in rust like how how many billions of dollars is it going to cost for them to make anything just real talk like how many billions of dollars are we talking about just to write anything at least seven bill it's a good point it's a good point it's that that's my worry is that the the ineptitude mixed with a language that by its very purpose is extremely difficult to be proficient in like you mix those two things together i i'm worried we got like a billion dollars for a hello world project like that's research that's research r&d all the way saying the gov made it will make it worse i know just by the very nature r&d tax right off by adopting an engineering forward approach to policymaking once is ensuring that technical communities expertise is reflected in how the federal government approaches these problems creators of software and hardware can have an outsized impact on the nation's shared security by factoring cyber security outcomes into the man manufacturing process okay okay some of the most infamous cyber let's see some of the most infamous cyber events in history the morris worm mother that mother worm the slammer worm by the way i got hit hard by the slammer worm i'm not going to lie to you the slammer worm i got i got taken to pound town by the slammer worm can we all can we all pour one out for the slammer worm the heart bleed vulnerability in 2014 the trident exploit of 2016 the blast pass exploit of 2023 were headlines grabbing cyber attacks that caused real world damage to the systems that societies rely on every day these worms i know real talk underlying all of them is a common root cause c++ can we just be real here can we just say c do we have to save memory safety vulnerabilities can we just can we stop dancing around it and just call can we call a spade a spade why does this once person sound like they're from whoville for 35 years memory safety vulnerabilities have plagued the digital ecosystem you call me whatever you like okay baby but it doesn't have to be this way says aan rajan assistant national cyber director for technology security damn that is like think about that that's the cdts i mean that's a name that's a name right there this report was created for engineers by engineers because we know they can make the architecture and design decisions about the building blocks they consume i don't know if you guys ever heard this but i think it was called the rule of six is it called the rule of six obamacare website right there there's this dang it there's there's a podast somewhere i know i could find it i could find it again but it's called the rule of six where the person who helped fix the website said that on average he had to go down six levels to find out anyone who knew what was actually going on i i can find it i'll try to link it but it's like it's very very funny that's like for anything to actually work required huge amount of levels so when i hear something like this is a report by engineers for engineers you know what i really hear what i hear is that there's first six levels of people that like did it and then and then there was the engineer right once has engaged with a diverse group of stakeholders rallying them to join the administration's effort statements from of support from leaders across academia civil society and industry can be found here no one asked me okay i feel am i not civil am i not am i not civil enough for you in line with two major themes of the president's national cyber security strategy released near nearly one year ago the report released today takes an important step toward shifting the responsibility of cyber security away from individuals and small businesses and onto larger organizations like technology companies and the federal government that are more capable of managing than ever the ever evolving threat oh that's interesting so do you think that there's like are they saying that there's going to be laws or agencies to enforce this type of stuff being passed down like are it hold on hold on hold on does that mean this is real is the rust evangelism strike force actually a real thing i think it it always has it always has been i think i think we now have government endorsed rust of vigil strike force haj kids haj your wives h husband the rusted everything around here this work also aligns with and builds upon secure by design programs and research and development efforts from across the federal government including the those led by cisa nsa fbi and nist i don't understand these last two more of them the work on memory safety in the report complement interest from congress on this topic great you know who i think about when i think of experts leading the field of cyber security you know who i think about i think about congress you know like nancy pelosi classically known for her expertise specifically in cyber security you know what i mean you know what i mean like that's that's what i think of that's that's that's what i think of you know this includes the efforts of the united states senate and house appropriations committees who included director report language requiring a briefing from once on this issue in fiscal year 2023 appropriations legislation i don't even know what that sentence meant additionally us senate homeland security and government affairs committee chairman gary peters and us senator ron weiden have highlighted their legislation efforts on memory safety to one want really okay what is okay real talk ron widen senator ron widen who is he what what what has he done like is an american politician serving in the let's see from oregon great oregon okay okay member of the let's let's see let's see what he's done he went there he's a senator education school of law okay so definitely knows a lot about cyber security he went to law school age 74 years old classic modern politic making all like i mean this is this is actually a really true problem just in our system in general is that i don't think this guy understands this and the thing is is i don't think that this guy given experts around him could accurately convey what he needs to convey to make these decisions and so like to me that's like that's really like like this all sounds great you know what i'm totally on board let's make things memory safe especially for the government like the government if the govern gets hacked it's really it's actually like genuinely a bad experience for everybody nobody wins on a government hacking except for the people doing hacking but i don't think this is this is this ain't the group you know what i mean this ain't the group i'm not even qualified to go do it okay i think we need to get live overflow and lowlevel learning they got to go do it okay we got to get john hammond on this okay john hammond needs to go and do that and then trash dev just to see what happens right i think we should get trash dev in there just to just to mix it all up right you're going to have like expert expert expert trash dev right like you just just throw it all together just to see what would happen yeah we need smelly nerds we need the smelly nerds and so you know like when i see these things i like i'm totally in support of everything that's being said here i think every nobody would disagree with any of these things being said it's more of i don't think the people making these decisions are are capable even with experts around them of making the correct decision if we send thor we won't get any more shorts so like do you want to send thor or do you want shorts so i think i think you got i think you got to make that decision and personally i think we should keep the shorts game going and not send thor to go do that that's that's that's person that's my personal that's a personal preference here okay send thanos yeah send thanos i just want jorts yeah i know you just want jorts by the way i just so d dorak dak i want to let you know something i was walking through my house and my wife had a box unpacked that had like a piece of metal sticking out of it and i ripped my jeans as i walked by it i now have a pair of jorts when i ripped my jeans i said f it f it i'm wearing jorts boys and so now i have an amazing pair of jorts sitting and waiting for summer to happen we're live absolutely how short we talk you know i i do the appropriate amount of joring which these aren't the jorts but i prefer them like you know a good few inches above the knee right you want you want you want some you want i i like to call it low do the pockets hang out no the pockets do not hang out but i like i like low man thigh exposure okay i think high man thigh exposure is generally a crime against humanity okay tasteful exposure i'm i'm a modest man i'm a modest man and i have very normal very normal opinions which is that the inner deep man is the ugliest part on any body okay i do not i do not believe anybody thinks that that that spot's good okay it's like sparely hairy it's it's it it's often entirely too white it's just like everything about it is just this not it's just it's just disgusting okay girls like it i don't believe that at all i in fact it makes me think you've never even talked to a female when you say this all right that's what i think okay that's hey that's what i think okay testicle tanning incoming okay well now that we've gotten onto this conversation and it's absolutely the most ridiculous conversation hey the name is the joren
