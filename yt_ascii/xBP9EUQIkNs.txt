i need to tell you about the company magically putting
the money under the cups. tiktok is an awesome
video app that allows you to create short clips doing
literally whatever you want. you can be original, like
pewdiepie, in your videos, or you can just react
to other people's video. pewdiepie recently did a video on tiktok and ever since then, chris
hasn't put the app down. like, it's a little crazy, you know? - i can't sleep. i've been watching it for days. - but yeah, to us,
tiktok's like the new vine. it's actually pretty entertaining. there is dos ways you can use tiktok. you can use it as a
source of entertainment, like youtube, or you can
use it to express yourself and create cool videos. there's over 100 emoji stickers and even halloween face
filters that are pretty cool. and to show you how cool
they are, we made our own. hey chris, you wanna see something cool? - yeah, sure man. show me. - did it, did it work? - oh jesus, change it back, man. - oh. it's not going back. what do i do? - oh my god, we gotta go
to the hospital right now. let's go. - but not only did i make a
tiktok, so did this person. wow. this one's my favorite. that person should message me. we should be friends. you probably think something this great costs a million dollars. well, it doesn't. it costs $0. it's actually free. - but what kind of phone can i get it on? - i'm glad you asked. it is available on ios and android. just go on there, search
tiktok, download it right now. if you wanna allow me to blow more money and just be completely irresponsible, i'm gonna need you to click
