one the following video contains footage of a pc that has been intentionally damaged for educational and entertainment purposes species was fully functional it was sent to us by origin but we broke it the makers of this video urged viewers exercise caution and respect when handling electronics origin pc told me to give away this kronos v3 small form factor gaming pc and that is their right they did sponsor the video but i have been spending a lot of time on r slash malicious compliance lately and while they did stipulate that i have to give it away they didn't say it had to be in working condition so here's the deal kelvin if that is your real name from the time you touch this computer you have two hours to fix it needing all of these criteria if you succeed you take it home with you ready to game if you fail i give it to someone else you may right now visually inspect the pc visually but don't touch not that i think you'll be able to glean any useful information anyway our team of skilled customer to service experts burned the midnight oil making sure that this was going to be extremely challenging anybody say something you can you don't have to you can just touch the computer and try and fix it okay touched it set the thing set the thing here we go oh oh and this is great because while he's trying to think right now is a perfect time for me to go through a few more really important details that i'm springing on him at the last second here oh and springy on origin they had no idea you see i put together a few little bonus prize packs of my own but to get them he has to complete the challenge in a lot less than two hours every 30 minutes i'm going to open up one of these envelopes and i'll read out what's inside them but once i say it you no longer get it oh isn't that fun and the best part calvin is that absolutely nobody is cheering for you because if you fail there's a separate giveaway for another chronos v3 for all the fine folks watching from home but it's just one unless you fail too isn't that great no hard feelings though man the contract says i have to give it away it doesn't say that i have to give it away to you ouch wow it really doesn't say anything it doesn't even say that i'm not allowed to distract you it's great do you have any experience fixing computers calvin because it really doesn't look like i've built my own before wow this is tough he has to post boot into windows have all the parts detected in hardware info there's a lot of stuff in there core i9 3900k rtx 4080 founders edition 32 gigs of ddr5 ram more than one drive okay to figure out exactly what drives are in there and score at least 37 000 in cinebench r23 and 2250 in classroom yeah you gotta run benchmarks too that half an hour one is going to be basically impossible you're removing a say to drive what exactly is it that you're hoping to achieve right now well it was disconnected and i could not fit my fingers in to reconnect it hopefully there's not too much other stuff that's disconnected it's going to be doing a full tear down and rebuild of this thing too bad you can't use origins 24 7 lifetime support did you watch our previous troubleshooting challenge videos as prep oh that would have been really smart you didn't did you goodness gracious almost eight minutes gone already where does time go when you're having fun should i give him any hints if i figure something out [laughter] he's one of the people who likes my evil persona okay i'm gonna poke my head in here david one thing i can see is something that's very clearly hanging out there what's this what's going on here doesn't seem very good at about 15 minutes in there's definitely things that i'd be doing differently i don't think he's being nearly aggressive enough in his disassembly he knows we've messed with this thing and he's trying to look for surface level problems like is the back of the power supply switch off you know stuff like that the first thing i'd be doing is tearing stuff out of here to validate that it's actually connected at all oh he started oh we dropped the ram ah to watch now i get how you guys feel in just 11 minutes and 23 seconds i get to reveal the first thing that you're missing out on it's funny how you change the dynamic right he started this shoot ready to win something in two hours but now all he can think about is what he's going to lose in 30 minutes man you could be gaming at like 4k 120 frames per second in just an hour and 40 minutes or you could be driving home in disappointment in just an hour and 40 minutes you cannot get that another word out here nope some things still plugged in that's the thing about small form factor builds is when they're done right they're packed tight hey i came up with that on the spot not bad sleep deprived brain this must hurt to watch hey no i'm having a blast i'm feeling particularly malicious today had a very bad night it's still an hour and a half there's yes and it's four seconds and four seconds which means it's time to open the first envelope if you had completed the challenge in just 30 minutes you would have received in addition to your origin chronos v3 gaming pc damn a xenon flex virtuoso rgb wireless xt headset k100 keyboard and a dark core rgb pro really it's a two thousand dollar monitor oh yeah that would have been nice yeah it would have been nice well hopefully there's something good in the next one truthfully watching him read that did kind of hurt i'm feeling a little bit more benevolent now so with that in mind i will say that half an hour in i probably would have put a little bit more work into isolation so taking my individual components and evaluating them one by one okay i got my gpu is it plugged in on one end is it plugged in on the other end okay spit roasted gpu good to go take my motherboard you know where are all the different points it needs to be plugged in i want to go one thing at a time this cable will be the death of me you got to have confidence you know what i've come around i'm rooting for kelvin now okay you got to have confidence you gotta just you gotta pull it out is that a piece of motherboard just from the edge right here so yes this is the word you were looking for yeah can i have a look at that please sure it's cosmetic thank god oh god's not gonna help you with this keep it far far away there's a couple more things that origin pc wanted me to mention about the system it fits up to 620 millimeter case fans which means it's easy to attach a 360 millimeter aio cooler which is really impressive given the size of this thing the one that we've got is the iq h150i elite and it supports up to a 1 000 watt sfx power supply which is that what they happened to put in here yes this is a thousand watt power supply one issue i'm noticing with calvin's approach is that he's thinking very inside the box in a literal sense he's trying to do everything inside the box by this point i would have everything spread out hanging out the side whatever it takes to just get my individual components attached in the bare minimum way and isolated doesn't need a gpu to post the system he doesn't need a cooler he started with absolutely no response whatsoever he doesn't even need a power button he just needs some way to jump those pins and see has anything i've done improved anything there is something that's troubling me we don't like viewer interactions to end negatively that was one of the reasons that i cheated in pc or no pc awarding the top prize to both participants regardless of what they actually earned but there was so much audience backlash when i did that because people felt that it removed all the stakes that i will never do it again if we said you fail you lose that's how it has to be okay come on calvin what does this do carrier board where does it go so where does it need to go liberate it where pray tell calvin would you normally find the front i o things plugged in on a motherboard or on the sides of it so do you see anything on the sides that looks like sort of unusual asus has done something very interesting with this board there are two male long male type c connectors along the bottom right edge of the board and they appear to be designed to plug into this daughter board which has two female receptacles now if i was the average user i might look at a usb type-c and go well that's for usb but if i were me having seen all the weird shiz that motherboard manufacturers do over the years i would look at it and go they have reused an industry standard connector and they've done all their own pin out for it so they're using these usbcs for my looks like front panel usb 2 sata front panel connector oh would you look at that a little indicator light okay getting somewhere did you find the front panel connection i o connector yeah oh it's just really you know connector crap in here okay well what you need to do is you need to find where the front i o connector is but before you can do that i really do need you to open this envelope because i said i would make you do it so i could have had yeah a xenon 32 inch yeah hs80 headset k70 keyboard and iron claw rgb wireless still great stuff but a significant downgrade over last time we're definitely trending in a like this direction i'm going to help you with that that is an extremely misleading manual there is no power button there oh there's a label here that says power button though what the devil are they talking about this is about those few switches back i mean these few prongs back here you think oh interesting that was weird okay well that's a good sign yeah i would turn this off really quickly though yeah yeah 47 minutes oh no it's getting intense it's been intense for me for a while you just didn't know it yet one of the most difficult things about troubleshooting under pressure whether it's a client breathing down your neck or a deadline is thoroughness you always miss things when you're under pressure and one of the things that i would be making sure that i'm doing at this stage is taking a second regrouping slow is fast have i missed anything i need to isolate say for example an ssd well we know from the requirements that there are drives we saw one two and a half inch drive which means there are some other z somewhere okay a more direct hint if something's not working there's no time you just need to press forward every time something costs five minutes at this point it is costing one-ninth of the remaining amount of time you got to think about it that way real talk david at 30 minutes do i jump in and help i think you should is that violating the spirit of the challenge because they never said i couldn't help i mean they never said i had to do this to him at all but will people be upset if together we achieve it i don't want people to feel like you know everything's wigged here because i really don't know the answers maybe i can help but i can't touch it yeah that's a good idea i can tell them what to do do you think that's compromise you guys good we good okay 12 more minutes i will start helping in our earnest okay it just has to run does it need to be in the case to run well we did say the case panels had to be closed we never said that i did you did i did why did you say that well i said that because i thought that that would be reasonable he was mistaken we take it back no it's established it's canon okay it's like the bad sequel star wars movies we're stuck with them we're eight and a half minutes from the third and final envelope and i hate to tell you this another surprise twist okay i'm not looking forward to it tech tip two of the four screws on that motherboard are easier to access than the others tech tip the panels have to be closed we didn't say anything about components left outside of the panels put in only two screws go go go whatever ones are easiest isolation what do we need to do now storages ssd we need to boot it up for longer than five seconds right keep your eye on the prize all right yes i'm sorry last time last one yeah a scepter 20 inch 1600 by 900 fake airpods i'm not gonna miss those amazon basics keyboard amazon basics mouse okay well hey at least you already had lost most of what you were going to lose before but the second twist is i'm gonna be helping you in earnest with the one rule being that i can't touch it okay i'll take anything let's go find that damn power switch thing and put it on the damn thing let's go there's no power button you see this power buttons right here and the orientation is this way so the bottom two finally okay that's on it's powered on okay let's see if we get an output we still have 26 and a half minutes we're gonna get them there well we're gonna try i'm really sorry but if you don't complete it i actually can't give you the computer and i know okay i understand i would power cycle it once though wait okay okay that's something step one okay okay this tells us our m.2 drive is working that's good so that means that the drive that wasn't working was probably the sata one okay it looks like it's already at defaults that's fine so okay yep so we're gonna reset here all right now let's think what do we still need to do we're not going to do anything we don't need we have 24 minutes hard drives so that hard drive must go in it must get power we must get this stupid sata thing plugged in okay okay however we don't need to move that power switch you can deal with that at home get it plugged into the proper thing later at your leisure right so just get this in get the sata on here get that in and let's see if we can get that drive detected we've got two ssds now excellent let's get the gpu in okay that should be the right spot so you got to support it at the back and push it in push push push there you go yeah it's in great hey these blender benchmarks is this gpu or cpu gpu gpu okay and the cinebench score is a single pass single pass okay okay now is a good time to sanity check if our pump is working we can do that with our ears the answer is yes i didn't have to touch it okay so hardware info what do we need to show up all parts detected including gpu which we obviously have the ram okay is all of our rent 32 gigs ram is that right that's right yep drives well we know both of our drives are here make sure they're in windows explorer they're not okay now hold on we gotta check the rules exactly have all parts detected in hardware and for including the gpu the ram and the drives we have to run the benchmarks we don't need to get this drive detected in windows explorer you can do that later okay but we need but we need cinebench r23 and we need blender with the monster junk shop and classroom benchmarks okay we've got a we gotta strategize do we think it will be faster to solve assigning a no you know what it's probably faster to assign it because where does the software stored onto is it on the m.2 probably on that two and a half inch drive that's probably why we have to figure out yeah okay what the crap it's not picking it up okay this forget it we're not solving it then okay okay yeah we're not solving that okay so let's download cinebench r23 i might be already here is it i don't oh there's a folder here exe yes okay we need 37 000 we didn't turn on xmp we might need xmp in order to get that score we should also really have hardware info open to make sure that our cpu is not overheating it doesn't help that our fans are pointed down at the table we'll deal with that later okay cpu cpu package looks fine what's our score 37 988 let's move on okay let's see if we get these scores gpu fans definitely spinning up all right we need to we need to put the side panels on leaning tower of side panel i consider that on okay great me too put it just put it on just on on just yeah on the top on top yeah just okay on here put this on so if the benchmarks don't pass we can go back into the bios enable xmp but we already passed the cpu benchmark so we're in pretty good shape the one thing i'm worried about is right now that second drive specifically says it has to be detected in hardware info it doesn't say it needs to be detected in the bios i didn't see it in hardware info so let's get this benchmark done then we know we're clear we have 10 minutes to figure out why that drive is showing up in the bios but not in hardware info yeah yeah in the meantime i'm going to figure out if there's a way for us to cheat okay yes yes monster in the monster benchmark absolutely monster numbers we passed everything we need the last thing we need to do is we need that drive to show up in hardware info so everything's validated let's reboot this computer so turn it off yep don't worry about it good okay we're in wait maybe i was mistaken that drive is not okay no this is good though because it means whatever is wrong is universally wrong i was really worried when it was in here and not there so i think what's going on is that cable is whack it's like bent no not that one the one on the motherboard this okay that is like oh it is bent it is bent you're right so you get that it's very loose here yeah let's make sure that's in there it is possible that we have actually ruined the sata connector on that little daughter board there's a second one we can try that next power it up and then worst case scenario i have a little trick up my sleeve this is why they have to be really careful when they build rule sets yeah i'm participating no still not there okay shut it down let's try the other port we still got five minutes what's easier at this point plugging the sata connector into the daughter board and putting that in yeah or just taking the entire thing out what entire thing this oh yeah yeah take the daughter board out plug it in put that back in that might actually be easier at this stage in the game two minutes it's time for the trick up the sleeve this is a usb to sata adapter nothing says we can't use it so oh sorry i'm not allowed to touch get get that drive disconnected okay just rip it out okay plug this in 45 seconds oh okay i have to put these on put them here faster they're on something don't worry about it storage d there's a problem with this drive but we don't care about that hold on hardware info hardware info quick no no you're good no down here yeah it's detected okay zero seconds oh my god oh my god [music] thank you [laughter] that's crazy that's crazy [laughter] the letter of the law not the spirit [laughter] anyway don't thank me thank you origin pc makers of the chronos v3 a computer that looks a lot better when they ship it to you than when i fix it for real though the one that you could win at the link in the video description it would look more like when this started and not like when it finished but fully functional without us having messed with it a tanner what the hell is wrong with that drive okay so what was wrong with that drive when i touched it was the sata cable was unplugged in fact that was a lot of the problems with it the front panel connector was also unplugged what was the other thing that was wrong with it wait there were only three things wrong with it well there were also two software things okay because i had the cpu underclocked and i had the gpu under clock but i on that one forgot to set msi afterburner to launch on boot that's so that one's on me okay originally i just wanted the power the power button to be unplugged but as soon as i tried to unplug that the whole daughter board came out yeah so when the whole daughter board came out i thought man that sure does look like it's still plugged in let's just leave it that's gonna be a thing the clock behind me did not help at all just seeing it like tick down were these helpful no no this was an innovation that came up with at the last minute the first one hurt the most oh oh yeah that xenia on flex yeah great monitor great monitor but the good news is that even if you don't have a xenia on flex this is a sick computer and now you get to take it home and build it [laughter] tear it apart and then put it back together now that would be best yeah yeah if you guys enjoyed this video maybe you like the energy go check out one of our rg rig reboot videos we'll we'll pick a nice one for you and we'll put it in the video description
