how can you learn new technical things fast i mean nowadays it feels like each and every day a new technology is coming out not to mention with the rise of ai it has made technology move at such a quick pace is it even possible i sat down with three experts to understand how they are able to learn new technologies quickly and keep up with tech from antonella who is a software engineer at microsoft sky who is a computer science student and don allen iii who is always up to date well not even up to date ahead of tech news and trends now through these conversations i uncovered how you too can learn how to stay up to date with tech and learn new tech fast whether it be a programming language learn about a tech trend speak about tech better we got you [music] covered now the first thing i needed to uncover is how are these individuals really learning new technical skills like what methods do they implement at work when they're studying in their day-to-day lives i sat down with antella and i loved how she shared how she was able to ramp up very quickly at microsoft on a new code base i mean new team it feels really intimidating here's though how she did it and even if you're not working on an organization how you can too at work i get thrown into the big repo for a project and i get to see what everyone else has coded and i get to see their previous prs and that kind of stuff so for instance say that you're on the powerpoint team and the your manager tells you to add a new button that adds a signature to a powerpoint and you're like okay i've never been on this code i don't know maybe you don't even know the language cuz that happens sometimes when i started i didn't know c so you're like okay where do i even start and what i've started doing is okay let me see something that's similar let's see the the button to add an image and i'll go into the code and see who worked on that go through like get blame and see who's been in there before and just go through the prs and kind of try to make sense of it okay this first pr was the basics and so this is what they did and just work my way way through there you'd think it's kind of hard doing it if you're not in a work environment but there's a bunch of code on github there's a lot of open- source stuff so i'd say go into it and start getting your your hands dirdy with it and it actually helps a lot and i mean as antella mentioned one of the best ways i mean i used to always do this when i was first learning to code is to use open source projects that's a great tip now another method or technique that whether you are learning something really technical like a programming language or maybe you're on the theory side of things that you can implement is a technique that was introduced by richard fineman and this is a technique actually that sky who studies computer science uses when she is learning new things i'll learn something new and then kind of later that night i'll be telling someone i'll tell my husband kind of like what i'm learning and going over it again and almost putting it into my own words and like acting like the teacher like i'm i'm teaching you something something that i know gives you kind of like the confidence boost and it really solidifies in your brain what you just learned okay but here's the thing it's one thing to use these techniques to ramp up your learnings learn it at a quicker pace and also make your life less stressful by using actual techniques that these individuals mentioned but it brings up the question how do you know what to spend your time learning i mean there are infinite possibilities it feels like nowadays i spoke to don allen iii and here's what he had to say i know people used to go to the like they they look for brand videos that pump someone's like oh here's my reaction with this new thing but it's like are are you a developer oh you're not a developer okay i'm gonna maybe take your idea with a grain of salt as a trend to follow but if a developer has that to say that's a that's a big deal to me is if and if there's a lot of developers excited around then i'll probably want to focus more energy on it and if there's not a lot of developers around i'll probably focus less energy on it so why focus on what developers are getting excited about well i mean for one thing they are the 's building this technology so that makes total sense but what if you are a developer wondering what to focus on that is where having community really comes into play whether online or in person having that group of individuals that will support you share with what they are learning and also in turn make it feel as though you have this place where when you have questions about what you are focusing on or what you are learning you can go to but here's the thing not only do you need to be aware of what others are focusing on and sharing your your excitement about that you need to have this underlying thread throughout it what is that you ask curiosity i love the story that da alen ii thiri shared of the importance of staying curious i just kind of follow what actually makes me curious one of my favorite children's books was harold and the purple crayon it's this little character i grew up with reading his books and he has this magical purple crayon and whatever he draws comes to life he uses it to any problem in his world and so i like how that fictional character basically approaches every problem with curiosity so if he's hungry he just draws some food if he's stuck on this island he'll just draw a boat okay so so far we've covered techniques to learn new technical concepts at a quicker pace or break them down really easy we've also learned the importance of staying curious and how to keep up with tech as it evolves so quickly but it brings up the question how do you break down what you are learning especially with these technical concepts whether it's for programming or once again theory and the business side into manageable parts like making them digestible these concepts a lot of them can feel so overwhelming here's how sky does it while studying computer science when i come home i'm usually like an introvert when it comes to my work like i like to work alone i don't love to collaborate when i don't have to like group projects i don't i don't know if anyone likes group projects really but yeah so it's more it's just relatable that like i i like to work alone but i think that it's really important to at least stay connected with a few people in your classes right now i'm taking i switch to kind of like online classes for this semester and last semester because i live kind of far from campus but it it's very isolating like you'll barely have any contact with your professors with other peers but something that's been life- saving is usually somebody in the class will make a discord but here's the really cool thing this advice wasn't just from sky it was really threaded throughout everyone i spoke to here's what antella had to say start small with for instance like if you're starting a new language the basics figure out like a little bit of the syntax just to get you by and then start going into projects because if you also get too stuck in tutorial purgatory you never get out of it so try to get your hands dirty as soon as possible just building stuff and then the next part would be go in small pieces so build maybe like like i was saying earlier if it's a button to something that already exist or a very small web app that just like shows hello world or something like that and celebrate those wins because that's a huge milestone in your journey and it means that you are able to produce something that someone else might not be able to so it's a really big step and if you only look at oh i don't know all these other things then you are always going to feel terrible about your progress out of all this though the biggest thing i love that we are ending with is around celebrating your wins not just your big wins because that bar keeps on going higher and higher and in the end we always are chasing what comes next but as she mentioned really taking a step back and celebrating your wins along the way your what maybe feel like smaller wins are really big wins that when you look back you you need to pet yourself on the back you did that it's pretty incredible all right i hope you enjoyed this video make sure to hit that subscribe button for more videos where i will be bringing on other tech experts in various fields leave in the
