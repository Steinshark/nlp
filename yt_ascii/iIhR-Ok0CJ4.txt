he's not like charles anderson it's just it's just charles of course it is you do if your child had a tumor that doctors could not remove if they tried the risk of death for your child or someone you love was so high that it was an almost guaranteed death sentence but if on the small chance that the surgery worked your child or loved one's face would be horrifically disfigured for life that's a decision charles had to face stock footage of old man google search please his daughter was supposed to die yet as you are about to hear he discovered a third option it was a long shot but it was one he was willing to take and the result well you can judge that for yourself after you he's a different person by the way everyone see that that's stupid the birth of his daughter was easily the happiest moment in charles's life but the joy didn't last long because soon a dentist noticed small bean-sized growth in his daughter's upper lip i took his daughter to see a doctor surely since he caught it early modern medicine would provide a way to remove it since it was still such a small growth hasn't she been through enough guys i'm already now emotionally invested of this i was gonna disprove this but now i'm emotionally invested in the bean size growth here but his hopes crashed when he was told by the doctor that it was a blood vessel tumor and that it was in a place where surgery couldn't be performed charles thought maybe it would stay harmless that it would stay small and benign but the tumor steadily swelled the doctors predicted she had only six months to live a shroud of sadness covered their family helplessly they watched their child slowly choke to death a friend suggested tcm or traditional chinese medicine as a last resort charles was desperate hey she's gonna live guys the music changed did you hear that the stock music and the stock footage has changed now it's gonna be okay how do you make up these wild stories about like child death in order to sell your your garbage product it's amazing to me the the level of psychopathy involved in these internet marketers they just make up these stories they're like hey what charles what is his daughter died can we say anything else oh yeah it actually came back more aggressive than ever and she actually watched his daughter choke to that that's cool seriously and desperately researching the options he found a center in china renowned for curing the most chronic and terminal diseases they did what it took landed in china and made a beeline straight for the center this was his last hope however in a mere 24 days his daughter's tumor not only stopped growing but also began to shrink but he had run out of his savings desperate to stay longer what a twist here she's about to live but he ran out of savings i can't get me to the point where she lives please rated manual labor for him and his daughters to stay longer one day charles's hopes were realized thank you the tumor was gone completely gone now this story and the others just like it that you're about to hear aren't unusual just because cancer crippling arthritis viral infections even as severe as aids autoimmune diseases like diabetes migraines allergies and extreme mental disorders were all completely cured oh so just cures everything i get it everyone knows china doesn't have any illness because of traditional chinese medicine everyone knows that right yet they are still kept mainly out of view to mainstream america they are safe gentle natural and powerful western medicine and large pharmaceutical companies simply cannot lose their monopoly on the industry of surgery medication and drugs i love how some random internet marketers like hey those guys they're greedy listen i think the only person worse than big pharma are internet marketers actually i think you guys this like if if big pharma you know people like the sackler brothers or whatever if they're like in the fifth circle of hell there's a people underneath for sure internet marketers definitely and i'm not saying all internet marketers by the way obviously but the people who produce this definitely go into hell i may be forced to by the powers that be to take this free video down it might be shut down by the federal trade commission because it should be this is psychotic how suddenly even tumors in cancer cells can begin to melt away and how asthma sufferers can suddenly feel like they are taking their first deep breath in decades i'm going to teach you the secret in just a second but before i do i need to talk about the big lie that's keeping you your family or dear friends from being free from needless illnesses physical pain and disease now let me guess big farmer i think you'll see why i feel it's my duty to share it with you so please stay with me the big lie is that a cure for the most debilitating and fatal diseases today can only be treated with medical drugs and surgery and that any natural cure doesn't exist as i'm about to prove to you in just a minute how a natural inexpensive non-chemical cure does in fact exist what i love about this like a little robot voice they have going on here for somebody who's pretending to be brave like i'm coming out with a big secret who are the people behind this i have looked for a long time at who makes this stupid thing of course they're nowhere to be found with something called clover 7 nutraceuticals or something who owns that nobody knows george brigham who's he nobody knows it's all a fake name so that's the thing that really pisses me off because these people they go oh i've got the secret but i'm keeping my face a secret that's how you know all this stuff is a scam they don't tell you who they are you can't hold them accountable nothing the truth is your body already has the power to kill any harmful germ virus bacteria or dysfunction by using this powerful safe gentle and unusual five-minute exercise size there's a reason why some people and even entire cultures manage to live their entire lives without debilitating illnesses the big secret the ancient chinese discovered and have been using for thousands of years to reverse any illness including cancer aids clogged arteries arthritis diabetes alzheimer's yeast infections isn't it enough is it cancer enough curing cancer you have to throw in heart disease and alzheimer's just to give it make it a little tougher for you be too easy to just cure cancer used in china for thousands of years to heal millions of people its potent abilities still find its way into mainstream culture now who's actually behind this whole thing the whole scam well we have this guy i don't know if he knew what he was getting into it he was hired by these internet marketers he supposedly the the guy behind it all there's always a guru behind it guys as you know from fake guru now we're going to learn about who's behind the touch point technique five times stronger than chemotherapy vitamins and antioxidants let's go kitchener in singapore named master lin he is easily the most humble man i've ever met in my life i actually had a hard time believing this humble soft-spoken man was the source of all the stories i kept hearing about performing such miraculous feats of healing stories like how a man was suddenly struck with a deadly heart attack in a subway and master lim who happened to be there was able to use his deep understanding of meridian points to literally massage the heart attack away okay we gotta address that right now massage the heart attack away first of all demonetized okay we can't show that demonetized massage the heart attack away though they've been doing it wrong all the time they've been zapping people unnecessarily all you need is a little massage from master limb here just by placing a few fingers on a specific part of the man's body he was able to neutralize the heart attack on the spot without question this saved the man's life as it took a long time for the paramedics to come so what i want to tell you guys right now let me just spoil it this is obviously a gigantic scam but not only is it a gigantic scam it's a gigantic scam that's existed for a very long time and these monsters who keep recycling this stuff are faking literally everything including master lim so i got behind their paywall of course and i got into the modules and this guy's basically like just like teaching you like rub yourself in the back and it's like going to cure your cancer or whatever it's like basic stretching right because of course it's not magical healing formulas for 39.95 online that the doctors don't want you to know about i mean i'm sorry to tell you but these scumbags are using like traditional chinese medicine which you know has its place in the world it's just its place is not curing cancer i guess this is like healing your arm i mean is this could master limb magically regrow your arm with this tapping technique but what i want to show you guys is that this has existed since actually back in like to the early 2000s there was something called pure natural healing so this is a modern thing but this is a literally a redo of this which is pure natural healing which is harvard confirms you know pain relief heart health and optimal blood pressure without drug surgery or just beginning of this odd therapy and in this the same guy is used for the same thing except the story is different instead of being a singaporean man he's a chinese man see this is a scam review from contra health scam and they talk about the fact that he was the chinese wonder healer a few years ago and miraculously now he's become a singaporean healer not only that last time is george bridgeum the previous version with it was a guy named keith richardson which was just a shutterstock photo because of course it was so these guys who are saying like oh down with pharma right we which is you know the problem is is they use it because they have a point right farmer's done some shady stuff for sure but they use that to then sell you even worse snake oil so they go to people who are like tired frustrated sick the most desperate and they go hey aren't you tired of those guys taking advantage of you so sick it's so sick and we have to call it out but yeah all their testimonials are fake as well they're all shutterstock images so literally even these things about like at it saved my life whatever it's all crap it's all made up by some scumbag in his mom's basement trying to make a quick buck so guys what's the conclusion here is there such thing as a healing touch just like there was the death touch unfortunately not turns out to be not only a scam but a recycled scam from years ago that some scumbag internet marketer is using to extract wealth and rent seek from all desperate sick people how long are we gonna get away with this how long are they going to be allowed to promise cures to cancer and not only trick westerners but also belittle traditional chinese medicine as well how long is it going to happen let me know in the comments below what you think and in the meantime i wish you all the very best sorry guys try to heal myself here because this video has given me cancer coffee [music]
