okay i'd be lying if i told you i didn't spend a 
lot and when i say a lot i mean a lot of time on   my phone and i'm gonna do something that i've 
never done before which is i am going to share   with you today just how much screen time i spend 
per week on my phone and i'm really nervous to   do this because unlike a lot of people who share 
this amount of screen time i've never even really   seen what the normal average is so i don't know i 
might be like crazy high compared to most of you i   might be crazy maybe surprise me crazy low but 
anyways today i'm going to be sharing with you   my screen time and the reason i'm doing it this 
is because today i really want to talk about   productivity and as someone who is a software 
engineer who is a content creator a tech youtuber   trying to manage a social life and just like enjoy 
life there's a lot going on and i'm always on my   phone and i want to share with you today some ways 
that really help me stay productive and focused this is very bright but we're just 
heading into the co-working space   and then we're gonna sit down and catch up   okay i am in the co-working space it's a rare 
moment when it's like this quiet so i'll do a   little of the main floor a little glimpse a 
little tour because it's really pretty okay also thank you to setup for 
sponsoring this video i am   obsessed with set up i love subscriptions 
where it's literally you subscribe to it   and you get this suite of beautiful applications 
included in it whether it be for technical   applications whether it be productivity whether 
it be workflow every app you can think of i've   always been able to finance that app i'll put 
it up on screen here so you can learn more about   it as well and i'm linking it down below but 
all the apps that we are going through today   are on setup and really all the apps that i use on 
my macbook are through setup it's amazing you pay   x amount per month and then in turn you get 
access to all the apps so let's get into it   okay hi i'm sitting down with you and jack 
nicholson behind me of course jack say hi hello   okay it's just crickets jack doesn't want 
to talk i wanted to sit down with you and   share with you some apps that i use to really 
customize my mac and make it more productive   in this sense which makes me more productive 
because i am more focused i can utilize my tools   better and i used to be someone who wouldn't 
customize my mac or have apps specifically for   different things and then i started playing 
around with it and i got hooked because   just like the amount of time you spend on your 
devices whether it be your phone your computer   similarly i find that if you have tools that will 
help you make life easier whether it be for focus   or organization you in turn will save a lot of 
time to be more productive and this is something   i mean time is the most valuable thing i think 
it's even more valuable than money in the sense   that we cannot get time back we cannot get more 
time like what we are given we have and i always   think about well how do i utilize that time in the 
best way possible so i'm going to put up on screen   here and my computer here i'm going to share with 
you my first one which is called bartender and   this is a really popular app i would say i've 
seen it on a lot of friends computers as well and   i was kind of late to the game on it but 
i was super excited when i finally got   it so bartender you can think of it as a menu 
organizer bar for mac it helps organize search   and see your mac menu bar icons while you are 
using your desktop or keeping it tidy i should say   okay so as you can see i have bartender up on 
the screen here and there are a lot of options   to really customize it so if you go to menu bar 
layout you can see where you want to see the menu   bar items which ones will be hidden different 
things like that that you can really customize and   okay so right now you can see i have very minimal 
things shown on my menu bar which i really like   but i would want to add in my spotlight and 
what else it already has the time the battery   would also be important or is important i should 
say and i like that kind of next too there we go   and then also too to know if my vpn is on which 
is very important to me but yeah the rest of them   i'm fine to be hidden and this is a great way 
just to see quickly i found what was happening   is i have so many different applications and 
these aren't even all of them i just i'm not   showing them all for this this walk through but 
basically i had so many and it just got very   it just started looking so cluttery and it 
just it really in turn makes your mind feel   that way as well so that is the first app i 
really want to share with you let's move on to   another one i feel like i'm sharing all my secrets 
here okay so next up let's do one switch which i   will put up on screen here and essentially it 
allows you to create a personalized control   center so and i found one thing that this app has 
done really well is it really kind of cleans up my   mac and i guess my favorite part of it is the 
shortcuts so as long as you can remember the   shortcuts that is key sometimes i make shortcuts 
for apps and then i forget them and then it's   just a really big pain but i'll show you what 
i did to customize mine here but first let me   show you in setup they have some really good 
images of it as well one switch you can see here hi desktop icons this is another 
huge thing i absolutely love because   oh am i going to show you my desktop we're getting 
really personal if i do that okay i'm going to   show it to you but it's going to be quick you 
might pause this video because it's going to be   i'm just going to show you for one second 
and hopefully you don't actually see it okay so bad i told you so bad okay let's move 
on next topic okay so yes one switch is   amazing and clearly i need to utilize it more 
for hiding files but let me show you let   me open mine up here okay you can see here i 
have general and then if you go into customize   so you can add remove or sort any of 
the switches on the dashboard so i have   quite a bit as you can see but here's 
what i was talking about with shortcuts   those shortcuts so you can record a shortcut so 
for me mute microphone that is something that i   usually have i took it out for now but so say 
you want it to be let's just do m for mute   perfect so you can see there's m for mute and 
keep awake a lot of people like to keep their mac   awake for a long time i'm not one of those people 
but i'm curious to know the reasoning behind it   so if you are one of those people 
let me know okay let's move on to   the third app okay so some of you might know well 
actually you all should know if you're watching   this video that i work from a co-working space 
sometimes as i gave you a tour earlier and i   absolutely love getting out of the house working 
in different cafes or going to co-working spaces   it really helps me get my focus back especially 
when coding but the downside i find to that   is i just have one screen i don't have 
my double monitors like in my office and   sometimes that can be really annoying as far as 
especially if i'm coding something on the front   end side of things so i have on screen here slide 
pad which has really helped me so you can see it   really helps reduce switching between screens 
you can answer different applications like slack   without opening the actual app which is pretty 
cool so i'm in setup here and let me just show   you some demos they do for it so it just slides 
over your current screen which makes it honestly   if you are someone who works from one screen 
or if you're a digital nomad you know this   is like an absolute game changer so i've been 
using slide pad for a while now especially when   i'm out at co-working spaces and it really really 
helps me actually enjoy working more so because   i often would go to co-working spaces for like 
one hour and then be like i need my two monitors   i'm going back home and then dredge back home so 
slide pad okay let's talk about one more app that   i am kind of obsessed with and once again this is 
an app that i have through setup it's actually   where i find all of my apps so this isn't unique 
to just productivity but really for everything   and i'll put up on screen here it's called 
spotless and this is something this is a   tool that i've been using for quite a while 
now because what it does is it will auto hide   and clean up your files and you can actually go 
as far to customize it that it does this on a   daily weekly bi-weekly however frequently you 
want basis which is huge because of course as you   are working on your computer and doing different 
things more files are accumulating so the fact   that you can set it to based on how frequently 
you want it to be changing or organizing your   computer for you is really huge and i don't even 
know let me see if i can find a stack quickly okay yeah i literally on screen here i or on my 
computer i just pulled up do people focus better   in a clean environment or like you know am i just 
unique in that way but no there's been so many   studies that show clutter actually affects your 
brain and how you work and that's not just the   environment you are in your external environment 
that includes your environment on your computer   if your mac is a complete mess yes i know i have a 
very messy desktop but that's very easily cured if   your mac though is a complete mess you don't know 
where your applications are you aren't organized   that's going to in turn affect the way you work 
there's no question in that it's just science it's   just it's just facts okay but i really wanted to 
share with you some of the apps that i use because   i get asked often about that how what apps do you 
use to stay organized and productive and i really   have to be on top of that because as i mentioned 
at the beginning of this video being into software   being a software engineer being a content creator 
tech youtuber all of those things they take a lot   of time and trying to grow your business 
with growing your tech career with growing   you know maintaining a social life and all that it 
is hard it is a full-time 24 7 thing so any apps i   can use to make me make my day or make my week go 
smoother is key so thank you set up i absolutely   love all of your apps and i always find another 
like i'll pull up on screen here again because   there's so many more apps that i went through 
and i always find one of my favorite things   to do when i'm bored or just kind of like you 
know looking around is to go on and actually   look at all the apps they have because sometimes 
hey i didn't even know that existed and this   could really solve this problem of mine so 
i link them down below so make sure to go   check them out okay let's move on though to 
something we've all been kind of waiting for   which is my screen time and i wanted to tie 
this into this video because if we're going   to be spending so much time on our screens we 
might as well make it to some degree productive   and i'm not going to i don't know can you do 
it on your mac i'm sure you can but for this   one i'm going to show you on my phone because 
i'm i'm always on my phone so my my screen time   my daily average are you ready what do you think 
it is okay here we go let me see i'll put it up   on screen but this is for real for real focus 
i'll put a screenshot up but it is four hours   and 33 minutes per day is it a lot is that 
a little i don't know let's see what the can i see what the most is let's see so the most is social and creativity then 
entertainment so the most used no surprise here   is tick tock i love tick tock it's so fun 
then i have instagram i have splice which is a video editing app i use and then i have youtube 
safari and camera it's crazy though it's so crazy   how many times like you use your apps in a 
day or use different tools in a day and it really   makes you think of how much time we are losing 
in a day by just going on especially social media   i'm curious to know though if you are willing 
to admit and just be honest with me as well as i   is with you what is your daily average for screen 
time when i searched it up the average like i just   looked it up the average is between four and eight 
hours a day so i think i'm on the low side which   is kind of surprising but in all honesty 
i spend most of my time on my computer   like a solid eight hours a day i would say it 
sounds so crazy but yeah i mean i work on it   eight hours a day social on it everything it's 
crazy anyways i hope you found this video very   helpful going through some of my favorite apps 
that i use on my mac to stay productive if you   have any other app suggestions leave them down 
below and i will see you all soon thanks everyone you
