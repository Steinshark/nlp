this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] so i guess the two things i wanted to discuss what the idea of the a city and the idea or that a city has a kind of intelligence or consciousness and and that is the first kind of thing i want to discuss and the second thing i want to discuss is the nature of church and how that relates to i guess our own spiritual journey i think those two things are the things that stand out for me personally listening to a lot of your youtube material and those are the two like interesting ideas to me like the idea of a city as a something maybe conscious and the idea that we can't kind of go it alone in this life and the kind of individualistic like attempt to do that has a limit and the community and the place of kind of community in that in that journey so i guess i guess the main thing with the city is you've said before that like a city is something we can pray to that we that we can communicate with in a way that's analogous to a person so i can ask my friend the question and that friend can choose to respond to that question or not and but that's a kind of prayer there or entreaty to my friend like oh what do you think of this or like that and in a similar way i can do that in a city or a or a something that's not as obviously a person as my friend in the sense that they don't have a physical fleshy body a city doesn't necessarily have that so i guess i'm trying to think of how to formulate the question maybe i can i can help you if you want because i understand the difference you are i understand how it's difficult to think about it that way so the first thing maybe to the first thing to understand is that a city definitely has a body right it it it does have a fleshy physical body okay it's just that it's not as it's not it's not a body that we can perceive at a glance the way that we perceive a person at a glance right so encounter person there he is like he's contained in space i can i can you know i can go around them you know the city is also like that but just bigger it's just it's just bigger and the space between the parts let's say are bigger than the space between your parts but you also have space between your parts too right there's there's massive amounts of space between your molecules and between your different parts it's just that at the at the human level we don't necessarily interact with them that's that's the first thing that's important now the second thing that's important to really understand is that all the things you encounter of the city are always parts of the city and so they don't contain the intelligence of the city they only manifest it at their level that's really important because we're not which is all we can ever encounter so we can is that as me in bristol for example i can only encounter the expressions of the identity of bristol in its particular ways in which that participates in that my story is that we were saying exactly but not only not only that but it's actually similar to even the way you encounter a person because when you encounter a person you you're encountering their their body and you're encountering the sounds that they make or the you have all these experiences and then behind that you can perceive the intelligence but the intelligence is is not limited to the the the fleshy stuff and the stuff i hear right and so it's that's the that's what's that's why sometimes when people say when i say something like intel like it's a a city has being if the city has intelligence then then people for some reason they're still there and they have to exist within the mater this weird material world where the intelligence behind it so so you can even imagine yourself like even not only even your physical parts but let's say even your mental parts like your mental parts are multiple for different situations but they all embody something like your spirit which is completely invisible and beyond the parts so if i ask you if i ask you to show me how to cook right or if i ask you to i don't know like i ask you a deeply personal questions it's not the same part of you that will engage me there'll be different parts of you that will engage me depending on your prayer exactly depending on your prayer and so you could imagine that like let's say your your spirit will send emissaries and those emissaries will will manifest different aspects of you depending on what is needed so if i come at you with a knife then you're not going to answer me with the same emissary as if i if i come to you with flowers right it's going to be a different you're going to send a different part of you and so you can understand that the city is the same where you know you you write like if you need something you know let's say you there's a pothole in your street it's right in so and so now you want to get rid of the pothole so you you obviously won't write to the the to like let's say the the people that take care of the of the parks let's say you'll write to the people that take care of this of this treaty so you'll write to the the the to the person at the city garage or whatever whatever how it's structured in your city and then you'll write them and you'll ask them to to come fix your pothole right and so those people they're bound by the rules of the city but they're not acting just as joe and jane because they suppo they're supposed to act according to the budget according to the general projects according to the the way in which these these roads are built so they're supposed to embody the will of the city so it strikes me as well that like there's an interesting connection between human beings as conscious and the city so when you say the city has a body one of the ways to think about that is that like every member every human member that makes it up is comprises that body and so i guess what i another question that comes to mind is like is it so like i recognize there is a kind of consciousness and intelligence to the city is that consciousness or intelligent intelligence kind of in our image if you if you know what i'm saying like in the sense of the words consciousness and intelligence personally i can only really have a sense of what that means in terms of like this living life like the phenomenology like my experience i guess and the and i guess there's theological traditions that talk about the the the nature of the human soul and or the human person and so and and like humans kind of have to establish cities like a city couldn't be intelligent without human intelligence is kind of what it seems to me and if that's so are they there's a way in which we could think that that therefore we're kind of projecting a kind of i have a kind of consciousness and therefore i recognize something similar in the city but i don't want to go that far because i do hear what you're saying like there is a genuine kind of autonomy kind of coming back at me from from the city side like that is is acting like a city but so think about it they think about it in terms of your your parts it's the best way to understand if you want to help you understand it you need to be able to try to find the analogies of your part right so you could say that you have processes let's say in your in your mind or in your experience so you have you have you have certain processes that manage different aspects of your of your reality you have processes that manage or express your emotions you have processes that will calculate you have different processes and it's not it's not like you don't even have to be able to fully identify them let's say there could be some malleability in that yeah but those those you could say that those process your singular existence your soul your spirit is is an image of those smaller processes you could do it the same like the manner in which the processes unify a certain aspect of reality so let's say you have a certain process which unifies different things together and kind of manifest then in the same way you the top part do you do the same to all the all the processes so so if to say for example that one is the image of the other it's just it's not a it's not super used it could be useful i see not that it's not as useful as you think maybe you know so it's genuinely fractal i guess is yeah it is so similar yeah yeah it's freckle all the way down because those processes will have processes and there's an indefinite amount of sub levels where each sub level will have the same structure as the higher level so we but then we that scales up that scales up too from the from the unit from the person into communions of persons and so but you can also if you want to understand at least let's say like how the how the being of a city works you can understand it let's say if you've ever found yourself as the leader of a team you can experience the higher consciousness of a city when you're a leader you can actually experience it because all of a sudden you have a bigger body but it's not you because obviously if it was just you people wouldn't follow you it's because you're the leader of the team doing something in common but you can nonetheless participate in that experience where it's like you know you're you're sitting at a table and then people tell you their opinions and then you decide and you say we're going to do this and then all of a sudden all the different agents align themselves in front of what you've decided and now they act as an extension of your body well i guess and so then that kind of brings the idea of authority to mind because they do that they do that if you have authority right because if you don't and and maybe that's like doing it in the name of something so like in the name of in the name of this end we're going to do this so do we all want to pursue this end and then that's like just kind of adjust kind of pattern right that's exactly the way it works and so you can understand it so for example if you want to understand a society you could understand let's say a medieval structure of a society where they had they had a almost like a caste system because those that pray those that fight those that work and they're embedded into each other that is that let's say you do business but if you're if when you do business you're not serving a higher goal then at some point it's going to become self-devouring and it's not going to sustain reality that's when you get you get parasitical parasitic patterns you get idolatry is a good way to understand it so imagine someone in city services becomes a little tyrant and decides to do things for themselves and so so they become corrupt does that mean to be to be like to name it's kind of like there's a self naming in that right like you follow me like why do we do this because me like because of my name instead of like in a higher name yeah that's what idolatry is that's why the idea that the gods required worship like this whole thing that they're talking about in lord of spirits the idea that the gods took worship for themselves and in doing that they castrate the father right they cut themselves away from the seed of that which is above them and when they do that then they open they open the door for corruption underneath them it's like they're basically opening the door for revolution and breakdown so when you so so you can see it like it you can see it in a city when a city becomes corrupt and then the people in the city start to act on their own accord and they don't act towards the communion of the city at the higher goal of it then you get social breakdown and it manifests itself all the way down that the money doesn't get to the projects the streets aren't fixed the building start to fall apart the police doesn't police properly everything starts to fragment because the different principalities aren't aligned towards the towards the higher higher identity so so i guess this kind of connects to the second thing i wanted to talk about with with church like the the word like ecclesia kind of brings this connotation of like community and so there's so a city breaks down if it's not structured according to the right authority i guess i'm wondering like what how do mean you as members of our cities change that or like what kind of agency do we have in that process and i think that's connected to to prayer or like even more well like generally culture things like music things like street art or like just the ways the city kind of manifests one of the ways i thought about this idea of a city and then just an electronic music producer i really love has has written music that kind of seems to me to like capture the soul of london and like there's it's just when i was meditating on this idea that you'd mention the city as a being and then so so my point is is that as members we're we seem to be kind of do i want to say co-creating or kind of like are the way in which we use our logos or the way in which we pray and ask different questions of the city kind of is connected to the fate of the city isn't it and yeah what would you make what do you make of that and i guess sorry it's a bit of a rambling one um now maybe i'll just shut up yeah but so so the first thing you need to understand the first thing also you need to understand is that the city itself is not the top of the hierarchy of being right and so it's like the city will only be alive if it's ultimately aligned towards higher goods besides just the this besides just the city itself it has to be it has to be attached to god ultimately you could say you know in order for things to lay themselves out properly and so of course it's hard because things never tend to not rarely be completely aligned under god you could say but so a way in which a way in which for example let's say you you're you're in a city and you see the city fall apart it's falling apart now the one of the ways to stop the city from doing that is to attach yourself to a higher good so you can think of it like so think of it so an easy way would be something like an easy way to understand it would be that if you're writing the city you say you're writing the city because the pothole is falling so you're sending a letter to the to the to the the municipal garage or whatever and then they're not doing it so at some point you're going to write a letter to your counselor city councilor right and then but then it's not happening and then at some point you're going to write a letter to right to the mayor whatever you're going to escalate the hierarchy in order to make to see things happen and so you could understand that that also embodiment is part of that which is that if you're watching the breakdown of the city around you like you embodying the ideal of the city will help to mend things as they're breaking down so you could think of it like right everybody's a jerk to everybody else it's a big city nobody's talking to anybody it's like i'm gonna be the exception i'm going to make cookies for my neighbor or whatever it is you decide to do to to restructure your immediate surrounding according to a higher good and the amount of transformation you can you can create is really surprising actually yeah you can be very surprised at how much transformation you can bring about by doing that we tend to we tend to neglect the neglect the capacity for people because what you you're sending out ripples and you're actually creating new models because one of the people model themselves on each other that's how we work right we and so if there are no models around us then we we tend to degenerate now if we if someone just sets themselves up as a model people will start to imitate it especially if it's a model that is that is bringing about a a greater good or they'll hate you it could be either one they could either model or they could hate you and then it'll still transform them even though you transform them even though they hate you right that's like one of the what's one of the revelations of the christian mystery let's say is that sometimes when you do that they hate you and they kill you or whatever they eject you but then it's still it still does it it still does the trick even though it's not it's not fun for you yeah yeah so like it does the pattern of that you said you know the self-eating idea like that seems almost like logically well you use the word self-defeating so it's like is there a way where that pattern is kind of i don't know metaphysically broken and that the true authority kind of idea we were talking about like well we'll come back yeah you can imagine it like there are several ways out of the out of the chaos one is to restore to remember right i use those terms a lot in my videos remember remember that which binds us remember that which connects us and so in remembering you're reconnecting yourself and you're you know but the other way is also the way down is works too but it's just that it's it's not as fun right it's like if things total if everything breaks down and total chaos rains then you know whatever seed is there is going to grow in that chaos but it can be painful right yeah yeah no thank thanks for thanks for exploring that with me okay i guess the the other kind of thing was was it it's a bit is it yeah it's a bit of a different topic so it's like how can i say so i guess what i learned personally this last year is the the how my own prayer it's like the the how impotent my own prayer is or something like that or like at least my own efforts and my own self-reliance how i guess in terms of my spiritual life like being aimed in the wrong direction sinning there's lots of ways in which i'm aware of doing that myself and like i want to stop doing that and repent and turn and aim in a different direction and i guess i've made as earnest an effort as i can to do that this year yeah and it failed yeah it was just like being that's the meaning of humility i guess is like being very brought low in that kind of thing and then and so i guess the reason i'm mentioning it is because one of the things that really struck me in your work is this kind of call to church and and church as community or as kind of something higher than just my own self-reliance and i just it strikes me as intuitively true you're saying that i'm just personally figuring out i guess what the ideal structure of prayer is or like do others need to be praying around me in the same direction these kind of questions like is me trying to ask the right questions alone gonna be enough because it doesn't seem to be it seems like we all kind of need to pray together kind of thing and so i've seen that as a big theme in your work so do you like do you think it's like necessary to join community communities or higher bodies to fully to live a spiritual life to like aim properly and to repent of sin can we do it on our own like do what is the place of community etc yeah but i definitely think that it's better it's definitely better because you're also inserting yourself into a hierarchy like a functional hierarchy the difficulty with a lot of spiritual work let's say is that we often get deluded we we just we we think we're acting towards our own good but we're all we're actually just imbibing our own passions we don't even realize it and so it's good to have people around you to be able to point that out to you or be able to kind of burst your bubble of the of illusion so i think that that's definitely it's better to be part of an actual community and for sure it's like a like the church for example like a traditional church what's what's great about that is that you're also involved in in the hierarchy of authority and so right if your buddy like let's say your buddy is comes up to you and says you know what you should lay off a sauce you drink too much or whatever you know i mean maybe like maybe it'll have an effect on you or maybe not right it's difficult because it's not like they have an authority over you but they don't they they're not allowed to tell you what to do and so putting yourself in a situation where you have someone who's actually allowed to tell you what to do it can be sometimes be useful because when someone tells you what to do like this is like the secret that the entire modern world hates they don't realize it but when someone tells you what to do they are also inviting you especially if they have authority over you they're also inviting you to draw your capacity to do it in them because it's like you're you're you're actually you're you're drawing your attention you're drawing your capacity to do whatever you need to do in them and they also bear some responsibility on whether or not you succeed right yeah they do right they so imagine a parent with a child right it's like a parent tells the child what to do the child doesn't do it the child is naughty but the fact that the child doesn't do it actually reflects on the parent and so the parent actually has has some responsibility for the fact that the child doesn't do it and so in a spiritual relationship with with a with a spiritual father with a priest that's what's also what happens is that they are when they tell you what to do they are also somewhat making themselves responsible for the consequence of that to a certain extent not completely it's yours but it's also theirs as well and so so that that's actually like if you've ever experienced someone let's say you're you're in a sports team is a good way to experience it it's actually pretty simple right it's like a coach tells you what to do and it's like he could have said many things but he says this this is the play this is what we're going to do and he's like it's going to work the church or the team captain it's going to work this is going to be our our play and so you're like yeah all right and so you draw in what that person tells you to do the energy to do it and then you do it and if it fails it's not just your fault it's his fault too yeah he can call you out though he could call you out and say i saw you didn't put all your juice into the play like i saw you kind of skimped out on us you didn't totally put yourself into it there'll be a negotiation between whose responsibility is but it's not going to just be yours so there's a there's an advantage to community which is that that's a great advantage do you think that's a do you think that's necessary and essential like because it because yeah you mentioned the modern age and it strikes me that like that's kind of the whole problem is like our relationship to authority and our like and maybe it's something to do with adolescence and growing and like trying to become someone independent of our parents i don't know but there's a kind of modern resistance to all authority and it that seems to be connected to a whole host of problems yeah but the thing is the secret is that it's it's actually not it's both it's the the kind of obsession with let's say removing authority like this kind of obsession with like being your own man and acting in authority and everything is in isn't it funny that that way of thinking came comes about at the same time as the state is acquiring absolute power over your life that it's actually those extremes will just real traditional authority is more fractal and is more organic and is this kind of negotiation and discussion between the levels whereas our world is rock and roll rebel you know rock and roll rebel taking drugs doing whatever i want dude i'm totally totally free and i can't build like i can't put like a a porch on my house without getting a permit from the city and i have to do it with like so many feet and so much thing and everything and it's like that's that's the modern world the modern world is those two extremes at the same time it's like an extreme of of like ultimate absolute power that completely permeates your existence and at the same time this kind of weird anarchist anarchist rebellion like the internet is a perfect example of that the internet exemplifies that that extreme in in the such a sublime way that it's almost you know it's the promise of like doing of being anything you want of saying anything you went if you want metaverse you could be whatever you want there's no limit you could become you could be a lobster a centaur if you want and in metaverse there's no limit but really interesting it's like they'll be controlling every word you say at the same time so it's like it's an interesting extreme that the modern world is yeah which is i guess just authority creeping back in right it's like the authorities there either way but it's like it's like an extreme authority based on an extreme freedom and it's not a normal it's not a normal negotiated fractal authority because it's like in in a normal world like think of a parent and a child right like a normal parent right so the parent says do this right and then they have to be attentive to the child even if they don't know they are because i could say i want you to do this like i want you to clean your room and it's like the child's like okay i'll obey my parents i'll clean my room then the parent could say i want you to clean your room i want you to clean the house i want you to paint the house i want you and it's like just and then of a sudden it's like the child will just not do it it won't and it's the same child that was willing to do the clean the room at the outset then they won't and so it's like relationship normal relationships between authority and and people under authority is is a constant like observing negotiation and and and it's like and then the child has to perceive that they get something from that relationship too so there's like a fittedness that's really interesting and that and that is constraining excess yeah and is that connected to the encounter of persons like oh like there's a yeah is that because of relationship that i'm fitting myself to my parent or to my authority and trying to come into the proper relationship and yeah there is something very like living or organic about that and so you're saying that i guess the internet or maybe technology generally but let's say the internet is not a living in that same way it just tends towards extremes it just tends towards extremes and the extreme the ex it's the it's the extreme talk so think about think about in your person right so it's like man i want to be free from all these authorities i want to be free i want to be free it's like i want to be free to do whatever i want and then the guy starts drinking and drinking or whatever and then becomes an alcoholic and all of a sudden is a slave to that god like an absolute slave and they're all their reality now becomes negotiated for that one thing that has now enslaved them so that's the that's the irony the irony of of wanting to break down the structures of of normal structures of authority end up creating tyrannical structures of authority that that will just completely control you it's actually in the in the process itself it just happens it's not yeah i don't that makes sense yeah i mean yeah it makes some sense i guess i guess the yeah i guess the main thing i the way i'm thinking about it is like it it it's just it's it's this submission thing because like in the sports thing you mentioned or like the military might be another good example there's a military particularly there's this emphasis on like submission like it's like you can't actually be a part of the body without submission right like if you're not submitting to the your local authority and you're not in right relation as you're saying you're like out of the body like it cannot kind of exist if that's the case yeah you have to submit and in the military especially like in a normal kind of military world there'll be a fittedness of course you'll be fittedness because it's like the if the commander can tell you okay now run 10k it's like that's something but he's not going to say run 100k yeah like if he says that he's just his his troop is going to is going to disband it's going to cease to exist or they're going to die why do you think that is he's just asking too much of them yeah it's just not fit it's just not fitted but you could get them to run 100 100k but you would need a concentration camp where the people are prisoners and now you say you do that or i kill you and then they will run 100k right that's what i mean it's like it's like that there's a let's say that the extremes let's say it's those extremes that that show break down the pattern it's like you're saying there's a kind of organic or intrinsic justice to the authority like if i'm if someone is submitted to me there's almost like an inherent just this is probably the word i want to use to to the demands i can actually make on those below i guess for practical reasons as well yeah it's just inevitable like it it's it's just really reality playing itself out if you're not attentive to the needs of so you could say so for example like you could say that the french revolution is is a was a result of a breakdown in the normal relationship of authority that should exist in in a society and so it's like i cannot i can disagree with the peasants killing the king but i can understand it i can understand why as the as let's say the the aristocracy separated itself from its people and then stopped actually engaging in just wanted to get taxes from their land but weren't there like making sure the kids were going to school you know making sure his his serps were were receiving medical treatment or whatever it is that a lord should do then at some point it doesn't hold like it that that that system doesn't hold and it's like that for all normal authority systems i mean something that people today have such difficulty understanding but it's like the idea for example that like jordan peterson jokes about that joke but you mentioned that a lot like the idea that like women have been oppressed for 10 000 years by men and that like the the characteristic of of relationship between men and women has been like masculine dominance and oppression it's just it's just absolute  like it could never it could never be sustainable like there would always have to be a negotiation between between between the the relationship between the man and the woman and sometimes it might go a little too much on one side sometimes it might go a little too too little on the other side but you can't really you can't hold it in the extreme for a long time unless you supplement it with technology if you supplement it with technology then you can go really far in one direction or the other so you can create you can create i think that's something it seems intuitively it feels like that's connected to use the word organic it it just feels like the a computer's not organic and that there's something there like there's something like quantitative and logarithmic or algebraic or you know about that whole system that isn't like my relationship to my mother or my boss or the different human persons i encounter yeah but it's it's extension of power it's always an extension of human power and so so let's say in a normal like in a normal relationship let's say in a normal in a normal power relationship right there's a leader and there's someone following them so the leader asks something of the person following them and that person kind of follows maybe they use a little bit of coercion at some point there's a limit at some points like at some point it's just going to break but if i have a gun i have way more power over you to make you do whatever the hell i want i say right if i have a if i have a military then i can make then i can push that further if i have a system of of of spying if i have a system of of controlling your of turning off your bank account if i have power if i have material power then i can go further in the extreme and the same even for like in terms of the anarchy it's like anarchy is only possible in a very controlled you know a system that has a lot of resources because in a normal system without a lot of power it doesn't hold it just you die you just die really fast it's like i want nothing to do with these people i don't want to participate in their society you know i'm a rebel yeah okay let's see how long you survived my friend you know it's like but we only do that we can only do be that way in a world that is so completely padded with with a kind of technocratic society that we don't we don't see it like it's yeah so all of these things end up being co-related i see i guess yeah the final i guess to come towards wrapping up it would be like the i'm curious about the relationship between like why don't we accept authority like i think there's a kind of i guess one of my intuitions was around the adolescent kind of rebellion idea but also like i think there's a connection between the more i've learned about christianity and kind of reflected on my own life like humility or being brought low and and submission yeah i just i wonder what you think about why we don't accept authority and what how we might how viewers or how how we might look to come into a proper relationship i mean the best way is to understand i think the best way for us to understand is that it's inevitable right that authority is inevitable that we actually we we follow authority all the time you know every time you stop at a stop sign every time you drive on the right side of the road you're obeying authority we obey authority all the time and so i think that at least becoming aware of that can help us understand the inevitability of this like like i said a lot of people who think that they're being rebels and and as they're deluded they think they are and they they they maybe act that way on some vectors but they are not like it's it's a it's a it's a little bit of an illusion which is based on this padding that we talked about so i think that that's probably a good idea is to just realize that it's inevitable and then also understand the negotiation part or understand that authority isn't always just top down it's just very rarely so especially in normal authority relationships because i need to a lot i need to follow your command for it to be authority right then yeah and i need to follow it but i also need to how can i say this it's like i need to get something from authority there's absolutely if i don't get something from authority the only way you will be able to let's say enforce your authority will be through brute force total brute force now and brute force is is is exhausting it's tiring yeah it takes your energy it takes up energy and so it's it's a it's a simple it's like it's it's a kind of a simple system and you can see it like you can see it like it's in modern classrooms like modern classrooms are great because the teacher doesn't have real authority like doesn't have normal authority and it's recognized that in a way the children the the teacher isn't an authority figure right and that's in the culture so the kids they they they'll flip between being screamed at by like a hysterical person to doing whatever they want and not listening to what the teacher says and it's like there isn't because they don't understand authority they can't they don't even the teacher doesn't understand authority because the teacher is part of this weird weird world where they they also think that some they're teachers but they think authority is bad you know it's like you know that's that's not going to work so they end up like going between extremes but normally what you would have is that the right the students know that if they obey authority things are going to go better for them and for everybody else and if it doesn't then at some point it's also might they might not continue to to obey like it's just gonna it's gonna break down people will go somewhere else yeah i it's it's interesting thinking about my experience at school because i agree i think they were they were on one extreme teachers who abdicated authority entirely but also just tyrants who i don't know tyrants but like teachers who would go around say like you know tuck your like tuck your shirt in do your tie up like you know keep that aesthetic proper and you know that teacher was obviously perceived as a bit of a bad like just annoyance or tyrant in our school you know always kind of known for that but then i guess it relates to i don't know i think i want to say justice like whether the authority is justified like do i understand like why should i dug my shirt in yeah and what like why and i think that's kind of what you're pointing at there with this with the way in which schools aren't kind of like connected to so think of your best teachers like think of your best teachers usually most people like maybe i'm wrong but most people if you ask them who their best teachers were they usually identify something like a teacher was who was very strict but very involved like a teacher that was quite strict the way that they ran their classroom was actually quite demanding in terms of what they asked of the students but were completely dedicated and would give you the time would take the time to help you understand if you were wanting to understand they would write comments in your papers they would they would you know like they would they would care and so it's like you're strict but you care so that's like that's a really amazing thing you know and so it's like we tend to not be able to realize that that exists we tend to think if someone's strict it's because they're tyrants and they don't care and because and if someone is is just lets things go then it's because they care but they're not strict it's like no actually those two things together are usually what make a pretty good teacher totally oh thanks for that jennifer therefore that yeah that particular note there is like might be a nice place to end it i think that's that's a really yeah like the the merciful and the just the strict the love and and the and the discipline as well yeah and i love i love the stuff about fittedness and relationship in authority because i've never necessarily made that connection before i thought i'm happy that it was it was useful yeah good conversation i enjoyed it for sure cool let me see as you know the symbolic world is not just a bunch of videos on youtube we are also a
