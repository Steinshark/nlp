and you have this fundamental vision of optimism you call yourself an optimist i mean in this world i have a sort of i see myself a little bit as the main character from the idiot by dostoevsky who was also kind of seen by society as a fool because he was optimistic so one can you maybe articulate where that sense of optimism comes from and maybe also try to articulate your vision of the future where people are inspired or optimism drives us yes it's easy to forget that when you look at social media and so on with the word toxicity and negativity can often get more likes that optimism has a sort of a beauty to it and i i do hope it's out there so what can you try to articulate vision yeah so i mean for me optimism and being an optimist is just seeing the silver lining in every cloud you know even in tragedy it brings people together and the question is can we see that can you see can you see the beauty that is in everything i don't think optimism is foolishness i don't think optimism is blindness though it probably involves some naivete the belief that things will get better the belief that that we tend towards the good even in times of struggle or bad you know you can't sustain war but you can sustain peace you know i think i think things that are stable are more sustainable things that are optimistic and more sustainable than things that are you know chaotic cp+ fundamentally good i mean some people may disagree that you can't stress you can sustain peace you can't sustain war i mean you don't have to you i think war is costly you know it involves life and money and peace does not involve those things it requires work i'm not saying it doesn't require work but it it doesn't drain resources i think the same way that war does you know the people that would say that we will always have war and i just talked to the story in a stalin is you know would say the conflict and desire for power and conflict is central to human nature is sucker but something in your words also perhaps it's the naive aspect that i also share is that you have an optimism that people are fundamentally good and i'm an idealist you know and i think idealism is good i'm not i'm not a fool to believe that the ideals that i imagined can come true of course they'll never be world peace but shouldn't we die trying you know i think that's the whole point that's the point of vision vision should be idealistic and it should be all all practical purposes impossible but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try and it's the it's the milestones that we we reach that take us closer to that ideal that make us feel that our life and our work have meaning and we're contributing to something bigger than ourselves you know we just because it's impossible doesn't mean we shouldn't try as i said we're still moving the ball down the field we're still making progress things are still getting better even if we never get to that that ideal state so i think idealism is a is a good thing you
