ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the world chess championship 2023 in the absence of magnus carlson we've got yanyupomnishu from russia and dingly ren from china first game was a draw second game went to yanipomchi with a fantastic game with the black pieces so he leads the early match one and a half to half it's the best of 14. so if you get seven and a half points you are crowned as the world champion and if it's seven to seven then we have a playoff no no further intro today welcome back to the channel if you're a returning view review for some reason clicked on this and it's your first chess video give it a chance it's a beautiful game so in the first game if you'll remember jan went e4 was e5 knight f3 knight c6 bishop b5 it was all this good stuff a6 bishop a4 knight f6 castles bishop e7 and then jan surprised everybody on move six by taking ding's knight now none of that and i mean literally none of that happened to start game two because i have an eyelash in my eye that's number one and oh god this is so annoying i have to get it out of here because i don't want to restart this recap yeah i'm surprised everybody and played d4 this is fascinating stuff this is very interesting stuff so it worked really well for jan when he played e4 and let's not forget yan is a lifelong e4 player okay and then all of a sudden even though it works he chooses not to engage in any type of warfare in e4 and he says ding what do you have for me and jana is able to do this because he's you know the second ranked chess player in the world he could do whatever he wants but also he he wants to poke in prod and see what eons what what ding has for him now again at the high level of chess folks are going to be playing knight f6 and nowadays the it sounded like somebody crashed into something outside it's a very exciting recap nowadays everybody after c4 is playing e6 e6 to try to play either queen's gambit declined if white plays knight f3 in fact this was the position reached in game two after the first couple of moves or if knight to c3 bishop to b4 now jan is not a d4 player of course he's a fantastic player so he can play whatever he wants but he plays knight c3 on the third move which is a very very pointed statement why i mean i don't write like us chess players we're such nerds he moved his night out to c3 oh my oh dear oh my oh my land oh my like the reason why the move knight c3 is so interesting is yan is forcing ding to play a nimso he says play the sharpest line and enter my territory let's go all right it's like when in a mixed martial arts fight a guy just lays on the ground because he's better at jiu jitsu he's like come in come into my my open guard that might not mean anything to you but that's the point he's like play the nimso ding and then here ding did something absolutely wild okay i just realized by the way that time stamps are not working well i will just keep you updated of their time for some reason today the the the the timestamps just decided to not function okay terrific well we had two days of the time working now we don't in any case the the time obviously should be working but sadly okay well such is life time was not a huge factor in this game that's not really much of a spoiler but they both had a lot of time bishop b4 pins the knight to the king but instead of that ding played d5 now that's weird because if you're gonna play knight f6 and e6 you might as well in this position play the nimso or you should play d5 because you're gonna get the exact same position so this move order is considered inaccurate because you could have just played the nimso indian so it's a very interesting thing here that ding says i'm not comfortable playing into an im so against i like i don't know what he's gonna play or maybe i don't know there's psychological warfare i don't know but he plays d5 and the reason why this is considered inaccurate is white hasn't actually played knight f3 so white can take and play what's known as the exchange variation of the queen's gambit decline which is which is just considered a little bit better for white so it's already kind of interesting to see like ding has made another big concession i mean he's effectively said like i don't want to play into the nimso we're not plugging to any nimso bishop g5 which which you know honestly when i saw this i was like that's not a good sign i mean why are you starting with the nimso move order but you're claiming you don't want to play them so it's very interesting right so it's like oh i'm gonna do this and they're like all right so do it and you're like uh listen bro i was just you know excited okay so c6 right this is a very common idea strength in the center if take the queen can take and it doesn't matter one's defended white plays e3 and the reason this entire thing is considered slightly advantageous for white without putting the knight on f3 is because historically what will happen is white will put the knight on e2 which is very interesting i mean you this is stuff you just don't know you know if you just mostly consume the youtube shorts or tick tock or whatever right like you you don't know and now you're learning you're learning that in the queen's gambit exchange variation white likes to put the knight on e2 and then play f3 and e4 and get a big center there look at that you should learn something how many of you just learned that incredible so h6 bishop h4 this is always considered useful for black keeps the options of g5 and various trades black now blocks the pin with the bishop white develops the bishop to d3 black castles and white plays queen c2 as i told you yan is very very very familiar with the intricacies of the position and he plays queen c2 singh plays the move rookie 8 because the rook is going to be more useful on the e-file when everything moves white plays knight e2 and now white is going to play f3 and e4 and life is going to be good now another reason black plays rookie 8 is so that when he plays the move knight d7 knight f6 and knight g8 six and knight e6 are possible and also the queen side is supported now one more thing you will notice that black has struggled to develop this bishop that is another point of why there is no knight on that square because if you tried to develop your bishop to g4 it would be a horrible mistake because i would go here and then you would need to go back and then your bishop would be a target and you would have kick-started some attack for me so there's no reason to do that and again bishop e6 kind of the same thing like i'm i'm gonna go get your bishop and just be slightly better so rookie 8 knight d7 and then here historically the move that's been played is the move f3 and people like to play f3 before they castle all right and what black will do oftentimes is blackwell for example if black attacks this pawn this bishop comes back and now white is completely equipped to play e4 and if white gets to play something like you know de4 and so on he will be happy you have to prepare this you cannot rush it because there is knight g4 but that's sort of the idea like for example maybe you play g4 h3 and then e4 maybe you play long castle or something and then you you can play for g4 but this is kind of like the point you have a rock solid formation your knight is you know not on the f3 square and it's only two square instead where it can potentially go behind certain pawns and and this is sort of the idea in this particular case maybe you don't play for e4 you play for g4 h4 but the point still stands like uh you're you're that that is like what you are trying to achieve is the movie for in some cases you can go here and play g4 h4 but that's the idea all right now in the game nepo castle the reason he castled is because recently after f3 top level players have been playing b5 and actually black has been kind of okay because this traditional idea of playing e4 just runs into b4 when your center is destabilized and if you can't play the move e4 and you just castle it's like all right well i've always got this lurking so he castles now is things where things start to get really weird in this game ding does not play b5 or knight f8 or any of like these moves ding plays the move a5 which is a extremely rare move but it's an extremely rare move that ding himself has played recently and the idea i guess is not commit anything and just take some space just take some space he's letting me take the space i will take the space now white has a few ways of responding here white in the queen's gambit the client exchange has something called a minority attack possibility you know a beat it it's three pawns versus four pawns and because you have a pawn minority you can try to play a3 before b5 and and so on and so forth so that's exactly what he does now ding plays officially the only game in the database the combination of a5 and knight h5 trying to trade these pieces is what ding plays and now the only game remaining in the database except the one that's currently happening is anish giri dingly ren played online in 2022 so ding has nepo exactly where he wants him in something that he's completely comfortable seeing wait or maybe jan has ding exactly where he wants him because maybe young prepared and analyzed that entire game both players made it to this position 26 total moves and jan has found his way into something that ding has already played before he plays rookie one that is exactly what anish giri did knight f8 opening the bishop and preparing to reroute the knight back into the center that is exactly what ding did in that game knight c1 that is exactly what anish giri did in that game now we have knight back to f6 f3 and as i said the movie 4 is prepared you give black you give black one dead move white is completely winning like white is just breaking through so with that looming ding needs to prevent the move e4 he chooses not to focus on the square that's controlled five times by white's pieces he chooses to control that and he plays knight a6 which is exactly what he did in his game against the niche giri now knight to e2 all right now i think knight e2 was a novelty i think anish giri played queen f2 so defending the pawn via via diagonal all right and in that game ding had no problem so officially on move 17 we have a brand new position and dingley ren fires back at the center with the move c5 the knights stabilize the pawns and black is fighting back despite not having as much good development as white white has moved every piece already black has not moved two of his pieces now the move c5 of course would love to play c4 so for instance if if black can successfully play something like c4 and b5 b4 he'll be very happy so in this position yan does not take the pawn on c5 he plays bishop b5 he has a lot of other moves for example here the computer was giving knight f4 immediately trying to give more pressure onto this pawn on d5 if you take on f4 of course you are just opening problems for yourself and in this position it is not a good idea to trade the queen for the two rooks why is it not a good idea to do this you're far behind in development i will take on c5 that's not any good so knight f4 is is a very interesting possibility and it could have led to a position where where jan had some meaningful pressure on the e-file another option instead of knight f4 was to potentially just keep the tension in the center with the move queen d2 but bishop b5 is what young chose in the game attacking the rook and dingley ran still does not trade bishops and plays rook dates he still has not moved this bishop so maybe now there is a threat to lock this bishop out of the territory so now jan took on c5 queen takes c5 and defended his center with the move queen d2 now here there was a very interesting moment ding could have probably just played d4 like we've been talking about this the entire game i mean his pawns are a little bit suspicious if he's able to push them forward we're gonna get knight d4 knight d4 eg4 queen d4 queen d4 rook d4 and this is probably just an easy draw although of course black is still a little bit behind in development and you know yeah it's never too late to do something stupid and lose not at their level but again like black can't just rush and lose the pawn so that is one thing but ding ding did not do that ding did not play d4 he played bishop d7 and then found this really nice idea to take with the knight the point is you cannot take d5 if you play queen takes d5 i'm gonna get this and even though material is equal black is just better black is more active this is now stupid because this was supposed to support a center there is no center so knight takes d7 and dingley ren is better with black what dingly ren has a better position after 20 moves with black i mean you talk about bulletproof queen's gambit decline preparation so jan puts his knight in the center the problem is you're better in the queen's gambit declined which it's like you know it's it even though you are a touch better it's so so so so so solid it's so solid for white and ding plays knight b6 so keeping the tension here and trying to put his knight on c4 and just so you understand how fascinating chess is like watch what happens to the eval if white makes this exchange it goes from point one right to like point it's gonna it's gonna get a little bit bigger point four like the evaluation actually quadruples for black in black's favor unless white tries to like fiend for a queen trade okay now stockfish is trying to make me look like an idiot but essentially what i'm trying to say is at the newbie level we really take for granted like what how how every move matters you cannot just improve your opponent's pawn structure for no reason now your opponent is looking very happy pressure on the c file i thought it would be something like minus 0.5 but okay stockfish is not as impressed with this as i am but the point that i'm trying to make is you cannot just rush into every exchange now ding is going to play knight c4 and he's gonna play b5 jana has to defend himself so young plays rook d1 knight c4 and puts the queen on f2 and this is actually ding's kind of biggest advantage of the game i mean it's only minus point three but he's done an extremely good job here and he plays rook c8 and now rook c8 applies pressure to this knight there is a tactic knight a3 and knight b2 so for instance knight takes b2 queen b2 queen c3 and white's position completely falls apart so a very tense moment in the game right and jan really is struggling to defend himself here he plays knight a4 which attacks the queen and defends the pawn on b2 and ding has to retreat to e7 or to a7 he retreats to e7 the pressure is still mounting the pressure building on the queen side b5 is on the way we have rookie one and now in this position the computer wanted ding to either play queen e8 and then try to go for tactics with knight a3 and then all of this the queen e8's a very interesting move or to play knight takes d4 invite this and play queen f6 or queen d6 and say my knight is better than your knight and i have b5 okay so the computer wanted queen e8 or it wanted knight takes d4 ding instead plays queen f6 with pressure on the knight and b2 jan plays knight b5 and suddenly ding realizes he messed up why did he mess up well if black just waits a move white comes back and suddenly d5 is under fire it's very hard to protect and if you try to repeat moves like you know you try to say oh well you know queen e7 i i'm gonna start attacking you and then maybe f4 f5 f6 so ding needed to play queen e8 or knight takes d4 by playing this he allows yan to immediately find knight b5 creating this opportunity to reroute back to c3 and now knight c7 offering a trade knight d4 back knight e6 knight b5 knight c7 knight d496 and the players did what's called a three-fold repetition in chess you can make a draw by stalemate you can make a draw by offering and agreeing and accepting you can also make a draw by repeating the position or the moves back and forth three times why did jan do this because he has nothing better he's been under pressure for the last couple of moves and he doesn't have any advantage from the opening and he's leading in the match so he really doesn't mind why did ding do this because he made an inaccuracy from a better position by playing the move queen f6 suddenly he lost all of his advantage and if he continues to try to play for a win instead of adapting to the situation that is now in front of him he might get into a worse position because knight c3 is going to put meaningful pressure on this pawn and the pressure on the queen side is actually gone because the knights are suddenly defending each other that is one of the reasons dingley red needed to play queen e8 to prevent this knight from coming to b5 to play b5 himself and he didn't and and he might actually be upset with himself because he was better with black he was better with black and a couple of takeaways even though he played a bad move order he still got an excellent and excellent position which really begs the question why is he not playing just the standard queen's gambit declined right like d5 but he does it this way instead of playing a nym so so fascinating stuff i mean is he gonna play an im so later in the match is young gonna be like all right d4 didn't work i'm only gonna play e4 now i don't know but the match is now two to one this was not the most eventful game but the truth is this this was a big moment because ding had his game with the fewest amount of problems and even though jan won a very very nice game one he went completely away from playing e4 so maybe ting is going to get back into the match after this this was a very good stabilizing game it's two to one and i'll see you for game number four now get out of here
