the monthly chart all at one time what bro you have a multiple charts oh what monitor you got 20 monitors by the way that's not 20. yo to confirm some of this rock solid analysis i looked up some pictures of stock traders here's what looks like to be not a stock trader only three monitors amateur hour now this is what i'm talking about dude this is this this is the setup of a real trader right

investment this is the future but real money real money is just pudgy penguins from now on i do want to show you guys this twitter space room that they were talking about pudgy penguins i want you to hear about what the future of finance looks like guys everyone knows bankers are on the way out influencers are on the way in and you need to know what the future is if you're going to retain a value in this current economy like it's like back in the day you traded wheat then you needed to buy dollars if you didn't have dollars you're out out of the loop right or gold or whatever this is the future of currency you need to understand it i didn't understand it let's listen together to what the greatest minds in finance are talking about and and that and i and my penguin is me and i am my penguin so true right oh my gosh i was going through some crazy things and and thank god like i said i had some supportive people with me along the way i've had some amazing people supporting me and constantly lifting me up now the day of the of the mint i minted so many other projects and i and i invested not money my me i invested me into these projects hmm i didn't know you could do that okay what did it cost me good go to a dealership that'll be twenty thousand dollars sir nah i don't pay in money ah i'm paying me good for some reason when it came to the penguins i didn't know much about cole i didn't know much about mr tubby i didn't know how amazing how influential be stupid stop back up a few seconds i feel like collectively we need to all hear that part one more time i didn't know much about mr tubby i didn't know how amazing how influential these two people were yeah it didn't make sense the second time either i didn't know at that time and i didn't know what they were producing and i said you know what i'll call out on this one regardless of what everybody was telling me i said you know what i'm gonna call out on this one i'm gonna save some money i have a girlfriend let me take her out to a nice dinner about this is my crying and i find myself in a group chat with' whales and all of them are telling me these penguins call mr tubby these are people that we've never come across before the devs the discord the way that they're managing all of this this is absurd this is something that's crazy this is something that we have not seen before i said i want to be a part of this i bought my penguin a few days later this has been the best damn thing i've ever done in my entire life what this man this grown man is crying for penguins the future has left us behind ladies and gentlemen i feel like a lot of people don't get what is this man crying about some of you out there are crying with them they're like i didn't know tubby either i didn't know what

mortgage next week okay it's with the penguins oh my gosh dude i speak for everyone when i say what a journey this has been into the mind of the gen z influenced influence or market i don't know what
