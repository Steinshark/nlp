boys today is a very special day today we're dusting off some videos that quite frankly should have been erased and forgotten but today are being dredged back up from the depths why because quite frankly i think some people need to see them yes they suck yes we will cringe but i think it's important let me explain why listen when i grew up i always wanted to be able to sing yes yes i'm not gonna do it don't worry thank you for sparing me but everyone in my family told me look don't bother you're not good you're not talented and to be fair it was true so i never practiced until in college i saw a video of this small time artist may have never heard of him ed sheeran okay and he showed the first time he had sang before and the results shocked [music] dear me no yeah that's right and i know you know most people laugh at this but for me it was a revelation okay the understanding that people don't just walk out of the womb doing the michael jackson hip thrust and singing like an angel it actually really encouraged me and ever since then i've been sort of shameless about singing everywhere and practicing because i just realized that sucking and being bad is part of the process they were all beginners at some point and that's the real way to think about it you aren't bad at something you are a beginner you are inexperienced it is a growth verse fixed mindset and so today i want to help contribute to that understanding because today we're going to be looking at arguably my only skill in life which is making videos and i'm gonna show you where i started now i'm not at sharon and i know this isn't a late show not doing make-a-wish yet thankfully but hopefully we can give you guys the same lesson okay you don't need to be steven spielberg to understand that we've gotten better so i hope this is an uplifting message for you guys let me set the stage for you where we're at and where it all began ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and i haven't always been in the 10 million dollar studio guys when all this started the dream it all started in a small bedroom in college station taxes guys going to school for chemical engineering i hated it okay my big dream was not to do what i did in school okay and so in my head guys at the time i was thinking i'm gonna go be a youtuber right i'm gonna go do what fred the youtube star did so i in college started making youtube videos and here's the first one that i ever did let's watch and get ready to cringe i know i will now guys i just want to note here that i did get a glass of wine for this because this is going to be tough already i'm offended by the camera angle okay yes that is a that is what we'd call a very artistic choice if we're being very charitable there's me i thought it was gonna be a piano star that's right i'm a mediocre pianist on the best day but i was sure that i was going to be entertaining the masses with my mad skills so let's watch a little bit now don't get excited not too many camera angles here can we get some volume here that's it you know it's not bad i mean i'm not listen my point is not that it's bad honestly we can play it as background music as i give you commentary for what i think for this you can see me trying okay youtube's a video platform though it's a personality platform what am i doing my face isn't on screen my bird like wrists very skinny wrists they're right there i don't know what what's going on i feel like like i'm getting vertigo watching the video so we're just gonna go ahead and move past this now this was back in 2014 guys it's taken me seven years okay to go from this to this all right wait i don't know if that's that impressive actually maybe we should scrap this idea guys not that impressive no i'm just kidding let's just move on now let's fast forward a bit because i don't want to bore you guys it's a lot of me just not understanding how stuff works so this is me three years later okay almost exactly three years later still trying the piano thing bold move okay still looking like a young stud okay not no beard yet those gurus haven't grounded me down into a bulb let's watch a little bit of this so you can see my camera framing has improved you know playing still okay you know we're all right we're not oscar peterson but that's okay i still not by the way okay so i'm doing some weird head gyrating that's how you know that i'm in the mood okay the point is what are we doing here okay this isn't spotify this is youtube who's this guy why should we care i have no on camera anything yet i haven't figured it out okay at some point i realize i'm not the greatest piano player in the world so what do i really have to offer it can't just be piano and that's smoldering smirk okay gotta be something else so i make a shift now this is this was big for me okay i'm gonna walk you guys through and i hope as you're watching you are collectively going oh my gosh it took him three years to realize that he he wasn't going to wow people with solo piano on youtube when there's literally the greatest piano players in the world on youtube it took you three years to figure that out yes it did okay i hope that gives you some context so now okay this is the video guys this is me finally figuring it out i think i just graduated college actually right here i'm realizing the time is now okay let's watch gosh i look so young so there are a lot of big changes coming to this channel and so let's get on with it so firstly i just started college which is super cool because it frees me up a lot to do more things with the channel and it's also super weird because my life is so why is my voice so high pitched i don't i'm not here to roast my i'm sorry i'm sorry go ahead steven from the past keep going sort of been planned out to this point now there's just open anyways so my goal going forward with this channel is to see if i can make it financially viable youtube full time and that seems a little far off you know with there just being'8 of us'8 guys it's been three years you would have thought i would have hung up my hat at this point'8 subscribers took me three years to do okay it's context context okay this was the start basically of the coffee break era now some of you know this this was when i realized that video essays i might be good at that try it out try a little bit more of my writing personality my what i was thinking about okay this was a really good era for me this is also when i started editing a lot more i'll just kind of mute this as we go through this is a video essay about casey neistat how he took how he took off on youtube not a bad video i rewatched it i go ah it kind of you know editing is a little shoddy but it's stan it stands up it's fine it's fine right one of the big secrets to video essays is you can quickly achieve high production value because a lot of the assets are just used from other people because you're just kind of using like some copyright law fair use to transform content right so that was very helpful and we entered a new age of youtube so we go ahead and switch to this like hybrid thing that i did for a while set up this little set and did this for a while this was when i basically investigated scientific fraud at this institution in florida state that was very interesting now we're getting much more to the modern era you can see i've figured out a lot of things at this point i got a little custom graphic there that's very nice i've got a little little presence i've even got some nice music here let's let's play a little bit of this number 27 a professor in criminology sent me an email about the single biggest scandal that the criminology field had ever seen i looked into it partly out of curiosity partly courtesy but what i found obsessed me for months alleged fraud anonymous whistleblowers university cover-ups this investigation changed the way i think about science not in the way we discover truth but how we uncover lies but before we get into that let's back up our story begins with an anonymous email sent to several scientists who are co-authors on five papers within criminology and someone decided to start asking questions so much more of the current style of coffee break you can t or really coffeezilla too like these like investigations type things you can see me kind of a little more catching catching my wind here you can see some more development in the editing now we're introducing me on camera again no longer are we just like faceless behind some like somebody else's video we're starting to use our own assets around this time i wanted to take it further and well you know what i don't actually think that's so important at this point i kind of i don't know sort of was finding my way i don't think that i really care to like talk to people who are at this point i feel like you can find your way i want to talk to people who are here i think this is actually the hard part this gap between this and when you actually have people watching you like between this and the you know i think i did like 80 videos before 100 subscribers or 100 videos before 100 subscribers like it was yeah it's just long just a lot of work for no results for a very long time and i want to tell you guys that that's okay much like me singing and i suck it's just years of sucking basically that's the way it is unfortunately unless you're some savant unless you're some genius that's how it is if you go back to mr beast's first videos it's the same thing dude i even went back and checked i was like what are his first videos like they suck they're terrible i mean he would tell you the same thing it just takes you time to find your rhythm to find what you want to be doing to find your style like now when people see my channel they see this whole like monstrosity that we built but they don't understand all the things that we had to do to get to it so it might be discouraging for someone who starts out and they're making terrible videos and they look at us and they go wow like he's already got it figured out whatever no dude it took years to even like not even to even realize i was on the wrong track okay not even to get on the right track so at this point it's been seven years i've been on youtube i plan to do it for many more i love youtube i love creating videos and i feel like i've really kind of found my voice found my style but this message is for those people out there who have not i know we talk about scams there's nothing about scams this is literally about paying the favor forward for some of you guys out there who may think to yourself oh i can't do that i'm not talented i'm not good at it guys i'm not i'm not this i'm not that like i don't know how to say more clearly that if you feel like you don't know what you're doing if you feel like you're bad at something if you feel like you're a beginner that's perfectly normal that's exactly where you're supposed to be and if you really want to do something if you just stick with it if you just push through it will eventually pay off for you so i wanted to send this positive message out there we don't talk about this a lot we talk about a lot of scams but guys there are some underlying messages that i also want to push about you know things like this creating stuff doing videos online so i hope this message was positive for you guys i hope you enjoyed realizing that i spent years being bad at things i don't know if that helps anyways i guess i don't really have it into this video so [music] if you enjoyed watching pump the stock as always thanks a bunch [music] but things will be different if i was balling
