so people would say what's the moral of the story right and so that's what they want to ask when they listen to a fairy tale and the truth is that there's something implicit which is more important than whatever moral you think you should get out of this story there's some participation some mirror of reality something that is that is reflecting to you something precious and powerful and some sometimes beautiful sometimes tragic but it's more than a moral and that's where like it seems like that's the feminine thing it's very elusive it's implicit not explicit and the mistake people try to make is they try to when you try to make the implicit explicit i think that's when it gets into like propaganda ter that's when it gets into like you're hitting people over the head with it and they you know if they want to hear a sermon they'll go to church you know they don't want to hear [music] it this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic [applause] world so hello everyone i am excited to be speaking to kendall hoyer kendall is someone who worked at disney for many many years and she's now co-head of story at sky dance studios she is an animator but mostly she is someone who does storyboard art she she kind of takes the ideas from the script and from the director and actually creates the basic bones of the of the story that bring it all together and so when you watch a movie she that she's worked on she some of the scenes she will have worked out in detail of what how the characters react and where they are and everything so it's a really a joy to be able to talk to someone like that and see how her thinking storytelling thinking how she bring symbolism into that and her experience as an artist so kendall thanks for coming to join me yeah it's my pleasure so kendall maybe tell me a little bit about what exactly it is that you do oh i'm a storyboard artist so i work with the director and other storyboard artists to board out the movie so i story we storyboard out scenes and eventually those scenes get cut together to make a entire story reel of the movie and it's almost like a comic book version of the movie it's almost like the blueprint of the movie before it moves to other departments like animation and lighting and layout and all these other departments that end up building the movie in production so we we watch our reals and we judge the movie the story basically on if it's working what's not working and then we oftentimes tear it apart and rebuild it again like four months later so we're in this constant it's almost like rewriting we're doing iterations of the movie to really try to hone in on the story and make it the best could be so that that's my job is to like take the story the the script pages or description of moment in the movie and flesh it out with like because that is camera environment acting character like all that stuff yeah okay so let's let's say if i ask you this like just to to figure it out what's the difference between you and the director the director he makes the final call he makes the final call so it's very very collaborative which is great like this is the same model that at disney and at pixar it's like a very collaborative and some other studios but disney this is really the disney pixar model and because the head of our studio john ler came from disney pixar he brought that model over here it's great because you it's kind of like the best idea in the room wins it's very collaborative and creative so the difference between me and the director is i don't have the final call however i sometimes will be like is that what you really want or is that what we should do because remember the that might contradict this like in the hierarchy the the main story point like look and i can point out to them like this isn't really you know driving with this idea over here and that's where like i might say like symbolic thinking is really has kind of honed my story senses because i'm like i can kind of see how you know things are more hierarchical and i can see the the patterns overall you know like and it helps it helps me i feel like i already kind of had a story mindset because i i discover obviously you were doing that before i was doing that before i discovered you guys's podcasts and stuff like that but it helped a lot right and sometimes it makes something implicit more explicit like because you have these intuitions it's not easy to explain them and and and so sometimes it can give you tools to kind of in for sure for sure i think i can recognize things that are implicit quicker perhaps and like put my finger on them you know what i mean like because i i i'm like oh that's that i can call it what it is where some people don't they're just they're not aware of those things yeah so in your job that means that if you're working on a project you have to you have to adapt whatever you're doing to the style of the project and be able to draw the characters and be able to like yeah scene yeah yeah like like if you were animating have to like be able to kind of draw them on model to a certain degree although sometimes we don't have models for characters we just have like it's gonna kind of look like this you're just like oh okay just go for it right if it's not a main character i imagine they don't put as much time designed yet yeah so eventually these these characters are modeled and then it goes to a different department which is called from here it goes to edit and then it goes to where they take my boards and they put it together with sound and music and they make like a story reel is what we call it and eventually we will watch the whole movie in this form to see really okay wow yeah multiple times we we watch every couple months we watch them to judge if it's the story is working and that's how we kind of hone in on how the story is coming along to see if it's coherent and then we bring in people from the studio to other writers and directors and also everybody in the studio gives notes and with those notes we go oh this isn't working there's a problem in this area this isn't working it's kind of like metacognition for the story i guess within the studio as that's veri thing doesn't yeah so that's it's kind of like that way we can pinpoint the problem areas and sometimes we'll take people's suggestions but most of the time people are like everybody is like pointing in the same areas where we see that something isn't working and that's how you know there's patterns in stories because everybody will almost always one rises to the surface something is it's always similar across the board h and so in some ways the animation you know before you put in the massive amounts of of investment you need to get it animated you know what the movie is going to be pretty much yeah you're f figuring it out although it's it's kind of simultaneous usually the schedule is we get about you get a couple iterations of scripts scriptment sometimes treatments and then they go to boards and we get three screenings before things have to enter production and that means when we'll after like the third screening or so they'll look at the movie and go this scene is is working and we don't foresee it changing too much in the future send that one to production and there's all these other things that have to get done in production like the models for the characters have to get built the sets have to get built they all have to get designed first by right artist and then they have to get built in the computer by a 3d artist and then yeah so there's and there's all kinds of computer simulation tests and things that people working on all at the same time it's very labor intensive imagine yeah and so so that mean that sometimes you are working with let's say certain set designers that would have worked on some sets before you're you're going in yes well yeah they take it so we kind of work with them the director works with all the departments that's the difference between me and the director too director is seeing it through all the way down the line yeah from like color and design and camera work and all these things like he's seeing everything through but eventually these boards will get input and edit and then the layout department will take kind of like what i did here and they might not have the exact set i draw because i i try to stay close to what we have but sometimes i kind of just make things up they'll try to get the spirit of what i'm doing and they'll they'll set the cameras in the set because like within the computer right there's a digital set it's already there yeah it's already there and they have the camera and they can place it and they lock off shots and those locked off shots then those go to the animators and the animators do the performance on the character within those shots and then from there it kind of other things happen like effects and simulations and water simulations and lighting lighting is really important and all these other departments that touch the shot before it gets done and usually gets much better each time and when you see the final thing you're like whoa yeah yeah wow and so it's like the fact that it's so labor intensive and that there's no possible improvisational aspect to it it's it's surprising that you could have an animation by the time to put it out that has like bad stories in it like how does that because you because you would think if you have people looking at it and you they can actually see the story play out like and these are professionals wouldn't they know if it's a bad story like wouldn't they be able to tell i feel like they can kind of tell but they don't know what the problem is it's almost always a problem of not going deep enough with the you know theme essentially like what what it's talking about and you know how you talk about layers of reality so like it's you know if the deepest level's here or the deepest level's higher whatever they're like somewhere in the middle and they don't know how to go to the next level of depth that would unify the parts and let some parts fall off sometimes they get people get caught up in like something that they're like oh but this is just so beautiful but the story is about this and then like yeah but when you have that moment in a movie that doesn't speak to the broader thing the movie feels fractured and disjointed it's not all pointing to the same thing like the best movies right are firing on all cylinders in the sense that they all have they're all pointing to the same thing right like story carries that the theme right but also then the the set design the light all those choices are pointing to one thing and but if you get caught up somewhere in the middle and you want this sequence to be just really cool and whatever but it's saying something different than what you have in your final conclusion scene then it's like they're not people are like wait what what was that about oh that didn't tie into this oh okay you know that that tends to happen yeah so people get like they like a certain bit of writing or like a little exchange and they're not willing to sacrifice it to the to to the bigger the bigger hole yeah or sometimes they i think they can't see the bigger hole sometimes or they can't they think that one sentiment might be like the deepest there is i think this comes from a materialistic perspective too because it's harder to perceive like you said to to see the idiosyncrasies that are evident in exchanges or that are evident in a character's journey but you're not you can't you can't it's like you can't see it you can't perceive it or you you don't see it in your own life so you can't see it in in the character's life i don't know it's just just sometimes i notice that people can't see it they can't yeah so they they so if you have you not have you have you had a moment like have you had moments where you've worked on something and like you thought it was all good and whatever and then later you look back at it and you thought how couldn't how did i miss this like how did i didn't see this weird thing about it or this like this bump or this this this i mean i i haven't had as much say in other projects as the one i have now because now i'm in a position where i have more you have more power now than you did before yeah i have more access now to to say something before when i was just a stus and i would i would say things but it wasn't in the room all the time to you know to really tr to get to the bottom of it and sometimes it takes a while to get to the bottom of what something really is about like because the what how the process works is the director usually has a couple different ideas and they they don't know necessarily what what's at the base of those ideas it's just like there's something intriguing about this you know and then the creative director or executive creative executive producer like comes in and says okay develop this idea out of the three like they pick one out of the three and they say go in this direction and so they start to develop that and as they're developing it they start to see kind of a story and they start to develop the world the environment that the story is going to take place in the other characters and excuse me the basic story structure but they i i wouldn't say that they have the theme in hand and it kind of it's like i think it's like when people say they write a book and like it it starts speaking to them it'll start speaking it's just sometimes i don't think everybody listens fully but there's something about you know like we talk about these animated movies there's something about the early pixar movies that were that seemed like they were really able to just it's hard to explain it like they just had a mastery of storytelling and also of characterization also because they were doing animation they didn't have to the the characterizations didn't have to be you know complex like he would in some you i don't know some oscar winning you know movie but the characterizations were were captured so well you know like it was hard it was magical right it's like the the first toy story or monsters incorporated or there these these these early pixar movies where there was something about it when when the story finished we were really mesmerized by just how much they will to capture even in terms of you know the the way the the movie the story twisted and turned and how kind of came back in the end and how all these threads ended up being brought back the writing was just astounding and so yeah so that's why that's why like in some ways they they kind of ruined us for animation because it's as if it was the first blowout of of real 3d animated movies and they did such a great job that now like everything's measured at the light of these early pixar movies i mean they were like the other good thing that they had for them at that time is like less pressure almost like and less you know like voices in the room but maybe they're not in the room you know just less top down bureaucracy for lack of a better words you know just like they were a small group and ideas could free flow and you know they were like let's do it you know they like you know more taking chances and it's that kind of creative environment that you kind of have to like it may come easy when you're small in a smaller studio and you you've got something to prove but as soon as you've proved something that kind of pressure comes you know starts turning heads people oh i want a part of that or you know and it starts to protect the creative environment you actually has you have to protect it to a certain degree actually right right i mean that's interesting to to think about you know and it's interesting that in some ways you could imagine that some a studio like pixar ended up being the the victim of their own success like you said which is that they attracted so much attention you know bought by gigant the biggest cor biggest entertainment corporation and then then basically the stakes are so high now every time every time you now every these movies are so expensive too because the stakes keeps getting higher that i imagine the pressure in the room is different from a bunch of i don't know like guys finished college that are just going you just kind of just bouncing things off the wall until it totally sticks and and bring it together yeah i think there's probably different pressures when you're at that level than when you're at the top and i think and you're at the top there's more voices and more i don't know like money pressure and like you know expectation and things like that which can really kind of drag you drag you down i think creatively hard yeah never been in that position i've never been a director i don't i can't imagine like the pressure that they they hear you know that that they that they have to deal they have to deal with so hope you hope that they'll protect their creative crew so that they don't have to feel that heat so much and that's where somebody is to have a creative person in charge that und really understands the creative process to kind of protect the creatives underneath them is really important like you know because the business side is the business side you know they're they businessing which they have to be you know that's important yeah can't do what we do without that side of it but also there's a certain aspect that you have to create create like a buffer or protection between the people just trying to be creative you know yeah yeah i mean that's really interesting like what i what i find interesting about what you're saying because you wonder like when i see the bad movies come out and i and i'm like what how is it possible because you think they're definitely creative people like it's not like there's a dir of people with great ideas and a dir of people that tell good stories but in some ways maybe it's just that pressure that's so high coming from people who aren't creative who want to make sure that i mean it's it's it's not anybody's fault in particular but it's like if your movie has to generate a billion dollars i mean the pressure for of something like that is so crazy that that it has to it has to kind of like come down onto the the people that ultimately are the resource to make it happen right and it becomes kind of like a beast in and of itself because the more you i guess succumb to like making things more expensive the more that cycle just kind of perpetuates itself in a way because you just well that one was really big we got to make a big you know one on this one you know just kind of like spins kind of out of control in a way yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and i think we're reach it seems like we're at the end of that like it seems like whatever the next wave of things is going to be is not it's just not going to be it's like what do you do after endgame like what do you do after these like massive huge you know really well done and successful like things that then it's like well i there's just nowhere to go after that if all you're trying to do is make it more fireworks like you you can't come back back to come back to story come back to character come back to to simple things real things yeah i mean i think people are really looking for like real and authentic things you know yeah small things i think i don't know did you see have you have you followed a little bit our snow white thing have you seen a little bit of what we're doing yeah yeah it's great i i bought it i'm waiting for my oh cool i'm happy i'm gonna read it to my daughter she's she's about to turn seven so she perfect perfect yeah where're it's like i'm listening very carefully to what you're saying because in some ways you know it's like i i think i think that it is possible right now to make very powerful beautiful things but but in some ways you have to have the right really the right people but then also the right spirit of of of of creative possibilities in order for it to happen yeah yeah yeah yeah to like protect that thing and i think you know the other thing that i think people like or maybe wanting or they need is something that gives them something to reach for something that's so much of things like are like story-wise they're not like aspirational you know they're just kind of like here's what it is you know yeah it's kind of a downer it's like oh yeah that is how it is you know as opposed to something that's like look at this beautiful thing you know and you know people might criticize that's just idealistic that's never whatever but it gives people something to aim for that's higher that that they can look up to you know stories that that give them something and also stories like that but where they can find themselves in it where they like the psychology of the character is real you know and that's another thing that's really that's hard to do i think it's finding a character that's interesting relatable appealing right that you're like you're like oh i'm on board with them like i i know what they're feeling in this moment i really understand what their what wound is we talk about that sometimes like what's a character's like flaw and wound what what drives a character you know have you do right no well i no i haven't ever written i you say no you say that do you have story ideas yeah some story ideas yeah and why wouldn't you want to right yeah i don't know i i just i'm always a picture person but i mean i don't hate i like words but you know i just i haven't no but wr not in the sense of i don't care about the writing part what i mean is in the sense of creating stories oh like creating your own stories yes i probably should should probably should i like i just do my work and then i do my mom duties like take my da b and all these things and then by the end of the day i'm like oh but i i should try to make time for that sort of thing how long have you been doing this i started i in 2008 as a story artist wow so that's and now you're head of story i'm a co-head of story co-head of story yeah so i have another cooworker who's doing the job with me which is super helpful and what does that mean head what does it mean the head of story well our job is to oversee the storyboard artist team and also to be in the meetings with the writers and the director to kind of almost like shepherd the story and kind of help the director find the story and and then carry that vision through in the boards in the story boards and now the project you're working on now this is the first time you're doing this like as yeah this is the first time i've been head a story yeah and how how is that well it's great it's great because that's why in this job i have more say because the director is really great he has us in like all these meetings and because we're in all these meetings i can really see the story like if you're not in all the meetings like little things get changed all the time but if you're in all the meetings you're like oh okay i know why that's there i know that's there no way that's there and this needs to accomplish this and this charact we need to have a moment around this area where a character realizes this because you have to track their character arc right you have to figure out you know because all the little pieces have to come together you got to do the main character the secondary character the world problem like all these things need to track throughout you need to lay enough pipe in the story so that it feels cohesive at the end right you're trying to like have all these things come together at the end in the conclusion and feel satisfactory so you can really track that if you're in all the meetings yeah and all the discussions about the story and so it's super fun because i really really enjoy talking about story and character and really figuring out i like story problems because it creates an opportunity to to solve something pick something yeah yeah yeah what did you study to do this i studied animation okay and i like you i went to art school but i animation illustration so yeah yeah yeah and i always wanted to work in animation since i was like eight you know when i was like eight i was like i want work at disney like many kids and praise the lord i did you actually went you actually went for it and ended up doing it yeah yeah but yeah i studied drawing you know in high school i was that kid with a sketchbook yeah at youth group drawing yeah yeah yeah always drawing so yeah i mean this is weird but there's a difference between how i think the public perceives entertainment or movies and stuff like that in terms of actors and all that stuff like that stuff is really secondary like it's it's like they get the money but that who cares really like the the the important thing are the the important people are the storytellers yeah yeah the storytellers are the writers and ultimately the directors that take the story and make it into something you yeah and they take you on a journey with with the actors and the the cinematographer and the lighting and the set dresser and all that stuff and that's why it all has the director has to be the keeper of whatever here is at the top like the thing that everything needs to be pointing to and if they don't know what that is then everybody else is in trouble right yeah and so and so s so we need we need for people that are thinking about storytelling and are realizing that that's really the key to to to to talk to each other so yeah anyway so like in my case that's what i want to do like i i have to stop complaining about stories and i have to try to to to tell better story so that's what that's kind of the the the vision i've given myself in the next few years with this fairy tale series but then also god's dog and then other stories that i have in mind yeah and so hopefully we can also attract people around that like people who who are so anyways that's my i mean like ultim you know i feel like i've never heard of so many people interested in like i mean as as people more and more people recognize wow hollywood's really not doing good things other people are like well we'll do good things you know just like everybody's you know and which is good because it creates opportunities for other things to arise as the other as the established system seems to be floundering but you know i think some you have to like go into it soberly and like also be really like led into it because i think that it's it's harder than it well at least for animation so stud i'm like really you really know what that takes like you need backers and you need someone at the head of that that understands it and like i mean i don't even understand it like all the like things that need to come together for that to work it's like it's it's a lot the massive enterprise definitely no i you know that's true especially if you want to make really quality things because obviously you can pump out animation now easy more easily than anytime in the history like you could animate without knowing anything about animation and then you look at you're like yeah and then it's horrible and then and then and then nobody nobody cares so so maybe tell me a bit about how how kind of symbolic ideas has influence your your work like how you you feel like you're able to integrate some of the things you've been that that i talk about or that or that you know jordan talks about and into storytelling yeah well i'll tell you how i came across jordan i came across jordan first and had like well because i'm always looking at stuff and you know film making things and story things anyway and i think i was looking up i had heard that akira kurasawa was influenced by doeski stories and so i was looking up doeski and i found jordan's video about doki his personality series i was like wow this is really interesting and so i started following and around that same time he became kind of controversial and people this was like back in 2016 like 2015 2016 when was it it was later than it might have been it was either early 2018 or late 2017 i think yeah yeah yeah well that's when it really blew like it really blew up yeah it was starting to blow up and people were talking about how this guy is really what he's misogynistic he's this that the other really i don't disagree with anything that he's saying i'm like oh okay and so i just kind of kept my interest to myself and just watched all his videos by myself and then i think he had you on and i was like wow that's really interesting and then i looked up your channel and you had like all these things about movies i was like oh cool and so i watched a bunch of that so it that shook my worldview yeah like i had pretty much been living in you know for like you know very worldly like i was raised in the church but then during college i kind of fell away and then so when i discovered all these things like jordan and you my worldview had already been shifting like i'd come back to god and like i was questioning everything and it really kind of things that i had been experiencing by having god in my life again were really resonating with what jordan was saying when like he talked about the bottom falling out i was like i know what that feels like and everything all the things that he would describe i'm like yes that's what happens yes that's what happen happened that's what it feels like phenomen phenomenologically and so all those things really spoke to my personal experience but also i could apply them to what i would see in the story room or what i was seeing in stories like i was like oh that's that principle that you guys talk about or you know when you kind of peel away the materialistic view and you see that really the spirit is the ontological truth you can see things more clearly you know and i feel that's what symbolism is very connected to the spiritual realm so it's very like it's it's like that represents that that thing in the story is this principle in kind of the spiritual realm it's symbolic of something that's unseen and and the more i could see those things the more i could kind of problem solve stories so i think that like listening to you and jordan i didn't discover john riki till a couple years later i think we kind of really just opening my eyes to seeing things not materialistically and seeing things and patter stories and patterns as more lack of a better word more spiritual in a sense and it just made it clearer to me to see the pieces moving underneath the the physical reality mhm yeah it's hard to talk about these things i understand yeah and so definitely one of the issues that people complain about in terms of the modern movies is in some ways a lot of some of the decisions that seem to be made are not based on the needs of the story itself but it come from outside the story like some message or some thing they want to get through and it and that and that it's it seems artificial or tacked on because the the story it's itself doesn't need it or the the it actually sometimes goes against the basic pattern of the story yeah yeah and i i think that was kind of like where i seeing like i think sometimes people can't they they see like sometimes those things those those values as the highest value like the best the like that's the deepest point of the movie or that's the theme or that's what it should be about and they try to it's like i always compare it to trying to hammer in a a square peg in a round hole or something it's like you're trying to make it fit but it just doesn't fit but you'll bend over backwards because you think that that's the most important thing and it comes from not listening to the story or the characters of what this movie is really trying to say just like if you know you were writing a novel and you weren't really listening to what the characters would say or who that character is like you would make them act in a way that's was counter to what you had established before you know yeah and people go like well that character wouldn't do that and he pulls you out of this suspension of disbelief and it because it's just like the doesn't jive with reality it doesn't jive with the patterns in reality it doesn't jive with what you've previously set up nobody would act that way in that situation yeah yeah yeah yeah and then yeah but it's interesting because right it's like that's when you can see that in some ways the highest form of reality is not because we used we we tend to think something like even myself you know writing fairy tales so people would say what's the moral of the story right and so that's what they want to ask when they when they listen to a fairy tale and the truth is that there's something implicit which is more important than whatever moral you think you should get out of this story there's some there's some participation some mirror of reality something that is that is reflecting to something precious and powerful and sometimes beautiful sometimes tragic sometimes you know but it but it's more than a moral right and it's yeah like like and that's where like it seems like that's the feminine thing you know like it's it's very elusive it's implicit not explicit and the mistake people try to make is they try to when you try to make the implicit explicit i think that's when it gets into like propaganda terit that's when it gets into like you're hitting people over the head with it and they you know if they to hear a sermon they'll go to church you know they don't want to hear it and i have a little posted i have tons of post-its on my screen but one of them is avoid didacticism and it's because i i learned that word i was like oh that's what we want to avoid diac because and there's a time and place for it like i mean i feel like asops fables or there's some you know there's some things that are like for children that have more of a a little more of that that dactic it has that aspect to it but as you get older you don't want it to be so explicit you know you're more you're in a story you're more like kind of asking questions in a certain area like a certain like over around a certain value and you can't strawman the opposing value or it feels didactic you have to let the the anti hero or whatever the antithesis be as strong as the the the protagonist or whatever because otherwise it feels rigged it feels rigged i love that word i never thought of you thinking about it that way it feels rigged yeah that's a that's a great idea and then and then it makes you realize in some ways that like you said that there's something about a story which is rather a puzzle of human experience that is playing out and that there is in there is a solution but the solution is within the puzzle of the story it's not it's not a it's not just a a a a mor a moral tale that comes in from from outside and obviously we're not the first ones doing this right the whole deos sakina idea was that was like you know aristotle complained about the playwrights not making the characters work out the story from within their own motivations rather than rather bring in you know at the end someone who just solves the problem from outside and just basically tells you what you know what the moral is so that you can go back home you know with a nice package right and and as a storyteller i feel like you have to be aware of the audience the characters you're creating and yourself you have to be aware of like what you yourself are putting in there you know because or what you already like have in your head in like in the story like so many times i feel like i've been on projects where it's like i feel like we are like yeah we're saying this and we know that this is what it is in the story but we should take that out of it because by this shot or saying this we're imposing ourselves as the storytellers onto the characters right and the if you do that too much the audience feels it and it doesn't feel right yeah yeah and it's a and you can imagine like you can also you can imagine it too that as so the person telling the story you're like well this is what i want people to get from this story and so the danger of course is is that that's what you want so you make it too explicit and then by the time you make it to explicit you've you haven't succeeded because nobody cares about your story anyways and so it's like you you've lost if you try to make your point or whatever it is you think you're you're you're making and so the and so what happens i think too is like if you if you remain in story mode and in the kind of story puzzle mode where you have these factions and characters that play off each other that balance each other out you know that that that relate to each other in ways that is that is in the puzzle of the story i think what it does too is that it can make someone say something deeper than what they capable of yeah i do think that that that i you can just see it starting to emerge like like somehow you just stumble across it and you're like oh my gosh that's so much deeper than than we could have even like constructed it just starts to kind of happen it it it's like things start lining up you know the things are starting to line up and it just kind of flows it's strange but it it happens if you don't fight it though somehow like that's the you have to almost get get yourself out of the way as the as the storyteller it's almost like a conduit you have to kind of shepherd it but you can't get in the way yeah yeah yeah no it seems like that i think you're you're totally right that's why sometimes like the best storytellers and this is true like in terms of music in terms of all kinds of sometimes those you don't really want to hear the people tell you what it's about because actually they don't really know what it's about or they think they know but once you once you see you're like well what you're saying is actually reducing the the the movie or the song or whatever like the reason why people actually care about it that's a that's a and so in some ways that the storyteller is almost like a it's like an antenna almost more than it's someone who's just basically vibing in the puzzle and is able to to put it out there but it doesn't even necessarily understand it's not even to their own to their own merit sometimes that that they're able to that they've been able to do something like that yeah i think so and then the muse idea becomes way more coherent like we can kind of understand why the ancients you not just the pagans the christians too you know in the middle ages they and even in the renaissance people were still invoking the muse before they started because in some ways knew that doesn't totally come from you yeah there's like a you kind of have yeah you're like some sort of conduit you're have you just kind of have to shepherd it and i think the more you do it the more you kind of you know recognize where you're inserting yourself and where you're just letting things flow to a certain extent and you know you've been in creative or i don't know i've been in creative rooms you know that did i there's a certain flow that happens in creative rooms too where things just go back and forth and they just kind of go and there's ones where it's just like oh can't say that well well that's that you know you just start putting blockades up in your own mind you know like they're not going to like that or this that and the other so that's true i mean i mean when you when you are creating something and there's that flow like really the way that john rei talks about it there really is this theos right that john also brings up which is that in the end the there's more than what you thought was possible there's definitely more than what you could have done on your own and that's really precious i mean if you can have that it's quite rare and it's really precious and that's probably you know like you talked about the like the early pixar movies or even the early disney movies or you know other projects like that where there was probably some of that going on like there was just this really bubbling thing where the ideas just jived and everything was just kind of falling together in a way that was that was intuitively right you know right i mean i think like to use like i mean i don't know but like early disney as example i think walt disney and his brother were kind of like the business people like protecting their little hive of creatives and they had they they amass all these great creatives but then they they interfaced with like i'm i'm sure they were hustling to try to get money and funding to keep this thing going right but they were also protecting their little hive of artists you know trying to give them like the best that they could and they also were visionary like we're going to need this and this is going to be great and so they're yeah they're like shepherding the creative process and moving it forward you know but for sure there there's something unreasonable about those early disney movies i mean when i i remember just a few years ago i watched pinocchia again and i was looking watching that animated waves and i was thinking this is completely unreasonable like how the hell did they how did that how did they who did this like who animated the water like just and it's all you know it's all hand done and everything and there's just something so completely unreasonable about about it and but also this you can just feel the absolute care and love like like if you're looking at a handcrafted violin or something right yeah and the they you know and like early pixar they created they had they were visionary and they wanted to tell the story and they they wanted to do it with such care that they cre technology they bring in like people that can help them to do these things and that's kind of where like you know early pixar would talk about like art and pushes on technology and technology helps the art and it kind of they kind of move forward together because sometimes the artist can't quite you know they can't they don't have the tools to create what they want and so the the the technological people will come in and help them create like the multiplay camera like that wasn't the thing right you know and they created that to do snow white so that they could get these the feeling of these you know of one layer moving this way and that way so you felt like a camera moving and you know all this stuff and it gave depth and beauty to the the shots of the the final product you know like but they didn't have that before they had to create that yeah so i'm gonna i think i think maybe i'll end with the dark question sorry to end with the dark question but the so ai is all the buzz and everybody is talking about ai and and you can see you know the different software the different platforms that are like stable diffusion and a mid journey and all these platforms that are kind of pushing on us and so what do you think in terms of as we watch this kind of these techn these massive technological innovations down the coming downstream how do you see the future of this like of animation of creative storytelling in relationship to the the these tech tools that are just coming down very fast well honestly i don't know that much about ai like you probably understand more than i do i really don't understand that much about it but i think i think it's i tend to think it's kind of a hack you know like people it's also robbing people of something right like there's a certain amount of like gratification and that happens when you put in the time to to do something and you and you you overcome and you overcome and then you you have something you're like wow that looks great you know but now people are like using ai to get there faster and i'm you know i'm not about like not getting something faster you know like to a certain degree but you're like robbing people of excellence in a certain sense you know by giving it to the machine and giving it to some program somewhere that like you know if you spend hours drawing and really honing your craft that can't be taken away from you right that can't be taken away from you that's something that you've put in the attention and the time to do and i think ai kind of robs people of that you know like that handcrafted thing is so valuable i think it devalues some things if if it was just a machine algorithm yeah and what do you think of the idea that in some ways like the best way to frame it is something like care and attention in the sense that even though the tech the the computer might bring to us like technically proficient images that will be very fast to produce and will be visually stunning and and and surprising and all that but that because it's so easy the type of care and attention you would need in order to create something that people will love will like you won't it's like as if you won't have to put that in there because it it can happen so fast and that will necessarily affect the the the result and it'll and it'll necessarily affect the the perception that people have of that result as well but i i think people can tell for sure like you said i think people can perceive that something does doesn't have that level of care and attention you know that and that i feel like it's just going to you know some people will be like oh that's great but then when something comes out that really has the care and attention people are going to like walk on to it because they can i think we're just built to notice things like that you know i don't know well i mean we're artists it's hard for me to know how how objective i am but for sure like now i've seen in the past six months i would say maybe a little more i've seen a huge percent of ads on line get replaced by mid journey images and i not only can i tell but there's something about it like there's something that it i don't know how to explain it there's something about those images that are boring even though they're all stunning and they have all the right light angles and they have this this kind of perfection there's something about a lot of these images that are boring and and repulsive to some extent and so i mean i'm curious if it's just because i'm an artist and i can tell and i'm like it's like oh please another mid journey image like if i just scroll down my facebook whatever thing or all i see are just a bunch of mid journey generated ads and people use it for thumbnails too on on on youtube a lot of people are using mid journey for thumbnails on youtube and there's something about it that is just not that i find very uninteresting but it's almost like something really flashy at the flashy really f like it's just obviously it's flashy you know but then it it wears off really fast yeah i i mean i'm also an artist so i probably have a similar like mindset to you like i'm also like my eye is really attracted to things that are like handcrafted or there's something and know something just something nicer about you know like handcrafted things and i i tend to have like i'm like oh look at that one and then i'm like oh look it's really expensive and there's a reason for that handcraft like dog on it but yeah and and a long time ago i i turned off to most of the like comic book movies because like oh same thing again it's like flashy flashy flashy it's like the same thing and my mind just kind of shuts it down i don't know if everybody will be like that you know but but i do think that if you create something that is really good quality and appeals to people it's not like high artsy or whatever that it will attract their attention i i i think people are just built to see things like that like their early pixar movies or the early disney movies like things like that like people are drawn to them you know and they they withstand time yeah definitely definitely so well thanks for your time kendall appreciate it oh that's great next year february 29th to march 2nd we're are going to have the very first symbolic world summit in tarpon springs florida a lot of people involved in the symbolic world community will come together to explore how we can recover the ancient cosmic image to further this community and to further this type of thinking in the world
