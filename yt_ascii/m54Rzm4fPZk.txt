so imagine this 47 of the population on the planet today is living in electricity poverty but this biden administration is the most anti-hydrocarbon administration in american history and all and there it seems like this climate issue is the only thing they want to talk about why isn't he pounding the damn podium saying we have to do something about this instead he's standing up and bragging about some stupid 900 million dollar loan to the angle and so they can build solar panels where are your priorities where is your humanism [music] hello everyone watching and listening today i'm speaking with author podcaster and film producer robert price we discussed topics from his latest book a question of power electricity and the wealth of nations their current audacity of those pushing the zero emissions net zero agenda how those policies really affect the developing world and the poor in the west hint it's not good the feasibility and necessity of coal and fossil fuel and nuclear power now and into the foreseeable future the catastrophic practical and environmental problems related to wind and solar and a positive vision for the future we could all share voluntarily should our institutions finally drop their fear-mongering tyranny-inducing doomsday narrative let's start well we can start wherever you want but perhaps on the renewable energy front might be a good place to dive in sure and so well i'm glad to talk about all those i mean those are all i'm passionate about those issues those are my purpose and so also just point out on my latest sub stack i don't know if your team sent it to you but the title was let them eat solar panels and the gist of it is that the u.s export import bank just funded a 900 million dollar loan for a solar project in angola jordan 60 of the people in angola don't even have electricity why in the name of jesus mary and joseph were we running a solar project they hit a natural gas powered plant and instead we're funding solar and the xm banks press release said to help angola meet its climate commitment yeah well you can you can be absolutely certain that the primary concern of the angolans is to meet their bloody climate commitment right no so it's so interesting watching the leftists in particular on the environmental front rampage down this pathway because they're the same ideologues who constantly what conspire to accuse conservatives and classic liberals of being colonialists in their endeavors and i've never seen a more colonialist endeavor in my entire life than the attempt to impose climate concerns on the developing world it is something bloody miraculous to see it and to see the leftists sacrifice the poor to their idiot planetary concerns is is an absolutely it's an absolute bloody nightmare as far as i'm concerned so in this situation in angola sounds like it's tailor-made for that kind of idiocy so what how is it the case that solar power plant can become the number one concern on the international development front for angola like how good how did we get there well how long do we have jordan it's a long history but this has been something that's been ongoing now for years where the world bank and the other and multilateral bilateral lending institutions are refusing to fund any hydrocarbon projects in developing countries and this latest example is the angolan story where and president biden bragged about it during a high dollar fundraise he spoke at a high dollar fundraiser for the league of conservation voters in early june and he bragged about this saying we're building a huge solar plant in angola and the average sixty percent of the people in angola don't have electricity at all and you're bragging about the in the in the export import bank brags in their press release about we're helping angola meet its climate commitments i mean it's crazy town and and this is a country that has an enormous natural gas and oil wealth we should they should be allowed to burn those hydrocarbons this is it's it's green colonialism carbon imperialism green colonialism there are and numerous leaders numerous analysts have pointed this out but i i just find it anathema i mean electricity is the key to better life for everyone everywhere on the planet and this is effectively telling the the developing countries and one of the most desperately poor countries in africa no you can't burn hydrocarbons yeah yeah it's i i think it's i actually think it's criminal it's criminal levels of stupidity to do this to the developing world and so so tell me tell let's let's go into your background a bit so that everybody who's watching and listening knows a little bit about you so why don't you run through your biography and tell us all about how long you've been writing and how you've done your investigations sure well first things first i'm i'm a proud father i'm proudly married to the lauren my wife we've been married for 37 years we have three great kids we're empty nesters which is a beautiful thing but we have three great kids married michael and jacob and they're all thriving i've been a journalist my whole career i've never had a real job i've been a reporter my whole life i wrote my first book on enron which came out in 2002 it's now already 20 years ago i started my career in newspapering in the austin at the austin chronicle here in austin in the late 80s that one thing led to another led me into the book business in my book on enron is called pipe dreams greed ego and the death of enron came out now 20 and a half years ago and i'm still writing about enron in fact these days so now six books later my latest is a question of power electricity and the wealth of nations i've been very fortunate to have the same publisher public affairs the same editor lisa kaufman same agent dan green all have been incredibly supportive and helpful along the way so i i consider myself incredibly fortunate jordan to be able to write about think about do a lot of public speaking on energy and power these are the world's biggest industries biggest and most important businesses and particularly now where there are so many political issues around all of these things and so much focus on climate and and renewables and and and and i think there are some positive trends and i want to talk about those but i see a lot of bad policy happening and particularly in europe and and here in the us where europe has just driven itself into the ditch but yeah that's my brain oh yeah and i mean the rest of the world seems hell-bent on copying let's say germany which has had the most catastrophic energy and environment policies that you could possibly produce short of shutting down the entire grid not least because what their energy prices are now five times what they should be they shut down their nuclear plants their energy provision is now unreliable they're they are dependent on russia and other totalitarian states for their energy provision energy is so expensive that electric car manufacturers are moving from germany to china germany is de-industrializing because the energy prices are too high plus and this is the kicker they're actually polluting more per kilowatt than they were 15 years ago because since they've shut down their reasonable sources of electricity including nuclear which they import anyways from france they're now turning to burning lignite for god's sake which is the dirtiest form of coal isn't it insane i mean you couldn't make it up you just i'll give you one i'll make you even one better so you mentioned lignite and the company it's rwe of memory serves right is the big utility so they're expanding a lignite mine so they can provide more lignite which is a low rank coal emits more co2 per kilowatt hour than any other form of power generation and to expand the lignite mine jordan they took down a wind project oh yeah yeah the iron the irony is just remarkable but to your point yes germany has more than any other country in europe has driven itself into the ditch they did it to themselves and they're patting themselves on the back i mean none of it makes any sense yeah well it's it's the response seems to be well we didn't do stupid things fast enough i like that so let's hurry up let's drive ourselves faster into the ditch but yeah i mean the coup de gras was them shutting down their last nuclear plants when they knew they were were short natural gas they knew they were you know we're no longer going to be able to import as much gas from russia so what did they do they went into the global lng market and they've snapped up as many lng cargos and future contracts as they could and in doing so what did they do what well not only did they are they burning more lignite more coal to your point but they also priced out a lot of developing a lot of developing countries from importing liquefied natural gas principally among them pakistan which is remarkable because pakistan in february announced we're done with the lng business we're going to burn we're going to burn coal and so the pakistanis are now saying we're going to expand our coal-fired capacity so it's not just that this is affecting germany it's having knock-on effects in the developing world well you know when the german chancellor came over to visit our idiot country and he asked trudeau if there was any possibility of increasingly liquid natural gas imports from canada and of course trudeau has done everything he can for the last 10 years to absolutely devastate the canadian oil and gas industry and to make the export of liquid natural gas impossible and so trudeau said well we can't make a business case for that which is exactly the same bloody thing that he said when the japanese leader came and asked for the same thing and the reason that he can't make a business case for it is because his government has produced policies that have made the export of canadian fossil fuel resources which are among the cleanest in the world impossible and so so i like i really don't understand how the hell this can be happening in germany i mean i'm i'm not a cynic although you know whatever naive optimism i had about the political process has certainly been disabused but everything that is happening in in germany is so stupid on the energy front that it's a kind of miracle especially because you know you could give the damn devils their due if they were able to say well we made electricity five times as expensive but we've cut emissions by a certain proportion and here's the net environmental benefit which all of which i think is complete bs by the way but if they could say that well that would be something but for them to also have to say oh well we've made electricity five times more expensive and unreliable plus we pollute more it's like there's zero victory that's f minus man you guys failed on every bloody front including the ones you set up as your own principles and yet nothing seems to happen and as you said you know biden can come out and and and and flourish his agreement with angola to produce a kind of electricity they don't need at a tremendously elevated price well engaging in this neocolonial enterprise like i can't believe we can be this stupid i can't understand how this could happen so obviously germany is this classic example of what not to do what's remarkable is what's happening here in the united states where california is following this example straight into the ditch more than any other state in the u.s california has emulated these policies of of mandating renewables of shutting down base load power plants they shut down the san onofre nuclear plant a few years ago they almost succeeded in closing diablo canyon that was newsom made you know i think finally sobered up and said no we need this plant forget that it's nuclear it's nine percent of our electric generation production in california but look at what has happened it's a similar story jordan for all of the effort and all the money that the california has spent they've seen no reduction in their overall emissions from their from their electric generation sector further they have seen their electric prices rise faster than any other state in the united states since 2008 and i've written about this on my sub stack schwarzenegger signed a renewable energy mandate in 2008 since then california's electric rates had gone up at a rate three times faster than that of the average in the united states it's unconscionable what they're doing jordan and this is in a state that is dominated by the democratic party the liberals who say they care about the poor in the middle class and yet this and this is what as my late brother john bryce said just grills my cheese i mean the it's it's ruinously regressive california has the highest poverty rate in america jordan and yet they are sticking it to the poor in the middle class in a big way and where the the peak electric rates in california now 40 50 cents a kilowatt hour i mean this is fine if you live in a nice house that's on san francisco bay but the the low-income people don't live there they can't afford to live there they live inland where they have to use air conditioning so all of this climate i i have to say it very clearly nearly all of this climate policy whether it's mandates for electric cars or the renewable mandates rooftop solar it's it's ruined especially regressive it screws the poor in the middle class i've been absolutely stunned to watch the left in their rampage to sacrifice the poor to to fail to save the planet you know it's almost as unconscionable to me as the fact that the left again climbed in bed with the pharmaceutical companies so radically on the on the on the pandemic front you know i mean there's lots of things to be said in relationship to the so-called pandemic which i also don't believe in by the way because i think it was a pandemic of totalitarian overreaction and not pandemic of illness but the fact that the left itself was so supportive of the pharmaceutical companies was something just absolutely staggering to see and to see the left go after the poor so assiduously my understanding is this you tell me what you think about this it's like if you really cared for poor people and you wanted their lives to improve the best thing you could possibly do as far as i can tell is to lower is to drive energy costs down to the lowest possible level and to make energy provision your number one priority at everywhere especially in the developing world but also for the poor in the west and the reason for that is that there's there's no difference between energy and work and there's no difference between work and productivity now you might say two things you might respond well the planet has too many people on it we can't encourage that sort of thing and if you make people rich then the rich people destroy the environment faster but both of those things are nonsense because we've seen a massive increase in population over the last 40 years and all the bloody doomsayers like paul eric who has more sins on his conscience than anyone else i can possibly think of has said that by the year 2000 we were going to be out of commodities and everybody was going to be starving to death and we're not out of commodities and they're a lot cheaper and we have more food and people only starve to death for political reasons and as we've got more people we've actually got richer so that's all bloody complete backwards nonsense and then not only that is that the data that i've looked at and i've looked at it with bjorn lomberg or through his eyes is that if you can get people in the developing world up to about five thousand dollars a year in gross domestic product on average they start taking a long-term view of the future and start becoming concerned about local environmental issues and we'll take that burden onto themselves so that top-down centralist globalist utopians don't have to enforce all this idiocy on them so like am i missing something here you know have i gone down some bloody right-wing rabbit hole or is this is this just the stark truth so i think the key for me jordan in all of this discussion is electricity availability and this is yes energy in general matters but more specifically it's electricity and let me get on one point that i think is critical when we talk about compassion we talk about humanism because my favorite line these days is energy realism is humanism and when we're going to be realistic about energy and we're going to be energy humanists we have to look at the lens of of energy and energy availability in particular and how it affects women and girls electricity frees women and girls from the pump the stove and the wash tub you remember uh the the new dealers here in the u.s when they wanted to bring electricity to rural areas many of these politicians george norris sam rayburn george norris from nebraska sam rayburn from texas lyndon johnson from texas they had seen their their mothers wash clothes by hand they wanted them to be liberated from from that from the wash tub they'd seen this kind of back-breaking labor and this is the key there are something like who's the the swedish demographer who recently died he estimated there were five billion people in the world today walking around in clothes that have been washed by hand well they've been frozen yes uh now she what is this like what's his first name hans roslings forgive me hans crossing yes hands wrestling brilliant he did that yes brilliant he did that amazing video i i think he gave a ted talk where he was talking about his grandmother and his grandmother his folks had bought a washing machine as grandmother came over when they first time they used the washing machine and she wanted to start it right because it was a miracle to her he said that in fact he said the washing machine to my grandmother was a miracle so when we think about electricity and energy availability this is the key for women and girls because if they don't have it they are effectively slaves to the household chores and so rossly hounds rossling's point five billion people in the world today are walking around in clothes that have been washed by hand that means they're two and a half billion women and girls who are washing those clothes by hand at every minute every hour every day that they're not why that they're washing clothes by hand they're not in the library they're not in school they're not able to get a job outside the home so there is this they're also not contributing their brain power to the rest of us you know can you imagine can you imagine the economic value of 2 billion brains that are occupied in menial labor that could otherwise be freed up i mean there's there's 2 000 women in that group that are one in a million you know and that's genius level man we could use those people and the fact that that we're locking up that that degree of neural architecture in these menial tasks to not save the planet while we're making electricity more unreliable and more expensive it's just it's it's absolute cr it's beyond incompetence into the realm of absolutely criminal as far as i'm concerned it's it's just it's just it's an it's an it's it's and it's an excessive focus i think on the look here's my line climate change is a concern it's not our only concern we have to balance our action on climate with our other other issues but the overall point i think that it's absolutely essential is that regardless of what we think what you and i think about co2 emissions and how many parts per million is the perfect number if we're facing more extreme weather hotter colder more extreme longer i mean it's been crazy hot here in texas well if that's the case we're going to need a lot more energy not less we're going to need a lot more reliable energy not less and yet the trends are for this effort to rely more on weather dependent renewables so for that's the other part jordan that's if we're facing more extreme weather why in the world would we make our most important energy network dependent on the weather it's like on the face of it it makes no sense i mean i don't want to get too tanked with it's just crazy town using the internet without expressvpn is like not paying attention to the safety demonstration on a flight most of the time you'll probably be fine but what if one day that weird yellow mask drops down from overhead and you have no idea what to do it's better to be safe than sorry every time you connect to an unencrypted network cafes hotels airports any hacker on the same network can gain access to your

to use i just fire up the app and click one button to get protected secure your online data today by visiting expressvpn.com jordan that's exp r e s s vpn.com jordan and get three extra months free expressvpn.com jordan [music] let's walk through this again too and so i'd sure like you to push back on me as much as you could so this is what i've watched in the course of my lifetime so in the 1970s we were going to run out of fossil fuels and that was a big bloody catastrophe for everyone for about six years after 1972 in the energy crisis and that turned out to be complete rubbish we're not running out of fossil fuels and we won't partly i mean i think it was exxon two weeks ago announced that they had a new fracturing technology that could double the known store of fossil fuels in the u.s which is like should have been front page headline news everywhere because oh my god we have twice as many fossil fuels as we thought and so isn't that really something and the eu americans have become absolute bloody magicians at extracting out fossil fuel from these huge reserves that you have like the shale beds and it's not going to run out and that's partly because as the price goes up people's incentives to to extract out even more of the fossil fuel reserves we know are there increases and the technology geniuses just get better and better at doing it so we're not going to run out of fossil fuel that's not going to happen that was wrong okay next the next thing that happened in the 1970s is global cooling where the planet's going to freeze and that happened for about five years and then that turned out to be nonsense and then the next thing that happened was global warming and then that turned out to be not true enough to be sustainable and somehow the narrative switched to oh well it's climate change now and that is one weasley proposition man it's like oh change so now you have a get out of jail free card for all of your idiot policies because of the climate is changing and that means increased variability now i've looked at the data on hurricane frequency for example there's no evidence whatsoever that hurricanes are increasing in frequency and to the degree that they're more expensive it's only because people are building more and more expensive properties in hurricane prone zones then we also have bjorn lombard's data showing that even if we accept the ipcc's climate predictions and i don't necessarily think we should that we will be you know some degree poorer then how much richer we would have been 100 years from now right and so he thinks we can handle that no problem with a with an iota of intelligence and some but then i'm wondering too you tell me what you think about this i've been watching the greening data now the world has greened 15 since the year 2000 and that is a law it's an area of leave twice the size of the continental u.s that's a lot of extra leaves and interestingly enough it's greened in exactly the areas that the climate catastrophists told us would be in at most risk because they presumed that the semi-arid areas the arid areas would expand out into the semi-arid areas and the deserts would grow well the desert isn't growing the sahara is actually shrinking especially on the south end and the reason it's shrinking is because more carbon dioxide has allowed plants to thrive and when they thrive they can close their breathing pores which means they don't need as much water and now they're growing in semi-arid areas all over the world plus crop yields have gone up so like i'm not familiar with all the data you're you're throwing out there and i i know these arguments and here's how i keep my sanity jordan is that i i don't i don't get into the you know what is how many parts per million is the right number i you know we can argue about the climate science my approach is very simple look if we're going to agree that we need to do something what's the best policy right if as i said climate change is a concern it's not our only concern so what is the way forward what do we if we accept that we are facing some risk how do we deal with this risk what is the best no regrets policy so i've been saying now for more than a dozen years natural gas to nuclear this is the way forward and this is the part that just you know as i said grills my cheese chaps my hide on this angola deal and it's on my sub stack robert brice.substack.com let them eat solar panels right the export import bank of the united states is not funding a natural gas-fired power our plant in angola even though angola has trillions of cubic feet of available natural gas instead we're funding a solar panel project i mean this makes no sense whatsoever so if we're serious about reducing emissions and bringing more people out of the dark and into the light which i think is incumbent on the wealthy countries to help developing countries do that how do we do that natural gas resources globally jordan are just they're not abundant they're super abundant they're geographically widespread and and there is an enormous amount of stranded gas look at the huge offshore fields that have been discovered off of africa tanzania other countries including angola enormous natural gas resources that have barely been tapped well some of that gas is going to be exported into the global market into europe and advanced countries or developed countries but africa those resources and to prevent them from doing so i think is just as you say i think it's morally wrong i think it's it's anatomy i mean it should be people should be shouting from the rooftop saying no we should be helping these countries come out of the dark we should be helping them develop because that's incumbent upon us way or at least not getting in their way so then natural gas to nuclear i'll just finish this other point this is one of the things that again to me when i look at these big climate ngos i don't call them environmental groups i don't call them green groups because i don't think they are either they're ngos they're climate activist groups and by the way they're spending four and a half billion dollars a year i've documented this that's their budgets they're just enormous but they're almost to a purse almost all of them are anti-nuclear well if we're serious about co2 i mean it makes no sense my line is if you're anti-carbon dioxide and anti-nuclear you are pro-blackout well i'm anti-blackout pro-starvation well right so we need to be helping develop this technology and these are the things that i think are positive now we can we can focus on a lot of things that are negative and i will grant you there are many negative things that are happening and we can throw rocks at the ngos and all the climate idiocy that's happening in terms of this or the the policy in idiocy rather around this but what we're seeing in the wake of the russia ukraine war that i think is really encouraging jordan is a move toward nuclear romania a lot of the countries france just finland just opened aqua just sweden just said we're gonna we're we're bagging our renewable push we're going to build nuclear plants just yesterday was june 29th edf group in france said we're going to build two more nuclear reactors the u.s tremendous amount of momentum and money behind new nuclear now there are a lot of friction points including fuel availability because the russians have are producing 46 percent i think over 40 percent of the global uranium enrichment market is in saskatchewan has the biggest uranium reserves in the world and they're bloody untouched and in our idiot country you know we have all these fossil fuel reserves but we have we have tremendous stores of of nuclear fuel as well of uranium and canada actually has good nuclear technology that can do reactor is a good reaction and canada is another good story and i'm working on a new documentary it's going to be out this fall it's called juice power politics and the grid and one of the the people we're featuring is one of your canadian colleagues chris kiefer he's done a remarkable job in in this revitalization of the canadian nuclear sector that you're you're going to rebuild some of your can-do reactors you're building an smr i think at darlington with a bx brx 300 so i won't say it's all due to to dr kiefer and he's a remarkable story by himself he's an emergency room podcast guesty oh you should put us in touch when you touch absolutely oh yeah no he's he's got he's got a lot of elvis he's six feet nine he's just this big presence but he almost single-handedly jordan has he has ignited this new rebirth in canadian nuclear and it's been a marvel so that canadia is kind of canada rather has kind of jumped into the lead but it's not so canada romania china's building dozens of reactors the russians are still pushing out their their technology uh britain france poland i mentioned romania so there is amidst all the crazy town that's happening the the one i think thing that is positive that's occurred in the wake of russia's invasion of ukraine is an is a recognition that if we're serious about reducing emissions or just more serious about not covering the the landscape littering the landscape with stupid wind turbines and solar panels we're going to embrace nuclear so i think that's a very positive thing that is happening and one that i'm watching well and where do you see where are you particularly optimistic on the nuclear technology front do you what do you think of small modular reactors and the molten salt technologies and so forth that people seem to be my my sense is that the way forward is something like standardized production of small modular nuclear reactors so that the cost per unit can be brought down and so that the systems can be distributed without having to build an immense amount of high of of like transmission wires so but i don't like i'm i'm trying to get up to speed on that but but i'm not precisely so where are you particularly optimistic on the nuclear front so well like you i see a lot of promise with nuclear in general so what about smrs which is small modular reactors there are a lot of technologies that are being developed now and a bunch of different companies that are pushing them out so the ge hitachi new scale here in the u.s xxx energy kairos oklo it remains to be seen which one will will be the one that makes it to market well among the most interesting ones to me jordan is x energy that's a high temperature gas reactor and they just recently did a deal with dao and dao announced in fact dao i think took an equity position in x energy and and they are planning to deploy four of their smrs at one of their dao's chemical plant in seadrift texas which is fairly close to corpus christi if memory serves well to me what's interesting about that one of those high temperature gas right so that's a safer design inherently than than a water-based reactor second it's that dow is looking at this endow is an old line chemical company we're very conservative they're looking at this and saying we think this is the right technology and further that they're saying we're going to use the high temperature process heat so we can make chemicals instead of burning gas to produce high temperature right to make oh yeah oh oh so it has that additional advantage right you want to walk through do you want to walk through that why that's important for people well sure so industrial process heat is needed for a lot of different things right refining mining chemical production so industrial consumers use a lot of electricity they use a lot of of energy in general so if you have a source of high temperature heat then you could produce high temperature steam and then use that for your processing of whatever it is that you're doing so for dow to make this deal with x energy i think is indicative of where the market the industrial consumers are seeing things how they see the market moving right and so that's quite intriguing i also think rolls-royce might be an interesting play and you know brit britain now is there technology the right one we don't know yet i think we're kind of in the i'd compare it maybe to the early days of video is it going to be vhs or is it going to be betamax right is it you know and which one will prevail but i think your general idea that we should have one or two designs is the right one right that is why france was so successful in deploying nuclear right they picked one nuclear reactor design and then they just stamped them out so that any engineer from any nuclear plant in france can go work at another plant because all the instrumentation all every all this equipment is the same i didn't know this until i went to paris a few years ago and i was talking to a nuclear engineer in france and he said at three mile island which of course is a nuclear plant where he had an accident here in the u.s there were two reactors but the two reactors had two different control rooms because they were built by two different companies well that makes no sense at all right so if we're going to see a new a new renaissance of nuclear there are a lot of friction points and i'll talk about those in a minute but we're going to have to speed up the regulatory regime and that means the nuclear regulatory commission here in the u.s we've had some u.s companies domicile in canada because they think it's it will be easier path to licensure if they start in canada and then come back to the u.s the europeans are going to have a different type of of licensing procedures than the us but the nrc is a big roadblock the other is the fuel part so this is where i think the friction parts are and i want to be very sober about this jordan because i was in japan earlier this year is very fortunate i'm very lucky in my career to be able to travel and see things and i went to fukushima daiichi and it was an indelible experience for me i've been pro-nuclear for more than a decade but seeing the ruined reactors at fukushima daiichi and hearing the people from tokyo electric power company talk about how they're taking the reactors apart slowly and the process that they're going through and what they're doing and then seeing what is actually happening in japan as well tepco is building a coal-fired power plant on tokyo bay right the japanese are embracing energy realism the home of the kyoto protocol they're not aiming at net zero that we met with top government officials we met with top industry officials i said so what about your carbon emissions they said yeah we're not we're not really going to pursue those we're pursuing energy security first and i had one guy just say very clearly look we live in a bad neighborhood we got the russians over there the chinese over there the north koreans over there we are going to take care of our energy security first so i think japan and more than any other country in my recent experiences is a is an indicator of how energy realism and energy security is trumping concerns about climate change and i think rightly so the japanese are nothing if not practical so they're building 1.3 gigawatt coal-fired power plant on tokyo bay they're also building another 500 megawatts ultra supercritical coal-fired power plant forgot where that one is and another five gigawatts of gas-fired capacity so they're slowly reopening their nuclear reactors but they're also being very terrified they're also very clear-eyed about where they are going in the world and they're saying energy security is our first concern and we're going to take care of that because our industry demands it and so so these are positive the chinese are doing the same thing i mean the challenge are are planning i think a hundred nuclear plants something like that over the upcoming decades but they're also expanding their coal-fired plants like mad which also makes an absolute bloody mockery of anything we're doing doing in the west on the so-called climate front because especially in a country like canada where our our emissions are so trivial on the world stage that they're not they're not even within the error margin of of estimate for for carbon dioxide effects and and that's and that's a critical point that i think that you know i've heard other people say this is not original to me but the emissions from the west in many ways don't matter anymore because the story is in places like vietnam bangladesh pakistan india china these are the places where emissions are growing so rapidly and in fact i spend a lot of time i nerd out on spreadsheets and i i the statistical review of world energy just came out so i've been studying it very closely the country that had the biggest and absolute terms the biggest increase in co2 emissions last year was indonesia followed closely by india so these are countries that have enormous populations and are are still desperately energy poor but let me return nigeria kicks in you know nigeria is going to have more people in it than china by the end of the century eh so and and your point there that we're seeing the huge growth in in energy consumption among the countries with the largest populations it's like well that's pretty bloody self-evident isn't it once those countries start to pass a certain threshold of industrial development that is where all the action is going to be on the climate energy front and so we should be planning for that and you know and vietnam is a good example of this and i've written about vietnam as well recently on on my sub stack that here's a country that is rapidly industrializing major industrial companies are moving to vietnam to hedge their bets about being in china so big companies nike adidas samsung apple to name a few locating in vietnam and suddenly vietnam is power short so what did vietnam just announced their viet command as their their state-owned mining company announced they're going to expand their coal mining capacity by 15 this is the iron this is the iron law of electricity what i call the iron law of electricity nod to my friend roger pilkey jr who coined the iron law of climate he said when faced between his his focus was face between climate policy and economic growth economic growth will win every time so i borrowed roger's idea and coined the iron law of electricity which is people countries and businesses will do whatever they have to do to get the electricity they need climate change is not their first concern and this was evident in japan this was the part that really was a sobering experience in going to japan but i've seen it myself i've seen people in india stealing electricity in beirut where i talk about that i write about it in my book seeing the generator mafia where pretty much everyone in lebanon pays two electric bills one to edl the grid operator and the other to the generator mafia who are the local entrepreneurs they call them the mob they call them the mafia but they're providing power when the grid fails in lebanon the grid fails in lebanon every day so this this iron law of electricity i think is another example in my view we have to be realists energy realism is energy humanism people are going to do whatever they have to do because they're not going to sit in the dark they're not going to let their you know the the like the the food in the fridge spoil they're going to find a small generator they're going to see yeah they're awesome they're also not going to let grandma freeze to death in the winter i mean i looked at domberg's data on the consequences of lowering thermostat temperatures just a few degrees and yeah he estimated for example that a three if i remember correctly and this is about right that a three degree decrease in thermostat temperature in the winter kills 110 000 people in europe that's old people you know because old people can't regulate their temperature very well and so there's two things we need to point out to everyone who's watching and listening and the first is is that if you raise energy costs imagine that there's a pyramid of it of economic development and there's hundreds of millions or billions of people who are sitting right on the threshold of poverty they've climbed out of absolute poverty so now they have enough money so that they don't have to worry about where lunch is coming from but that's just where they're at and they're barely there and if you increase their energy cost to any degree at all all you do is whack them down back down into absolute abject poverty and then they do things like slash and burn agriculture and they burn dung and and other you know very low energy dense high polluting fuels yeah we're right and they and then they pollute the indoor atmosphere and that's really really hard on their kids and their elderly people as well and so you cannot we got to say this over and over you cannot raise energy prices without devastating the poor period the end and and the more poor people you make as far as i can tell the worst things are actually for the planet rather than the better and that this brings us to another conundrum you know you pointed out that the green types tend not only to be anti-natural gas which is of course completely insane but also anti-nuclear and this points to the fundamental underlying motivation as far as i'm concerned is that it this green movement isn't so much green certainly not as a consequence of the fruits that is born as it is both anti-industrial and anti-human and those actually turn out to be the same thing and you can tell in these when push comes to shove cases because the bloody greens if they were actually concerned about carbon dioxide output which is what they say we should only be concerned about would be jumping on board the nuclear wagon bandwagon in a second saying well obviously we should transition to nuclear because it's zero carbon dioxide output and that's not happening so that means as far as i'm concerned that everything that their fundamental narrative is a delusional lie and it's got a malevolent twist in it too and you can see that manifesting itself in the refusal of these western ngos and and the world bank and so forth to lend money to developing countries to try to raise them out of poverty which is inexcusable there's a certain well you know this field better than i but there's a certain puritanical part of this right and a certain also i think a religious fundamentalism and and i'm sure other people have talked about this before i know but there is there are many overlaps between the christian belief and and these ideas around climate catastrophism right that the that we've sinned against the earth right we haven't sinned against god we sinned against the earth we need to repent we need to use less do less and go back to the garden right and even martin luther to you know you know keep going on this just a hair longer he would recognize carbon credits right you know like you get a carbon indulgence by buying some offset because you flew to fiji but let me just build on your point about the availability of hydrocarbons and how important it is and kirk smith was a professor at cal berkeley who died recently and i cited him i think in my latest book or in in my in my fourth book power hungry but he documented and was one one among the first researchers to document the effects of indoor air pollution on women and girls and you know i was interviewing a climate activist yesterday and by the way i don't call it green energy i don't call them green i call them climate activists i don't call it green energy i don't call it clean energy i called it alt energy right because i don't think it's green i don't think it's clean covering the landscape with solar panels destroying landscapes with wind with wind turbines i'm a long time critic of the wind business proudly so they don't like me i don't like them back okay because i have you know i've documented now for more than 10 years and on the renewable rejection database which is on my website robertbrice.com i've documented nearly 400 rejections of wind energy in the u.s from maine to hawaii it's happening in canada too by the way in ontario over 90 communities have declared themselves unwilling hosts to wind energy now you don't read about this in the new york times because it doesn't fit the narrative but i digress so back to the point about hydrocarbons and kirk smith indoor air pollution is one of the leading killers of women and girls in developing countries kirk smith and the who i think the world health organization documented something like three or four million women a year women and girls a year dying premature deaths because of indoor air pollution because they're cooking with dung or wheat straw in in their homes and and and kirk smith made this point they need lpg they need butane they need propane they need clean forget electricity for just a minute let's replace those low those low density fuels at low low density high polluting fuels with hydrocarbons that's a step change in their standards of living and so you know i but i'm with you in terms of kind of your broader points here we need more energy not less we choke and and i'll i'll stop here because i could go on and found the table here but expensive energy is the enemy of the poor and i remember very vividly i i live in austin which is of course you know i i used to have friends here it's a liberal hub right but a friend of mine a former acquaintance of mine he was pounding the table oh energy's too cheap and i thought okay here you are you vacation and you fly around the world you go somewhere here there and they're everywhere you're rich and you're telling me energy is too cheap i don't see it that way and i wait i haven't talked to him in a long time because of that because i just thought you don't understand what you're talking about expensive energy is the enemy of the poor and yet so many of these policies both in the developed countries and the developing countries are aimed and by these bilateral multilateral lenders by policy makers at the state level and federal level are aiming that are creating policies that make energy more expensive and i just think that's just fundamentally wrong energy means life and the absence of energy is death to quote my friend doomberg the bible is the root of all wisdom inspiration and spiritual

of all six thousand plus prayers and meditations i started to take this whole domain of trouble particularly seriously when watching what was happening in europe and starting to understand that the west in its delusions of repentance would sacrifice hundreds of millions of people and literally sacrifice them on the altar of gaia to not save the planet well virtue is signaling about how indus in the industrial enterprise was unethical despite benefiting from every single one of the gains that the industrial revolution has produced and being 100 absolutely unwilling to give up any of it at all whatsoever under any circumstances for ourselves like there's no excuse for any of that now my understanding is this is that we there's a pretty clear developmental pathway to cleaner and more reliable energy in the long run it's something like well you start at the very lowest rung with with dung and with wheat straw and with those things that and with wood scrap wood so forth that can be burned that's there in the local environment and it's low energy dense it's expensive it runs out easily it's unreliable it's polluting you move from that to coal now you move to coal because coal is unbelievably plentiful and it's dirt cheap and you can get a coal-fired plant up and running with relatively rudimentary technology and almost no time flat and it's disadvantage in particular is particulate pollution although it also produces a lot of carbon which i don't really care about but the particulate pollution is a problem you move from that to oil or natural gas and you move from that to nuclear like do we know this or or not is this just like it can can we rest assured that this is a reasonable developmental pathway and one that we should be pursuing well this is the way it's been happening for a long time now i mean that is the way the world has deep carbonized over time my friend jesse osabelle at rockefeller you know rockefeller university has documented this and and and shown we are gradually decarbonizing but that decarbonizing is happening as is underway in developed countries and we're they're you know dozens of underdeveloped countries that are just getting started right they're still at the biomass stage and there's this this claim oh well we can leapfrog they can the alt energy crowd the climate crowd says oh well they don't need hydrocarbons they'll jump right to renewables no wrong i mean while that's true in some cases in rural areas where solar and batteries are going to be the solution africa is rapidly urbanizing here's a quick quick comparison so you're you're a canadian is in rough terms there are 35 million canadians they use compared to 1.4 billion africans roughly the same amount of electricity that's the disparity that we're talking about now there's no numbers aren't exact but in rough terms that's a comparison so the need for electricity is overwhelming globally jordan it's just enormous so how do we you know this is the part where look we can talk climate change all day long what's the right number what's the wrong number what the you know who's doing the right thing who's the wrong thing what's the best no regret strategy as we look to the future and i think again of end to end natural gas to nuclear these are the ways that we are that no regrets okay so climate maybe we find in a few years well we were wrong about climate change i don't necessarily i'm not making that argument but when it comes the why natural gas or nuclear both are lower no carbon the technologies are very well developed they're available in numerous countries and they can scale at relatively low cost so all of those things together to me and make this a no-brainer and i'm going to pound the table continue pounding the table on that because this is the challenge of our time i mean when we look around the world this is when we look around the world and we think as humanists right if we're going to be humanists what do we do to help developing countries come out of the dark to develop how do we help countries like vietnam they're going to look out for vietnam first that is that you know every country is going to do what is the right pathway for them so how does how could the u.s how could the how could canada how could the european countries help those countries well help them build develop their natural gas and help them deploy nuclear energy at scale new next generation passively safe modular reactors these are the things that are going to help us decarbonize and electrify these countries that are so desperately poor right now okay so let's turn to two things here all right sure i would like first of all i i'd like to pick your brain momentarily about coal yeah there's lots of coal and so if we could figure out how to use that coal that would be real good because there's lots of it and it's everywhere and so how are we doing on the clean coal front how good are the are the modern coal-fired plants well in terms of for example getting rid of particulate pollution sure well i'll make a joke first which i think clean coal is kind of oxymoronic oxymoronic like military intelligence or family vacation right or jumbo shrimp right you can make cleaner coal and so i mentioned japan earlier they're building new coal-fired power plants what are they doing they're using ultra supercritical technology which is the the highest level of combustion you get you ring more watt hours for every kilogram of coal that you burn so that is the optimum that's if we're going to burn coal let's let's use ultra super critical technology but that's more expensive and not all countries are willing to do that instead they're building subcritical plants which is are the most common ones well you think that would be a place for potential subsidy then to help the countries that are building coal plants build better ones absolutely cared but i think but i think it's important to put it in historical context so i'm i've written about the history this is one of the points i make in a question of power is when you look at edison in'82 will he use coal on his on the pearl street station in lower manhattan he burned coal right well we're still now 140 years 141 years later cole globally still has 35 percent of the global electric sector market right so and and you mentioned china before global energy monitor which is a clearly an anti-coal group in in february put out a report last year china permitted two new coal plants a week right right so india is building new coal plants bangladesh vietnam uh numerous other countries indonesia indonesia had as i mentioned before has the highest or biggest increase in co2 emissions last year of any country in the world why because they rapidly expanded their coal fleet so coal is here to stay it for decades to come that is a fact these plants that are being built now are going to continue running so you know america because you know cheering on the closure of our coal plants well i think that's probably problematic in terms of reliability but that's a different discussion but so so geographically widespread widespread it's relatively cheap and it's super abundant so that is why so many countries if we close all the bloody coal plants in the west it also means that we won't be able to put our technological prowess to work to make the coal plants cleaner and it also means it'll knock us out of the international market for the development of coal-fired plants which as you pointed out is going to be a growth industry for you know into the foreseeable future so that seems like a stupid idea to me all things considered yeah i i don't know necessarily about that because there are a lot of companies that have that kind of technology that can deploy the japanese the malaysians the chinese but but i think the key here is just to think about it you know it's a global story right and if we're going to it's not it's not texas warming it's not is canada warming or america warm it's global warming it's global climate change we're going to deal with this we have to have some sensibility about the the the the world as a collection of nations that want to try and address this well what is going to be the weight of it's what is the way forward then it's going to be to make cleaner electricity cheaper and i think that means natural natural gas or nuclear well we could run around panicking about the sky falling even though it isn't and we could lie constantly about net zero and make everyone poor and we could hurt the hell out of the third world while not doing anything on the climate front instead which seems to be what we're doing you know these these net zero advocates first of all that entire that entire what terminology just grates on me it's like there is like net zero is a cliche not a policy and zero anything is impossible because we're not going to get to zero carbon output obviously ever and we shouldn't even aim at that because it's stupid you know even if we could reduce it 80 that would be fine but i i think that narrative is running out though i think i you know if you look at what's happening in europe i think the politicians particularly in germany we talked about germany earlier okay too the uk as well they're looking forward and saying you know we're not going to make net zero right we're this is we're gonna have to throttle this back the german green party has been has lost some remarkable recent elections got shellacked the german the german voters are looking around at this and they're saying wait a minute this is terrible for us so i i think some of this another positive sign in addition to the expansion of nuclear i think we're seeing more energy realism and thank thank the lord for that i mean it's taken a while yep all right so let's talk about let's take another attack on the environmental front now you've rather extensively about the dangers the environmental dangers of wind power and you're also well you you made a crack earlier about let them eat solar panels and so you obviously have some misgivings on the solar front so let's start with on the wind front so my understanding i'm going to lay out a few things and tell me if i'm right or wrong so first of all siemens last week two weeks ago announced that they were having catastrophic and i think the ceo said something like i can't believe how catastrophic our problems are with our wind turbines that's not a good thing for a ceo to say the wind turbines they're unreliable they obviously don't work when the wind isn't blowing which is quite a lot of the time and that's really a problem at night when the solar panels also don't work they're they don't have proven track record they only seem to last about 17 years god nobody knows what to do with them when they're decommissioned and they're very expensive to decommission they're killing whales like mad hypothetically they seem to be really hard on birds and so this just isn't working out very well and so now am i missing something on the wind front and then we could turn no i think you hit pretty well all of the issues here let's set whales aside let's set the wildlife issues aside i'm an avid bird watcher and this again is one area that just absolutely just i i it it's unbelievable to me you know that that the wind industry gets a pass when it comes to killing some of our most iconic wildlife including bald and golden eagles but set that aside for a minute let's talk about just basic physics so one of the key ways or the the essential keys to understanding our energy and power systems is to look at the physics metric of power density so we want high power density that's one reason why i'm so pro-nuclear super high power density we're talking 2 000 watts per square meter roughly so energy is the ability to do work power is the rate at which work gets done i'm sorry energy is the ability to work that's right power is the rate at which work gets done we measure power in watts so we want high watts per square meter nuclear explain that a bit more explain walk everybody through what energy density means because it's i'm sure it's a sophisticated concept and yeah and it is people need to understand it and and it's and to be clear it's power density so what is power it's a measure of energy flow it's measured in watts so you have different kinds of power density and and power is a measure of energy flow okay so you can have barrels of oil in the ground are energy barrels per day are power we energy is worthless unless we can make it flow and the more we can make it flow the better so we want more power flow which is watts so power density is a measure of energy flow from a given area of volume or mass and you're right it's not well understood fairly simple in physics terms but it's essential to understand it because power density determines the shape of our energy and power systems everywhere always all the time period okay so we want high power density sources ethanol is extraordinarily low because it relies on on on photosynthesis about one tenth of a watt per square meter wind energy i don't care where you put it is one watt per square meter period end of story elvis has left the building one watt per square meter solar is better about 10 watts per square meter so if i'm going to pick my renewables i think solar has more attributes better attributes than wind okay so what do we see though because of this low power density with wind it requires enormous amounts of land so and when it requires enormous amounts of land well you're impacting more people and the more you the only way to expand the output of wind is to capture more land it's axiomatic so to give you an analysis vatslav smill those are your fellow canadian has written about this he estimated back in 2010 to for the u.s to meet its electric demands with wind would require a land area twice the size of the state of california about eight years ago i'm sorry eight years later david keith and lee miller at harvard did a similar analysis came up with the same number if you were going to generate all the electricity in the us with wind energy you need a land area of 900 000 square kilometers twice the size of the state of california okay that's clear jesse jenkins from princeton recently wrote a piece in in in mother jones again saying that the footprint of wind energy is massive well this is a problem jordan i spend a lot of time in rural america and i these people i was in i i travel i meet these people they some of them become my friends they're rural landowners rural farmers rural ranchers we don't want 600 foot high wind turbines in our neighborhood we don't want to look at red blinking lights all night every night for the rest of our lives they these wind projects despite all these claims from the win business they hurt property values and they produce enormous amounts of noise pollution which are is bad for human health it disrupts sleep this has been proven again so these are polluting machines they're visually polluting their blights on the landscape they hurt human health they hurt property values and none of this matters to the sierra clubbers or these alt energy crowd because climate change right they they're like these totems these climate change scarecrows that's what i call them right that they're somehow going to solve climate change no they're not they're only being deployed because of the tax credits which are enormously lucrative for the companies that are doing this so just another quick point this tax credit pursuit of the tax credits what i call subsidy mining is what's driving this deployment of solar and wind but particularly the wind business so look at what happened in madison county iowa i wrote about this was in forbes some time ago but mid-american energy is subsidiary of berkshire hathaway owned by or controlled by warren buffett who in 2014 said the only reason to build wind turbines is to get the tax credits okay back to madison county berkshire hathaway a mid-american wanted to build a wind project in madison county madison county passes an ordinance saying we don't you know no more wind projects they effectively the ordinance said banned new wind projects they got sued by mid-american energy imagine if chevron or exxon did that it would be front page news in the new york times and instead crickets no reporting on this at all if the oil and gas industry was acting as aggressively as the wind industry has against rural americans and in fact in nextera energy sued one of your fellow canadians esther reitman filed a slap suit against her in canadian court because she was opposing one of their win projects and called nextera next error on her website they sued her and said they fired they put a slap suit on her the slams were designed to stop people from being intimidated by large organizations that was the bloody plan there right so imagine if this if the next if oil the oil industry did that but here is an american company suing a canadian a canadian court i mean the way these companies have acted in terms of corporate responsibility it's just crazy i mean it's just this be in this pursuit of subsidies what they've done from a corporate responsibility standpoint it's just like at the oil and gas industry acted this way it would be they would be pilloried and yet because it's alt energy they get a free pass in a world filled with uncertainties it's crucial to be ready for whatever

you're concerned with regards to windmills you know i'm an avid bird watcher and have been for more than 30 years in 1990 i can pull the story up in fact i wrote a piece for the christian science monitor back then about bird kills and open oil pits in west texas and and new mexico and for violations of the migratory bird treaty act and at that time the fish and wildlife service estimated that the oil and gas industry through their own negligence was killing about 600 000 migratory bird migratory birds a year they the fish and wildlife service and the department of justice brought something like 200 cases against the oil and gas industry prosecuted them rightly so and the oil and gas industry to their credit cleaned it up they put nets over their pits they closed their pits today the wind industry is killing at least that many birds probably more we don't know and there is no accountability because they're not required to report these deaths they have been prosecuted in very rare occasions but it's this oh and the justification as well oh well these these birds are going to get hurt by climate change sometime in the future oh yeah yeah you're you're killing them now because you think it might help in the future well that's just crazy policy that makes no sense whatsoever yeah and you don't do that with people either you don't get i mean this is and yet there's a free this is a free pass i mean we haven't talked about the whales we can talk about that as well but but this idea that oh we're going to kill them because we might have some climate change in the future and i'll return to it i'll return that i'll return to next era just one quick point last year thankfully they got prosecuted by the department of justice why because in wyoming next era had been warned by the fish and wildlife service three times not to build a wind project in known golden eagle habitat they did it anyway and so they were prosecuted and i was glad to see it under the migrant under the i think it was just under the migratory bird treaty act they should have been criminally prosecuted under the endangered species act bald and golden eagle protection act and the migratory bird treaty act that said they paid a fine but the fine they paid was less than the amount that they're going to earn from the tax credits for building the wind farm in the first place so there are perverse incentives at hand here and i i i i i i words fail me because i i do i care about wildlife but i think this is the death of environmentalism climatism has replaced care for the environment and this idea oh we'll just pave this rural countryside with wind turbines and solar panels in the name of climate change but are you out of your mind man we need to we need small well we need small footprints it's also the case too that this unidimensional mania in relationship to carbon dioxide is stopping us from solving environmental problems that could at least in principle be addressed like i looked into the environmental literature in detail about 15 years ago and my conclusion for better or worse was that one of the stupidest things we were doing was continually overfishing the coastal shells in the ocean and we do that like it's to call it devastating is to barely even scratch the surface i think we've eradicated something like 95 percent of the ocean life on the coastal shelves and that's about where the life is because you need sunlight for life and you need the shelves so it's a bloody catastrophe and it's impossible even to get people's attention focused on that because everybody who hypothetically has an environmental concern is leaping up and down about carbon dioxide and that means that every other problem and there are plenty of them and they are serious problems and some of them are remediable they're just ignored completely so you get a you get a get out of jail pass for any form of industrial development that claims carbon dioxide remediation as its goal and you get a moral pass if you jump up and down about carbon dioxide hard enough because you're saving the planet even if you're not doing any of the difficult work that would be necessary to actually do something useful on the environmental front plus you're sacrificing the poor not to help not to do anything but but make them poorer and more likely to pollute so this looks like a three-way catastrophe to me well and this is obvious in in the development of offshore wind on the u.s east coast where these and these ngos these climate ngos that in the past audubon society sierra club etc would have been jumping up and down to protect the north atlantic right whale from the encroachment of offshore wind develop offshore development i mean imagine if it was the offshore of the oil and gas industry was trying to develop and put hundreds because that's the goal hundreds of offshore platforms in the middle of known north atlantic right whale habitat a critically endangered species less than 350 or so specimens left on the on the planet imagine if this was the oil and gas industry doing that they would these groups would be raising hell i mean i mean they would be laying down they would be blocking the trucks and instead because it's the wind industry and largely being developed by foreign companies not even american companies it's it's what michael schellenberger calls the environmental betrayal and i think that's the exact right word i'm old enough to remember you know save the whales and that you know was kind of parodied like you know save the gay baby whales for jesus right you know this was kind of like this was the kind of almost a joke right but that environmentalism right did and i call it that i'm working on an essay on the death of environmentalism because i think that's what we're seeing that's what we're seeing that this this idea of protecting landscapes or protecting wildlife has been has been forsaken for climatism what we've and what i call climatism and renewable energy fetishism so instead instead of a focus on preserving landscapes preserving wildlife and and and and that that real deep green ethic has been replaced by this idea that any wind turbine is a good wind turbine any solar panel is a good solar panel and it is most obvious i think in this well not just in the onshore wind issue which i've documented and the rejections of solar by the way on the the solar rejections on the renewable rejection database i think we're at 130 or more rejections or restrictions but this climatism this new renewable fetishism i think is most obvious when it comes to the the north atlantic right whales and the development of offshore wind on the east coast of the united states sad to see so so the way it looks to me like this is that people people's reputations are extremely important to them because they signal their position in the hierarchy and the higher you are in the hierarchy the more stable your nervous system is and the more positive emotion you expect you experience and so and plus all sorts of other benefits accrue to you because people if you have a good reputation people flock to you so reputation really matters so that means that there's an avenue open constantly for false avenues to reputation enhancement and that's what psychopaths and narcissists do but it's also what ideologues offer because they tell people look if you're a good person you stand up against problems here's the problem which in this case would be carbon dioxide thus you could be a good person all things considered and have your reputation enhanced merely by standing up against carbon dioxide takes absolutely no work on your part whatsoever you just have to protest and complain you don't actually have to solve problems and now you're a good person and now that's a pre-packaged solution especially for young people who are looking for moral virtue say well all you have to do is be anti-industrial and anti-carbon dioxide and now you're now your reputation is significantly enhanced and anyone who stands in your way is like a devil and and evil and so that's the that's the religious nexus that we're dealing with here and the problem with that is as you're pointing out is that well first of all it's really hard on the poor and second it sacrifices all the real problems to the this pseudo problem solution or pseudo problem pseudo-solutions and and so now and so now this is destructive and so now the solution is to go throw some soup on some paintings in the museum yeah right and right we're just like oh i'm going to protest by by being a vandal i mean and so that's right yeah exactly well that that and that signals that opposition to the you know colonial industrial enterprise or whatever the hell it is but there's a certain but there's a certain pathetic aspect to that i mean it's there these these kids i call them a guy i'm going to be 63 here pretty soon and i look at them and i think what are you doing i mean what is your hope for the future have you no idea how privileged you are living where you live have you no sense of yourself in the world relative to the rest of the planet because we mentioned i think before we started recording but i'm i'm happy i'm working on a piece for the alliance for responsible citizenship which you're helping found in and i've written a long paper and and on on electricity availability in the developing world and i've documented i went through using data the latest data from our world and in data they're 3.7 billion people in the world today almost half of the world population right now that live in places where electricity consumption is 12 1200 kilowatt hours or less per capita per year that's about the same 1200 per hour kilowatt hours about the same amount of electricity is consumed by a large kitchen refrigerator in the united states so imagine this for 47 of the population on the planet today is living in electricity poverty and we're and we're complaining because our electricity isn't you know from alt energy or something i mean there is there there there's a certain i think michael schellenberger calls it this kind of nihilistic narcissism or so i'm not sure exactly how he describes it but but there's something about this only presentism right that we only have right now and none of him there's no history there's no future and but there's no sense of how we in the west are i mean i i sometimes pinch myself i mean just how lucky i am and not just in my career in my family you know married to a wonderful woman got great kids but in terms of energy and energy availability and then yet all we you know what we're hearing and is what is dominating this administration and i say this is not a partisan i'm not a democrat i'm not a republican i am disgusted but this biden administration is the most anti-hydrocarbon administration in american history and all and there it seems like this climate issue is the only anything they want to talk about when you know an existential threat and i'm thinking existential threat a hundred thousand americans died last year of opioid overdoses i my son jacob is 23. within the last two months two people that he knew two two kids two boys that he knows i say young men died of opioid overdoses here in austin that's a that's a public health crisis and yet where has the biden administration been on fentanyl where are they on opioids why isn't he pounding the damn podium saying we have to do something about this instead he's standing up and bragging about some stupid 900 million dollar loan to the angle and so they can build solar panels where are your priorities where is your humanism i mean i i get worked on this is part of the reason well this is part okay so on the arc front the alliance for responsible citizenship i mean we're trying to do a couple of things first of all we are working diligently with bjorn lomberg who's on board with the project because i think of all the people that i've met his ability to prioritize is unparalleled and he's done very careful empirical work showing what our priority should be now it turns out to be complicated and it's not you get to be a good person if you shake your protest sign up and down it's a lot more complicated than that but we're also concerned you know you said there's something pathetic about watching these young people for example glue themselves to to paintings and i think that's where pathetic degenerates into outright criminal by the way but i take your k take your point with regards to pathetic i mean part of the problem with classic liberals and the conservative types is that we we they haven't been able to put to get forward a narrative that's compelling on the genuine moral advanced front right and that's what we're trying to do with the ark is we'd like to say well you know why don't we envision a future that we could all get on board with voluntarily without fear in compulsion and tyranny and that would be something like well what would it look like well how about we get how about we take those 47 percent of people that you just described who are barely bloody well scraping by and get energy to them so that they can stop scrabbling around in the dirt and can start contributing their brain power to the collective human enterprise how about we make that a bloody priority and remember other than that while we're doing that we could we make some real advances on the environment front because as soon as they're rich enough to care they'll start caring and that's i mean even china is greener than it was 20 years ago you know that and it's partly because as china has gotten rich people have started to care a little bit about their local environment and we can really you know places like india are almost at that threshold now where they're going to start to really care and so and the story could be instead of oh my god it's an apocalyptic nightmare and everyone's going to die and we should only have 500 million people on the planet and i don't know how the hell we're going to get rid of the other 7.5 billion but we'll figure out some way we could say no you know more people like musk has been saying more people the better because we can convert we can convert all that to brain power and if we were ethical and we had a clue we could have a future that everybody could be proud of where no one is starving where there's a world of abundance where everybody has opportunity and that would be a lot better than this bloody apocalyptic nightmare that justifies increasing top 10 down tyrannical pressure it's not a good idea and and the energy has to be one of those most fundamental building blocks and i i'm completely on board with that because as i say energy realism is energy humanism we have to be realistic about the limits of this the these renewables right and my friend jesse oswell i mentioned before he said just because he says wind and solar may be renewable they are not green and i think that's a just a great a great way to think about them yes they're renewable but just because the renewable doesn't mean they're green what an example i i you know i could pound the table on this one jordan because it does just get me riled up please do i was in wisconsin i had an event at the university of wisconsin oshkosh a few weeks ago and i flew into milwaukee and i've been contacted people from rural america contact me all the time and asking me to you know help them find a lawyer help them you know publicize their you know their fight against their renewable project well john uh john barnes is a resident of christiana wisconsin a little town of'00 it's about an hour west of milwaukee so i got the rental car i drove straight there i met him i'm at the town town supervisor mark cook and another one and a woman who was there whose name escapes me at the moment they're fighting a project that would cover get this seven square miles of their little farming community it's a farming community of'00 would cover some of the best farmland in all of wisconsin with solar panels some of the best farmland in wisconsin some of the best farmland in the world and these local people are saying we don't want this and yet it's in venergy this privately owned renewable company out of chicago that is going to develop the project and then flip it to local local utilities circumventing wisconsin state law but it screws that farming community i mean just screws them and it's and who's speaking up for them no one you know winning solar may be renewable they are not green why in the world would we be covering prime farmland with solar panels the answer is very simple it's the climatism and the investment tax credit you and you yeah you put you put those you put those two together right this renewable energy fetishism which is i think the right word right description with these incredibly lucrative tax credits which for solar amount to like 30 percent of all the layout the initial capital cost of the project it's incredibly profitable for these renewable energy developers to do these projects and so you know oh food you know with fiber you know farmers we don't care about that we're here to make money and these are little you know not little farms but they're growing corn and soybeans they're you know they're they're they're rural farmers they're just getting by and yet they're just gonna get screwed by these kinds of projects where's the new york times where's the new york times why is it why is the washington post report hands why is it in in npr why aren't they reporting on this because they don't care so you said something interesting that solar and wind are renewable but you know i don't think that's true exactly let me say what i mean by that the sun and the wind are renewable but that doesn't mean that solar and wind power are renewable those aren't the same thing and and the reason the reason i'm saying that is because the lifespan of solar panels isn't very long and the lifespan of wind generators isn't very long and so they're not renewable at all because once they exhaust themselves they have to be scrapped and destroyed and then they they have to be rebuilt so i don't understand what's renewable about that at all like if if we were growing solar solar panels in the field that would be a different thing but we're not wood is renewable because wood will grow but like and i i don't know exactly what happened to siemens i haven't been following that story close enough to know but the siemens manufacturing company and they've taken a huge stock hit because of this said that their solar or their wind mill generating systems are much more problematic than they had originally thought what did they mean by that like what what exactly is the problem do you know the problem on that front what are they run run into right i i don't know exactly i haven't looked in into that specifically but here's my theory and let's go back to physics and and fluid fluid mechanics the bets limit is what determines the amount of energy that you can harness from the diffused energy in the wind right it's it's like a water a water and wind i think in many ways so i understand an amount of physicist but they function in many of the same ways right you there's a limited amount of power that you can harness from this diffused source of energy i think they just got to a point where they made the system the machines got so big that the the forces on them are effectively tearing the machines apart right that they couldn't the forces the torque the forces that they're trying to do with in these gearboxes which are incredibly complex machines that these you know the stresses were just too great right that they made them too big but the variability too right i mean those bloody wind mills they have to they have to operate from conditions of like zero wind whatsoever which isn't a problem too like to like gale level gale level storms and that that's a tremendous engineering challenge especially and you're also putting them in the bloody salt water out in the middle of the ocean right which is just madness by the way you know that you're gonna put them out there any put anything in salt water it's going to cost you two or three times more than putting it on land so i think this is about basic physics and they're getting to the limits of the bets limit right and you have these blades that are 80 meters long and you've got to manufacture those and that's another thing and then when they're done you you can't you have to landfill them right there's no way to recycle them but i want to take it a little bit different direction jordan because it's not just about the machines and how they're built it's the supply chains and this is the other part that is not getting the kind of attention that it deserves and i've written about this on my sub stack that these supply chains for alt energy are almost all dependent on china let's look at electric vehicles why do you think elon musk is building his next gigafactory i'm in austin they just built one here it's a massive factory i just flew in the other the other night from miami and we flew over it it's a massive bet on a few very specific commodities cobalt lithium neodymium neodymium iron boron magnets dysprosium and terbium to name a few manganu some cute a few others copper obviously so what's the problem there well the chinese control the market for 90 of the global market for neodymium iron boron magnets which are the key uh element in the ev drive motors right nearly all the electric vehicles being produced today use this type of magnet so other countries can make those magnets but who controls the terbium and the dysprosium two other rare earth neodymium turbium and dysprosium are all rare earth elements china controls 100 of the terbium and dysprosium markets those are the critical things that are used to dope the magnets that are put into those evs so they can function at high temperature so it's not but okay so let's go beyond the magnets which are needed as well in wind turbines in offshore wind turbines in particular but the new generation of wind turbines need these same magnets and not just a few ounces or a few kilograms talking tons of magnets china controls the market completely what about the other things that we need graphite for batteries copper for the the material intensity of electric vehicles is far greater than that for internal combustion engines so who who where do all these supply chains lead to china i'm not a china basher china is going to take care of china but why in the name of peter paul and mary now would the united states be to be staking its future economy on the chinese supply chains it doesn't make any sense whatsoever i mean and for the u.s to try and reassure all of those technologies including rare earth element refining and and and these and processing copper mining and processing and we can talk about uranium as well there are all these supply chains that figure into the big picture here that are just like there's a lot of hand waving oh we'll we'll just keep importing it again who are you where is the strategy here where is the long-term thinking about our strategic vulnerabilities and i don't see any of that and it's very worried that's the problem with doing things in an idiot fear-based panic is that these are very very complex problems right and the supply chain problem is an invisible part of that and if we did repatriate those industries that you described well that would mean a lot more minds and it isn't obvious at all in today's regulatory environment that that's even vaguely possible plus it's not like there's not an environmental cost to let's say copper mining so so the the notion that this is somehow green in some obvious way is not it's not attainable notion at all and then you add that supply chain vulnerability to that and that that could be well that's obviously unwise to say the least well well and and it applies to solar as well and this is something else that's been largely ignored in many cases just flat swept under the rug is the supply of polysilicon for solar panels now let me be clear i have eight and a half kilowatts of solar panels on the roof of my house why did i put them on because i got three different subsidies hello i'm i'm opposed to energy subsidies unless i'm getting them jordan all right so let's be clear but am i sure that those solar panels which are made in korea don't have any content that was that came from china no and when you look at the solar market in fact the u.s government just two years ago issued an advisory saying that the about uyghur slave labor in xinjiang and the content in particular for polysilicon produced in xinjiang with uyghur slave labor and and the u.s government called it genocide now are these credible are these exactly right i don't know for sure but this is very problematic i mean imagine if the oil and gas industry were in any way connected to something involving slave labor i mean it would be front page news but because the solar industry again they get a free pass and i just think that we live in a world of networks and that's the part that i think if i was gonna think about how your your point about oh these simplistic notions it ignores the fact that all of these systems all the networks that we rely on are all interrelated and we've we've forgotten that and particularly when it comes to the alt energy discussion we've neglected this the the to understand how how vulnerable we are how we're how reliant we are on foreign suppliers and that includes enriched uranium but in particular it includes rare earth elements neodymium iron boron magnets polysilicate nearly all of the alt energy stuff that is being pushed and being heavily subsidized now through the inflation reduction act in the tune of 400 billion dollars depends in either almost completely or in large part on chinese supply chains yeah well well the thing is is when it evolves accord it's full of a multitude of checks and balances right there's many people providing hydrocarbon based electricity and there's all sorts of supply chain problems that have been ironed out and nailed down and had a certain degree of resilience built into them over the course of decades and those are relatively simple technologies in some ways as well and now what we're trying to do is run in a mad rush because the sky is falling to replace all that even though we don't know how and it's absolutely impossible failing to understand at all the invisible supply chain complexities because the people who are putting forward the policies have never had to grapple with anything like that and they just assume that if you plug an electric outlet plug into the wall that the electricity comes out of the wall right and and further that you know there's this blind spot here let me focus in on the u.s electric grid and my friend emmett penny with grid brief has done a lot of good reporting on this and and across the u.s we've had grid operators warning of reliability problems pjm new york iso california obviously has had huge problems with grid reliability the the the miso of the midcontinent independent system operator all have been warning and as well as the north american electric reliability corporation of reliability problems why because we're shuttering our coal plants too fast and instead of having keeping those coal plants online were the the push is on for a lot of these utilities to install renewables because that's where the money is you mean the coal plants for example that the british government had to reactivate like three weeks ago because it got so hot the solar panels wouldn't work you mean those coal plants it's just very similar ones yes exactly so i i what but there's again i think this is a lack of forward thinking and a lack of accountability and then i saw it here in texas right with the ercot blackouts in february of 2021 there was this idea oh well the market failed well who made the market well well the legislature well who's in the legislature a bunch of lawyers well they don't know what the they don't know how the electric grid works they like the idea of the market and so they said well we're going to make a market it's going to be great well who who was responsible well no one was responsible and that's what we're seeing now when it comes to these bigger threats to the reliability of the u.s grid is everyone's looking around well who's responsible for reliability no one well that kind of a problem so i think it's you know i think we've talked around a lot of big issues here but to me the one the more when it comes down to it the us in general and i think the west in general when it comes to the alt energy push with climatism renewable energy fetishism it's this narrow focus on this idea of co2 is the only issue no it is a concern it is not our only concern we have to be concerned about reliability affordability resilience these are the key things because one of the key things that really brought this home to me and really motivated the work that i'm doing on this documentary that i'm working on with my colleague tyson culver it's one thing to talk about at blackout it's another thing to to be blacked out and it really once that happened i realized well wait a damn minute if this can happen in texas the energy capital of the world what is going on here and so that led us into this deep dive for this our new our new documentary when is that coming out it'll be out this fall we haven't made the announcement yet but it's uh juice power politics and the grid and and that comes out just before that comes out why don't we do another podcast and you can provide us with some video footage as well that we could incorporate into the podcast to advertise it in some more in some if in a manner that is as effective as i can manage because well issue you know in this this arc enterprise we have six domains of of focus let's say and what and one is energy and one isn't in one is environment there's four others yeah but right we we understand i think as much as we possibly can that the issue here as you pointed out is affordability let's say in reliability and we we want to take those words apart momentarily maybe we can do that close this program i'm off affordability okay that means poor people don't die right right that's what affordability means it doesn't mean that you know reasonably well-off people can save a few dollars on their energy bill because the people who are most hit hardest by far by any increase in energy costs are the people who are barely clinging to the bottom of the economic hierarchy and there's billions of people like that and they can easily be knocked back down into absolute privation and this idiot moralizing in the west is exactly doing that and it's hurting poor people like mad in in the west as well so it's not just in the developing world right and reliability it's like well reliability means that your food doesn't rot in your refrigerator how about that or in the supermarkets right and reliability means that your power is there when you're on the bloody operating room table and you need everything to work a hundred percent of the time which is what we've managed right we have this miraculous bloody industrial state where people are working flat out 100 of the time to make sure everything works one hundred percent of the time and we've managed that and we're doing everything we can now to compromise that in the name of a a false and potentially genocidal moral virtue it's absolutely appalling there's a you said a lot there i'll reply this way which is if your energy isn't reliable it's not affordable and that is the key right here right right yeah when you talked about those countries that are turning to the mafia so to speak to right to supply backup energy well obviously that's going to happen everybody will have a bloody diesel generator in the backyard if we make the grid unreliable and i don't think that'll be that good for the planet well and so you know to build on that point if your electricity isn't reliable it's not affordable so that's what i saw in lebanon with the generator mafia where the grid the grid fails every day and so people they they have the the generator they have to pay two electric bills one to edl electricity and one to the generator mafia in some cases they're the almost the same cost right or look at here here in the us what's been one of the best stocks in the united states over the last few years generac the company that built standby generators right well why is their stock booming because everyone looks at the grid and that we're seeing increasing numbers of blackouts across the country so people are acting in a rational way and they're buying generacs well who can afford generacs it's the same people who can afford electric vehicles the average household income for the average generac buyer is around 130 140 000 that's twice the u.s average so here people who are you know i'm do okay i'm not rich men but you know if i wanted a generac i could afford one i suppose but if your electricity isn't reliable then it's not affordable and if it's not reliable you buy a generac because you know that it's going to go off so i've seen it myself after a hurricane in louisiana people like get a small generator and they're putting gasoline in it because they can't you know they're we met one guy at the gas station because he's buying gasoline to his mom can sleep at night with an air conditioner right in houma louisiana we talked to this guy so so if it's not reliable you're going to have to spend enormous amounts of money to make it reliable so these things go hand in hand but i'm so pleased that you know i was honored flattered to be asked to you know participate in in the arc project because electricity is fundamental and it is a humanist it is a humanist standpoint to say this is the critical this is the critical form of energy that we crave as humans and it's critical because it makes us more human electricity is our bodies are electric where our entire systems are electric and the creation of the electric grid is one of the greatest engineering feats in human history and it has changed humanity like no other form of energy ever has and if we're going to be humanist and i will stand on that pulpit all day long for going to be humanists we need to bring more electricity to more people and in particular to women and girls because that they're half they're they're half of humanity and electricity is an excellent place to end absolutely man absolutely there is no bloody way that you can be pro-poor and you know of the often the most vulnerable people on the poor front are obviously women and children there is no way you can be pro-poor and anti-energy those two things do not go together not in the least so yeah yeah it's unconscionable and one of the things we really do want to do with the ark and we're very happy to have you on board and to have your help on in this regard is to push constantly to drive energy prices down and to climb up that hierarchy we talk about right from from biodegradable fools food fuel sources to coal to hydrocarbons past hydrocarbons hopefully up into nuclear with renewables in there wherever they can actually be wherever they can pull their own goddamn economic weight without a variety of market distorting idiot subsidies that that are that are causing all sorts of counterproductive activity so anyways good talking to you amen to that one jordan all right all right so all right so good talking to you and to everyone watching and listening thank you for your time and attention these things especially for you young people who are listening you know you guys got to think this through because this is the world that's being created now and you could have a world of you know continual abundance and reliability which is kind of what we've had for the last 50 years miraculously enough or you could wander down this demented pseudomoral route and break everything while making the planet worse and those are basically the options that are open to you and so you know it was good to talk to robert today he's got some intelligent things to say on the energy and environment front and as a man who's also concerned with environmental considerations and so you know it's good to think this through and to issue the cheap moralizing and to work forward into a future where we are doing what we can to supply energy to poor people because that's the best possible thing we could manage at least on the practical front so thank you very much for talking to me today sir let's have another podcast when you get this documentary up and ready that would be a very good thing we'll see you in london at the end of october obviously i'm looking forward to reading your report the one that's been commissioned for the for the alliance for responsible citizenship and so until then we'll turn now over to the daily wire side i'm going to talk to robert for another half an hour a little bit about so you know a little more personal issues i'm interested in how his his calling to the energy environment nexus came about and and to delve a little bit more into his motivations for devoting his life to that so join us on the daily wire plus front if you're inclined the folks there could use the support anyways at the moment especially because we're under you know pretty heavy assault by the youtube types at the moment so thanks invisible youtube background sensors you bet robert thank you very much thanks thanks a lot jordan it was a pro it was a privilege [music] thank you
