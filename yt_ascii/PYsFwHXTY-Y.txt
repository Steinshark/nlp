so hello everybody i am here with frederica matthews green many of you probably have heard of her have seen her she really is a famous author she has written several books she is involved in many causes she is really a light in the pro-life movement she has been involved also just as as a upstanding christian woman that has been given ways for for women and for people to see how we can live our life as christians in the modern world she is also very involved in ancient faith as well has written many blogs she's just all over the place if you just google her you will see that she has done many many things and so i'm very happy to have have her with us we're going to talk a little bit about you know how it is as people that we can reengage the world with meaning that we can kind of rediscover the shining aspect of the world how we can do that and and i know she's got great insight about that so frederica this this discussion kind of started it's almost humorous because someone pointed me to a facebook post that you made which was kind of like a little rant about the term re-enchantment and how you didn't like that term and it's true that we've been using that term like myself father andrew many people have kind of been using that term and so i thought it was it was a little it's probably a good place to start maybe you can tell us a little bit why it isn't that word bothers you and hopefully that'll be a springboard for for a deeper discussion sure yeah i think it probably will be i was just noticing that as much as i sympathize with the goal of re-enchantment and as much as i was very heartened by you saying that it's inevitable actually it's reality you know people got to return to reality eventually but i didn't like the term i noticed i was avoiding using the term and i thought why so yes i did intend to be a humorous not a serious challenge my objective was that i think the ultimate objection is it focuses on the world that needs to change rather than we need to change but the term suggests that god created the world and then he enchanted it in a separate step and that somehow it became disenchanted and now we need to find the power somehow to re-enchant it i just questioned almost every step in that range there yeah it's almost as if it's as if it's our role to kind of put the magic back into the world you know rather than like you said like you suggested in the post which is to transform our own selves our own relationship with god and that the the transformation the change in the way that we perceive the world is almost going to happen on its own let's say once that happens yes i've long felt that when the time came that christians were losing the right to speak in the public square that we would see a resurgence of miracles and that also would be very important for each person to know how to tell the story of your own life in christ and the things you've seen god do in your life because we need to be able to tell our story you know at 20 or 30 years ago it was all about having our our our objective arguments in line you know our apologetics we needed to be able to argue our cause logically time is over and we need to be humble and we need to rehearse it give it a try think through what what would your story be if you're giving a elevator talk to a non-christian what story would you tell them yeah well i think so i'm going to make my pitch for the word for the word just to start us off and then we can go on but wrong wrong this is this is this is this is the pitch that i'm making okay is it it really is in the the meaning of the word like almost the etymology of the word which is that that one of the aspects of modernity or the modern world has been to make us believe that the world doesn't have it's not a song that the word that the world is not a pattern it's not a poem that it's kind of this weird arbitrary you know layout of facts that have you know like billiard balls that hit each other and that have no meaning to them and that meaning is actually put back on top of the world and so in a way the way that i kind of view the term enchantment is almost the opposite of how you described it which is is rather kind of reliving the fact that the world is actually a pattern that it is a song it's a dance it's a story and that we need to dive back into stories and the example you gave about about let's say being capable of telling a good story the good story of your own life the good story of your own encounter with others and with christ and with the saints that's exactly what i'm talking about in a way that's like and that not just tell it but really kind of live the world as a story rather than you know this kind of cold arbitrary world that that a lot of the let's say the materialists have wanted us to believe the world is so that's my that's my pitch for the word i i get now the thing about singing a song because chant in french is literally song so the world has been has a song in it it is within a song in chat and we need to participate in that mostly that's what we need to do recognize that this is reality and then find a way to to sing our part in that song to bring that that hymn of worship to life in the world yeah but i think that you're you're i think that the the let's say the resistance you have is is appropriate in the sense of especially i think some of the images people were posting on the facebook post were the best ones which is you know mickey mouse as the sorcerer who is like enchanting the the brooms and everything and i think that's a perfect image to show the difficulty of how people tend to understand it which is almost in really in the magical in the bad aspect which is that we as people have the power to impose a narrative on the world and this is actually something that we've seen happen more and more in social media and just regular media where there's a kind of wizard aspect where you see people trying to force a story on reality and try to to make us believe things which are actually just this kind of imposed reorganized things in a in an actually dishonest way to make us see a pattern forcefully and i think that that really is the difficulty and as christians we need to really discover the true the true pattern the true song which is there in the world rather than as using human power to just kind of impose these narratives on on the world so that's that's kind of how i see it you know what i think is is true is that the the real pattern the true pattern is embedded in reality and we are definitely being threatened and even coerced by stories that are not true like in the us the story that the whole country was founded in order to spread slavery it's it's just not true it's a heartbreaking story maybe you can tell is this story true or not is does it create hope does it create joy and wonder does it make you love other people or does it make you hate them there's some really elementary sorts of tests we can use to find out whether or not this is a true story a true song yeah and also true stories have many sides that say i i've been trying to help people see that for example some of the great epics you know like the trojan like the epics of the trojan war like the iliad there's a way in which you can actually sympathize with all the different sides of the of the story even in a conflict like there's a there isn't just this simple demonizing of of the other but really a way in which a way in which these the different elements of the story kind of point to something bigger than what they are and those have been always been the great stories you know and and the simple stories are those where you know it's it's it's so simple and clear especially in these the the modern political narratives like okay they're the bad guys we just need to destroy them and then everything will be fine yeah i was going to ask you if you've seen timothy patitz's book the ethics of beauty and it begins with the story of the iliad the odyssey and he proposes that what used to happen is soldiers would gather and over the course of several days someone would sing this long story to them and it had the effect of healing trauma that that really was the kind of therapy to be first in this story where there are good people and bad people and good people do bad things sometimes and there's death it's a very ultimate story and hearing this beautiful song was a way to reorient themselves to a reality that had been chaotic and terrifying and to help them find that that place of a kind of an eternal beauty of their own story fits into an eternal song so i do recommend the book it's dr timothy yes he's been on my channel before yeah and we had a wonderful we had a wonderful discussion about you know beauty as being really the foundation of of reality and i think as in the iliad especially there are some scenes which do they really do seem to do exactly that you know the meeting with the trojan king to negotiate the body of his son is such a intense moment of of of almost even though it's said from told from the greek side there is this deep compassion even for your enemy and and kind of recognizing that he's still my enemy and there's this anger and all of this is kind of going through and there's no justification of the the moral decisions that are made it's just this this this this participation in the difficult and painful story and i think i agree that that would definitely be something which if we understand it that way that it can that he could play a kind of healing role and i think that's what the crucifixion is is ultimately really what that leads to you know when you look at our services during holy week the intensity of the mourning but also this this idea that we in a way are also those that crucify christ but that we're also mourning him and that we also wish hope for his resurrection all of this kind of this jumble of of pain and hope and and and even to a certain extent guilt but it's all kind of coming together towards this movement where it will be you know resolved in the resurrection i wonder why it's so hard to tell the christian story in a post-christian environment because i think what people what non-christians expect the christian story to be is simplistic and sunny and artificially optimistic and that the happy ending is already is pre-assumed before you begin the story in a way that is true we do believe there's an ultimate happy ending it's not in question but the expectation is that christianity is a shallow thing and i don't really know how we how we approach that yeah it is offered as a very shallow thing by by christians in america i can speak for my own country it's been simplified down to just a few words how you how you can be saved yeah and i think that participation is really the only way to experience that you know when you go through the services of lamentation you know they're long and and and you kind of you get into this mode of you're tired and you're but you're listening to these these amazing songs of lamentation and then these little glimpses of call to resurrection like kind of intersperse in the lamentations and so you really you really almost do feel like you're going through a morning which is leading to to healing at the end but it's not it's not like just surfing over the pain or surfing over the trauma it really is diving into it but then giving these little this like punctual hope that keeps growing and growing as we get to holy saturday and then finally kind of explodes into the resurrection i just learned something too from people on my facebook group that i've never heard this before and i want to ask if you had about the crotalus which is at that friday night service people would have little wooden gadgets that would make a clacking or knocking noise a rattle really yeah and if they say it's because in the west you weren't allowed to ring any bells between thursday thursday evening and saturday morning so in order to do the things that alderbells would do they had these little placards this is on holy friday yeah on holy friday and but the thing is that cretalis is a greek word and so i think it was brought over from the the orthodox practice and somebody wrote in and said he was visiting a ukrainian orthodox church in canada and they had like a whole box of these little wooden noisemakers that he said he thought they were probably a century old so it's an interesting way that we bring not music but sound you know we're inserting something that may not be a beautiful sound but we're amplifying the experience through extra means through the through incense through music through the light everything that's going on it's a full body experience yeah but it could be the it could be especially if it's on holy friday it could actually be about death and because noise noise is usually related to to death like if you if you think of how or the end it's related to the end you see it in purim festivals for example these noise makers are used in in purim and it's a spinning like a spinning noise you know and it seemed it might have to do with with a kind of the carnival aspect of the crucifixion where where the crucifixion has everything in it so there is an aspect of the crucifixion which is like the end of a world like this end and then this kind of moving into a new beginning at the same time that that that could possibly be why but i'm really surprised to hear that i'm actually kind of excited to know that that exists yeah yeah and this and they're very beautiful you know what you find they're very beautifully carved yeah it's another train of thought worth worth it's worth exploring and so a lot of your work has been i think about this kind of helping modern americans modern christians modern even secular people try to plunge back into into a world of meaning you know and so what are what is some of the advice you you give to people to help them reconnect to to this meaningful world there's always a dilemma and you know this is an orthodox christian of wanting to offer people the small bits of the you know tradition that they are willing to take on and what hope will be a more complete journey offering these these little things that perhaps they can comprehend even before they're totally on board with everything and yet you know that by taking a small piece out you're giving them something artificial i always felt that way even in my episcopalian days when i was in episcopal seminary in the 70s all of a sudden there was this new hymn it was a very ancient hymn it was used in the early church and it was like it had been just rediscovered and the hymn is holy god holy holy immortal have mercy on us and as you know we we use this hymn a great deal yeah all that's every day it's in every libertarian service and in our daily daily prayers but at the time i was like wow there's really something different about that prayer it sounds more like a chant it sounds more like an incantation to spin around on enchant incantation as if god is present when you say these words and my thought was why haven't we been using this all along if we know what the hymns and the prayers of the early church are the the visual arts of the early church if these things are still known why were they ever abandoned and to bring it back in as this little wrapped up box you know that you can open up well that was pleasant and now we go back and we move over and then we move on to something else i had the same experience once in in my church you know god bless him my pastor had met some romanian protestants who were still doing would still say christ is risen pasca and then with the answer and so he tried to get the baptist church to do that and it was just like this half this half thing and people were like what is this thing like what is going on and so like you said it it didn't it didn't have the kind of integrated or kind of it ended up being a very superficial part but what you said about invocation or incantation i think is a very powerful insight that you have about the difference the notion a type of way of seeing the world you know this this capacity to invoke and to like in the jesus prayer you have the same the same movement you know where you kind of invoke the name and then there's this participation in you know in another person by kind of calling them let's say and this is something which which is actually so it's it's so intuitively right when we think about it just for a moment but we've completely lost these types of practices i remember the little book by father roman braga a transcribed interview called the the interior universe exploring the entire interior universe something like that but he said at one point a jesuit priest asked him how many times do i have to say the jesus prayer before i can see the the uncreated it's hilarious yeah yeah you're missing missing the point there my friend father roman said i told him do not say that prayer anymore oh man going for the jugular and you just completely yeah just stop stop yeah yeah yeah you could have a software running that just says it like automatically and then like it could be on a loop then they're like like prayer spinners they use exactly yeah yeah just put it on the loop and get get enough up to 5 000. this is great now you know but i thought too i've been thinking a lot about the way education teaches us to deal in abstractions and kind of from early childhood we are taught to think in abstract terms i've been reading this are you familiar with this book cognitive development or how about this is the predecessor for many people orality and literacy by walter ahn [music] this is interesting because it's the results of the work of a neuropsychologist communist soviet neuroscientist really wow in the 1930s so it's like but he went to these little towns in uzbekistan and kazakhstan and he interviewed people who were it was like a spectrum some of them had had begun to become literate and most had not and some were high in the social status some were low he just interviewed a lot of people and asked them questions and when he said i was going to he was going to ask them he showed them abstract images just a circle a square a triangle asked what they were and those who had a little bit of education would say that's a circle that's a triangle the people who were illiterate would say that's a mirror that's a house they recognized them as friends innocence as as things they already knew these things are part of the story of their lives that they are participating in a story with all these other people and they are enmeshed in all these these uh touchable tangible things around them it seemed to me it did not seem that way to the author it did not seem to him that this was a good thing okay you know we have to train them so they'll think logically and abstractly and it intrigued me how he missed that they were capable of using abstract categorical thinking he would show them if four images there's a saw a hatchet a hammer and a log and he'd say which one doesn't belong and of course the right answer just say the law doesn't belong nobody would say that they would all say you have to have the log or there's nothing for the saw and the hammer to do to work on that's theirs the loudest part of the story and we'd say you know a house in a wheelbarrow and a tree and a bird you know well the bird is the only one that's that's a living animal they say no you need the bird the bird will make a nest in the tree and it will be next to the house look it's next to the house and he will sing and people in the house will be happy they just really resisting resisted reducing things to abstraction and i think maybe that's the sickness that we have and one more thing as he gets further along he has like nine stages he takes them through one of the last things he does is he says tell me about yourself what are you like what kind of a person some people are angry some people are happy what kind of a person are you and they would resist that and they would say you have to ask the people who know me how can i how can i know my own heart but they know me they can tell you what i'm like i think the sense of being enmeshed in a story in a world where there are people who know you better than you know yourself you don't define yourself you don't make up your own profile it is the circle of others around you who really know you i think this is what people are hungry for but they don't know it and we are so heavily conditioned to think in terms of abstractions one of them was a a spectacle a drinking glass a water pitcher and oh what was the last one i don't remember but there were one of them that just didn't fit then the man said you can buy them all in a shop so you know he was capable of thinking in abstract terms but yeah but it was real life that mattered yeah they didn't they were they tended when presented with a series of things they tended rather than try to find the excluded one try try to to web to weave them together into a story they actually tried to see how they communed with each other rather than the opposite which is which is one of the diseases of the the modern world like we we understand health through disease we understand things through their exceptions things through that we try to we i almost have like an upside down way of understanding the world where we look at we look at we look at things that don't work in order to understand things that work and that's how we kind of we tend to we tend to analyze reality and in terms of this idea of self-naming this is if there's any disease that we have it's self-naming the whole individual idea of you know and this we kind of have a caricature of the will to power right now in in our society where people can just declare themselves to be whatever they fancy themselves to be and not understand that your identity is actually like you said is supposed to be enmeshed within a you know a network of human relations and if it's not then whatever identity you kind of self-proclaim it's going to make you miserable no matter what it is because we're meant for communion we're not meant to be these splendid individuals in isolation and kind of declaring our our identity to others you know the temptation of autonomy and it really that's the sin it's like that's the sin of satan it's the sin of adam it's the sin it's the main sin is the sin of trying to be autonomous and to to kind of be on top of things and not you know it's the it's actually that's the that's the the first sin and then the other sins kind of come after you know all the what we tend to think as sins you know you know what i one thing i noticed in giving speeches and giving talks because i don't always talk about orthodoxy sometimes i'm talking about social things or sex and sexuality or pro-life obviously i noticed that there was one word if i said it the audience would stop breathing and they would just freeze and after a few times i realized it was really consistent and the word was loneliness that if i mentioned loneliness it was like people would and it was like they were thinking how did she know my secret loneliness yeah yeah and you know i'm always encouraging people if you're young marry young get married at' 19 20. start having kids right away i sure opposed that when my son was 19 and got married i thought that wasn't a good idea well now he's they're expecting their ninth child his wife always wanted a big family and she's got one and it's just so much healthier than the autonomy that goes on and on and on and you marry at 30 and then you're trying to have children at 35 and yeah we have an artificial idea of how possible that that is exactly bent and always be bent to do the things we want i think the appeal of autonomy when you're young is almost overwhelming and perhaps it's natural to some extent you need to define yourself as separate from mother and father and you need to set up your own little home in our modern culture where where youth extends into the middle 30s what happens is that autonomy can work very well when you're young and attractive and sexy and not fat and you know there's so many things you have going for you but everybody gets older and every year a new crop of 20 year olds is rolling off their belts you know exactly and you're 25 and 30 and 35 and 40. and you're competing with them too yeah exactly and so the world keeps saying you know be young and sexy and independent and autonomous but they don't show us the ones who are 40 and 50 and 60 and never married and are facing perhaps in their old age being cared for in a old people's home where the people don't take jobs there because they love old people you know they it's not necessarily a pleasant or even a safe place to end your life so we've we've seduced our culture has seduced people by these images of images of how great it is when you're young and piggybacking maybe on what is to some extent a natural and healthy desire when you're young and covering up and hiding from us the loneliness that sets in my drama yeah exactly i think i think that that's that's that's so right and i see it myself because i like we were we were of those that you know i married pretty young like not i'm married at 23 and then but we started having children later you know we waited quite a while and and it's it's only it's only when you're your 40s you're in your 40s and you know your third child is young and you realize that you don't have the same energy that you did and you don't have the same kind of voice-ness that you did and you think wow you know this would have been like to all those moments in my 20s that i'd barely remember i mean i remember them but they don't have the vibrancy of the time that i spent with my son when he was two like they don't have that vibrancy and so so i mean i don't say i would say that i regret because i don't like i don't kind of like live that way but i can understand why it probably would have been a better idea you know to to really kind of consolidate that that that that because now like our family is it is an amazing microcosm like we love being with each other we love spending time together you know when we're at the dinner table everything is nice and it's it's a nice time but it's you think oh wait that could have been we could have had more of that and also longer so anyway so yeah i would encourage people to to kind of break the norm and not agree don't let people seduce you thinking oh you're in school you have to finish your school you have to get your phd and then you're you know you're 26 or whatever that's that's a lie i wrote an essay once that i titled let's have more teen pregnancy that's amazing no i know it was it was almost accepted by the new york times it's just like you know just by an inch but it was published in national review so but that was my thesis that it's good to marry young and to begin having children young but i said you have to let go of there are three things you want and you have to let go of one of them one is both of you are going to college at the same time yeah another is you are living independently of your parents you might have to live in your parents basement for a while and the third has to do with timing children that that's if you want to live in your own home and go to college at the same time both in college then what about having kids that makes it much more difficult the way our culture is threatened apparently so yeah and and there's something there's something about being poor which people nobody accepts like nobody wants to be poor but it's actually being poor is not that bad if you accept it i mean i don't mean like poor in the sense you don't have anything to eat but just being just living in an i like we like we were poor for quite i would say like now we're doing fine but we were poor for a very long time and we just accepted it and it actually meant it made us free we could do a lot of things because we didn't have this thing pressing on us that we kind of need to prove to everybody that we have a new car that we have a shiny this and shiny that was just it's actually easier to be poor in our world today than maybe it's ever been in the history of of humanity so so i would say to not see that as a idea of like making all your money in your in your 20s and 30s i don't see that that's that's not necessary we did that when i was 21 when we got married that was just a week out of college and i had our first baby and when i was 25 my husband was 30 now 28 something like that and we decided that we were going to live within his income as a junior pastor which is very small of course and one of the decisions we made was looking up all the dietetic and nutritional information we raised our children on powdered milk instead of buying a bottle of milk we would buy powdered milk and mix it with water and big brown picture in the kitchen and they grew up with that so they accepted that i remember we would go every week to mcdonald's for lunch with my my two friends and their two little daughters the same age when my daughter was a toddler they would buy dinners or buy lunches for themselves and their children and i would bring a sandwich and drink water and my daughter would have a plain hamburger and nothing else on the side this is before happy meals yeah so it's possible it's possible even when your friends have a lot more money you can you can live within your budget yeah well it's all but it you have to accept it because bitterness can set in you know if you're not careful and you you're if you if you do it out of kind of resentment and frustration it's not it's not going to work but if you just accept it then it's actually quite freeing to live that way i could never have become an icon carver if i hadn't if both my wife and i had not decided that it was totally fine to be poor and to have an old beat up car and to you know not fix the windows because they should be fixed but they can still survive for another few years and you know that kind of stuff you just think you just accept it and then then you're free to do things that a lot of people wish they could do and then they don't i felt like i actually got a kick out of it i felt like outsmarting someone you know that's wonderful madison avenue and all these other things and just looking and looking for the cheapest possible way to do things and my kids get into the spirit of it i taught them when they saw advertisements because we used to watch regular broadcast television as a family when the advertisement came to the end i would say and what was the lie can you spot the lie and and so i train them always to look for the lie in any advertising where are they trying to trick you or to lure you in yeah well they're trying to convince you that that you know if you only you had this then everything would be okay it would be perfect so i think we're talking in you know around the same thing over and over again but for me the big thing about orthodoxy is that it has that that sense of being embodied and embedded and that we are part of an ancient story and that me as an individual human i don't matter as a if i'm plucked out of the context and put on another planet or something that i am part of a community and that i try to help that community and i get so much help from the community and from their support and their prayers we are all embedded here all together and i know that if i get older and i get dementia and i'm failing in other ways and i'm failing physically i know there are people who love me there are people who will take care of me i'm my the next baby will be 15 grandchildren we had three our oldest had three our youngest had three but that went in the middle is they're getting their ninth i feel so embedded in a loving community that i don't fear i don't fear death i know i know that i belong and the the myth of autonomy i think is what's breaking the heart of our fellow humans in america many of our fellow christians as well when i look at the things that orthodoxy offers when i look at the things that converts say about what they like about orthodoxy it's always i'm going to move my eyes over here because i've got a document here i never learned how to share screens it's okay i have to have a grandchild tell me how to do this but the list of what people say when they become orthodox you're thrown in the deep end you just have to live it it's like they can't describe it direct contact it's dynamic you have to come and see firsthand alive immediacy i find that's the term i use the most it's the quality of it's just in your face it's immediate it's right there you have to be there organic good old warren farhat i asked him what is the one word you'd use to describe orthodoxy he said organic just sums up so much yeah body immersion you have to experience it you marinate it's active it involves all the senses yeah but that that i think that's also it's all these words are are good to help people understand too like the idea of marinating is good because we are so used to kind of immediate satisfaction that it's true that some people you know at first when they they kind of come to the services like what is happening you know i don't know like again and again and again and again and they don't know like where these prayers are going that seems to be just like you said thrown in the deep end where where at first their needs you need time to kind of soak in and and and kind of acclimatize and just slowly start to see the patterns but not in a mental way but really kind of all suddenly trying to be inside the pattern and at some point sometimes you're not even thinking about it because you you you hear the prayers and the para the prayers do have a pattern and then you know where it's going but you're not even thinking about it you kind of know what is happening and what it's going and then it slowly starts to it slowly starts to become a a background pattern to to to your perception but it does it doesn't happen immediately you can't just like go to a service and all of a sudden you're like okay i get it i get it i get it i get it it doesn't work that way oh boy yeah my first reaction to an orthodox service was it was weird and boring and i want to get out of here you know just really and it's strangely formal and informal at the same time it looks super organized but messy really messy and these kids crawl crawling around and and it's like it looks sometimes like the priest knows what he's doing but sometimes it feels like no one knows what they're doing but it's it's it's like it's it's funny to it's hard to describe that to people it's kind of strange sense of formality and informality which is all happening at the same time that is so true i've i've tried in talking about tradition because we're such a negative picture of what tradition means this i think instead about christmas traditions and now your christmas traditions you do them because you like them because they're fulfilling somehow and they met the family together but you do them because they work the orthodox traditions work in that sense they have an effect and you can't learn them all at once that if you married into a family that has lots and lots of numbers lots and lots of christmas traditions you wouldn't get at all the first christmas it would take repeating and i say imagine they have red and green napkins they're doing that very faded but they use them every year and you might notice that last year grandpa got a red one but this year he got a green one you might say oh you've broken your tradition what you don't know is there's a tradition about the traditions yeah you know there's there's something that when you've marinated in it you kind of know instinctively where things are little t and where things are big t it's you really can't learn it except by doing it so that's kind of the mystery about orthodoxy people who are in it tend to smile a lot and they're very happy with it but it's because they can feel it going to work on them they can feel how it's changing them inside and making them more and more like the heroes that we have there's so many 20th century heroes of the faith that we want to emulate and be like it's like having baseball pic pictures you know posters on the walls of your bedroom and just wishing you could be like them or you want to hold the bat the way your hero holds the bat it's a wonderful family to be in yeah you really don't realize that at first and there's something about the causality which is also sometimes difficult to understand especially in our kind of psychological psychologized world where let's say people are struggling with a passion or struggling with a sin or struggling with something and they're like well how do i fight this like how do i how do i deal with this problem in my life and they wanted like a direct road where they could just do these simple things and then they'll get through their problem but in in the kind of the orthodox tradition in faith it's it's like this whole process where as you improve your prayer life as you are more involved as you as you remind yourself of god during the day as you do the jesus prayer and your little moments all of this is working and at some point you're like oh you know that passion that i had all of a sudden it's like cut in half or you know that this thing that i was doing before this bad habit it's like okay it's gone and i don't even know where i got the will to to do that it didn't come from me it's just this this kind of this healing process that just kind of flows through you so yeah it's difficult to describe that to modern people because they want the solution like i have a problem give me the pill this is what i need to take to do this and it doesn't work that way another part of that illusion i think is that they they they say you know people who are functioning under a high level of traditions well it makes you all be alike it makes you all be little carbon copied you know figures but it's actually the reverse when they want that that program that will fix them they want something that might be useful to a million people and they could just get in line and go through the steps and it would fix things orthodoxy is more radically individualistic than that that the program that works on you is finding you at your deepest levels at your most unique level and it addresses you in a wholly unique way you're not one in the line of a million people using a program you went in a line of one and god knows you so much better than you know yourself yeah and because it's so there's so much like i've noticed that like sometimes i've noticed for example like my attachment to certain saints for example i can't completely explain it i can't i can't tell you why that i feel closer to this or that saint but i can see it working in my life like i can see that that communion that i'm that i'm living with is slowly changing me and transforming me and making me closer to to in close to the image of christ and so it's like that for so many things because even the practices you can have in the church there's so there's so many that you unless you're like a monk you know you can't do them all so you end up through your discussion with your spiritual father through all this you end up finding something which looks like like you or you moving towards god you could say something like that yeah we we are tiptoeing up to the question of the supernatural which is that simultaneously a very difficult thing to get across but also something that non-christian non-believers the nuns crave they crave that and that's why it's all about you know are there little spells or little charms you can cast on people or their potions is this a haunted house they have a lot of what they probably don't realize is an unhealthy attraction to the supernatural and they don't understand that it is a dangerous world and that in christianity you can do that safely and supernatural things do happen yeah part of telling our story is to say when this incredible you know like the time that we were trying to vote on who our patron saint would be for the women's group and saint nina kept pushing her way over and over and over again none of us knew who she was the that one person began reading a short biography the president of the women's association with sisterhood began to sob and just run with tears and she didn't know why she didn't even hear the story so when i we you know we said well are we going to vote now and my husband the pastor said you don't get to vote it's pretty clear she's already said that she wants to do this so give her the job and so i got up to walk upstairs i picked up one of the sundays on saturday i picked up the sunday bulletin and it was january 14th it was the feast of saint nina so things like that happen and you you can just know you get the awareness of when it's healthy and when it isn't and as you were drawn on through healthy why do we call them supernatural right what should we call that yeah i don't i didn't i was like you don't like the word re-enchantment i never use the word supernatural because because it has a there's something about it which seems like an arbitrary thing which just kind of imposes itself on top of reality you know i just i just say i have my own way people around what i'm doing we say symbolism happens like the idea that the world is full of meaning and that this meaning is embodied in people in persons and so don't be surprised when the world coalesces into meaning meaning because that's actually how the world exists and so it's not that miracles when miracles happen you you shouldn't be totally surprised because the world actually exists through these patterns of meaning and so that so that's kind of how i say it's not it's obviously not a traditional term but patterns of meaning symbolism yeah yeah but you could just say that miracles happen too like miracles happen because miracles are not arbitrary or not arbitrary things that you can't explain they're rather the world coalescing towards towards meaning and showing the meaning in a bright and and surprising way it's like as if the pattern of reality appears to you in this shining manner and so it's not at all arbitrary it's it's actually quite it's actually the summit of meaning is when miracles happen so enjoyable and so fun and so awe-inspiring to participate in that like god is dropping little clues for you and seeing whether it's like how we look at children i think god and the angels look at us and oh look look she understood that part this time oh look she prayed for them it's an amazing way of seeing it that's wonderful and that's something like like we look at a sonogram and we see the baby the baby has no idea you know that we're watching them yeah i think that's what it's like with the i was thinking too though about i only use the term supernatural when i'm dealing with non-believers because i know what the word means i definitely wouldn't use it but a cautionary tale i like to tell i'm blanking on his name there was an extremely popular bbc series called civilization the first mini series and it was i guess late 60s and into the 70s but sir something something you know who who wrote and who narrated the whole thing he had a sensitivity to supernatural things he said when he went to there was a certain village in italy that he just felt evil he just it just felt horrible and murderous he went to the island of iona and he just felt the goodness he felt the the good spiritual presence there well one time he was going to you know do some filming and a smaller church in paris in france anyway and he said as soon as we walked through the door he felt an invitation he felt that he was being invited to participate in christian faith and it lasted for several days he said but he vastly he realized that if he accepted this invitation there were things he would have to change in his life and between the lines as you read the autobiography you can sense there was probably a lot of adultery going on so he he knew that he would have to change and he came to the conclusion that he really didn't want to change so he said after a couple of months that invitation just faded away so wow you know today decide who you will serve you know pay attention to date when you hear his voice it says in exodus i forget today when you hear his voice respond to that voice you may not get another chance you might be like sir richard whatever and it would just fade away after a while it's it's said that on his deathbed at the last minute he became a roman catholic and received so we waited till the very end so did saint constantine i guess i guess it's not it's not for us we'll leave god it will let god you know parse that out in the end you know but he might not have felt yeah we don't know i think if we keep choosing against the good over and over and over we become more numb and less able to hear that invitation we reach a point where we really don't want it we really don't want god anymore so you don't know yourself really you don't know when you might just become so numb you don't care so i think it's important and i really should memorize that scripture better about today when you hear his voice don't delay run toward him you may well not get another chance you may well not care next yeah once you the next time exactly well frederica thank you so much this
