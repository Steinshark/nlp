should you be able to repair something that you paid good money for it seems like a no-brainer that the answer should be yes but apple has long been notorious for making their devices very unfriendly to diy-ers who just want to replace the battery or fix a cracked screen not only has self-repair on an apple device avoided your warranty in the past but apple intentionally designs its products to make them hard to fix at home i mean they've even used proprietary screws but apple has done a face turn worthy of pro wrestling and announced their self-service repair program which ideally will allow users to fix their idevices at home without voiding their warranties and apple will even help customers do it oh sign me up but how exactly is it going to work the idea is that if you need a repair you can have a look at an apple official repair manual and then order the parts you need from the apple online store the program which will debut in the us and roll out to other countries throughout 2022 is initially going to support the iphone 12 and 13 with support for m1 based max coming sometime later that year the online store is going to have 200 plus parts and tools available for repairs on the two supported iphone lineups so expect things like spudgers and suction cups to appear alongside actual replacement parts but what parts can you actually get and fix yourself there wasn't an exhaustive list at the time we published this video but we can tell you that apple will offer batteries displays and cameras so basically the parts of the phone that are most likely to get damaged or worn out during regular use with the exception of the lightning ports which makes sense especially as there's been a whole cottage industry around replacing broken and worn out iphone screens and batteries for quite some time apple will also give you a credit towards the repair kits if you return your old part for recycling sounds like a pretty good deal to me but what are the caveats and why did apple decide to change their mind on self-repair after all these years we'll explain it after we thank mexico for sponsoring today's video next to go is bringing wireless earbuds to the next level with their airt2 earbuds they won a ces 2022 innovation award in the headphones and personal audio category and there's a good reason for it these are the world's thinnest and lightest earbuds with its case only being half an inch thick don't worry though you still get great battery life with up to seven hours at a single charge and an extra 28 hours with the case get your next to go air t2 earbuds today using the link down below so what's the catch apple the really big elephant in the room is exactly how much all of this will cost apple is notorious for charging handsome sums to both buy their products and repair them later and they're still encouraging most consumers to have their repairs handled by a professional anyway so don't discount the possibility that apple's pricing might push customers towards having apple do the job anyway especially once you factor in the time effort and risk involved in attempting a diy fix and although apple relented recently on allowing third-party repair shops to obtain official apple tools and parts something it did not permit for a long time i must add it hasn't always been clear which of these shops was authorized as apple doesn't provide a list and some independent shops have even refused to join apple's official authorization scheme as they believed the terms of apple's contract were unreasonable combine that with apple's history of crippling phone features if a user performs self-repair and it's pretty clear that apple hasn't exactly had the best track record of making things easy for folks who don't want to go through apple itself for repair job but the hope is that this time things will be different apple clearly isn't doing this out of the goods of their own hearts though as the company is feeling mounting pressure from several governments to give electronics consumers a right to repair the gadgets they already own starting this program might help apple get ahead of the ire of regulators if right to repair laws do get passed but it remains to be seen just how accessible it will be to the average iphone user and if the company will end up supporting older products now if you'll excuse me i have to go try the private back off of my ipod classic that battery ain't what it used to be thanks for watching guys like dislike check out some of our other videos comment with video suggestions and don't forget to subscribe and follow
