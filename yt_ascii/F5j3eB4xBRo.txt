the price of phones is going up fast but why like how can apple get away with charging nearly $1,500 for a top-spec iphone or samsung it's $1,600 for an s 20 altra and maybe more confusing for some is one plus a company that has built their entire reputation on creating affordable flagships their latest phone as a thousand dollars is the well going crazy are we gonna be lining up in a few years time to sell our organs so we can afford the next phone well maybe but the point is what i'm trying to say here is that while i'm not gonna defend high pricing there are seven key reasons why phones are getting so expensive that i just don't think a lot of people are acknowledging also massive thanks to surf shark vpn for sponsoring this video the first thing is qualcomm qualcomm are the guys who make the snapdragon chip sets that power pretty much every high-end android phone and while they clearly make amazing hardware they also cause a bit of a cost problem see they have no competition if a company like oneplus wants to have the best performance then they've got no option but to use whatever qualcomm's latest snapdragon chipset is in this case the 865 and then because qualcomm has got all this power this year they've basically told companies if you want to have our chip then you've also got to buy our expensive 5g modem to go alongside it so whether or not a smart phone maker wants 5g they're paying for it and it gets worse because as well as the chip and the modem qualcomm will also give you a set of guidelines the big one being that your phone needs to have a large amount of space inside it so if you're wondering why smart phones especially this year are leaping up in size this might well be part of the reason because you've got to remember a company can't just make their phone taller and keep everything else the same they've then got to make the screen bigger so people don't complain about a massive board around the sides and then they've got to have a bigger battery to power this display as well as the more power-hungry snapdragon chip and then add to all of that if the company actually wants to take advantage of that 5g modem they paid for then they've got to buy additional radio frequency modules and put them all around the phone this costs money so if you're wondering why oneplus a suddenly hiked up the prices for their latest phones i would guess that at least a part of that is qualcomm steering them in that direction also if you're enjoying the video by the way a sub to the channel would be amazing number two the second thing is that smartphones are getting better and that sounds like common sense obviously they're not getting worse but i feel like when a lot of people complain about the prices of these phones they're actually missing this point see technology is to improve egf so it's true if every year samsung just released the exact same phone but with slightly more up-to-date technologies each time we probably should expect prices to stay fairly constant but that's not what's happening it's not just a case that each year we see a slight internal speck bump to keep up with the times if it was our smartphones would still look like this [music] every year we get designs that push boundaries further more intelligent cameras more advanced materials and naturally that's got to cost more not to mention that phones now have like three times the screen area of when they started so as well as all that new tech everything else has to be scaled up accordingly and remember whilst it is getting more expensive to buy the highest end phone each year it's getting cheaper to buy a good smartphone each year there's probably no better example of my point than this in the us the average price of a smartphone has fallen every year continuously since 2011 because phones are getting so much better people no longer need to buy the highest and so every year they can get away with spending less and less because the highest end phones are the ones people talk about and the ones that grab the headlines it creates this kind of distorted view that all phones are more expensive when all that's really happening is the high end is becoming higher but now that's out the way why are these top end phones just so expensive well one important thing is selling costs the actual process of selling a phone can cost companies a ton of money which also has to get added to the price let's take the absolute top end iphone 11 pro max you can get this for around thirteen hundred and eighty dollars in mexico but here in the uk you'll pay the equivalent of'80 there's an element of currency conversions in those differences but it's mostly two things sales taxes in most countries whenever a product is sold the government takes a cut in the u.s. it's pretty low most states that are around 7% but in the uk it's 20 and then there's operational costs the costs of running a store the costs of hiring employees this varies massively based on the country these selling costs are a big part of why here in the uk we get a terrible deal compared to for example people in india like for example this top-end 1+8 pro is the equivalent of one thousand one hundred and twenty dollars here in the uk in india 785 it also helps in this case that india is where a lot of one-plus firms are actually put together but hopefully you're starting to see just how much of a difference these selling costs alone can make to a firm's price but there's more because every aspect of the chain of production of a smartphone is expensive and it's getting more expensive as an example take a look at the samsung galaxy s 20 the phone is priced at 800 pounds here in the uk but it's bill of components will be around 340 pounds based on past years so it would be easy to look at this and think something is making formed 60 pounds of profit per phone which would be great but also wrong for starters after you take out the sales tax which is included in that 800 pound price something is only actually taking about 640 but okay but still a fair bit of money but remember that component cost is only one of many many costs you got manufacturing the machines the factories the production lines they all have to be rented or bought you've got the employees everyone from the people that put the phones together to the people who solve your problems over the phone have you tried turning it off and on again plus as chipsets become more and more minut and sophisticated the failure rate is higher as things stand with the current chips based on a seven nanometer fabrication process about 30% and fail they just have to be chucked or maybe potentially recycled research and development you've got to remember that for every beautiful finish you see on a retail phone a companies tried 15 ones that they eventually scrapped for every successful feature like 100 times zoom on the s20 ultra there's been five or six ones that never saw the light of day and then advertising costs i've seen this one first happened i'm not allowed to tell you which brand it was for but last year i was on set for a commercial for a smartphone launch and it was crazy the company had rented out an entire warehouse they've got a hollywood film production crew they've got like hundred actors and extras on that set and yet after it was all done and edited they just canceled the project because apparently it no longer fits the message they wanted to send for their phone plus the retailers who then end up selling you the samsung phones like amazon like t-mobile they're going to want to take their own five to ten percent cut on top of that so after all these costs samsung doesn't make 150% profit like it initially seems not even 50 if i had to guess i would say 10% per phone on average they'll make more money on their top-end phones like the higher storage options and the s20 ultra but this figure gives you an idea apart from apple who benefits from having full control over every part of what goes into their phones most smartphone makers have seen profits falling not rising but there is still profit and when you take a step back considering the volumes of phones these companies sell it's a lot of money and while so far i've told you some legitimate reasons why prices should be rising there is also an element of craftiness from the end of the companies something that i'm gonna call the luxury effect and it started with the iphone 10 up until the iphone 10 apple's phone pricing followed a fairly uninteresting trend the first iphone started at $500 and this price slowly trickled upwards but barely even nearly 10 years on with the iphone 7 you could still buy it for six hundred and forty nine dollars but that changed the year after in 2017 apple pulled a bit of a fast one they launched three phones an iphone 8 to replace the seven an h+ to replace the seven plus and these two phones were similarly priced last year but then also the iphone 10 at $1000 and they got away with it the way they pitch their phones was the iphone 8 and the iphone 8 plus there are flagships there are replacements if you wanted to upgrade from the 7 and the 7 plus but the iphone 10 well that's a luxury item even though apple knew full well the iphone 10 would sell by the bucketload by pitching this as the luxury phone the optional extra they avoided people comparing its price to their past phones they made it seem incomparable and then following this move the entire market reacted samsung for example saw the opportunity to hike up the price of their phones and more recently the s20 ultra uses this exact same luxury effect to get away with this price tag of up to $1,600 because samsung also released a galaxy s 20 and an s 20 plus which sit as the technical replacements velocity as s 10 and s and odd the price comparisons by saying that the ultra is just unlike anything else out there okay so cost of production is rising companies are getting crafty with their pricing but there's still a missing piece of the puzzle if these top and phones are so expensive why are people still buying them i mean in terms of pre-orders the highest and s 20 ultra made up 50% of the sales of the whole s 20 lineup but why why is all of a sudden the people's willingness to pay for phone has grown well it's kind of simple phones are becoming every year more and more beneficial to us and this price hike is just a case of companies like samsung and apple seeing that and taking advantage of it i think about this when the first iphone was introduced you could take it or leave it it was a cool way of doing stuff that similar devices could already do but now for a lot of people living without a smartphone would be like living without a limb it goes far as to say that there's a lot of people out there who gain more value from their smartphone than they do their car the smartphone has already replaced a lot of people's need for a camera for a speaker for a tablet for an mp3 player and i just think as the smartphone becomes more and more intelligent it'll start to swallow up more and more product categories becoming ever more useful to the end-user a bit of an extreme example but warren buffett famous american businessman he's gone on record to say that he'd rather keep his iphone over his airplane that his thousand-dollar phone gives him more value than his multi-million dollar aircraft and finally just inflation the price of almost every type of product rises over time naturally that applies to gold that applies chocolate and applies to smartphones and while the rising price of phones has exceeded inflation inflation is a part of it okay so a barrier go surf shop vpn contact me and asked me if i wanted to partner with them and i just seem to remember thinking i've not heard of surf shop vpn but i'll give it a go see if i like it and i did it does everything you need a vpn to do like give you

so that's fine but now that i've been using it for about a year it's becoming pretty clear that some not all but some vpns are just daylight robbery they told you like twenty to thirty dollars per
