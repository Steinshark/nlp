so hello everybody we are back with richard rowland for one more episode of our universal history we've been talking about a lot of stuff in the past several months some things that many people have never heard about strange legends going to the ends of the earth with our series on ethiopia but now a lot of people will be excited because we're finally coming to talk about the grail i know many people have been waiting for us to talk about the grail just because it's such a prominent figure in in western legends and there's so much around it even up to today in popular culture so i'm really happy to have richard to talk about this because i know he's going to surprise me as well with some of his knowledge and so richard thanks for coming along i'm super excited to do this the grail is really important to me and i think it's it's one of these great nexus points in the whole question of universal history so i think that i think that by the end of you know probably it's gonna take us maybe a couple of videos to get through some of this grail material by the by the time we get through that i think people will have a much better idea about let's say sort of the organic way that universal history kind of develops and then it's actually kind of this ongoing process right [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] [applause] [music] so before we start though i have a little personal thing going on which is that richard is one of the the the first people to actually read a copy of god's dog as many people know in the at the end of october probably when this is coming out the crowdfunding will have already started for our graphic novel and so i wanted richard to to say a few things about what he thought about our graphic novel well first of all you owe me an afternoon because i had sat down i was actually at a coffee shop working and i sat down i was like all right i got this list of things like i'm gonna do some writing and some study and all this different stuff and then as i'm in the middle of that you message me and you're like hey do you want to look at god's dog and i was like well i guess that's the rest of my day so it's really cool there are just i mean just the opening pages there are so many things in them which if people have been attentive long-term viewers and listeners of your podcast they're going to pick up on probably instantly but i think the thing that's really impressive to me is the way that all of those symbolic elements like they're not just like oh here's a neat symbolism thing let's wedge this end right but they're actually they are really brought together in this very cohesive way in this kind of medieval way of of relating them relating them to each other in such a way that we can [music] we can sort of see how these concepts relate i think there are probably very few people who are going to be really bothered by the by the let's say the the freedom that you take with with chronology i say very few people because i think that kind of person probably isn't going to read your your graphic novel anyway but but i also think it's it's maybe going to be a really great proof case for how a bunch of the things that we're talking about in universal history in hagiography in you know all these christian legends the lives of the saints i mean you've got st george is in there saint christopher is in there seeing simeon the skylight is in there where people who obviously did not exist people people obviously didn't didn't didn't ever meet right yeah and but they're all sort of in there together and and chris st george is a really cool character we're big st george fans at my at my house so there's that one that one sequence that i sent you a screenshot of and i was like this is really cool and i had to i'd come and come home and show that to my son george who's named after c nice i didn't know and yeah so i don't know it's to be really great i think this it's going to do a lot of really important things one of the the things that it's doing and i know this is probably one of your main goals is to return our what what should be let's say our native storytelling language and you know that i am obviously a big tolkien fan i have a whole podcast right there's no doubt of your there's no my talking bona fides should not be in nothing in question right but i think part of the reason that tolkien is so dominant when it comes to imaginative storytelling especially in christian spheres to the point that most of us if we were going to sit down and write a work of like fantasy fiction or something i mean tom shippy says you have to spend the first few years just writing the tolkien out of your system right but part of the reason that he's become so dominant is precisely that his books came along at a time when christians had lost their lost their native storytelling language like we we become so disconnected from it that the only option that we really had was to make something like middle earth so i think that and i'm not saying that's bad obviously again i don't think anyone's going to question my love of tolkien but i do think that it's really important that we regain our this regain this this what should be for christians it should be our native language right and the thing is like once you do that once you get really deep into something then you go from having you know you enter into the glorious freedom of the sons of god right you go from having to be like just really rigidly strict with okay this this chronology and i'm gonna write this this incredibly you know like detailed historical novel and maybe i don't believe these miracles and gotta question all these things right you go from that approach to instead being able to because because you inhabit these things as like a native speaker of the language you can then play with it with the kind of freedom that a native speaker of english has right a native speaker of english can do certain things with poetry that somebody who's learning english as a second language can't do or wouldn't understand and i think you've accomplished that in this graphic novel and i want to encourage everyone to please go and back it i'm going to be getting multiple copies for gifts i mean christmas is coming up soon so i don't know if they'll fulfill before probably not probably not i wish i didn't i didn't i didn't promise promise to be clear but but anyway i'm gonna be getting multiple copies as gifts and i would encourage other people to do so as well we want this book to do well so that we can have lots more things like this so yeah thanks richard i appreciate it yeah the the goal of this first crowdfunding is to to kind of generate enough excitement and honestly enough money so that we can now put these out regularly you know like every six months or whatever so we can get the whole story out because this is just the first chapter it's just the beginning the story is already totally written it's it's very big so we need a lot of room to tell it there's this great moment at the beginning of the graphic novel if i could just share a little bit of it's not really a spoiler but where there's you know these pilgrims are walking along and they're singing this hymn and i read the hymn and i messaged you and i said which syrian hymn is that like i couldn't remember which one it was but it was so obviously syrian you know that it it seemed like it like it had to be and then you messaged back and it's oh it's this one but it was just it was really cool yeah so i'm i'm jazzed about it cool all right now on to the grail so let's start us off with the grail so what i wanted to do for this first video on the grail is to talk about what we could say the seeds or the sources are the ground out of which the grail legends which are primarily explored through a genre of literature called a romance not not like you know people falling in love married hopefully the people who watch your show are like astute enough to know what what that term means right a romance basically just means like a high adventure story right yeah because we've been talking about the alexander romance and so i'm sure they write it wasn't a love story right right right yes now actually people you know do actually fall in love and get married in these stories but they're not just about that so okay so i want to talk about three sources and the first will be what i'll call the celtic reliquary tradition so those of you who are wanting like the symbolism of ireland and things like that you're not going to quite get that in this video but you are going to get some of it the second thing i want to talk about is the i let's call her the iberian virgin and her grail and then finally i want to end on joseph joseph of arimathea who is of course very important to the grey of legends and the his links to the byzantine mystical tradition and sort of how all that comes in so we're not going to actually talk about the romances themselves today and i think the reason for that will be sort of more apparent when we get to the end so to begin with in the celtic tradition the the way that celtic christianity thought about and treated relics is a little bit different from what maybe you know other traditions have done so in the celtic tradition it's the there's a great deal of veneration given to the relics of the saints this is nothing unusual in christianity what's unusual is that these relics don't always mean bones in fact they usually don't mean the bones of a saint they usually seem to mean items that the relic that the saint has left behind them liturgical books gospels croziers bells chalices etc and there if you read celtic hagiography and i've been reading quite a lot of it lately what you're going to find is a very unique honor and and reverence that are given to these to these items that's different from what you find in the rest of christianity and there's some scholars who think that these this is like a let's say a sanctification of the idea of the of the tribal palladium you know like the the relics of or the idols of the tribe or whatever that are sort of passed down in celtic culture that may or may not be the case if it is the case it's not a problem for us right yeah but it's also there in in scripture in terms of the the passing of the skins of elijah to elisha and then there's also the ark itself which is this this kind of physical object which isn't which isn't the body of the saint but which let's say gathers together a certain amount of authority or power with it right right and that's the thing to remember that's odd to this idea of this epidemic transmitted you know all this stuff yeah yeah that's the thing to remember about the ark is that it's a it's a container it held the you know the tables of the law and the the the mana and aaron's rod that bought it and goliath sword weirdly enough right so that's or at least at the very least they kept goliath sword in the tabernacle right when david shows up there to get some food he needs food and a weapon and they said well the only food we have here is the showbread and the only weapon we have here is goliath sword so they had taken the sword of this nephilim and they had actually kept it in the holy place in the in the tabernacle so that's yeah that's another video for another day but all right so the the flaming sword symbolism i know i know i know so i'm sorry all right so the next one okay so the gaelic so basically this this gaelic tradition of the importance of objects which are transmitted and which are can be connected to a saint so right and so for instance you had things like the book of saint columba which was supposed to be which was born they carried it out in battle which is not unusual for relics in the middle ages but the belief was that if a person who was pure of heart carried the book then then it would bring victory for the clan of course there are other relics that give oracles one of the most important kinds of relics in the celtic tradition is a bell which is actually one of the forms that the grail takes we'll talk about that later probably the bell and of course what are bells used for in in western liturgy they're used uh at the the moment of the sacrifice right at the moment of of the consecration of the gifts that's you know a belt there's a bell it's called the sacrifice that is wrong they still do this in like some traditional western western liturgies so bells are very important and the idea was you know and and the the miracles that are attributed to the to these relics you know they're they're oracles there's you know bells that refuse to ring in the hand except of the person for you know to whom it belongs you know like the saint you know so how do you know like is this saint legit or not right is he really the one who's supposed to be our bishop well the bell rings for him and not for anyone else there's um you know there's a another bell that actually like sails through the air from jerusalem to wales right as a gift from heaven to this particular bishop some of the other items are really really interesting for instance one of the one of the most common forms that we find in welsh and irish hagiography is the idea of a of an altar right and you we don't typically think of an altar as being a relic because we think of an altar as being like you know it's large it's unwieldy and it's more or less fixed to a certain place right yeah but in the celtic tradition they're all of these floating altars flying altars right and i think this is somehow connected to the the the the interconnectedness of like so so the the the ancient irish thought of of let's say mist of course there's a lot of mist in that part of the world right they thought it was still sort of being part of heaven and so there was this idea that heaven and earth kind of became like were a little more permeable at certain places right and so the this this idea of the floating alder floating altar seems to be connected to this so one that's actually really important to the grail legend is the altar that was given to saint david of wales this is you know the patron saint of wales and the story about him is that his his birth was foretold to his father by an angel in a dream and his father was supposed to go out hunting when he was going to find three things he was going to find a stag a fish and a honeycomb and these each of these items are are some somehow foretelling or or prophetic of saint david's ministry so for instance this the angel says that as the honey is in the wax so he that is david will hold a spiritual sense in a historical instrument which i just mentioned here because i think that's a great way to sort of describe symbolism or way to describe universal history where you have these these patterns that are above the historical but now they're manifesting in historical ways that was supposed to be what the life of the saint is but there's also this this fish right and this fish on which he was supposed to be fed now i think most people know that the fish is an ancient symbol for christianity what people sometimes don't realize especially like down here in texas pretty much every other car has like a bump it has a little fish bumper sticker on it what most of the people who have those bumper stickers don't probably understand is it's not just that the fish is a symbol for christianity but it's specifically a eucharistic it's a symbol of the eucharist right right so you've got all these you know evangelicals god bless them driving around with the symbol of the eucharist on the back of their yeah because it's the fish giving in a way it's like the gift because the fish is leaving itself to be eaten yes that's the mystery he's like that's why like or else why would you have a fish as a symbol for christianity and it's also like the treasure that's drawn up out of death yes there's that as well all these different things right there's another saint that's really wonderful his name is elar which is the same name as hillary but it's not hillary or poitier it's a different illar and ilar was just found he was a foundling it was found on the stone in the middle of a river so they they took him and they came the monks that found them took him they came back the next day and on that stone in the middle of the river there was just a fish so they took that and they fed the child with the fish and they came back every day and every day for the for his whole childhood there was a fish and that's what they fed him with and then he grew up to be this you know awesome wonder working saint and he could talk to animals and all this stuff right i mean i loved i love all the best stuff of comics i just love this stuff just enormously right and so of course the the they're we're talking about the floating altars right yeah so i'm just mentioning the fish thing because the fish and the floating altars seem to be connected and there's of course this really important figure in the later grail stories the rich fisherman or the fisher king right who's going to become really important to the story of the grail so just sort of like you know put a pin in that i'm interested to hear your opinion on that because as a french person i always see it as the sinner king like that's how i see it but oh interesting yeah we can talk about that yeah so in the yeah so the earliest romantics we see the ancestor of the grail keepers is he's made to catch this miraculous fish and that's what gives him this title that's that's passed down and yeah we can talk a little bit more about that but i want to note it just note here that among welsh saints and among celtic saints this this idea this there's a connection to fishing into fish that okay seems to crop up over and over again now i mention all of this because the possession of these relics of the saints altars bales bells chalices croziers gospel books etc the possession of these relics is a really important theme so especially in welsh christianity so you know when when cod waller is sort of like the last great welsh king when he dies in battle it's it's prophesied that he will return obviously this is what happens right is prophesied that he will return when all of the ancient relics of the welsh church are are revealed when they're uncovered when they manifest again so it's like it's like um and and the idea is it's not that we've totally lost them it's but they're in hiding right now and they're they're you know so there's this idea that you have these families you know very much like what's going on with the ark in ethiopia okay but but obviously more obscure there's this idea that you have this this handed down tradition of the relics of one saint to somebody in their lineage and that the the person who has inherited them also inherits you know like that cloak of elijah that you mentioned also inherits some degree of their grace yeah so i mention all of this to say that in the celtic tradition and this is picked up in one of the later romances called the high history of the holy grail the grail doesn't have one form the grail has five forms and it is strongly implied that these forms at least one of these forms is a bell a sacrificing bell we're not told what all of the forms are though and the reason we're not told what all the forms are i'll read this again in our next video the reason we're not told what all of the forms are is that it says it's not good to speak too explicitly of the sacraments so when arthur goes into the chapel of the grail and he actually sees the grail in this particular version of the story he sees it in the context of the mass of the liturgy and the five forms of the grail are revealed to him and we're told the final form is the chalice but we're not told what the other four are but again there's a strong implication that at least one of them is the bell is it bell no interesting i want to say something a little bit about the idea of the relic and the power just to just because one of the things you mentioned i think it's important for people to see the connection is that when you believe in a world where symbolism happens let's say there's a sense in which you talked about how if someone carries the book of saying columba and has a pure heart then the relic will be effective that is the relic will become a vehicle you know a connection between the two and so there's a sense in which this is something which i think would have been implicitly understood in the the different legends of these relics and goes into the grill which is that the only knight that can find the grail that can reach the grail has to have a pure heart so there's there's actually a notion with the fact that you receive it is almost like a proof that you're right of pure heart right there's a connection where just because you have a pure heart you have access to this but then having it becomes a proof of the fact that you also have a pure heart and so there's a there's a incarnational way of seeing the world where it's not like there isn't this arbitrary capacity i say this because just because i was telling i was telling richard recently that i just before that i watched the movie constantine again where you have this arbitrary idea that if you can get this relic you know if you can get this object then you're gonna have a certain power that you can then use and it's almost like it's almost like finding a grenade or finding a bomb it's completely arbitrary it has nothing to do with virtue it's like harry potter style magic where you just have to like technically be proficient and learn these spells in the right way and and know how to use these things almost like mechanical tools but that is not the way in which ancient people thought there was a deep connection between a virtue and let's say the power that the objects could have and also kind of christian faith and all of this and the manner in which objects could manifest or have power in the world so all of this so so all of this it's important to remember because the relic is always a it's not just that the that the relic has like the powers of the virtues of the saint right that this is god's power right it's god's grace we say his you know like his energies it's something that's constantly given to to us as a gift right and so yeah it's not this mechanical thing and that's part of why we have to be really careful about how we talk about this stuff and that's why there would be a certain amount of secrecy about you know even just like a saint whose relics we have right we don't parade them around the streets you know just you know for the you know exposing the mystery right at the very least we're gonna have it in the name of the church some relics or you know especially holy icons things like this we might bring out on certain feast days right uh there would be a time when the mystery is revealed but we don't you know again yeah it's not this mechanical thing i was literally just arguing with somebody about that on discord before this video started i said every time you say the word magical system a fairy dies you know it's i can't i really i cannot stand systematized magic in in fantasy fiction yeah so i wanna i wanna mention one thing because this will be really important for talking about the grail later on but also you're gonna get just a tremendous kick out of it being who you are okay so saint david is given this altar right and so this happens when he is on he is on his pilgrimage to jerusalem that he is we're told that as god gave matthias in judea christ in jerusalem and peter in rome so he has given saint david to be in the island of britain so the is the idea that st david was sort of like the the the keeper of like the apostolic lineage in the island of britain and there's this is a long time like before the joseph of arimathea stuff and all this right and we're told that the the patriarch of jerusalem who's the one consecrating david as bishop gives him one of these altars it says a certain hallowed altar in which the lord's body had reposed and this seems to be connected to that stone there's that stone in the the church of the holy sepulchre i can't remember the name right now we can probably put a picture of it up here but that stone on which christ's body was laid after he was brought down off the cross and that whole all the legends and the stories surrounding what happens to christ's body when it's brought down off the cross are going to be essential to understanding where the grail comes from so we're told that he's given this hallowed altar in which the lord's body had proposed which abounded in innumerable virtues and then we're told never was this altar seen after the death of the bishop saint david by any son of man but it lies hidden covered with skins what i know right strange legend yeah and so and so and it says hence the common people call it the gift from heaven so as we talk about the i just i knew you would love the fact that it's covered in skin yeah what else would you cover it in but uh there's also another uh saint actually in in the same book saint karanak to whom we're told that christ gave an honorable altar from heaven the color of which no person can comprehend but this altar is also wrapped in skins most of the time so it's like this jeweled altar that's like a color that no one on earth has ever seen but it's it's kept veiled right so i'm gonna mention i mentioned this because the key idea of the grail isn't really just a chalice right obviously that that becomes the most enduring image for kind of obvious reasons in some senses it's because it's the best image right but the idea of the grail is really something which is hidden which contains or has contained the body and the blood of christ right so there's this altar which had somehow contained the lord's body we're not it's not it's not elaborated on because it's in jerusalem there does seem to be a connection to this this stone on which christ's body was laid and keep in mind that most of the grail legends start popping up in western europe after the during the time of the crusades so people are coming from the east and they're bringing back these these tales of like amazing relics that they've seen or like heard legends about but that's the key idea of the grail so we're told for instance like i mentioned the height history of the grail of the grill has these five forms only the last of which is the chalice it's it's going to be much later we'll talk about this in our next video when robert de boron he has the grail become the cup of the last supper right but that's sort of the final form you could say that's the final form that the grill takes in the romances like once it takes that form the grail is always that in all the future retellings yeah for sure because it's not clear that that's what's going on right when you see it's not that idea is not at all there in court for sure a vessel it's it's for sure eucharistic vessel yeah that's it that's it and we'll talk more about where that connection comes in in a little bit so you have so you you have this idea of like the the altar which is kind of like the ultimate version of this in the celtic tradition this hidden altar that comes from heaven that's contained god's body and which is now covered over it's veiled it's covered in these garments of skin okay so that's the that's kind of the first thread in in what eventually becomes the grail story the second one we could talk about is in the what i've called the iberian virgin and her grail and if you want to know more about this by the way i know people love like where can i go read about this myself there's this great book called the virgin of the grail by joffer joseph gehring and it's it's all about this image so the image that you see manifesting in let's say in the pyrenees right around the time of between the third and the fourth and a little bit after the fourth crusade right you have these images that come up over and over again these beautiful romanesque frescoes i mean they're really stunning whenever somebody's like i'd like to see more western art in churches or something like that i'm like well i would too but i don't think we mean the same thing by that i think you mean like renaissance stuff and i mean this stuff like this is this is like amazing amazing stuff and very like it's very sort of distinctly western but also really consonant with a byzantine tradition and so the first image of this seems to be and this isn't a it's by an anonymous painter fresco do you call somebody who paints frescoes like a painter or they are a yeah i don't know anyway he's called the master of saint clement because we don't know who he was people didn't sign their work and but he was a really gifted iconographer and in the apes of this church the saint clement of saint clements in of tol in in the pyrenees mountains you have this image of christ and glory surrounded by the the four creatures and i mean it's very very byzantine image if you've ever been to an orthodox church you've seen this somewhere you'll immediately recognize it but then beneath him around the the you know around the base of the of the apps of the church you see the choir of the apostles right so the 12 apostles plus plus some but then in their in their center and sort of standing as like the first among equals among them is the mother of god and the mother of god is standing there and she's holding you can kind of see it in the cover art right here because this is holding a cup of something he's holding it it's a dish it's a dish yeah so the word grail means it means like a large shallow serving dish and actually specifically specifically it's a serving dish for serving fish that's what you serve in a grill and this is in christianity it says the virgin he sees this version coming in holding this large grail in which you might serve like a pike or a lamprey in other words like a very large fish so again thinking about fish here it's carrying right this idea of a container for food a container for fish right an altar or an altar or like a tombstone all of these images of of these containers but that are also yeah that are also secret that are heavenly all of this is kind of coming together right so there's something there's something about this and and this this original image seems to be ugly of the ascension i should have prefaced that by saying this original image seems to have been of the ascension so in the byzantine tradition right when we portray the ascension it's essentially exactly like this we show christ in glory he's being taken up to heaven on the like the terubic throne and then beneath him we have all of the apostles and in the midst of the apostles we have the mother of god and she's flanked on either side right by two angels you've done some really great videos it's been a while but you've done some really great videos about this icon of the ascension right which is an icon of the church what the church was at that moment what it is now and and of course the way that we expect yeah and it's it's an eschatological vision as well it's also right how because it says even in scripture that that christ will return in the same manner that he that he left so this seems to be a a reworking of the byzantine image of the ascension but what's different about it and this is the crucial difference and this is about 50 years before kretion wrote his his grail story which is the first real grail romance right so 50 years before that this guy painted this image and he shows the virgin mary holding in her hand this grail and in the grail there are flames shooting up out of it so it's not totally sure what's in the grail the author of this book has some theories i don't think they're all like totally right because there's some things i mean he's he's writing about christian ritual from like an outsider perspective whereas anybody who's like you know lived in the church and and been to been to liturgy enough times and things like this they're but but on the whole i think he's right in that he says that the contents of the bowl are either you know it's either the eucharist or it's chrism and that for our purposes it doesn't really matter which one of those it is right that that in other words like this this this fiery bowl right contains let's say it it shows the way in which the grace of the holy spirit has been given to the church which the the the the creator of this fresco saw as being mediated through the incarnational experience of the church which which we understand through the the mother of god so he so would he so this author does he see this as a kind of small image of pentecost yes wow he doesn't talk about pentecost so much you just talk about it a little bit again that's where i think you know because in the western tradition by the way the image of the image of pentecost resembles the image of ascension right we have this image where we don't show we don't have a character in the center and it's like it's like these these chairs going around like this in the door but the western version and the one in the raboula gospels which is like some one of the earliest versions of the of pentecost we see that disciples in a line with the mother of god in the center and then the fire coming down upon them all so like it's it's more it's closer to the image of the ascension that you would find that you would find normally i didn't know that i didn't know that in armenian depictions of the ascension is very often the same so that you know where you do have the mother of god there and i actually have seen some byzantine icons that have her there not the one that's in our church but like my home parish but i have seen that a few times so yeah it's a very old tradition people say people don't like it because it's not the one we ended up with but yeah the idea it's a very very old tradition to have the mother god in the center so it's i mean this is a little aside but once my daughter for an art class decided that she wanted to do an icon of the of pentecost and she was just doing it like totally from memory having grown up in the church and things and she just even though that the fresco that we have on the ceiling of our church it's like right on right on the other side of the apes on the on the other side of the auction is from the apes we have a very traditional pentecost icon nobody's seated in the middle and that's the that's as you know that's the icon that she's seen in her entire growing up but when she did the icon she put the mother of god right in the middle like it was just like a normal you know here's mary here's baby jesus here's the church around them and like yeah so that's it's i j she's like oh that's huh that's really interesting if anybody's interested by the way i wrote an article specifically about that on the two women on the two images of the church let's say the the the the church of the jews the church the gentiles or the inner woman and the outer woman and so how it's related to to pentecost to ascension and pentecost so i'll put a link of that in the description yeah that'd be great so right after this image what we have what we see then happening in these in churches all across let's say this the certain region of spain is and and then into into france we see we see this image of and it very quickly changes into just mary holding a chalice but we show this image popping up in romanesque iconography from the century again and again and again and it's worth noting that the the the romancers who wrote down their versions of the grail stories right that their patrons their original patrons were these troubadour crusader kings and lords who originally came from this region right so that so that they're coming east they're going east for the crusades they're coming back this iconography pops up and then about 50 years 50 to 100 years later that's when all the grail romances start showing up in western europe so i find this very interesting of course it is in in catian it is the virg it is a virgin maybe not the virgin but it is a virgin who is carrying the grail in the procession in the in the fisher king's palace okay so the third seed of the grail story and this is where things get a little weird the third seed don't think playing altars is weird enough i mean we need much weirdest i mean yeah okay so we have this we have this icon of you know this is some we call it like the holy mendelian or the icon made without hands right if you've been to an orthodox church you've probably seen this icon right it's it's it's weird because it's like an icon of a towel with the face of jesus on it right and this goes back to this legend of of uh which is let's say attested in some of our earliest christian historical sources right so much so that you know i mean i personally i mean it's a feast of the church i take for granted that it's a it's a real thing that happened right i have no reason to doubt doubt it right but this legend that essentially there was king abgar of odessa right who had desired an icon of christ and so he sent his his people to to make a copy of christ's face like to make a picture of him a painting right or to get something of christ and you know avgar is sick and in some versions of the story you stick with leprosy but actually very importantly in other versions of the story especially in the middle ages as the the legend gets sort of elaborated he's paralyzed in other words of course paralysis is also always sort of associated with let's say infertility and all these things right so you have a paralyzed king a wounded king right and and so he sends for something of the lord's which will which will be able to heal him and basically what happens when the when the the people they come to draw christ is that they can't do it like they're actually not able to to to depict him they can't get his image and actually in one of the remember what i said about the grail having five forms right in one of the versions of the story in the middle ages the reason they can't get his image is because as they start trying to draw him his image constantly changes and it goes from being a little child to being a 30 year old man to being christ in his passion to being the ancient of days right and it moves through these like all these different things right and they can't do it so finally christ basically makes them an icon and it's it's at least of his face but possibly of his entire body yeah so he imprints his his form onto the claw right and so he gives that to them and they take it back to the city of odessa and there are all kinds of this is people don't understand now like we understand a little bit in in like the orthodox church because like again we we have this icon in a lot of places and we do have a feast for it it's one of the three feasts of the lord in the month of august but this is a big deal in the middle ages people copied and re-copied and copied and re-copied the story many of the crusaders who obviously odessa was was taken by the western crusaders and during the first crusade it was retaken and then in the fourth crusade of course constantinople was sacked by the time of the fourth crusade the the icon of the the holy face the holy mendelian was in constantinople at blackhair and i and if you go back and you read the the first hand eyewitness accounts of the people who saw this icon but then you also if you read the the legend so so there were there were legends that got copied into latin from a pretty early date that a lot of these crusaders brought back west with them and you start looking at let's say the the the theological connection between or another theological connection but you start looking at the connection between the what the things that are supposed to happen in the grail chapel or in the grail palace right or the grail castle if you look at those and you look at the rituals that were associated with the veneration of this icon in odessa and then in constantinople later they map very tightly okay and and of course there's a lot of other stuff obviously the spear isn't you know the holy spirit the lance of longinus whose feast day was in the in the orthodox church was just a few days ago by the way from when we were recording this that that comes up during the time of the crusades right because it's uncovered or it's believed to be uncovered during the siege of antioch and all this other stuff is going on right so all of the stuff is kind of coming west and in particular we're they're they're and i don't totally understand because obviously there's the you have basically like three versions of this idea of like a cloth that has christ's face on it right you have the shroud of turin or the burial shroud you have the like the cloth that st veronica is supposed to have pressed against christ's face came away with an impression of the icon and then you have this the holy mandelian the icon made without hands but in a lot of these earlier stories those all basically seem to be the same thing well for sure they all seem to at least the the one the earliest one is the is the mendelian tradition yes okay that's that's very old so this is this is where it gets a little kind of mind-blowing and i don't even know how much i want to say about this but in in in the early in the earliest descriptions that we have of people who went to venerate the mendelian and wrote about us these are firsthand eyewitness accounts it's not just the face okay that it's actually a cloth that has been folded but if you unfold the entire thing it would give you this impression of christ's body at least from like the waist up and that it was and that that this impression was made with christ's sweat and with his blood so it's more like the the the turin the shroud yeah yeah so but typically speaking what they would do is that this whole thing would be folded up in fact one of the names for the cloth means like they ate the cloth that's been folded eight times or something like this and they would fold the cloth up and then they would so that only the face could be seen and you could only see that see the face i mean it's just it's heavily protected so you could only see the face if you look through a certain aperture which you're only allowed to do at sort of certain times right and so so it's it's it's again it's this idea of here's something that that that contains christ's body that contains christ's blood right or at least the impression of them yeah well it did i mean it's it's like just right right just like yeah right and so all of this is all of this is tied then with the the byzantine apocryphal tradition surrounding joseph of arimathea so joseph of arimathea who was put into prison and released after the emperor of vespasian was healed by the holy cloth of leprosy he's you know this is the this is the legend that's found in the there's a there's a the gospel of nicodemus and the acts of pilate these two apocryphal works that are really important in our tradition yeah when i say they're apocryphal i don't mean that we totally discount them i think maybe by now people know that but that is that source of the sorry the source of the anastasia's icon is from the god right exactly exactly yeah so so obviously a really important part of our of our tradition so joseph jose yeah so joseph takes the the blood or he he takes the cup or he carries it so he's closely associated originally with his burial cloth especially in the in the rituals surrounding its veneration at odessa or burial cloth or the mendelian or whatever you want to call it he's very closely associated with that in the tradition of the city of odessa now the other place where this comes in would be two two things one is that during the first especially the first millennia of the church going into like the 13th and 14th century there's a really rich tradition of byzantine you know eastern christian mystical commentaries on the liturgy right you could basically say it's like doing allegorical commentary on the liturgy except that nobody knows what allegory means anymore and so i don't like to use it that word because people get confused but it's just it's ways of of sort of let's say interpreting and explicating the mystery of of the divine liturgy of course the most most important one of these is probably saint maximus the confessor's mystical ecclesial mystagogy which i've talked about a lot and i'm a big fan of that particular work one of the things i love about it is that i only understand maybe like a fourth of it because because he's like the liturgy has these four or five senses and he re explains the first sense and i'm like okay i get that he explains the second sentence and i'm like okay i get that and then he starts explaining like the third fourth fifth census and i'm like i don't i can't i don't even know what the subject is i don't even can't even yeah right like i don't even like my my i'm such a baby you know spiritually like i have no idea what that's even about right yeah exactly but um so in the in these commentaries okay and uh i'm just gonna pull up my notes here because because there's like a whole chain of custody for this information but basically in these commentaries what we get is this idea so you find this in like saint germainis uh commentary this idea that there is a let's say like a polyvalence or an overlapping sense of meaning between the the chalice or the patents the the what's it called the epitaphion you know like that like the the cloth that has which is exactly which is an image of the shroud basically right the image that has the body of christ stitched or painted on it and that which is on the altar right so between that between the the patents and the and actually the the the epitaphian seems to have developed and i'm sure there are people out there who know way more about liturgical history than i do but it seems to have developed originally from the veil which is placed over the chalice and over the patents so this seemed to be related which you know okay all intuitively like on a symbolic level all that stuff makes sense right yeah but then you have the then you have the so so there's a relationship between these things and then the deacon who carries them out during the liturgy right and such that we are told and this is in the byzantine liturgical commentary which is then translated into latin which then is like re reworked into another latin commentary on the latin mass and like there's three or four levels of this versions of this that come to the west right about all the time right about the time that all the grail legends are popping up in which we are told that the deacon at this moment is imaging the role of joseph of arimathea really so this stuff is like deeply and of course i mean in in well i mean i guess because he carried you could say it really immediately because he carried the body right down and he put the body in a tomb and think about it right think about how heavily joseph of arimathea features in the eastern liturgy right that long beautiful the noble joseph jamari that we sing every year we sing it during holy week we sing it again on the sunday of the myrrh bearers right this you know so this this the the role that he had in taking the body of christ down and sort of carrying it he's he's so closely connected in the eastern liturgical tradition not just in like the byzantine version that's come down to to us in our church but also like in the syrian tradition he's so closely connected to the act of carrying the body of christ that that's the connection that these these liturgical like these mystical commentaries on the mass and on the divine liturgy that's the connection that they make yeah because also joseph offers the vessel yes he actually offers the tomb like he pays for it right he he buys the tomb and so he offers this vessel for the body and so it's like it yeah it all makes sense like very in a very immediate way notwithstanding all the legends which are going to come later right so the legends about like joseph coming to england and all this stuff that comes much later okay comes much later right they make so much sense like with all this symbolism right we know where what england is right so that's the thing though is is one of the things i want to point to with with something like the grail legends where you have where you have a clear a story that is clearly non-historical let's say but also so fundamentally true that we keep trying to tell it over and over again right like the holy grail as far as i'm concerned the holy grail is like the great story of western civilization like it's the big problem right the fact that the fact that in the early stories of the grail i'll talk more about this in the next video but in the early stories of the veil the grail the the grail quest is achieved but the more we retell it and the longer it goes the more unattainable the grail becomes okay i think that's i think that's really really telling yeah so yeah but it's also it also has to do like if you unders understand what's going on when the grey legends are appearing and you notice that you know there is the idea that there is a mystery which is no longer accessible to me this is something that especially as a as a as someone as an orthodox person i can see as related to the one of the problems which comes in the late middle ages as this nominalism gets set in as certain branches of so it's almost as if mythically there's an intuition that there's something off and that there's something that we used to have access to or that we should have access to that we could we don't anymore like there's an aspect of the mystery which has been kind of that has been kind of pulled away from us and and and so there's there's i think there's it's related to the schism i think so yeah so so this is where i'm gonna get into get myself into a little bit you shouldn't say these things so that i can be the one that get i i can be the one that gets in trouble with some of your listeners okay but a lot okay but but there are a lot of serious grail scholars out there who have pointed out the fact that the grail legend begins to arrive in western europe exactly at the time that people start arguing about transubstantiation right right at the time that berengarias and all these people they're like they're like is it a symbol is it what is it this is it that right just right at the point that of course that's where somebody like alexander schmemann sort of points the original that's where maybe things start to go wrong you know everyone's got maybe their date for when things start to go wrong but what everybody agrees with on is that something obviously went wrong right but but right at the time that the the secularism begins to be born and that that rift in in western sacramento theology starts to slowly widen in what's eventually going to become the reformation and all the things that kind of are downstream from that right at the time that was happening is when the grail story starts to manifest itself in western europe and that culminates the the idea the unattainable grail culminates right around the time of the fourth crusade which is kind of the death knell in in any hopes of reunion between the eastern and western church you know i think you know my reading and i think a lot of i think there's a lot of evidence for this is that historically people still thought they were going to be able to get the band back together yeah right until you know latin crusaders sacrifice and they put a prostitute on the throne of the patriarch of constantinople in the church of agyo sophia and at that point they were like this is not happening maybe maybe like you know you know maybe maybe this is not gonna work out after yeah right so and i and i think you're right like i think it's connected to those things and it's part of what makes the story of the grail so important and also so tragically painful and when i what i want to do in the next video is is to start going through some of the romances of the grail yeah and i want to start with christian because even though his version is not let's say the definitive version i think in some ways it's still the best yeah and i think that actually people have been reading it profoundly wrong for a very long time that everyone thinks it's unfinished and everyone thinks percival doesn't get the grail and i think that's totally wrong oh right wow yeah so just tease that for next video so so maybe so what i my last words are going to be something like even now in the discussion that we've had talking about the sources of where the grey legend comes from we notice that there is something about the grail itself which is related to the west that has to do with the west if we understand the west in the sense of the place where the sun sets that that western edge of the world and we always have to remember now we live in america and so this has kind of been thrown up there's been a stretching out of the west you could say but for the ancients britain was the edge of the world right it was it was represented that eastern that western edge of reality where the barbarians were still there and it was still kind of a wild land that had to be tamed you know we remember that the giants were there there's all these these these stories about what it is that britain represents so there's a sense in which all these stories are kind of coming together and manifesting the west and manifesting this notion of the container and the support for something sacred something which holds the sacred in it the altar this cha the the cup the chalice the grail the the the cloth all of these are all these supports and it's also a book there's also a version of the grail mid-ledge which it's a book so it's all these idea of the of the support of of something from above right and so it is of course related to the feminine and so we can already see that why so much of the madness of the grail stories that have come to us recently and dan brown i'm talking to you in this this this this statement is they wanted to make it about right they all wanted to make it about the feminine and they're totally right that it is about this about the feminine but we also need to understand it rather as something which is pointing beyond the kind of crass the crass way in which people like dan brown have wanted to bring about like as if all these mysteries all these stories what they're pointing to is some historical fact that everybody wants to hide and that's it there's no more meaning to it than that it's all about hiding something that happened that nobody wants you to find out about yeah and so that's really like if it was that then she just all throw it in the trash anyways because it's not it's not really interesting so i think that i think that the things you're saying are so something that's really curious to me about this grail stuff right is that essentially all of the pieces are there in the east but the east never has a grail story they never have a grail legend they never have a grail romance and in general the east never it they they just never develop let's say imaginative literature to the same degree even like you know like the great orthodox novels like dostoyevsky or something like that are you know they're like you know super super like like in your face and very like grounded and gritty and realistic and things like this and it's not that we don't have like wonder tales or or things but when we have them we they tend to be in hagiography or in stories of miracles and things like this and there's like a like just this experience of a much more proximate experience of the divine of the miraculous of relics of saints of angels of all these different things that is there initially in say like the age of the saints like the fifth and sixth century you know whales or somewhere like that but tends to starts to be lost in the west and as that distance begins to stretch out you have something very much like and this is this is i mean this is something i've been thinking about a lot because i write fiction obviously i love talking about fiction right fiction is the garment of skins in which saint david's altar is wrapped right it's it's our inability to to come to some of these things in like a really bald way in like a really open way we can't do it anymore and i say i say this you know as a obviously i'm a practicing christian i'm a member of the orthodox church but i'm also a western person yeah and that that hasn't changed and i'm like i'm totally as much as i can be i try to be aware of what that means and what you know obviously there's some great things about that there's also some some big limitations that i'm trying to work through and i think that i think that you could say the grail romances right and the way that they develop they develop precisely at this time that something is being lost that there's a rift that's happening and they become a way to take that thing that's being lost and sort of wrap it in this protective covering of skins which becomes poetry and romance and all this stuff and a sense of nostalgia there's a sense in the grail of nostalgia yeah especially the later especially the later version like robert de berlin this this deep sense that man if we could have if we could have i mean this is all the way back in in krita and like in his his romance which is the first real romance like that sense that if he could have asked the right question he could have asked what's the grant yeah if you could have asked the right question then he would like then the land would have been healed yeah you know that that in other words communion would have been restored which i think actually again happens in that romance and people miss it so we'll we'll talk about it all right well that'll be that'll be the way to end this to see how is it that richard thinks that that that the kids ain't got it right well i love kids romance and so i'm really excited to find out about it so everybody thanks for your time thanks for attention of course this is just the beginning of our of our discussing the ground so we're looking forward to the next episode having an announcement go for it go back god's talk oh and go back god stuck all right everybody talk to you soon bye-bye
