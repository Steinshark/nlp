the attitude for the huawei p30 phones really seems to be let's get what we did last year and take each individual feature to the next level so if this is the huawei p 30 pro then you're looking at the most exciting kind of upgrades first off a basic overview if you look carefully at some of the case leaks you'll be able to peek what looks like a headphone jack and some publications have inferred from this that the feature will make a return now i thought this would be super unusual it would be the equivalent of huawei admitting that they made a mistake last year so to find out i tried ordering one of the cases and it arrived so this is a huawei p 30 pro case so if we start by placing it over last year's p 20 pro a few things become clear it's a little tight around the sides so you can tell there in terms of body the p 30 pro will be a similar size and maybe even a little slimmer also there is a massive amount of room around the camera if we shifted the flush module to where it'll probably go on the right hand side then that leaves room for four cameras and a wider camera module on the p 30 pro now if we flip to the top you can see that we have two sizable holes on the case the larger one actually big enough to fit a 3.5 millimeter jack through which doesn't make my job easier but my best guess would be that these are for an ir blaster and a microphone car like we saw on the p20 pro which would imply no headphone jack there's no sign of a fingerprint scanner either indicating that the in screen scanner from the mate 20 pro will make a return here okay so cameras the standard huawei p30 looks like it's taken on what the pro model could do last year according to evan blasts it should have a triple camera with a 40 megapixel resolution and five times lossless zoom that sounds familiar at the same time while the p30 will be essentially competing with last year's flagships it is the p30 pro that will be stepping forward with four cameras on the back we don't know the exact formation but looking at the case gives us a good idea on top of the three that we've already seen on the may 20 pro this fourth one could be either a monochrome sensor which can add a degree of sharpness to the end photo or a 3d camera which could do things like make a person seem taller or slimmer in real time the p-series is also traditionally where our wave massively bolsters the main camera so you can also expect a better sensor capable of processing more light and quite possibly a wider aperture which can further reduce noise in the dark and as a side benefit create even more bokeh in your photos portrait mode on huawei phones has always been a bit artificial looking though so i do hope that instead of just throwing a whole load of new stuff onto this phone the company also works on refining what's there the european boss walter g has also talked about 10 times optical zoom on their future devices but to be honest it might make more sense for them to save that for the mate 30 pro later on in the year because let's face it the p 30 kind of already has enough going on right now one thing it would do though is push that dx o mark camera score higher so if it turns out that the p 30 pro wasn't performing as well as why we hoped then they could have decided to fast-track this ten times zoom to give the score a boost okay what about the display while we have most likely had a bit of a dilemma with this one they've got the option to go for the cheaper water drop notch or they could go for the more modern-looking punch hole camera or the third option would be to take advantage of the full size notch and incorporate the 3d face scanning features we saw on the mate 20 pro it's pretty clear from the case renders that these companies aren't too sure what the answer is either some of them resemble last year's handsets while others look more like something new oh yeah and we're pretty sure that the p30 pro is gonna take the curved display that we saw on last year's meet 20 pro which mind you i don't completely love that screen isn't entirely responsive around the curved area and every now and again it does result in a little bit of fiddling so what about the power if the past is anything to go by the p30 pro is gonna be powered by six or eight gigs of ram and he karen at 980 chip and it's a bit of a hot topic because on one hand this chip is beaten in a lot of areas by the snapdragon 855 but then on the other hand because huawei would then be building both the hardware and a lot of the software they can build that software to take advantage of the dual ai cores on this chip also don't get me wrong this chip is still very fast and very responsive and you'll only really notice ace light performance disparity with high-level 3d gaming and load times mui 9.1 you might not be keeping up to date with while ways mui update cycle but long story short alongside the p30 pro they're probably almost definitely going to drop mui 9.1 and considering that the upgrade from mui 8 to 8.1 brought massive features like night mode slow motion and face unlocking expect big features this time too as well as a much-needed facelift so there we have it what do you guys think do you think this p30 pro case is legit and if so are you excited about the phone let me know in the comments down below as always my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss i'll catch you in the next one [music]
