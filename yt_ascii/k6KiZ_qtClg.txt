on paper peru is one of the most water-rich countries in the world 17th in fresh water per capita availability things should be great right the problem is that this water is very unevenly distributed basically none of that water is where the people are namely the capital of peru lima and its 11 million residents lima was never meant to be a mega city an accident of history that has caused a watery havoc in this video we look at the water supply wo of lima and peru in general in 1535 the spanish started looking for a new capital for their mineral extraction colony the vice worldy of peru the then capital of jaa was located in the central highlands but the crown appointed governor francisco pizaro wanted to move the capital in order to be closer to a port located at the city of kalao that port was shipping out the precious metals mine at the vice royalties and i love this word upper regions of cusco and poosi scouts located a spot about 5 miles away from the pacific coast it was not only close to the ocean but also airy and had good land and amazingly when the conquistadors arrived at this spot in the desert they saw thriving farms fruit trees and willows and so they chose to place their new capital here which they named lima residents are called lenos the area gets some peculiar weather peru today is the 19th largest country in the world larger than south africa chad nigeria or egypt and just behind iran the peruvian geography is very diverse 60% of its land is covered by amazon jungle which is sparsely populated by humans plenty populated by nasty animals i want to eat you about 30% of the land is the andes mountains snow covered peaks high islands and valleys not a lot of people can live here and then there is the 10% of country which is long and narrow and bordering the coast this is where most of the population today lives and it is a literal desert this is because of the peru current flowing up from antarctica this cold water not only brings nutrients up from the ocean bottom but also cools a coastal waters despite being in a tropical location and thus rain clouds do not easily form the result is a location that interestingly enough can get very humid and foggy but at the same time gets extremely little rain about 10 mm each year so where was all this water for these farms coming from the largest source of portable water for the lima area is a river descending from the andes the ryac glaciers up in the andes melt to create water that travels for about 100 mil down',000 ft steep slopes of the highlands the remac feeds into what is called the remac river basin before emptying into the pacific the river is quite seasonal today about half of lima's rivers completely dry up during the may to december dry season but during the spring the remac river might swell and often flood causing devastation the remac river is lima's only natural source of fresh water the other option would be to dig wells which was possible but not easy the water table is deep and inaccess accessible without relatively advanced drilling technologies prior to the spanish invasion the peruvian indigenous people had already built a network of irrigation canals that drew from the river to drink and irrigate their crops the canals were cleaned and maintained by local laborers who received tools and food from their lords the water would be shared amongst various social and ethnic groups and political power came out of how this water would be distributed when pizaro founded lima he struck a deal with the local indigenous lord talah chuso later da francisco after his baptism as the city quickly attracted new settlers the city government or cabildo first connected their households to this existing water system in the 1550s the city had grown from just a few dozen men to over 3,000 spaniards plus women merchants and mos by the end of the 1500s over 14,000 people lived in lima they dumped trash sewage and other waste into the remac polluting it and making it undrinkable disputes broke out between the residents there were some springs at the foot of the santa rosa and quiros hills called the la atara so in the early 1560s the government built a reservoir that collected water from it clay pipes then brought that water to the rest of the city these pipes were about 30 cm wide internally glazed and wrapped in brick the first fountain was completed and inaugurated in 1578 there was a great celebration where the city mayor threw silver coins out of his window while times today atara is the name of lima's major water treatment plant supplying 85% of the city's total water demand more pipes were built throughout the late 1600s into the 1700s many of these lines served only the powerful this included royalty the cabildo officials like mayors and councilmen and the religious institutions like the dominicans franciscans and the jesuits 82% of the waterpipe capacity petitioned for and granted went to these religious institutions at the time some of the most powerful people in the state the lower classes which not only included ordinary laborers but also richer merchants and professionals did not receive concessions for water pipe to their homes and neighborhoods so they had to go to the public fountains or or they purchased water through a water vendor or aatos who brought water by hand into the city from over the mountains in those days peru had an active slave trade people who wanted to drink better water than what they can get from the remac would send a slave on a donkey to the nearby slopes outside the city to fill two barrels of water after slavery was later abolished in the'50s several freed water carriers banded together to create water guilds they would bring water from a distant family mountain and then sell it door too on the streets peru's independence from spain in the early 19th century coincided with a shift away from silver to guano or bird poop the guano export boom lasted for several decades as peru cornered the world fertilizer industry annual gdp growth hit 4.7% and guano made up 74% of total exports the guano gravy train funded large government expansions peru's government earned 80% of its income from guano and spent half of that money on ambitious railroad networks and expanded government services one service was public health president ramon castilla wanted to improve lima's water supply those old clay pipes first built in the 1570s needed to be replaced with iron ones water storage had to be expanded and so on so with presidential support a group of peruvian businessmen founded the water company in'55 10 years later in'64 the company signed a 50-year contract with the government to supply water between'58 and'98 the water company laid down some 73 km of iron pipe that company is the ancestor of today's state-owned waters utility sedapal this contract basically privatized lima's water supply and because the company spent all that money they argued the water belonged to them them causing disputes with the city and federal governments this water shortage issue was exacerbated by the fact that in'72 lima removed its city walls originally built in the 1680s to protect from attackers with the walls now gone new residents streamed in and the city expanded straining the water supply once more the guano boom had a mixed effect on the peruvian economy its financial benefits mainly acred to to the elites namely the merchants and financiers average laborer saw little widening the gap between the rich and poor worse yet bread and butter prices rapidly inflated during the'50s and the'70s driving up living costs and creating social unrest riots and uprisings took place in'58 in'72 the peruvian guano boom ended in the'70s when new artificial fertilizers made by the habber bos process won the market the government's attempts to find its next big export spark war with one of its neighbors from'79 to'84 peru and chile secretly backed by spain fought the war of the pacific apparently over nitrate taxes it seems peru eventually lost the war seeding the nitrat rich province of taraka thousands of peruvians died economic activity in peru collapsed by over 30% though this helped alleviate the cost of living crisis by the end of the 19th century the average peruvian was about 70% richer on a gdp per capita measure sounds great right but when taking into account the higher costs of living the average working class peruvian was left 10% worse compared to how they were in'25 as measured by welfare ratio whether their wages can buy food for a family of four in 1913 just a year before the end of the water company's contract the lima municipal government bought the company outright foreign experts hired by the government pointed out that the water supply did not meet the drinking standards of the day water traveled through dirty irrigation ditches including the ancient circo quotquot river more an irrigation canal without any form of treatment so the lima city government under the leadership of mayor luis miro cada took control of the water company and set about building a purification factory and chlorination plant near the ataria springs for the first time in 400 years the lenos had portable drinking water in 1920 this progress was interrupted when the peruvian national government under president austo lagua expropriated all of peru's water companies water supply and street paving contracts were given to a new york based company called the foundation company which kind of does not make sense until you realize that austo moved to the us after the war of the pacific and got very rich as an insurance executive at the new york life insurance company anyway companies like foundation did very well from these contracts then in 1929 the national government nationalized the water companies again a status that has basically remained unchanged until the 1960s up until the 1940s lima's population grew rather slowly in 1940 lima had about 645,000 inhabitants representing just 10% of the national population but the post-war era brought a long period of prosperity driven by burgeoning economic demand for peruvian goods like fishmeal the good times lasted through the 1950s 60s and the first half of the 1970s demographic changes brought people to urban areas le population grew at over 5% a year throughout the 1960s and 1970s as you might expect the city struggled to meet the needs of this growing population in the late 1940s and' 50s the city built a total of 3,500 new homes nowhere near close enough to accommodate the 30 to 50,000 new migrants arriving at the city each year so the new arrivals stayed in baros inal settlements on seized land they built the household first only counting on receiving urban services like water later by 1974 lima had 371 such settlements and they grew to host some 1.5 million people despite attempts in the 1960s and70s to quote unquote legitimize these baros they nevertheless divided lima into quote legal and illegal residents the government tried to build water pipes to some of these settlements but the reality is that the quote legal parts end quote of the city the so-called richer guys tended to get their water first leaving the less fortunate to resort to the informal water vendors by the mid 1970s peru's per capita income was on par with brazil chile and uruguay but the energy crisis of the decade struck the country's economy a startling blow ending its economic growth worse yet the government did not respond well to these new challenges under a series of inep leaders the peruvian government implemented policies that caused high deficits social instability and even hyperinflation the late 1980s saw some of the worst economic times the young president alan garcia was elected on a platform committing to all peruvians but his administration oversaw a drastic downfall in the economy import restrictions high tariffs and an overvalued currency discouraged exports and agricultural production these policies hurt the overall economy but benefited urban residents incentivizing even more people to come to lima then in 1987 garcia attempted to nationalize the country's remaining private banks which evaporated all business confidence in him from there the peruvian economy rapidly collapsed at the same time a maist terrorist group called the shining path where the communist party of peru fought a vicious guerilla war to topple the government and establish a communist state at its peak the shining path had 3,000 armed members they were formidable and the government could not control them they stalked the outskirts of lima following ma's philosophy of starting in the countryside and choking off the cities this affected mining energy and agriculture activities conducted outside of the city and caused people to flood into the city even more the shining path declined in 1992 after the government captured his charismatic i leader abel guzman by 1989 only'.6% of the population was fully employed the inflation rate was 2776 garcia's approval ratings 90% in 1985 had plummeted to just 9% back in the growing mega city of lima the water problems were getting worse gara's populace administration did not allow water and sewage fees to keep up with inflation by 1989 fees for each cubic meter of water on a real basis cost less than half of what they did back just 4 years earlier those connected to the water system used their water wastefully with few controls on their demand users did not often pay for how much water they used either paying a flat fee not having their usage metered or just not paying their bill in 1987 water consumption per capita in lima during the wet season was 23 6 l per day this is more than what is consumed in european cities about 150 to 200 l per day some richer areas used as much as 567 lers while poorer areas used as little as 105 for those 25% of lenos without a connection they can do nothing but rely on public taps drilled informal wells or expensive vendor water the 1990 election was a major turning point for peru lima and its water system the turmoil of the garcia years led to the unexpected rise and election of alberto fujimori a peruvian of japanese descent who spoke spanish with a noticeable accent in his early career fujimori was an academic and tv host in the 1990 election he started off as just another one of several candidates he positioned himself as a relatively moderate political independent but was not taken very seriously by the major players however divisions in the dominant left and right-wing coalitions lost them their support there was a distinct desire to make a break from the past and go with fresh leadership and thus el chino perhaps a misnomer as he was japanese not chinese consolidated middle ground support and won a runoff against a novelist mario vargas leosa by a large margin largely by sticking to a vague generalized script defined by change as a political newcomer entered government the consequences of years of water mismanagement came to pass in january 1991 doctors began receiving chaler patients in the northern parts of peru chalera is caused by bacterial infection in the small intestine famously resulting in high volumes of watery diarrhea chera is a disease caused and spread by unsanitary conditions infected people dro their watery wastes into public drinking water sources there was a terrible affliction back during the'00s but we don't hear about it today because of public water systems it was peru's first chera epidemic in nearly a 100 years the disease swept through the country infecting 1.3 million people and killing some 3,000 though some estimates go to 13,000 the death rate would have been worse had the public health authorities not reacted so swiftly to the news and brought fresh water and salts to the victims but nevertheless it spurred the government and people towards change fujimori ran as a moderate he drew strong support from lima particularly in the poorer segments of the city however fujimori ultimately followed many of the market oriented policies espoused by his rival losa which were painted as potentially bringing economic shocks shocks though were ultimately unavoidable considering the dire situation first was the readjustment of the water and sewage tariffs among other public services prices rose by almost 80% in the single year many poorer peruvians could not afford the higher water fees without subsidies from higher income users which the water utility sedapal often granted pricing regimes also had to change only a percentage of connections were metered and a lot of people paid a flat fee for their water however the government was less successful in pushing these changes through these prize hikes were done as part of greater reform towards a potential privatization of the water utility setal from 1992 to 1996 stakes and over a 100 state-owned companies in the oil mining electricity and telecommunications sectors were sold to the public to raise money for government sedapal was listed as one of those companies later documents sl scandals or what have you found that much of the sum 7 to9 billion dollar raise never benefited the people rather it was stolen by by members of the fujimori government but anyway in preparation for life as a public company sedapal underwent many reforms they implemented management and employee bonuses they raised wages and invested in new infrastructure and maintenance the world bank encouraged this transition and even lent $600 million to prepare for it but despite the utility adding $20,000 new water connections from 1989 to 2006 30% of the manual still did not have good water in part because the city's population was still growing so fast and like as i mentioned earlier any pathway to better returns on investment and greater profitability would necessitate setap pal to break the subsidization of poor water users by the richer ones and that would have been unpopular the setap pal privatization effort fell apart its status as a water utility made it less valuable than other state-owned entities ities like those in telecoms or energy selling just 35% of the telecom monopolies in early 1994 to the consortium led by telefonica yielded over a billion dollars alone to the treasury you can see why they put that first in line by the time the government turned to selling off sedapal in late 1994 it was getting perilously close to the next election the fujimori administration realized that setap pal's new owners would mean higher water prices for low lower income customers and if you recall lower income lenos were a stronghold of fujimori's winning coalition back in the 1990 election so the setal privatization was put on hold until the 1995 election which fujimori easily won and then after that the momentum was gone the public stung by higher electricity and telephone rates had soured on the privatization drive seeing it as a gift to the rich furthermore sedapal was no longer in crisis higher prices improved management incentives and a 23% reduction in headcount via voluntary retirements alleviated losses meaning that sedapal was turning a slight profit so sedapal was doing well i mean notwithstanding the 1.7 million people in lima who still do not have a water connection and all that the 1990s were a time of strong economic growth for peru inflation fell from 9 % in 1991 1992 to just 6% in 1998 real gdp growth was over 5.6% for the decade taxes were simplified and the government even turned a surplus debt was paid off and the country returned to good standing thus in 1997 the administration canel the setel privatization in its entirety and funded a $2.4 billion infrastructure campaign 14% of all public investments spent during the 1990s focus focusing on leakage control and laying down new pipe the fujimori government collapsed in 2000 in the midst of a run for a third term for all the work the fujimori government did throughout the decade he was profoundly corrupt this in addition to the viciousness of his government's actions during the suppression of the shining path caused a weight too great to overcome his elected successor as president was alejandro toledo who resumed many of fujimori's neoliberal oriented policies and after a hiccup the economy recovered from 2002 to 2008 peru was south america's second fastest growing economy despite this setap pal's financials began to deteriorate again lima's population continued to grow and acquiring enough water for those new residents cost a lot of money but every time setap pal needed to raise rates or curb demand it caused pain for poorer people and grief for politicians the 2006 election marked the return of the populist politician alan garcia yes the same garcia who in the late 1980s attempted to nationalize the banking system and spark peru's economic collapse another surprising turn in peruvian politics during his second ultimately successful presidential campaign garcia made the water issue a core theme of his message he had the slogan without water there is no democracy and promised a water forall program or a for auwa par totals ap was a public private investment program the vaguely defined goals were to achieve maximum coverage of drinking water and sanitation improve infrastructure and set up drinking water projects via private funding in line with a commitment to market oriented reforms the garcia administration in 2008 brought sedapal shares onto the lima stock exchange essentially privatizing it though the government still owns a majority of the shares from 2006 to 20 9 ap covered over 2,000 water projects sewage treatment plants water transfer pipelines desalination and so on about 349 of those projects were in lima supposedly benefiting 1.2 million people ap's private aspect means that investors will want to see a return on their investment as the number suggests seta pal struggled to execute on these complicated water projects and then there were the accusations of briber and corruption in their conduct a thesis done by peter medina razuri at the national university of san marcos later evaluated the ap projects it appeared to have concluded that the ap did not set out with concrete coherent goals to evaluate success other than the vague things declared by garcia during his campaign which in turn makes it difficult to decide whether or not ap was successful today lima continues to grow now utterly sprawling the capital city is spreading onto hills and into river valleys making it even more challenging to build water infrastructure for the residents there ap's lasting legacy is to create one of the most complicated water systems in any city a hodgepodge of reservoirs storage lakes wells and more in a network stretching over 14,000 kilm with vendors and barrels patching it all together the manos continue to suffer from high water tariffs and water service outages so they continue to rely on these informer water vendors and their own storage systems as well as thievery some 30% of sedap pal's water cannot be accounted for fundamentally water will always be expensive or scarce in lima because it basically never rains the water must always be pumped from deep underground transported over vast distances or stored in expensive spaces looking ahead climate change brings even more challenges the glaciers on the andies mountain mountains that provide water for the remac river are likely to be affected threatening serious droughts so for the residents of lima despite living in a country with plentiful amounts of fresh water the marginal cost of procuring that water will almost always be high inflicting suffering on those who can least afford it an accident of history with ramifications lasting over 500 years all right
