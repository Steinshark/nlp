welcome back to wish to attack we make some very questionable decisions on wish purchases look this is not gun well in the past fry not gonna go well today well let's spin the roulette wheel and see what we find oh that's so good it's like a 1/12 scale phone we should get this just for thumbnails alicia i love it really small though my tinder reviews king naked tree i said tree with that's weird oh a racing wheel for $62 refurbished thumb yeah 462 bucks free shipping oh wow look at this only one second go from this to this that's a great photo shop oh i just inked a 32 mil f 1.6 manual aperture and everything lens for sony e-mount what is this it's a girl eating a microphone not all white people look alike ken although most like girls do look like i found a 56 dollar macbook knooow you clickbait tonight that keyboard yeah you make the thumbnails you can't blame it on me oh my god do you want an intelligent voice translating earphone with 28 languages i mean we have to try this this looks ridiculous yeah a 400 watt solar panel do you think we're going to get 400 watts out of a 50 lf solar panel unwish should we try it for 62 bucks that just seems like it would be a fun gag outside ken look the 2021 upgraded the beats we're in the future that's pretty sure that's illegal wait how is it refurbished in its in 2020 okay i'll buy it do you want to shure sm57 we give a try 27 bucks okay the 1600 dpi optical usb gaming mouse which actually looks really cool in the photo i'm sure it's terrible but six bucks why not all right so with that i think we have all the items we need for our wish tree tech extravaganza now i'll be back in like two months when these things actually all show up oh well hello and welcome back my friends it is currently three months later as for some bizarre ease and the wish shipping was delayed however we're back with my invisible mouse i gotta tell you from over here it doesn't look very invisible can you see me matt am i invisible yet bad it doesn't feel good it feels very hollow let me actually plug it in and see what it's like to use oh oh i forgot it's our g it's b look the problem is is that the mouse because it has no like sort of rear anything the entire weight mind you it's very light but the entire weights on the front so as you go to move it it's almost calling front-heavy because there's literally nothing back here besides just a little grip to sort of keep your hand from falling over see if i try to push this down the entire mouse is picked up but i mean it's pretty easy to be reasonably accurate now i'm just using a can normal like wood surface here which is not remotely smooth a single spot oh you're right it's just right here it's not on this side so there's one led in this entire side in fact there's only like one led period it essentially it's just reflecting through the plastic cuz look of you yeah and then yeah the laser wait i just realized though that's not the laser that's not like an extra light that's just the laser like firing up or something right it's fine we paid almost nothing for this you don't mind waiting several months for it to show up i'm pretty happy with this that's actually legitimately pretty cool yeah and if i'd recommend it that definitely is much worse mice and suppose price were more expensive so oh this stupid thing what is this wait that's it we're not any pedals for it okay pedals are a very key important component here so this is what i am almost positive is a used four five eight thrustmaster wheel it's clearly designed for an xbox because you have the x y a b would you have your little mode selector switch i bet you guys should program that into like f1 like i'll open up drs or something but i do have a racing setup at home with a pretty nice wheel and pedals so i'm curious to see how this lines up what i don't have is a chair hello there tiny austin here i'm gonna say right now this is not the most seamless smooth of experiences mostly because my pedals move and i'm making excuses okay you know i'm matt that's fine oh wait i have a good excuse how the buttons work nothing's working a review on amazon which i quote is a great wheel but not for pc master-race this is a truly great product that i love it but it does not work on pc out of xbox play anywhere racing games even though it's usb there is no way that i have found to pick i found a trick a game that is seeing well that's unfortunate oh i caught it oh so these are beats to do wireless and the means i can tell they're incredibly lightweight but also can you hear that plastic i don't think these are real slash legit also beats pure a and c 22 hours beats that that's happily using that beats that okay we have our slightly dirty beats headphones i can tell you amelie this is not real cuz they weigh like half of what real beats way look at this you see those little things they print it on the side oh yeah like real beats have these feel studio 3 dude these are such bad knockoffs they're not be furbished if i can give anything to beats by dre is they make very high quality feeling headphones right and sure maybe that requires them to sneak a little bit of extra metal for the feel i don't care it still feels nice this feels like a toy i will say i've worn these before i didn't start playing music i just paired them and my ears are already very uncomfortable they're like they're not the right size for anything like it just sits there and just like squishes on your ear so it's like it's not like a non ear it's not soft but it's like an over ear that's like small so just sits like right on the edges of your ear look there's a light on the side of the beach it's like and listening to the ghost of music it's like there's this speaker in the other room on this thing - it's so harsh ah i'm not gonna lie those might be tried those try this those might be the worst headphones i've ever listened to okay yeah these these feel cheaper in person oh that's prepare yourself prepare some of this okay okay that's bad okay that's bad it's not bad horrible bad ba d deeds like a slight step above horrible no no no no i challenge you shouldn't say this on camera like i said anyway challenge you to find me worse a pair of headphones for next mystery tech i bet you can't do it oh are you sure no please don't do that it's a terrible idea i don't work because it came back toward me boards gonna continue look at that i am catching everything today this is supposedly a pair of pair a single shure sm57 legendary instrument and microphone now if you're not a audio guy like madness then you will probably not know that this is a legitimately very very popular mine this is kind of the industry standard for a lot of people and for good reason it might not be the most expensive mic and might not be the best sounding mic but it is a very very popular mic that is used in many popular places so that's the nation of that yeah ever drawn out of your house this is a microphone it record things it definitely picks up audio tends to script in was about a thousand the roast is real right now so i'm gonna plug it in oh talk about test tests sm57 that's fake man wait so i can't hear this right now so can you please describe to me what you were hearing with this microphone it's very tinny it's a more of like an old-timey radio sound really yeah it's like it's not great it's not bad if you needed microphones and for recording your bandit and like in your bedroom or whatever for 26 bucks i actually think i would pick this up but it is not a real confirmed fake next item please as well i do like you know though i i say that yeah of course i know i know you do so the thing is i actually like holding the mic like this it feels really good i feel like i have a lot of power in my life so i'm just kinda you shouldn't just stand here while i do the next item this is the trans talk wireless translation headphone how awkward are you that i'm gonna make you stand right beside me as i do the dragon next item hello and welcome that this is anyway i have the mic so we're gonna go ahead and continue with the trance talk so here we have a wireless translation headphone with an app i love when i have to download an app for some weird random item that i purchased for mystery tech it's great it's my favorite thing in fact get on google play i have not found great love it awesome sweet that was a really fun item wasn't it aren't you so glad that you're spending your time watching this wonderful video all about wish mystery tech boy oh boy i'm so happy that i'm here right now i just love when things don't work it has an iphone app the iphone app actually shows up so it just doesn't work on android how are you gonna try this does anyone speak any other languages here i can give you like three sentences it ok cool we're gonna do that i'm gonna download this super sketch balls app on an iphone so you as the phone person for listening to japanese i as the headset person listening to english so if you say something in japanese to the phone you tap the button i should then hear it in english on that this is like a dumb version of google translate let's go it actually looks like dumb version of google translate as well okay all right we'll meet you up wait did it wait what wait no that's right why are you hearing it on the phone i'm not hearing that that's well it is working i'll say that much let me try this wait it's text what's the point of the headset it's it it's just the app i think he's right and then what's the point it's headset this is just a bluetooth headset yeah it's an app like google translate yeah so what's the point this there's no point i'm so offended by this mystery tag i have not been this legitimately upset normally i can blame canada it's fine but i have nothing to blame here besides myself and wish i don't blame you anyway kent how dare you let me order these items austin hits oil you just hand it to me - okay so this is the stupid baby phone here we go this is no wait nope sorry hannah don't love to do this if you would like to know more about tiny phones we did a video on this is all about these smallest phones so feel free to click on the card or the link in the description field glados this is the tiny doll phone that we got as you can see it is incredibly detailed so much so that kim can't keep it in focus you can see if you look very very closely then it is a little an old scam samsung wallet paper it's like a note 4 or something you spent a dollar on i got a dollar worth of enjoyment out of that i could give it to like my my doll that was a poor shot this is there's labels on both sides just you know what we're just gonna censor the entire frame so the entire frame just gonna go black as i unbox this instead this is now going to be an asmr unboxing so now we haven't emailed normal okay this is the beldon aps-c 1f one point 632 mil lens i mean ken yeah we can put this on back here right no no no no no right there alright see me they said no no so currently what ken is doing is if you cut to that angle is he is currently replacing the normal lens on her a camera i don't know but it's fine now we're currently using the brand new lens i don't know if this is focused it looks it looks really actually it's not that different so this is where also finds out that we bought all these lenses to flex so this is what it looks like we're recording with our $90 lens so are you trying that's that you're showing the labels again okay so this is mystery tech now where we huddle around this tiny lens so focus this is our next item for mystery tech that ken just gave me it's a solar panel that we bought on wish so why don't we go outside and see if our $61 solar panel actually works okay so we are now recording with our cheap lens and we have our wish solar panel which i will say actually looks to be reasonably large reasonably sized reasonably reasonable it's a pretty big solar panel what we're charging hey oh device charging slow oh no it was charging slowly for a second and now it's charging at full speed oh wait now it's back to slowly yeah you get like max sun because it is a little cloudy out right now we're like yeah yeah over here yeah yeah there we go max done max sun still saying charging slowly that's fine anyway hopefully you enjoyed this
