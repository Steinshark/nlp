ladies and gentlemen it is my pleasure to welcome you to norway chess 2023 norway chess is every single year one of the strongest chess tournaments that exists where they invite players like magnus carlson and basically they go down the list of the top 10 players and they invite everybody that's available this year we have players like fabiano caruana as you see on the screen they actually played in the first round hikaru nakamura they always invite ari antari as well as he's the second ranked player in norway and given that it's called norway chess they would like to give our intari an opportunity to play the top 10 players in the world and the format of norway chess is very unique so every round the players do play a classical game of chess against each other but if the game ends in a draw they then come back and they play an armageddon where the person who had white gets 10 minutes the person who played black gets seven and then if black makes a draw that counts as a win okay all right let's do that you know and the scoring system is three points for winning in classical chess and then winning in the armageddon is one and a half and you know we'll we'll get into all that as the tournament progresses we had some very interesting games on day number one including some really really shocking results and every round i will be making recaps for you this round is obviously no exception let's begin my first appetizer game that i will be serving you your order if you will is the armageddon game between chakra and ariantari they made it to armageddon because their classical game ended in a draw so the armageddon begins and as you can see it's 10 minutes for wide seven minutes for black black has draw odds so a draw is a win for black which is a pretty significant advantage we have knight f3 we have a relatively normal looking opening and then in this position plays the move g4 this is a very wild gambit tari probably shouldn't have rushed he probably should have played c5 and stuck around in the center because now this has a little bit less oomph it has a little bit less oomph because what you could take g7 make no mistake but at least your king is not castled there so g4 is a really really wild move and obviously it's too dangerous for black to capture because if you do capture like this then white is simply going to play rook g1 and have a very powerful attack which is why that's exactly what's what our insari does our antari basically just calls the bluff here he's like i think that g4 is a stupid move i think you're being overly ambitious and i actually don't believe in this attack whatsoever because i'm gonna play f5 and then if you play h3 i'm gonna go back and i just don't believe in this and neither does the computer now plays knight c3 and basically just tries to act like he did not just give away a pawn on g4 when mizarov is essentially just like i'm going to develop all of my pieces however i will lack a g pawn and instead of a g pawn i will have a rook on g1 which is just sort of a constant reminder that if you mess with me i will punch you in the face which is a pretty good way to just live life c6 from tari he has a very very strong central setup we have d4 we have a5 as tari sends a warning shot down the other way like if you castle that way i will attack you and that warning shot clearly works because in this position my major of castles directly into that warning shot and says if you mess with me i will punch you in the face i don't think he's saying this to tari as the game is going on but i have no evidence to the contrary knight to d7 king to b1 which is just always a useful move against the king off of this diagonal against the king off the c file it defends a2 king h8 h3 by the way the travel setup will be gone tomorrow we'll be back to my normal setup and now we see mommy diary of trying to in fact utilize that open g file knight to f7 is in fact fighting for g5 and also e5 my bizarov plays knight e2 and we see tari is doing exactly what he said he would do on the queen side but it is mommy diary of who is in fact asking some questions you will notice or maybe you didn't notice and now i will draw your attention to the fact that might be is no longer up three minutes in fact well before that last move he was only up about a 120. so he's lost over half of his time advantage but now tari spends a considerable amount of time and plays the move queen to a5 with various attacking ideas over here mommy giraffe has no plans of stopping knight to g5 the horses have arrived and they are pissed they have not been fed in a very long time knight to h6 ponto f3 simultaneously winning equity in the center and opening the door for the queen to rotate over to g2 and do some damage here comes orientare mamidyar of locking the queen side making sure no pawn trades are possible because if you do in fact open up the queen side black is very quick and look what one pawn trade does to the evaluation of honda c5 b4 and brings the queen why does he bring the queen because he ain't afraid of no queen a2 check why is he not afraid of no queen a2 check because the king is brave the king goes to c2 and it is actually the queen that has wander in a little bit too far and tari plays the move rookie seven and on rook a1 he parts ways with the queen he now has a rook and a bishop for the queen and yes admittedly he is in fact threatening rookie to check but mami jarv is not in the business of losing his queen if black could play rook a7 that would be wonderful like if black had this move for example he would be winning but he doesn't so he has to back out of the position now we have knight f6 and bishop d3 and mommy zara still has all the benefits of his position and he has an extra queen and he is just going to play bishop d3 he will prevent this with playing bishop to b1 and the attack will continue mommy yarov plays queen d2 takes the pawn and b4 tari's defenses over here are dwindling a rook trade secures more or less the victory because to fight successfully against the queen you need a lot of soldiers you need rogues you need knights you need bishops once you lose the two rooks the rook needs help rokang got help and mamajarov uses the threat of the constant attack to get this down into an end game where he is completely winning due to his past pawns and we need four c6 there's just absolutely nothing to be done queen e7 is a beautiful final move sacrificing the queen yes you can make a queen but i think mommy dr would have promoted to a knight so mommy tariff wins in the armageddon a very very fun game where he waited for his opponent to castle and sacrifice the g pawn maybe you guys can play like my mediaf now there was a game decided in the classical portion all right this was farouza versus gukesh two of the young superstars of the tournament and they went directly into the italian now ali reza is originally from iran but he lives in france and he loves the italian and they said they're saying right now that actually ali raza despite having the fastest rise to 2800 of any person who has ever existed on planet earth alireza is more interested in fashion i mean what a flex like imagine being like the lebron james level prospect of chess like lebron was sought after by everybody high school prospect never went to college lived up to all the hype ali raza is that for chess now imagine you are that for chess and then you step away and you're doing fashion in france i mean it's incredible stuff but he loves the italian and he's really good at it plays d3 plays c3 a little bit later with ideas of d4 with ideas of b4 the italian is very subtle opening you know hints of flavor and so on and so forth knight to f1 rotating the night over this way with the potential to expand on the queen side if he really wants it but it is actually gukesh who's sort of restricting that area of the board as you can see from the time spent by the players both of them have all of this in their preparation they are not thinking on their own whatsoever yet fairuza plays bishop b5 he is now in fact thinking on his own a3 clearly gukesh is still not clearly gukesh is still not bishop going back to c4 now after 11 minutes of thought not the most accurate move but it's time for gukesh to think surely he spends four minutes i don't think he's thinking i think ukesh is still very familiar with the plans of the position he puts his knight on g6 after some five minutes of thought and he has a 17 minute time advantage it's a very very close position very locked position there's no pawn breaks in the position so gukesh decides i'm gonna play c6 and i'm gonna play d5 and i'm going to make a pawn break in the position a very interesting moment farusha can take he can also play no less than like eight different moves the computer likes c4 with the idea of c5 the computer like c4 with the idea of cd computer likes queen c2 and bishop two it likes a lot of different things computer doesn't really like bishop e3 but it doesn't mind the move bishop e3 i mean short of white like hanging a queen somehow i mean you could probably even get away with queen e2 farusha plays edie okay now gukesh plays knight d5 he plays knight d5 because i think he kind of has a long-term prospect of not wanting to take back with the pawn i mean you can but i kind of think that he would enjoy taking back with the queen potentially so knight d5 keeps the center more open the queen now has opportunities to pressure d3 perugia plays bishop d2 defending the pawn on c3 and goes knight h5 and it's very clear from farrugia's last couple of moves that you know he's taking over okay he has outmaneuvered good cash the last few decisions were maybe a little bit dubious d4 good pressure c4 ideas bishop staring down over there knight just this knight is just sort of hanging out on h5 like causing problems it's like the kind of crazy person that's like always outside of your apartment building and this is very much a new york thing and it's like ah they're gonna yell at me you know but maybe if they know i'm a local they'll leave me alone he takes d4 and in this position knight takes d4 is an extremely natural move but here the computer finds bishop h6 the idea simply of bishop h6 is that if you take back queen d4 and like maid is shockingly difficult to stop in fact it's so shockingly difficult to stop you cannot stop it so i would just sacrifice my rook or even take my the knight and queen e5 and very very bad stuff is coming so the best move after bishop h6 is actually for black to maybe take on c3 or maybe to take on f4 and after knight c3 just queen d2 and apparently you know bishop g7 queen h6 is coming bishop takes h6 is an amazing amazing move but as you see from fairuzia's time he only spent about 20 seconds on the move knight takes d4 so either he already decided bishop takes h6 doesn't work or he never even considered it which is fascinating fascinating idea bishop h6 gh6 queen t4 and just go for mate now certainly he saw that but he probably rejected this because of some knight f4 and head spinning complications is basically every piece in this position is staring at one another and it's not to say by the way that after something like this bishop b3 queen b3 bishop f4 or even knight f4 like nobody is saying that this position is guaranteed better for white knight takes d4 knight back to g3 preventing mates a very very tense position ferrugia grabs the bishop activates his queen and here visually speaking after something like 95 i really like white's position i like his position because of the bishop i like his position because of the pressure of the queen not on the queen but of on the pawn this pawn is also kind of stupid looking i don't really understand what that pawn on a3 is doing it seems like black's position is is really after some accurate moves just completely on the verge of collapse but it's actually not so simple we need to and now absolute chaos ensues in this position gukesh plays knight takes b4 sacrificing his knight but with the idea to take this bishop ferrugia now finds a brilliant move-in response bishop g5 that is a sensational move what is it bishop g5 is something that we refer to as a desperado a desperado is not a full blunder of a bishop that's what you do a desperado is when you know you're going to lose a piece like this but you sacrifice the piece to gain some sort of quick advantage or long-term advantage and then you make the obvious recapture so rather than taking this first we give up the bishop like this now we are damaging black structure and now see before who cash now plays g6 which is a really weird move and it's basically just preventing anything from going to h5 alireza plays rook d1 giving up yet another queen side pawn so he is now down two pawns but he is not worse he is not worse and he can take back one of them immediately he can also play knight e4 but he has no way in so he goes here in h8 and now rook b1 and it looks like ali rezzo would like his investment back right now all right ali raza doesn't like the fluctuation of this chess stock market he wants to cash out immediately and he gets the pawn back right away here's the problem knight d3 the queen defends the bishop and these two are coming down this way the knight hits everybody as well it's a very unpleasant position and look at ferrugia's time can we back up for a moment ali raza firuja in this spent he had 22 minutes to make 12 moves he now has 148 now look i'm not a rocket scientist that does not look very sophisticated of a time management decision and farouza just game spins out of control he he he he just gets absolutely torn apart and he ends the game with a2 being a massive weakness but it's it's it's worse than that it's the point that anywhere the king moves a fork is coming so king f3 there is some queen f4 stuff with the rook if king h1 there's queen e1 and the bishop falls and gukesh beats perugia cash beats a 27.85 three points for gokash massive the next one i have for you wesley sohikaru nakamura it's the age-old tale their classical game was in fact a draw their armageddon game was sensational it's now time for the main course we have an italian we have an italian different to the last one here hikara was the one asking questions and he plays king h8 with the idea of playing f5 in the future and he will probably play that move knight g4 king h8 set up this move by unpinning the king knight rotates back to h6 hikaru plays queen f6 and knight back to g8 and it's just a matter of time he's just gotta make a few more preparations there it is f5 played now look at the time keep in mind that the game starts 10 minutes for white and seven minutes for black and it's five four and i got news for you folks it ain't getting any better ef5 bishop f5 wesley grabs the bishop pair but wesley spends 40 percent of his time on a backwards bishop move not only was that move a poor investment of time percentage-wise it was also not a good move forty percent of his time now he could have played bishop f5 he could have played rook c1 he could have played queen g4 here's the problem white cannot make a draw in the armageddon because white loses the armageddon right so white is playing for a win that is why wesley plays a move and frequently grandmasters will play moves in armageddon that might not necessarily be the best but they keep attention and if you take on e3 for example i will go here and even try to checkmate you for example ed queen d3 it's a very very powerful svichenzog and now this bishop is out and that pawn is very weak so he takes d4 played we have pawn takes and a massive exchange begins but wait a minute hikaru takes takes hikaru in this position could have taken with the knight he could have taken with the knight and he could have went for a good one for something that looks like this which is probably unusable now he decides to do it this way taking first with the bishop suddenly bishop takes f5 and hikaru could go here with this hanging and this hanging but he decides to go check wesley plays f4 check g3 and now kikaru doesn't have enough time to win the bishop so he does this and he's got six pawns to wesley's three and a very weak king a king that's on the verge of getting mated but queen d2 and the king is safe and rook f3 is very aggressive but queen g2 and queen f6 a fascinating position two of the best players in the world have two minutes and wesley is playing for a win because he has an extra night but hikaru has six pawns so who is really playing for a win all right i i mean i really i don't know my head is spinning this is a very very complicated position a rook trade now king h1 akikoro plays c6 he could have also played something like rook f not what he could have played he could have played rook f8 because after something like queen takes b7 it's actually queen e3 and it's hikaru who is completely calling the shots i mean if one king is weak here it's wesley's so that doesn't happen he plays c6 and then plays a little defensively a little bit defensively and we get this end game one minute each per player on the 40th move they gain an extra second good news is now both sides have made 40 moves and each of them will have an extra second only wesley is playing this for a win now how do you get this down closer and closer to a drawn end game for black you gotta trade the pawns with no pawns white can't win the only chance white has of winning this end game without black having a heart attack god forbid or i don't know falling asleep and losing on time is for white to win all of black's pawns and then promote rook e7 icaro comes with the pawns here's c5 here's rookie three we have one trade now kikaru needs to trade two more pawns c4 c3 e4 that's it hikaru's gotta secure it right here comes the king wait a minute wait a minute g5 suddenly hikar's got no way to protect his pawn on b4 whoa whoa no time on the clock he ends up playing c2 and b3 now hikaros chopped down the whole sign but it's a two on one it's a two on one 94 and hikaru could prevent rook c6 but rook b4 is also a nice move he goes back to b6 now stockfish is convinced this is holdable but after rook c6 i'm not so sure you can trade but maybe you can is this a draw for black i don't think so right he plays rook before targeting the knight now we have knight f5 and in this position hikaru just has the cold-blooded play h5 because after rook g6 check king f7 rook g5 there's this and this looks like it's winning for white it ain't that's a cold shower to play knight g3 but rook b2 check and it's a draw because if the king ever goes there and something like king f4 oops the root guards of the night the hikaru's last chance is h5 but with five seconds on the clock wesley's king marches up king g5 and there are checkmating possibilities and disaster strikes i see caro loses both pawns and like i told you in the very beginning the only chance that wesley house of winning this game is with the pawn and wesley wins the armageddon as hikaru resigns on move 68 crazy crazy stuff but if you had the patience to watch 20 minutes or maybe you skipped ahead to the magnus game nothing can prepare you for what you're about to see this is a rematch of a world championship match from 2018 played in london between fabiano caruana and magnus carlson and magnus plays e6 the french defense we gotta italian-american we got a norwegian we got a french on the board and they have history in england isn't chess such a beautiful global game and some idiot is making video about this in new york idea obviously d5 these two played the sicilian defense and paved so much new opening theory in 2018 but we have a french knight c3 is the classical variation now taking here would be entering the rubenstein potentially knight f6 is the classical french and bishop b4 is the win hour but it's very dicey playing this knight f6 played e5 is the main line knight d7 f4 big boy center here from fabiano caruana all of this has been seen before and now black chooses sometimes black plays queen b6 and goes for this sometimes black plays bishop e7 and castle sometimes black takes on d4 and puts something on c5 sometimes black plays b6 bishop b7 sometimes that plays a6b5 a6 fabiano spends a couple of minutes here and plays knight e2 it's not it's not the it's not the main line and queen d2 is a very very committal move here that's kind of considered mainline sort of threatening this you can also play a3 in some positions 92 is a very clear indication that tabiano has no plans to castle queenside why because after queen b6 what do you do you played b3 you're opening up the diagonal if you play rook b1 you're definitely not castling queen side queen d2 is an indication that you have plans of castling queen side than after something like b5 castles you know there's some unpleasant things that can happen here you have to be careful with white you have to make a few preparation moves so knight e2 queen c1 and fabiano is just trying to build a big pawn wall that is sort of his idea now as you can see from fabiano's time management he did not expect the french defense from from from magnus but fabi knows literally every opening so he clearly has something there and now g3 now this is the first time in the game that fabi spent quite a bit amount of time it's not because he didn't really know the opening it's because he's deciding what to do the players are sort of now entering deep territories like ponte c5 is some move there and there might be other plans but he does in fact play g3 and now f6 so magnus is threatening the integrity of the white center here he has achieved both c5 and f6 which are critical pawn breaks in the french defense and it's up to fabiano to decide what to do he can't take one he can take both he can take the other one but not take the other one or he'd do nothing he chooses to do nothing and once again he spends quite a bit of time 25 minutes went by now here fabiano considered ef6 he considered dc5 he considered one and then the other maybe one and then not the other you know he considered my dog is exiting the room as you can see he is really really unhappy with the french defense on the board he also definitely considered bishop h3 which is just a very clear and violent attack on black then he had to calculate cd4 and an fe5 and all these lines as well as f5 the fabiano chooses bishop g2 and basically says look magnus you decide and now magnus spends seven minutes takes in the center and this pawn structure as you get better and better at the game of chess you're gonna realize that a trade is not just stopping at one pawn one pawn equal trade things happen all right that trade opens the c file it also relinquishes defensive b4 and some queen side stuff so here comes queen a5 check now fabiano can block this with the knight with the bishop with the other knight he could also move his king he should not do this because it would lose him a queen okay so he plays here now that move destabilizes these squares but still gets the knight back into the game now here comes knight b6 from magnus now actually magnus has evened out the clock with fabiano and he has knight c4 in his mind bobby now no longer wants magnus to have this possibility so he decides to take on f6 why does fabiano take on f6 right now because magnus's options are limited they're limited he can now no longer take with the knight like for instance in this position fabiano probably would not have gone here why because of knight f6 so when magnus committed the knight to the queen side fabi decided to capture because magnus's options are to take with two pieces that have no real role in the game or to take with the g-pawn to try to play e5 but simultaneously weaken the king and block the pieces and create you know and isolate a pawn for yourself so bishop f6 and now b3 b3 is a very high level move which is why fabi spent some time on it it prevents this knight from coming forward at the cost of weakening dark squares right so at the cost of weakening some dark squares which is why bishop d7 and rook c8 are now on the mind of magnus and fabi just says i'm not concerned i knew that that was going to be your move i even knew that this was going to be your move and i got news for you queen d2 okay so you made a bunch of moves that improve your position now what magna says you know what you're right it should be seven i'm rerouting my bishop to this side of the board i no longer think that the target should be on d4 fascinating position what now this is like middle games 101 what now how do you you got no checks you got no captures that make any sense you got no attacking moves what do you do in this position like how do you actually play chess right well chess is a is a is a is a constant loop of having an idea evaluating the quality of the idea based on the multitude of opponents responses to that idea returning to the idea and either tweaking it a little bit or discarding it constantly this is how chess players think idea one idea two idea three depending on how many responses the opponent has to that idea you can reject it or you can work on it for example i have an idea to play knight takes d5 i can reject that very quickly for the fact that it loses a knight three different ways right but how about 92 is this queen trade beneficial for white why or why not well fabiano clearly took 20 minutes here so he knew what he was doing and the other question is what if there is no queen trade what if the queen you know slides forward or the bishop comes here or something else comes here magnus after thinking for five minutes decides to capture bishop takes d2 from fabi and now rook c7 very clear what he wants it's the double up and go over here so fabi meets him on the c file rook fc8 but now fabi gets a little a little something and it's the fact that this rook right now is stuck so fabi plays f5 and suddenly magnus's position is under some questions oh it is the bishop can go to f4 the move f5 is called a clearance move it's called a clearance sacrifice you're sacrificing a material to free up a square magnus responds virtually immediately with counter-attacking measures and what he's trying to do here is not just hope that fabiano sees the rook hanging like you doesn't see the rook hanging like you would it's trying to get the rook off of a stable square if the rook goes here nothing is guarding it tricks are possible you take the rook i take with check first you take this i take the rook so fabi just says okay you still can't really take this magnus because i'm gonna trap your rook oh magnus goes back to b4 and this move doesn't let the bishop move because of the rook oh we have fake take it seems like after some nagging magnus has figured out the position but he hasn't he hasn't you see the current position that we have the quality of these pieces we're all determined by the opening and the decisions that the players have made over the last some 15 moves and the verdict is this knight is too slow this night is far useful it's not that useful these pieces are a lot faster knight f4 and peek-a-boo two things see the bishop now 95 gallops in and pressure on d5 black does not have the time or luxury to take this because they're positioned completely disintegrates so 95 the computer in this position really liked rookie 5. but knight e5 played by fabi he is utilizing all five of his pieces he has targets magnus plays g6 and fabi plays g4 fambi's position is so beautifully coordinated here that every move magnus's position hangs on the knife's edge bishop e4 is the only move now basically saying look i'm happy chucking a pawn take take i'm happy chucking upon i might win one bank here and as you try to advance into my position maybe i'm gonna trade the rooks off fabi in this position very cool com collected a3 he could have also according to the computer played g5 which is a disgusting move and the point is just restricting the position he plays a3 magnus plays knight back to d5 we have rookie four and in this position magnus needed to play either rook c1 trying to trade the rooks and neutralize the white position trade knights replays the knight in the center welcome in this attack and maybe play rook c2 and get a counter attack of his own but magnus needed to relinquish some pressure he could not allow fabi to keep all his pieces on the board he needed to trade knights or trade rooks before engaging in further endgame battle he played rook c3 and he played rook c3 pretty quickly and suddenly the hammer came with knight d7 magnus did not quickly enough trade the pieces of fabiano and all of a sudden there are massive existential problems to the position if you take the knight i take this knight i hit the rook i threaten this the game is over if you take this knight i give you a check first then i recapture and then i continue my attack now still white is better but after rook c1 black is trying to hold white is better for sure but in the game magnus went here and now knight d5 knight d5 and a very simple rookie five what's so simple i don't understand the night just so what knight f6 check knight f6 check and magnus resigned because if something like king g7 white is just completely winning here white has a red carpet pawn to the end of the board white also has g5 and rook e7 and just a bulldozer on the seventh rank and magnus decided i'm not even gonna play the song after something like d5 if you try to stop the knight rookie 7 check d6 ideas it's game over fabiano caruana takes down magnus carlsen in classical and after one round he leads the field 3-0 for fabi we see all the other games that were decided in classical at the top and then we see the three decided in the armageddon so welcome to norway chess hikaru and magnus both losing in the same recap it's gonna be a fun tournament now get out of here
