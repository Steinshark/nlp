apple says that the iphone 13s have the best battery life of any past generation so in front of us right now we have every iphone apple sells right now the 13 pro max the 13 pro the normal 13 13 mini last year's iphone 12 the year before iphone 11 and finally the iphone se i've set them all to an equivalent level of brightness and also made sure that every phone still has 100 battery health or in other words lasts as long as it should last so let's see if apple was telling the truth the phone to beat right now is the galaxy s21 ultra which hit eight hours and 41 minutes okay we're unplugged we're on the way and i've structured this test to start with light social media move on to heavy gaming and then into one of the most taxing things you can do on a phone using the cameras now i think that with these iphone 13s it is more important than ever that apple delivers on its promise of more battery for three reasons one android flagships now almost consistently come with enormous size batteries two with last year's iphone 12 pros instead of actually improving the battery life from the year before apple reduced it from the 11 pros which actually meant they fell behind a little bit and three battery life is meant to be one of the main selling points of the iphone 13s and so if it just ends up similar to the 12s that wipes off a big potential reason that someone might have to upgrade but at the same time if apple has nailed it then they will have corrected one of the main barriers to owning an iphone we've not had a single year so far where i've looked at the entire iphone lineup and thought yeah all of these have really good endurance anyways interesting results so far we've had just under an hour but there is already a huge gap between these phones apparently the iphone 13 pro max is still on 95 not sure i completely buy that but it's definitely promising oh and thanks to surfsharkvpn for sponsoring this video the other thing that we need to keep a really close eye on is how the new 13 pro iphones perform versus the normal 13 and 13 mini because as you might know this year the pro iphones have new displays that can refresh up to 120 times per second as opposed to 60. however if not done right refreshing twice as fast can obviously be a huge drain on the battery and so we could well have a situation where the normal iphone 13s outlast the pro iphone 13s and that wouldn't be great in fact for all features that you need specifically on a pro phone i would say that none of them are as important as battery because pro users are going to use their phones more you just came in created chaos and left i'm not impressed pro users are going to use their phones more and more than likely they're going to use them for more demanding tasks like recording 4k footage and video editing can we just have a moment to appreciate how poor the battery life is on the iphone se i mean i guess if you had someone who literally just used their phone for calls it might be enough but this kind of battery alone is enough such that i wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone and i actually had a spare over an sc i was going to give it to a family member but then i remembered how poor the battery life was and actually decided it would cause them more problems than it would solve to check this though so far the battery lives are performing in exactly the order of the price of these phones and it's looking pretty promising actually as i was hoping the pro phones they are ahead which means apple has figured out how to add 120x refresh rates with little to no compromise and the fact that after three and a half hours the iphone 13 pro max is on over 70 percent i'm actually just realizing now that i may not sleep tonight this is the problem with battery tests the better the phones get the worse my life does okay so iphone se is dead i usually say that if a phone can get to five hours in one of these tests it means the battery life is good enough that you shouldn't have to worry about it less than four hours though is fair reason to worry don't get the iphone se and it also looks like the iphone 11 is following suit and to be honest in 2021 i don't think this phone is worth its asking price either like you can tell very easily compared to the iphone 12 and onwards the screen is low resolution it's only an lcd panel instead of an oled so colors aren't the best and the borders are just chunky the way that apple tends to work is every time they release a new set of iphones they will discontinue some of their previous ones that they think might overlap in terms of demand and then for the ones they keep they'll knock like 100 off the price so this iphone 11 for example released at 699 in 2019 it then got dropped to 599 last year and now it's sitting at 499. but the thing is this hardware ages much faster than the 100 cut compensates you for or in other words other phones have just gotten better okay how are we doing holy crud i've just realized something it's been over five hours and the iphone 13 pro max is still on over 50 percent that phone is on track to break every record we have ever had and while the iphone 12 is doing well pretty good this is quite cool the entire iphone 13 lineup is outperforming it including the mini the battery life is the single main reason that i never even considered using the 12 mini i mean i probably still won't use the 13 mini i like big phones but it will probably be enough to remove my inhibition from recommending it so right now on this test we have reached the camera stage so to start with i was taking photos on each phone then i started recording 1080p video on each phone and we're just finishing off now with 4k video on each phone i don't think the iphone 12 enjoyed that too much oh i do want to point something out here while i remember though it's got nothing to do with batteries but which one of these iphones looks like it has the slimmest bezels it's the normal iphone 13 right and the reason for that is that the outer rim of apple's phones the band of color around the sides it extends all the way to the edges of your screen on the front and so if you pick a darker color all it does is make your screen bezels look thicker because you've just effectively got two black layers around your display also the lighter colors are much better at not showing fingerprints so yeah i strongly recommend going light okay the thirteen mini has just conked out i'm gonna fast forward this test now so we can get to the results quickly while we do that final time i'm mentioning this i have bought 10 iphone 13s myself to give away to you rules for that are in the description i am kind of at a loss with this 13 pro max i'm now convinced that this is going to beat the current record of 841 it's just more a question of by how much and bear in mind that on this test every phone has had wi-fi on bluetooth on brightness high and speakers at 50 volume in this 13 pro max specifically is in a league of its own in 25 left after over seven intensive hours what am i even gonna do with that much battery i've literally had to reschedule my plans for the evening because of how long i've just realized i'm gonna be sitting here and do you want to know something really crazy this is the first test i've ever done where the timer phone has also given me a low battery warning anyways here we are so the first phone to finish was the iphone se with 3 hours and 38 minutes i would feel uneasy recommending this phone the only possible scenario i can think of is potentially like a grandparent or someone who is trying to upgrade from a really old iphone like an iphone 6 and who absolutely needs to have a physical home button now then we have the iphone 11 it is over 40 minutes ahead which is a very significant jump but still falls below that five hour mark a long story short i think if your budget doesn't stretch to over 500 you should probably stick to android you can get a really solid samsung xiaomi or oneplus for that price but then the iphone 12 is leagues ahead it beats the iphone 11 in battery by over one and a half hours putting it comfortably in the category of good solid battery life and more or less rendering that phone redundant when you factor in all the other improvements too that said the fact that this new iphone 13 mini lasts a whole half an hour longer than the regular size 12 actually makes me want to say that between these two this phone just makes more sense they're exactly the same price and yes this mini is a compact phone but apart from screen size it doesn't have any of the usual trade-offs that come with being smaller and it's actually the more powerful longer-lasting phone with better cameras you can also buy the iphone 12 mini right now for a hundred dollars less but i really wouldn't this is where things get really interesting because the normal iphone 13 is a lot better than i thought it would be i've had plenty of top-end flagship phones that are in this bracket are between seven and eight hours and so the fact that apple's base iphone can now match that i think changes the entire narrative it's not just a case that you won't have to worry about battery life here it is more that it will actively impress you and looking through apple's past lineup that's not happened very often but it gets better the iphone 13 pro took that and then added a whole 32 minutes of screen on time to it but that puts this in the top five to ten phones i've ever tested and it greatly outperforms its dimensions i'm also just relieved because last year the iphone 12 actually outlasted the 12 pro which really just didn't sit right with me they sorted it this time and then finally you've seen it yourself this one is just nuts let me just establish something here the way that i rank phones on these tests is if you can get over five hours good solid if you can get over six hours that is great battery if you can get over seven really great battery it has gone above and beyond if you can get over eight though incredible the top tier you will definitely notice how it never seems to run dry okay the iphone 13 pro max lasted just under 10 hours this is not just the highest score i've ever recorded it is miles ahead of anything else and even though yes each battery test does run different apps and you can't make 100 direct comparisons it is far enough ahead that i can say for sure this is the king okay at this point i probably don't need to tell you what a vpn is if you want to either browse the internet anonymously change the location of your device to another country to watch tv shows from that country or avoid censorship or even just to escape data throttling from your internet service provider then a vpn is the way to go but then you're faced with a question of which one and from what i've seen at least there is no other vpn that's offering close to what surfshark is unlimited number of users and 24 7 support for this kind of price if you use the code boss you get an 83 discount as well as three months for free and that takes it to just 2.49 a month i spend more on paper clips than that oh yeah and it also has the option to remove ads and trackers while browsing to check out my iphone 13 pro max camera comparison that's up here or for the full unboxing of every iphone 13 that video is here my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss i'll catch you in the next one
