so i had the chance to go down to gauchong for the third meet greater south conference and i had a good time i think it was interesting to see the changes that taiwan south is going through as they tried to adjust to new technology trends i attended the event the first time back nearly two years ago in december 2021 and what jumped out at me at the time was that there was a lot more larger companies than actual small startups companies like china steel and donghua telecom brought their technologies to demonstrate their abilities and chops i think china steele brought a metal working robot this year we have more small businesses and i think that adds a bit more buzz and energy to the atmosphere also there are more people here especially foreigners last time i went the covet protocols were still in effect so it was not as busy i had interesting conversations with several small businesses like uf meow which makes cat variable furniture and earthbook which makes digital twins of locations for simulations taiwan southern economy is mostly agricultural with heavy industrial interests i liked seeing new data in ai-based applications for agriculture or heavy industry or automation options for tackling worsening societal issues like population aging for instance i saw an interesting tainan based company called air eco which is trying to make a product to revolutionize recycling and embrace resource generation their first product seems to be a vision ai picker arm trained to pick up specific bottles i haven't really done much reading into the sector of the world yet but it seems pretty new and interesting but the co-founder cto talked of an intriguing vision about products that can help better enable recycling at the household level i didn't quite understand what he meant but it seems fun trying to figure out what can be recycled or not in taiwan is the world's biggest chain of if else statements i also got the chance to talk to kuby's co-founder and cto jocelyn ho ntu and stanford grad who worked at neta for a few years before starting kubi kobe is kind of like a sales crm platform built on top of whatsapp i profiled them in my previous video on meet taipei their office is near where i live and i've walked by it a few times i hope to have them on the startup island taiwan podcast down the line i'm not quite sure of any of these startups would interest silicon valley venture capitalists but nevertheless they're startups it's business generation and i like seeing young people going out and do things it was a great conference and an intriguing look at taiwan's often overlooked southern area they do it every year go check it out
