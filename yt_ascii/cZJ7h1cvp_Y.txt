i wanted i wanted to talk about this because this seems to be just like a crazy crazy take okay first off look at that guy's face okay i have never seen someone give like the the the the the face so accurately in my lifetime oh my goodness i love smelling my own farts this is so good like that that face is just like this is this is it this is truly it second off you don't know the face you know the face the face the the face that's the face of a conference speaker getting a stupid question emphatic statement there are no programmers in 5 years type one in the chat if you believe this statement i'm actually just curious don't troll no trolling i want to see it one one in the chat if you believe this statement i see nobody can follow instructions literally no one can follow instructions gosh i hate you guys so much i swear to i swear to i h e double hockey sticks people we're going to do a poll all right twitch let's see this dude nan you guys suck no programming in 5 years yes no i i'll put some let's see greatly changed mild changed greatly changed no real change there we go i figured that's probably a little bit more realistic is that there's going to be change options out of order exactly i'm curious what people think pull for youtube no okay so see youtube you're already making me upset youtube i'm letting you out i'm letting you out we demand rights okay i appreciate that that guy that guy you deserve to be on twitch all right all right so let's see we got we actually have a few people four people think that there will be no programming in 5 years wow wild five people i think some of those have to be trolls i think at least one of them is real so i'm going to give you like my general take on this one which is i really by the way i hope on the box art we just get this guy's face i just want this guy's face i want this as a box art i i'm going to take this as a box art by the way haley free box art let's go i would say that in the next 5 years if you aren't deep diving and being something more than a react script kitty if you aren't understanding your terminal understanding vim becoming the best you can be becoming the person that can do stuff that's really deep and difficult i would say that yeah you're probably going to be obsoleted pretty quickly okay next 10 years yeah but if you're the one that can figure stuff out and you go deep you're going to be the one that's not obsolet you should figure out how to become an amazing programmer you should at some point tweak and argue about things you at some point should really go after stuff this is already true no it's not true right now there is so dang much effort that is still needed right people should always have a backup plan if the world could get rid of all programmers there is no backup plan what do you mean what's the backup plan playing video games like that's the reality is if if we could do that no you wouldn't even be plumbers plumbers wouldn't even be needed right nothing would be needed everything would just be automated the robots would build the robots doing everything we need need them to do until the person who owns it decides they don't like a certain set of people anyways i think that's i i mean to me that's the more scary part of all this kind of stuff is that when all this happens and everything becomes automated and the robots are walking around all over the place the reality is is that some company is going to own it they're going to have the greatest amount of power ever just sitting in every last person's house right like to me that's the more scary set of things right the scary set of things is that as far as this goes like when like when this does happen honestly whatever things you have concerned about and all that life will be so different having a second profession in the bag does not matter okay it's not going to matter it's just not and it's silly to think it will right just use vim enjoy your life argue about what you want to argue about enjoy what you want to enjoy if you're a n9 to- fer clock in clock out if you are somebody who wants to go deep and become extremely useful be that person okay cu if you're just if if you're going to base all of your decisions off of a potential future at some point that may or may not happen you just got to realize like that's like one of the worst ways to live your life okay don't plan on skynet plan on like like what's the next three years look like plan on that it'll be great that's how i look at it i want to try to maximize my ability to work at my job to enjoy the time with my family to deepen my expertises and that's that right like that's what i want to do that's it the name i'm not nearly as blackpilled as this right i'm just going to enjoy i'm just going to enjoy the things that have and become awesome at what i do and i'm going to try to build my craft and become good at it and even if even if i don't have a reason to build stuff i will build stuff out of the enjoyment of building something you know what i mean enjoy enjoy a jen
