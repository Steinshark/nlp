if you are relying solely on motivation to 
achieving your goals i can guarantee you are   going to fail there is so much more you need to 
motivation and the number one thing is discipline   as someone who has been there when it came 
to teaching myself how to code starting a   business getting my first big tech company job 
i can guarantee and tell you firsthand that i   needed so much more than motivation in order to 
achieve my goals today we are going to be talking   about just that how to get past the motivation 
and really focus in on the discipline and i'm   going to share with you different tips i use to 
stay disciplined if you haven't already make sure   to hit that subscribe button for more tech and 
coding related videos and okay let's get started okay we are going to sit down and 
really get into this how i really   focused or realized to focus more on discipline 
versus motivation and i see so many people put   all of their focus into motivation and then when 
they don't feel motivated which is inevitable   they end up giving up and failing and i see 
this way too often i get messages around this   even about people being like i don't feel 
motivated today i can't work i can't focus   yeah i'm not surprised because there is so much 
more to it than motivation the first tip the   first thing i really did to focus on discipline 
and really stay disciplined is recognize and   identify my weaknesses identify when i am least 
productive in the day at least want to work and   for me that was about i would say 3 p.m onwards 
i'm being totally honest i love to get up super   early and that is when i'm most productive that 
is when i can focus and in turn that is when it's   easiest for me to be most disciplined so the 
first thing you really need to do is recognize   what works for you and what doesn't work for 
you and work around that too often we try and   fit in i would say it's a society standards of 
you need to work nine to five or you need to   take lunch at noon or different things like 
that and i know these are silly examples but they   are very real examples when i'm saying that do 
what works best for you don't worry about what you   think you should be doing if you are someone who 
works best at 2am in the morning then work at 2   am in the morning obviously if you have to get up 
for a day job that could be a little challenging   but you get my point know when your weaknesses 
are and work around them don't try and fight them   and do what you think you should do but just know 
when you are least likely to work least likely to   be disciplined and flip the script the next thing 
for me that really helped was setting small goals   and i want to clarify what i mean when i say set 
small goals because when i would say when i used   to set small goals i would set goals that were 
small but still too big and i think this is often   done in many areas when whether we are building 
a project or coding a project whether we are   just taking on some new kinds of work we think 
oh i can do that it's pretty small whatever amount   of small you think you are taking on reduce that 
in half make that even smaller and i'm saying that   because we as humans too often think that we can 
take on more than we can and think it's smaller   than it is and it turns out to be way bigger the 
problem with that is we become so overwhelmed that   we end up freezing and in turn doing nothing so 
for me what i do is if i know i need to achieve   a goal or i am focusing on a task that needs to be 
done and i have no motivation and the only thing   left is discipline is i will break down my my goal 
into tasks and then from there i will break them   down even further and this may seem extensive to 
some or like why are you doing all this work you   know just focus on your goals just start working 
but in turn what it does is it allows us to have   those our brain to have those small moments 
of rewards when you complete a small task so we can still get the task done but then what 
we do is allow our brain to still subconsciously   get those moments of rewards or those moments of 
feeling really good we're like yes i achieved that   i got through that i'm this much further in the 
goal so really recognize how to set smaller goals   set them even smaller and then allow yourself 
your brain to have those moments of rewards and   maybe you're sitting here thinking tiffany i 
don't need my brain is i don't care if i get   those small rewards i'm telling you as a human 
and just like how our brain works we do care   our brain loves that feeling of accomplishment 
or like we achieved something so having these   small goals will really help that okay so the 
next thing that you need to do once we have   really recognized our weaknesses we have set 
small goals what's the next thing we need to   do well for me it is having visualizations and i 
used to really not think i was like ah this is so   hippie this is so like this isn't what i'm about 
you know like having all these manifestations   and visualizations but you know what really helps 
is being able to visualize or write out on paper   something to have in front of you what you are 
working towards what your goals are and that   really helps you stay disciplined because it's 
easy to lose sight of what the end goal is and   what you are achieving if you aren't constantly 
reminded of it so for me what i literally do is   i will share it on screen here i'll get really 
personal with you is i actually have a vision   board on my phone my phone's background that i 
look at every time i look at my phone which we all   know we all look at our phones way too much and 
what it does is it reminds me subconsciously every   time i look at my phone that this is what i'm 
working towards these are a few of my goals and   in turn it just kind of is so ingrained in me 
that my actions throughout every day are working   towards those goals so i'm just doing my nightly 
walk with the boys they were out all day so it's   really just to get me out of the house after being 
on the computer all day oh it is so bright here   let's see if we can go somewhere that is a little 
less right but i really wanted to finish filming   this video and speaking to you about really the 
importance of discipline and the importance of   having tools to stay disciplined because just 
like motivation goes away you need tools to stay   disciplined or it's going to going to come and go 
as well and i think one of the biggest things that   we haven't spoken about yet really is this it's 
probably my favorite trick and what it is is i   see a lot of times people always telling others 
of what they're working towards what their goals   are and i always kind of shake my head because 
what that does and it's proven i don't know   if i can show an article here of where i read it 
but it's actually proven that the more you tell   people about your goals and what you're 
working towards it already what's the word   it already like celebrates in your brain or 
gives you those positive reinforcement that   hey you know when people are like that's amazing 
you're working towards this you're going to be   great at it you know you're going to achieve 
it and in turn because your brain has already   had that confirmation and praise it actually 
demotivates you or really helps you enables you   to not focus on what you are working on as much as 
if you were actually just to keep quiet put your   head down and work towards your goals so one of my 
biggest takeaways or biggest pieces of advice that   i would give you is keep quiet about your goals 
and what you are working towards because just let   your actions speak for your themselves and i think 
that's a really big thing that a lot of people   forget to do too often is just keep quiet 
and let what you are doing speak for yourself   themselves actions because in turn you're going 
to be so motivated and find that discipline to   really achieve what you're working towards because 
you know that you aren't telling people about it   but they actually have to see what you are doing 
which i think is a really good way to go so that's   one of my biggest pieces of advice actually it's 
really cool so i'm in a park right now and i   think you're setting up for a pretty big festival 
going on i'll show you here this is totally not   related to the video but kind of interesting 
this is the park we always walk in and as you   can see they're setting up a bunch of tents over 
there i don't know what is going on must be for   a festival there's oftentimes like festivals 
that go on in here so we'll see what it's for   then we've got mugs here harry here the whole 
crew i will end the video at that though that   motivation will come and go and i'm so tired of 
hearing people i'm not tired but i'm you know   people saying how do you stay motivated how do 
you work so hard towards your goals and how do   you achieve all your goals well there's no secret 
to it it's just staying focused being disciplined   and having the right tools a lot that i spoke 
about to keep disciplined and there's going to   be days and moments when you don't want to do 
anything and sometimes you have to listen to   your body and actually not do anything but 
other times you have to know when you need   to push through that in order to to get further 
along okay i will end the video there i hope you   enjoyed it and found it valuable and helpful 
to really hear about how i stay focused and   on track for my goals and achieving them if you
