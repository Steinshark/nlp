it wasn't too long after i watched the video that you did on discrete cosine transforming and i was thinking about how music has patterns in it and of course life imitates those patterns you get them with with number sequences within flowers and stuff like that i was thinking about how a really nice picture how that could be translated to a piece of music and whether there was any kind of like correspondence between the patterns within a picture and the patterns within music it was one of those moments late at night where i just sat down and thought let's just do something you know and that's that's the great thing about programming is you can just sit down and go let's see what happens i had this idea that you could turn pictures sort of standard bitmaps or jpegs or whatever into music and i didn't quite know how i was going to do it whether i was going to use chords or get it to produce chords and different multi-layer instruments or just a single tune so i think what i did is i just just went straight in for it i thought i'll get a picture and i'll see what i can do with it excuse my drawing so if this is the picture and i'm sure you all know it's separated into a grid of pixels i started in the top left with the first pixel and numbered them on the way down so they work their way down the column and then it would go back up to the top there and that would be the seventh one that would be the eighth one that'd be the ninth one and so on so in each pixel you've got the red the green and the blue and then what i'm going to call l which is like the luminosity how bright it is and by using those four things i decided what sound i wanted to get out of it basically so i generate a wave based on the information that i got from that pixel so the red component was the length of the note so if that pixel there had a lot of red in it it would be a really long note and if it had no red in it it would be a really really tiny note i didn't let it go to zero the smallest it could be i believe was 255th of a quarter of a second which is again arbitrary amounts i was just making this up i mean it really was there was no there's no science to it as such i was just thinking i wonder if i multiply the blue by this and do whatever and it ended up sounding nice so the green channel was the octave it was in a standard concert pitch a note the note a is 440 hertz the octave below it is 220 hertz the octave below that is 110 hertz so you halve it or you double it each time so it's a logarithmic scale it's not straightforward so that that decided the octave and the balloon decided the note within the octave each octave has 12 notes and then there's several octaves so if you get let's say an a1 the octave up from that will be the a2 and then the a sharp one the octave for up from that will be a sharp two but there will always be 12 notes in each octave so with these three values the red green and blue values which you can get from a pixel i got the length the octave and which note within the octave i was going to use and then the last thing was the luminosity which is how bright something is now i think you've covered this in another video you can sort of get a level and say that green is twice the brightness of red and blue so you kind of halve the green value and you get what you call a perceived brightness level of it and that said to me how loud the note was so something very dark would be very quiet or the other way around something very very dark would not have a huge amount of red green or blue so it'll be a very very low note with very little length and very little loudness it's almost like it might not be there which and the brighter the picture the the longer the whole thing becomes you get more length on the note you get higher notes you get more variation in the tones between them and it becomes a lot louder the only thing i did then was i wrote something which then took that note and fixed it to a scale so i wanted to so this is to do with this is how to do with making it sound musical you know sometimes you've got 12 notes of the scale and sometimes you put those two notes next to each other and they sound quite horrible so i wanted to limit it to sort of seven notes which made it a major scale or a minor scale it's a bit like they do with vocals with auto-tune someone sings out of tune and then it moves it to the nearest note so after after because i'm assuming if you hadn't have done that that it could have sounded like a chimpanzee falling on a piano it would have sounded interesting i'm sure but i limited it i mean i did that afterwards i produced some stuff and i just thought i'll have a listen through to that and it didn't sound as nice as if i restricted the restricted the scale down a little bit so that was almost like a side chain i produced the frequency and then i just sent it off to a function which did something and then brought it back and i could change that function depending on what vibe i wanted in the music and that was that was something which i haven't put on the website i put all the code for this on my website with the exception of that bit because i thought that's more down to the person that's composing the piece of music you know you can limit the scale and decide what what you want and what you don't want based on your own choices you know i've done 90 of the way but so i ran through i picked some photos on my original pixel noise music i did it with six photos for this one here i thought the first thing to do let's grab the computer file logo and run that through the first thing i did was shrink it down to a smaller image because a big image can produce quite a long file i mean something which is maybe 90 pixels by 50 pixels if it's quite bright will produce an 11 12 minute wave file and yeah 11 12 minutes of something going like that can be a little bit dull this is a classic example of what i was talking about earlier where you don't get much data as you can see here there's a lot of black pixels and then there's only really one color coming through although there are shades little bits of red and little bits of blue in there so it wasn't going to produce anything which sounded particularly musical in the same way that you discussed that jpeg compression works better on natural images and not on text and stuff like that the same is true with this it produces better results from photos things that are actually taking they've got a natural shading or whatever then something that's a piece of text that's that's that's not i don't know it's not nature in any way it's not natural anyway so let me play you the result for that if i minimise this for a second it is going down and getting almost no data from the first column almost no data from the second column by the time it gets here you've got a tiny little bit there and then it goes across there and makes a noise that goes across there and then you start getting two little bits two little bits next to each other and then you've got the same here and then you've got longer bits and then two bits with the gap in between and then of course the same reverse out it's very clearly in three sections and you can see the first bit with the bracket you can see goes there and then as it gets into the the two lines you can see it having having two bits of waves and then the c is there and then this one here is effectively a reverse of that one so this wave does quite nicely show the computer file logo but it's not that musical so that moved me on to my first computer which was an acorn electron and i ran this through because it's quite bright it produced a lot nicer result when you get into the keyboard make some make some more interesting tunes do you know what it reminds me of we did a sorting with music and graphics yes video on an acorn machine it was on archimedes i've got an archimedes a3000 upstairs these are the kind of things that when i'm bored i sit there at night i buy one on ebay oh 16 pounds i've got an a3 000 never plugged it in what am i going to do with it but so we're still hearing tones here so how then do you turn that into say something maybe a bit more musical what have you been doing okay i've got down here on the floor a whole load of guitar pedals that most of the time i use for playing guitar but i've put some delay on it if you don't know what delay is it's like an echo you know when you shout someone you hello and it comes back he goes hello like that and you hear it bounce around well you can artificially put that on things so it repeats itself and and sounds a lot bigger and you can put reverb on things to make it sound like it's in a big chamber and of course you can distort things and one of the fun things about using things like valve amps and pedals is whatever is the amount of distortion you can put on stuff and distorted guitar so that's when it sounds fuzzy right fuzzy it just makes it sound sound more more rock and so all those big guitar solos that you know from from all the classic rock tunes are all really really distorted a lot of the time so if i play you what this electron picture sounds like with distortion and delay on if i skip it on a bit i've just put in some drum loops so then you can start just improvising over the top of it i know out of the original 40-odd minute piece of music there's a few moments in it that i think could be turned into quite nice songs and i probably will extract those moments i won't keep it true to using the whole picture i'll just take out the little melodies i like from the generated wave and then i'll loop them round and make songs out of them so i think from that point of view it was valid to do to go through the whole thing to lift something that might make two songs now if you were coldplay for example and you were spending a year doing an album considering i did this in a couple of evenings you know to produce a 40-minute piece of music that might inspire two songs is really not that you know it's not that crazy to do you know pink floyd spent years well not years but months and months and this year recording household objects you know pinging elastic bands and stuff like that trying to get some inspiration for the album that eventually became wish you were here so some people got it and went wow this is amazing but the people who didn't like it tend to put it on and listen to the first minute or two and go this sounds like nonsense to me and then turn it off and i'd say i mean it's no different to a bit of software if you download a bit of software and try it and you can't get your head around it within two minutes and you just go oh that's rubbish i'll throw it away and i understand most people don't have 40 minutes spare in their day to sit and listen through to a load of synthetic nonsense that i've produced and i don't expect them to but some people do you know and that's that's the joy of creating something that is attempting to be brand new is that you know it will get and someone retweets it and someone else goes and of course this in itself you've picked up me and we're doing this and someone else might listen to it and you know it might get 500 plays it might get 5000 plays one day who knows i mean it's not that's it really so the number of slices per second that it does is the sample frequency and obviously the more of those you put in per second
