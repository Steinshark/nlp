type in usb cable dongle or flash drive on amazon and your eyes will be assaulted with products from hundreds of companies some well known others not so much what is a cute so how exactly do you know which ones to trust and spend your money on this is a question the usb implementers forum tries to help you answer with its special certification program in case you didn't know usb if is responsible for developing the usb specification it's kind of like a blueprint that all usb gadgets are supposed to follow but what's the difference between a certified and non-certified product and why does it take so long for certified options to show up when a new lightning fast usb version hits the internet along with hot takes about its naming scheme to find out we spoke with jeff ravencraft the president of usbif so he's kind of like the head of the usb universe and we'd like to thank him as well as joe balik for helping us out with this episode so usbif certification process is voluntary but many companies choose to pay and have their products certified to gain a leg up on competitors they get to use one of those little logos you've probably seen on product packaging before and also they benefit from usb if's advertising which tells customers to look for that logo when shopping online in 2021 those ads got over 305 million impressions and if even a small fraction of those customers are convinced to buy a certified product instead of a non-certified one that's a big difference in sales but the usbif certification process involves more than just taking money to slap on a sticker testing is required to ensure the product is built to spec and won't unexpectedly give you poor performance or be shoddily constructed companies such as underwriters laboratories contract with usbif to do the testing and these companies also have to submit to audits to make sure the testing is being done done correctly testing the testing you know otherwise it is really is really a test the uspif also runs special workshops where products from member companies can be certified as well as the platform interoperability lab in oregon where lots of big industry players like intel and amd have their products tested while they're still in development to ensure proper operation or as i call it properation but the certification process can take quite a long time which you've probably noticed if you're looking for a certified product compliant with the latest and greatest spec so why does it take usb gadgets so long to get certified or even to come to market in the first place we'll tell you right after we thank freshbooks for sponsoring this video when building a business it's easy to feel like there aren't enough hours in the day and if you're doing all the invoicing and accounting on your own you're probably spending too much time on paperwork freshbooks is the all-in-one accounting software that can save you several hours a week that's more time to spend nailing a client pitch serving your customers or just enjoying the company of those you love and right now there's a special offer just for our listeners head over to freshbooks.com techwiki to get 90 off your freshbook subscription for four months now it turns out that once a new spec is published it typically takes manufacturers 12 to' months to start getting products on store shelves so part of that delay has nothing to do with the certification process itself it's not their fault additionally although the spec gives companies a blueprint as to how to properly implement the new version of usb the certification process actually has to get developed after the spec comes out since as companies find quirks and snags with a new revision testing protocols get designed to make sure those things don't end up affecting the final product but if you can't wait for a certified version of the power adapter or external ssd or eyeballing how do you know if a non-certified product is any good i mean almost 3 billion usbc devices have been shipped in 2022 so as many good products as there are out there there's also a lot of crap to sift through as well the answer is actually quite simple try to buy from brands you trust and thoroughly read reviews especially if it's a more expensive purchase but if you can it's typically safer to buy certified especially as the usbif is finally ditching those terrible labels that say things like usb 3.2 gen 2x2 and just putting usb with the speed beside it wow and that's fantastic because one thing is easy to understand for even the most technically challenged among us bigger numbers are better i love those big big beautiful numbers there they are and thanks to you big beautiful viewer for watching like the video if you like it dislike it if you disliked it check out our other videos comment below with video suggestions don't forget to subscribe and follow techwiki or a youtube channel and we also upload other places too check it out
