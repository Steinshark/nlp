let's go to the board okay that was nice for 10 seconds what's up guys welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i won't bore you i do like to play the keys sometimes but it's time for a reddit review i felt like we had to reintroduce it because every time i tell y'all i'm going to do a bunch of reddit videos and i don't do them so i have to reintroduce the concept where you guys submit stuff to my reddit r copyzilla underscore gg and i get free content out of it and i get a laugh at it and you guys get your work featured so i think it's a win win what have you guys been up to what i want to know what i'm trying to figure out up first even youtube ain't what it used to be youtube someone replied to my comment thanks for your comment expert smith is carefully currently handling my crypto okay that's enough and it's a scammer guys i've like reported like 20 people 20 profiles of coffees that led to youtube i don't know how many more i can do waste so much of my time youtube doesn't care they really don't if you guys see those just do the report feature i do it every time let's see here oh wait what they're also actors that's a backstage profile is this real did brian rose hire out his whole i wouldn't be surprised honestly that would make so much sense by the way related to the brian rose content i can't do brian rose videos anymore because he he copyright strikes every single one it's absolutely insane i even posted about somebody else's coverage of brian i reacted to it and he copyrighted that so literally there's you can't talk about this guy he'll copyright claim every single one of your videos so sorry about no brian rose content recently he's just he's a total yeah anti-free speech when it comes to that the photo of the london real party tells you everything you need to know about brian's narcissistic personality that's how every photo of brian it probably is he's probably like get back i need to be in the i need to be the sitter focused oh my gosh how much do you think it pisses him off when one of his cameramen gets him out of focus for like three seconds he probably loses his mind dude brian drinks his own urine twice oh yeah i've seen this before this is just mind-blowing what is he doing so it's a little salty this is embarrassing i would never be seen in daylight again if i drink my own piss by the way i don't know if you guys know this i did place a whole bet on this on the brian rose london election i have big stakes riding on it now i've decided that if brian rose wins i will drink my own urine on camera that's right and as i just told you if that happens to me i'll never be seen again i would never be caught dead in public after having a video of me online drinking my own urine like unless you have to like if you're a bear grylls in the wild it's kind of like badass but if you're in your office peeing into a cup and drinking it purposely like i'm gonna not have too much but i'm gonna have enough yours foaming and all that that's disgusting i have committed me and amish my co-host on the trip which you can go subscribe to that channel we've committed to drinking our own urine if brian rose wins you know

certain amount of money like it's not about millions millionaires are fine multi-millionaires are fine when you get to the billionaire stage you start to lose like it's not brain cells because these people are often times very clever or smart but they lose like this level of self-awareness or care about what other people think because they're so rich but i don't think that you should lose all

grant cardone thinks he's everywhere that's the funny thing about these guys they sell ads for themselves constantly because they're not everywhere and they need they have to they can't get there organically they're constantly shilling ads stuff like that but grant cardone especially has such a like psychotic complex about this did you guys see the jordan belfort grant cardone interview i'll pull that up real quick literally this is one of my favorite moments from that epic i don't know if you want to call it debate or just grant cardone arguing himself into the dirt about like not no interest is interest or whatever but there's a moment where you know jordan belfort's asking about the 10x conference and grant cardone honestly believes in his heart of hearts that everyone knows about 10x everybody knows about him because he's such a big shot and this is like the psychology of someone who would make that video of like hey reddit i bet you're wondering who i am who's this guy you've been seeing everywhere look at this look at this psycho saying something right how about the how about the 10x conferences what do you know about what have you heard i don't know anything about
