this episode is brought to you by brilliant in 2020 the united states hit a record high in its yearly use of one of the most ubiquitous manufactured materials on earth cardboard with around 80 percent of all products sold in the united states being packaged in cardboard over 120 billion pieces were used that year in fact in 2020 alone over 13 000 separate pieces of consumer cardboard packaging was thrown away by american households when combined with all paper products this constitutes almost 42 percent of all solid waste generated by the united states annually however despite the sheer magnitude of this paper waste the vast majority of it is composed of one of the most successful and sustainable packaging materials of modern times corrugated cardboard known industrially as corrugated fiberboard this paper-based material that's made from a fluted corrugated sheet and flat liner boards is recycled more than any other packaging material in the united states as of 2020 just under 97 of all expendable corrugated packaging is recovered for recycling making this inexpensive durable material an extraordinary recycling success story modern paper-based packaging is the direct result of the convergence of three key technologies of the'00s the process for pulping wood the paper making machine and lithographic printing pulping wood involves cooking wood chips and sawdust in the presence of sodium hydroxide and sulfide liquor under high pressure to remove non-fibrous lignin separating the wood into cellulose fibers during the cooking process approximately half the wood dissolves and the remaining pulp is then washed screened for quality bleached and then dried into a fully white material this processed pulp is then used to produce paper paper making machines use a moving woven mesh to create a continuous paper web that aligns the fibers held in the pulp producing a continuously moving wet mat of fiber this wet mat is then dried to produce a strong paper web material known as craft paper by the early 1900s these processes had reduced the cost of paper enough to make it useful for a wide range of disposable packaging products simultaneously the demand for packaging was rapidly growing as the industrial revolution brought about an explosion in manufacturing and the distribution of consumer goods the invention of several paper-based packaging forms and processes stemmed from this boom with the corrugated fiberboard shipping container quickly becoming the most dominant the first known widespread use of corrugated paper was in the'50s with an english patent being issued in'56 to edward charles healey and edward ellis allen this early corrugation was formed using a fluted iron and its purpose was to make ruffled elizabethan collars as well as cushioning for men's hats shortly thereafter american albert l jones would be granted a patent for the first corrugated paper packaging material in'71. jones's design specifically employed corrugation to service cushioning for wrapping glass bottles three years later oliver long would patent an improvement on jones's design with the addition of an inherited single paper facing to prevent the unfolding of the corrugation forming the basis for modern corrugated fiberboard by'82 american robert h thompson would receive the first patent for a double-sided corrugated board material he would go on to develop machinery processes and various forms of wrappers based around corrugated paper the first corrugated board plant would be opened in'83 in london with a german plant following in'86 in kirchberg his company thompson and norris would maintain a manufacturing and sales monopoly on corrugated bottle wrapping paper for the life of his patent these early corrugated bottle wrappings were made from thin straw sheets that were dipped in water and then passed through heated fluted rollers a typical bottle wrapper was single-faced with excess facing extending past the corrugated paper to fold around the neck and at the bottom thompson's first double-faced corrugated product would use unrolled single face bottle wrappings that were pulled through a machine that applied both adhesive and the second liner by a series of brushes and cut the final product into sheets the process would later be improved with a step that piled dozens of sheets within a press setting the adhesives under pressure in'70 american robert gear a brooklyn printer and paperback maker had discovered that by cutting increasing cardboard in one operation he could make prefabricated cartons in a partnership with the thompson and norris company the concept would be applied to double-faced corrugated stock giving rise to the production of the first corrugated fiberboard boxes these boxes were first used for light express deliveries in new york city with wells fargo being one of the first successful adopters pleased with their performance wells fargo agents would go on to recommend the product to their shippers and by the turn of the century the corrugated cardboard box began replacing custom-made wooden crates and boxes previously used for trade in 1903 the first use of corrugated fiberboard boxes for rail transport occurred when the kellogg brothers secured an exception to the wooden box requirement by railroads of the central freight association this motivated nine major manufacturers of packaging products to unite in 1905 in an unprecedented cooperative effort between competitors forming an association called the corrugated paper patents company their goal was to standardize corrugated packaging and make it fully accepted by all railroads by 1906 the first specifications would be drafted and quickly adopted by both railroads and eventually most of the transportation industry modern corrugated fiberboard can be easily manufactured in massive quantities in a fully automated process many corrugation machines can produce as much as one thousand feet of product per minute this is achieved using just three constituent elements paper steam and an adhesive rolls of paper stock are first mounted onto unwinding stands and are pulled into the machine at the feeding side of the corrugator also known as the wet end the paper medium is heated to around 176 to 190 degrees celsius or about 350 to 380 degrees fahrenheit with pressurized steam at around 12.4 bar or'0 psi making it more flexible so it can be formed into a fluted pattern at the corrugating rolls the corrugating rolls are gear-like cylinders that are designed to shape the paper medium into a fluted structure as it moves through them as the newly formed fluted paper leaves these rolls an adhesive is applied to the flue tips and the first liner is roller pressed on the paper stock that forms this liner is often pre-treated with steam and heat before the binding process the combination of heat pressure and steam causes the adhesive to form a gel which creates a bond between the two papers this single liner corrugated medium is known as a single face web the adhesives used in modern corrugated fiberboard are typically water-based food-grade cornstarches combined with additives they offer excellent paper adhesion qualities while remaining both inert for food use and biodegradability in order to produce double liner corrugated fiberboard the single face web is then processed through a mechanism within the machine known as a double facer or double backer here a second liner is applied once again by adding adhesive to the fluted tips on the other side of the paper medium however this bond is formed far more gradually as the board passes over heated plates in a hot plate section this is done to prevent crushing of the flutes the double liner corrugated fiberboard produced at this stage is far too stiff to be rolled so it's cut into sheets that are matched to the customer's requirements these sheets are then stacked and allowed to rest in a heated environment for a predetermined period of time because of the added moisture from steam and the starch adhesives moisture changes in the curing phase must be closely controlled to prevent warping after curing the sheets may be coated with molten wax to create a water-resistant barrier if the packaging is expected to be exposed to excessive amounts of moisture such as with produce or frozen food products modern corrugated fiberboard is made primarily from fast growing pine with some of the larger packaging companies owning their own sustainable forests that are dedicated to packaging when trees are harvested only the trunk is used the pulping process begins with debarking and chipping of the harvested trees while the first packaging papers relied on the chemical based craft pulping process modern production relies primarily on mechanical pulping due to its lower cost and higher yield in this process the chips are forced against a revolving stone while being sprayed with water to remove the fibers however the trade-off to this process is that it produces a lower quality paper due to its inability to remove lignin though nearly all of the wood is usable giving almost twice the yield of craft pulping while recycled material can be used instead of virgin wood this tends to produce a lower quality paper because of this its use is generally limited to hidden parts of packaging products when a production run of corrugated fiberboard is done a target set of specifications based on customer requirements determine both the quality control and physical properties of the fiberboard some of these key metrics are the moisture content absorbability bursting strength compressibility dimensional accuracy and flatness moisture content in particular greatly affects the strength properties of the fiberboard as it deviates from a typical range of six to nine percent in order to achieve these specified properties the corrugated medium flute size adhesive and liner board configuration are varied flute size in particular forms the basis for most fiberboard specifications the most common flute sizes are designated a b c e and f or microflute with c flute being the most popular these designations specify the order that the flutes were invented and have no relationship to their size newer thinner flute configurations such as our flute are gaining momentum as their 30 lower weight results in lower supply chain costs and storage requirements ultimately most of the corrugated fiberboard that is produced is used for packaging specifically boxes while seemingly trivial designing corrugated packaging that is both economical and can survive the harsh environments of shipping while being suitable for marketing and consumer appeal is a challenging task faced by packaging engineers the most popular box configuration is known as the regular slotted container or rsc packaging pioneered in 1906 by thompson and norris rcs are characterized by having all flaps cut to the same length from the score to the edge with the longer major flap meeting in the middle other common box configurations are the full telescope design style container or ftd the wraparound blank the five panel folder or fpf the rolled entry with locking cover the bliss style and the pre-glued auto bottom with rse top flaps however as the retail environment continues to grow more competitive and packaging becomes a larger part of marketing more dynamic designs that deviate from standard shipping configurations are becoming more prevalent while it's common for box production to begin immediately after corrugation processing within integrated production plants some facilities known as sheet plants start with corrugated fiberboard sheet stock that is produced externally in both cases the corrugated sheets are run through a splitter scoring machine that scores and trims the corrugated stock into sheets known as box blanks from here the box blanks are then processed by a machine called a flexo or flexographic machine within the flexographic machine the final packaging product is created flexographic machines employ both printing dies and rotary die cutters on a flexible sheet that are fitted to large rollers as the box blanks are automatically fed through the rollers within the machine it is trimmed printed cut and scored in some cases further processing by machines that only perform one of these steps may occur additionally a machine known as a curtain coater is also utilized to apply a coat of wax for moisture resistant packaging these unfolded boxes are either assembled on-site or at the customer's facilities in a machine known as a folder gluer that assembles the final box the recyclability of corrugated containers is one of its main advantages over other packaging materials they can easily be compressed and build for cost-effective waste transport and processing corrugated waste is straightforward and relatively inexpensive the process begins with the build waste being shredded and put into a large vat of warm water known as a hydro pulper that both cleans the material and creates a pulp slurry from it the slurry is then run through multiple stages of screening to remove broken glass tape staples and other non-fiber contaminants finally the slurry is sent through an industrial magnet to remove metal contaminants chemicals are also applied to decolorize the mixture of inks within the slurry because the paper produced by purely recycled material will have a dull finish and poor wear characteristics virgin pulp is typically blended into the slurry to improve its quality this blended pulp is then directly used to produce new paper recycling paper based packaging is so effective that only 75 of the energy used to produce virgin paper packaging is needed to make new cardboard from recycled stock aside from diverting waste materials from landfills it requires both 50 less electricity and 90 percent less water to produce in fact it's estimated that recycling a single ton of corrugated containers saves 1.1 barrels of oil 390 kilowatt hours of energy expenditure and 5 cubic meters of landfill space in addition to the recyclability of paper the move to inks based on soybean oil and the use of biodegradable waxes and other eco-friendly coatings are becoming more popular in packaging manufacturing raising the bar even further for sustainability in the wake of a growing consumer appetite for more cardboard in the making of this video i found it astonishing how something so trivial and underappreciated as cardboard boxes took decades of experimentation and engineering refinement to perfect even today packaging engineers must strike a balance between cost manufacturability application effectiveness and
