today a seven billion dollar money laundering service just got shut down by the united states many crypto advocates say this is an attack against their privacy while crypto skeptics say it's about time as for my opinion i'm torn about tornado cash let me explain tornado cash is a website and smart contract that would describe itself as a privacy tool many people like myself who investigate fraud though have seen it used primarily as a money laundering tool but what's the truth well tornado cash is a bit of code that has one job it takes your money in and hides where it's going it does this by mixing it together with a bunch of other people's money thereby making it untraceable hence why tornado cash is called a crypto mixer which obviously if you're a criminal sounds very appealing because think about it on a blockchain where everything is traceable and public tornado cache represents a break in that chain which is why anytime there's a hack like for example the 620 million dollar axi infinity hack you'll usually hear the name tornado cash getting thrown around because that's how criminals hide their funds and because it's used by criminals so much the us treasury put tornado cash on a special list called the sdn list which is the ultimate banned list it's what russian oligarchs go on the ultimate blacklist at a party except that party is the global financial system and what it means is that everyone's forbidden from interacting with people or things on this list which means if you now send money to tornado cash you could be liable as a criminal and be put in jail for up to 30 years and so far all this makes sense right who doesn't want to put the bad guys away and stop them but what makes this story very tricky is that while the us government implies that only criminals use tornado cash that just isn't true anyone who wants to conceal their money might want crypto mixers and it isn't just the bad guys in fact according to chain alice's ten percent of the funds sent to tornado cash were stolen another 17 came from sanctioned sources which probably is a bit conservative but even so that means that 27 of these funds are essentially criminal but then the rest a lot of it is not criminal so why would a normal person need to use tornado cash well assuming most of us are past the fifth grader argument of if you have nothing to hide why do you need privacy it basically boils down to wanting the government and society out of your house your life and of course your money which is why there are many pro-privacy arguments to be made in favor of tornado cash and why it was helpful like just ask yourself assuming a crypto future where everything is on chain do you really want anyone to be able to see everything you buy do you really want that anime body pillow to be public information do you want your donation to a dissident political figure to be public do we really think that governments can always be trusted obviously the answer to all of those is no so now that we've gone over the negatives and positives of crypto mixers what do we do well the answers aren't easy because while crypto used to be the wild wild west if you actually expect regular people and grandmas to use it you have to take the scam and fraud problem really seriously and tornado cash is a huge part of that problem you can't just expect the government to sit back and watch as billions of dollars get sent through untraceable pools of money so there's a balance i think we're heading for like it or not and to be honest it's not perfect but here it is you fundamentally need the government to be able to investigate crime and you also need privacy for your citizens but ultimately this is not a binary it's a balance because this doesn't work if it goes too far in either direction if the government can just surveil people all the time theoretically they could fight crime perfectly but nobody wants a surveillance state and on the other extreme if the government could never investigate a crime because everyone had maximum privacy crime rates would skyrocket and nobody wants that future either so the balance has to be a reasonable expectation of privacy but if you're implicated in a crime law enforcement has to be able to investigate it and this is already how most of the world works your banks for example the government can't just search your accounts they need evidence and they need a warrant so you have a reasonable expectation to privacy but it's not perfect privacy and that's sort of the problem with tornado cash is that it's too good at its job there are no warrants available for tornado cash no investigation tools nothing that can trace funds sent through a mixer that money is gone even if you can 100 prove that it was stolen which is why i think the banning of tornado cash was inevitable like it or not the dream of perfect privacy just can't co-exist in a world where criminals will abuse that perfect privacy for fraud and scams now right as i was going to finish this video i did discover a final m night shyamalan twist to this whole saga the users of tornado cash have started to get a little sassy and started sending tiny amounts of eth to a ton of wallets including famous wallets like jimmy fallon steve aoki and logan paul presumably to make it so difficult to figure out who's the real money launderer is that it becomes impossible to implicate anyone now will all these crypto influencers go to jail for 30 years for this no obviously not but it is pretty funny and it shows that they can take away your right to buy an anime body pillow in private they can take away your right to money launder in private but they can never take away your sense of humor about it
