the most powerful naturally aspirated v8 engine in a production car ever hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to take a deep dive into the 2023 corvette z06 engine gm provided me with access to several of their engineers who developed this engine to discuss in great detail the inner workings the 5.5 liter naturally aspirated v8 engine is making 670 horsepower which is especially crazy when you realize that's more than the larger supercharged engine that it replaced so how in the world is that possible well we're going to cover all the details but i want to just take a moment to appreciate how cool this engine is so ultimately how much power you make with an engine is restricted by how much air you can shove into that engine so you shove a ton of air in the engine you put an appropriate amount of fuel with that air you ignite it boom and you make power and so what's really wild about this engine is that so the previous generation z06 had a 6.2 liter v8 engine this is a 5.5 liter v8 engine so both v8s but it is now smaller the previous engine had a supercharger putting in an additional 9.4 psi of boost so additional air shoved into that larger engine and yet if you look at the horsepower figures 670 for the smaller naturally aspirated engine it's reliant on the atmospheric pressure around it and it is making more power 20 more horsepower with a smaller engine at atmospheric pressure how so a big part of the story of this engine is how high it revs an 8600 rpm redline making peak power at 8400 rpm so i made a way oversimplified quick comparison between these two engines to help illustrate that point of how much air you can shove into an engine ultimately is going to help you determine how much power you can make and so if we look at our new corvette z06 engine well we are reliant on atmospheric pressure one atmosphere going within that engine cylinder we have 5.5 liters to work with so we multiply that together and we are revving to 8 400 rpm so if we look at how much air goes into that engine per minute well we take 8 400 rpm we divide it by two because we have one intake stroke for every two rotations of that crankshaft we multiply all this across and we get a number of about 23 100 liters per minute now if we look at the c7 z06 engine well we've got 1.64 as our pressure within those cylinders because we're adding in 9.4 psi of boost we multiply that by the size of the engine of course that's an advantage both that is an advantage of the pressure within it as well as the displacement however we do lose out a bit because the rpm is not a size so we're not sticking as much air per minute you know from an rpm basis as we're not revving as high so we multiply all that across and we get a number of 32 500 liters per minute which is still 1.4 times what we are doing with the c8 z06 so it still does have more air per minute and thus you would think okay well it's probably going to make more power right so what are the other factors that we're not considering well first of all temperatures so a supercharger is compressing air and as you compress that air it heats up so hot air has less density than cool air and a naturally aspirated engine is going to tend to bring in cooler air because you're not compressing it within that supercharger so because it's naturally aspirated the engine is going to be cooler it's going to have a bit better density so it's not realistic that we're actually going to get you know 1.64 cool temperature atmospheric pressure within it the pressure will be that but the temperature will be high so your actual density of that air isn't as high meaning the amount of oxygen you have to burn is actually less also with our 5.5 liter v8 in the new corvette we have a compression ratio of 12.5 versus 10 in the previous engine so that means we're squeezing that air and fuel more which gives you better thermal efficiency means you make more power and also this naturally aspirated engine even though there's just atmospheric pressure outside it's able to pull in just slightly more with some very clever tricks it's able to pull in slightly more air and so when you add that all up realistically what you get is this smaller higher revving v8 engine naturally aspirated making more power than the previous generation z06 now a defining characteristic of a high revving engine is often a wide bore with a short stroke and that is the case with this engine 104.25 millimeters across that cylinder and then that piston is moving down 80 millimeters this is a really high bore to stroke ratio i didn't do a ton of research but i looked at quite a few cars out there and i didn't see any that had a ratio this high as far as production cars and that short stroke of course is helping you to rev really high next let's talk about the engine's flat plane crankshaft so traditionally corvette engines have a cross plane crankshaft meaning the crank pins are split by 90 degrees these crankshafts are heavy because they have large counterweights to counteract the forces of the pistons moving up and down a flat plane crankshaft on the other hand has all of the crank pins on a single plane you might call it a flat plane the piston's primary forces are already balanced so the crankshaft is lighter overall which means it has less inertia and can rev very quickly so if you look at the rotating assembly of the new z06 you can see the forged steel crankshaft which is significantly lighter than the previous crankshaft design and you now have lightweight forged titanium connecting rods and the short height forged aluminum pistons so the whole idea of using a flat plane crankshaft and corvette's philosophy here is to remove as much reciprocating and rotational mass as possible the other advantage of a flat plane crank is how it impacts your firing interval as you can see on a cross plane crankshaft instead of the firing order always alternating from one cylinder bank to the other bank sometimes the same cylinder bank will have two cylinders fire before switching to the other now if you look at the new z06 you can see that firing order switches between each cylinder bank so it goes one four three eight seven six five two back to back each time and so this is ideal for intake and exhaust tuning and you can also see that you have this 4-2-1 exhaust so the two inner cylinders and then the two outer cylinders and if you look at this firing order you can see it alternates between these two sides as it alternates between the left and right banks and so what that does is it provides ideal exhaust scavenging by making all of those pulses evenly spaced now the way i've drawn it here isn't actually accurate if you look at the actual engine you can see that those are all equal pipe lengths leading into that four two one exhaust moving on to the valve train there is a lot going on instead of a single camshaft with two valves per cylinder now we have dual overhead camshafts with four valves per cylinder truly the future looking at the camshafts you can see they are hollow to help reduce rotational inertia these cam lobes directly act on the mechanical finger followers and there is no hydraulic component to this valve train this gives you very direct motion for the valves moving on to the valves you can see that they're using dual valve springs so each valve has two springs and so we have an engine here which has a really wide rpm range right and so if you're to hit the resonant frequency of one of those valve springs well with that spring resonance you lose control of the valve so they have two different size springs so you can maintain good control of that valve moving up and down across the entire rpm range so they have a larger spring for high rpm control and a smaller spring for low rpm control of course they're both going to be used at all times they're both always being compressed and released by that cam lobe however having both of those springs together ensures you don't lose control of the valve the intake valves are titanium and the exhaust valves are sodium filled to help dissipate that heat now you might be wondering if there's no hydraulic component to the valve train does that mean you have to manually adjust the valve lash over time according to chevy nope so there's a shim which you can see located between the tip of the finger and the valve stem all of these engines are hand built in bowling green kentucky but gm has automated the shim selection during the head sub assembly a robot will pick the exact shim needed for each individual exhaust or intake valve and it will have a process of checking the measurement three times throughout the assembly to ensure the perfect fit the materials used and their surface finish keeps the part within tolerance for the vehicle's lifetime so how do they know well they run tests they abuse the engine under severe conditions and ensure that the valve lash remains within spec under testing there's also an oil jet in the finger that shoots through the opening in the finger follower to constantly supply fresh oil to the camshaft lobe another clever thing they've done with this engine is they've located the direct fuel injectors on the exhaust side rather than on the intake side and there's two good reasons for doing this first of all it gives you more real estate for your intake valves so this engine has massive intake valves and that's really important for that high rpm air to enter into the cylinder second of all this helps with emissions so how well with an engine of this style wide bore short stroke when you're driving around you know city traffic low rpm kind of driving you don't have really high piston speeds so if that piston isn't moving up and down really fast you don't have really good tumble and mixing within this cylinder so by putting that direct injector across from the intake air they collide together and it helps mix that air and fuel even though you have relatively low piston speeds and so that helps out with emissions finally we get to the intake manifold and what a beautiful piece of engineering so we have dual throttle bodies dual plenums three center valves and then four trumpets which are mirrored on each side so the benefit of this style of an intake manifold has to do with hemholt's resonance big cool science word so what is hemholt's resonance well when you're driving in your car and you roll down one of the rear windows just one window and you hear that really annoying wind buffeting that's hemholtz resonance so you have these pressure waves bouncing around in here air acts like a spring and that air is just bouncing all around with these pressure waves in here and as you open these different valves in here in different combinations you allow those pressure waves to travel around these plenums in different ways and so you can optimize each of these for different rpm so what do you do well you don't have to understand perfectly how it works to understand why it's beneficial all you do is you stick this engine on a dyno and let's say you just leave all of them closed and then you rev it from idle all the way to its 8600 rpm redline and you draw out that torque curve so you got torque versus rpm and that torque curve will have some peak then you open up one of the valves and you do the same thing again idle to redline plot out that torque curve what does it look like then you try a different valve you try all the different possible combinations that you can enable by opening and closing these different valves and you plot out all of those torque curves from idle up to redline and then what you do is you just find these peaks and you choose okay at this rpm we're going to use this combination of valves open at this rpm we use this combination and then at this rpm we use that combination of certain valves opened and closed now our corvette they gave me a little bit of insight at idle all of these valves are closed at 2 800 rpm they're going to open up one valve at 4 200 rpm they open two valves at 5600 rpm they close the valve and then at 6800 rpm they close all the valves and that gives them that ideal torque curve where you just follow these individual peaks based on that resonance that's going on within these chambers those pressure waves to maximize the torque of the engine so how well did corvette do well let's talk about bmap brake mean effective pressure i have a separate video if you want to learn all the details i'd recommend checking that out but basically brake mean effective pressure is a nerdy way of comparing car engines it tells you what the average pressure is pushing down on that piston and it's good for comparing naturally aspirated engines so if we look at a really impressive naturally aspirated engine built by cosworth for use in the aston martin valkyrie this engine revs past 11 000 rpm produces a thousand horsepower big v12 6.5 liters well if we look at its brake mean effective pressure it's 14.3 bar at the engine's peak torque and it's 13.1 bar at the engine's peak horsepower so we'll just use these numbers for comparison now keep in mind the valkyrie is a three million dollar vehicle that's starting price three million so this corvette z06 is probably gonna be about three percent of the cost of this aston martin valkyrie with its wild cosworth engine the corvette numbers for peak torque brake mean effective pressure identical 14.3 bar and 13.1 bar at peak horsepower so wild that in something you know a 30th of the cost you're getting that level of engineering put into it absolutely incredible engine that corvette has produced here for this z06 thank
