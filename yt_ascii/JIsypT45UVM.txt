the dark powers want to use symbol in a way that sort of obfuscates what's really there powers are always based when they have a kind of a bent agenda they have to have some kind of lie that's inherent to the way they're working in the symbolic world because true symbol is integrity between what's on the inside and what's on the outside it's it's kind of the way i think about glory true glory is like pure integrity of what's on the inside and the outside like a piece of amber you know and you put it up to the sun and it's just like this beautiful translucent thing that you look through and it's solid all the way through whereas a distorted symbol and now we get into things like idols and advertising and and words and stereotypes and things that kind of like have a certain force socially they're all predicated on some kind of a lie they have a duplicitous nature they function precisely because their inside does not have integrity with the outside the outside has more of like a grandiosity which we kind of like almost attribute to things by virtue of association but they're hollowed out they really don't have integrity of meaning yeah [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] so hello everyone i am very happy to be here with ted lewis ted lewis is the director of the international jacqueline society cristiano who you may have seen on this channel is a good friend of mine presented us i myself have you know read some jacquel i i've struggled with jacqueline you know in some ways i feel like his insight on technology is is very important for us right now to understand the problem civilization the problem of technology but also of course as an orthodox christian and as someone who makes images i've struggled with some other aspects of jacqueline which is what i see as the two negative vision of the city of civilization of the image of you know of spatiality and the kind of the possibility of these things to manifest in the world today and so i'm really excited to be able to kind of engage this discussion with ted and so ted thanks for coming along yeah it's great to join in here so i i will know jackie little but maybe several will not so could you give people a sense of who he was what's his importance for us today yeah i'll be glad to jacquel is a mid-century thinker and many in many ways as a pioneer in the area of critiquing technology and his prominent book the technological society came out first in 1954 in in the french edition 1964 in english so we're coming up on a 70th year anniversary but even before that during the nazi era jacques luol and his friend bernard charbonneau and others in the personalist context in france we're very concerned about how the force of technology and a mechanized world would have an effect on society as well as our very humanity so one of the threads through all of his writings i mean he wrote a lot 40 books died in 1994 but the thread through all of that is sort of a warning that if western people do not really come to terms with how the force of progress and technology when it's untethered from ethics will end up having a deep effect on even the way we conceive ourselves as human beings a simple way to think about it is is to think about how environments influence us so a little kind of split things into three zones there's sort of like a time where nature was our environment and and social villages and and cultural things are primarily rooted in how nature forms and patterns human life and then the next stage has to do with just what what he calls the environment of the of the social this is the society we might think of the greek city-state and the roman world and into the medieval world and renaissance and the social world has more influence from how humanity is starting to lift itself away from nature and to create new new ways of thinking and being and science and and and whatnot and then for a little technology it's it itself becomes a third kind of environment an environment which informs who we are as people it didn't it it almost becomes totalistic for him and some people think he's you know too too far with that totalistic way about technology as a force dominates every part of human life but but those are some broad strokes around his writings yeah well i think the thing that for myself made me feel close to you is that he definitely seems to understand because it's important for people to understand that ilu was also a very serious christian you know his his insight much of the way that he thought came from the bible came from his own he was was he reformed was he protestant i don't know what his tradition was yeah primarily identified with with the french reform and had had quite a bit of influence within france and in those circles one of the more more significant things is but before he was really a christian he had read karl marx he fully embraced a marxist approach and in many ways that continued to inform his his sociology and then he starts to read kierkegaard i think he's known for reading just about everything kierkegaard wrote which is really astounding and then and then he started getting introduced to carl bart so kierkegaard and bart kind of advanced his his christianity out of a traditional calvinist reform zone into what you might call more of a dialectical perspective of faith matters and so one of the things that impressed me was that he does seem to really pick up very much on a clear strain in the bible which is the you could call it the canine image of of civilization which is that we've we find in the first chapters of genesis that civilization is is an issue of the descendants of cain and is in some ways a a kind of reaction cons you know reaction to the curse and compensation for the curse in some ways to to think about that that he seems to see the city in that that vein and and civilization and tick tick the technification of society in this this kind of line let's say canine and you really have to understand a lull's critique of the city and he does come on pretty strong as a follow-up to harvey cox's book the secular city where harvey cox tends to have more of an open-mindedness like now now that we've come into you know the fullness of modern society all the virtues that that might come with that what a little son that was a sacralization of the city so it's not the city per se with all of its architecture and structures and and institutions for for a little that's most problematic it's the fact that it gets lifted up like a tower of babel as something that becomes autonomous with its separate law autonomous from god so that that's really at the heart of the louisville's critique of the city is it becomes archetypal just like the tower of babel of human enterprises that don't know how to be more interactive and participatory with with god in a spiritual realm yeah and in this way this is where in some ways the it starts to rub with me in terms of especially being an orthodox christian is that his his interpretation of that leads all the way into his vision for example of image making and also of liturgy how he saw liturgy as something similar to this to this process you know where he tends to be suspicious of all of all formalizations you know any type of formalization seems to be suspicious and and prone to becoming idols and his approach seems to be a kind of desire to de-sacralize or demythologize you know very much like karl barth very much in that in that sense where in some ways he sees christianity as the ultimate de-sacralizer you could say that that de-sacralizes everything is that do you think my understanding is is right in that i i think it's it's fairly good and you have to understand that elul once went to a nazi rally some sometime in the in the later 30s he was he was at one of those rallies and he even admitted that he felt the pull that the magnetism the the the group energy getting drawn into that and so his his reaction to ceremony and ritual and the use of of arts ultimately has to be understood through the lens of how it can be used to manipulate society of course he then writes empire of the nonsense where he kind of feels like most modern artist itself sort of you know dominated by a technological flow within the 20th century so he doesn't have a whole lot of positive things to say about modern art and so what is his view of let's say because there is an eschatological image of the city right in in the book of revelation and so how does for himself like how does he reconcile those images together well i'm i'm glad you used the word reconcile because that is a word he likes to use where image and word come together in a in a fruitful way so probably the most important book for this topic of of his perspective on images and liturgy and and all of that is the humiliation of the word it happens to be one of my favorite books and i was able to bring it back into print recently and at the end of that book he has a whole chapter called reconciliation and by that he's talking about jesus word of god ultimate image of god as reconciling word and image in a way that restores the balance of both and then that has implications then for other aspects of christian life so even though he's very very hard on image and he pries his word i mean the very title the humiliation of the word is sort of like grieving over the fact that we are an image dominated society image saturated and and we prize more what we see rather than what we hear and and he goes into great depth about how the loss of our capacity to hear well affects our our thinking or our way of relating to to the spiritual realm and to god and and it kind of roots us much more in the here and now so bringing back a restoration or reconciliation of word and image for him is the pathway modeled by jesus to to you know to to bring us into a better zone and so one of the things that made me fascinated to talk about this is that recently you know gave me this this wonderful edition of the elul forum that deals in large part with the question of how jacqueline talked about principalities and powers this is i think something which is extremely relevant today as we're noticing one of the things that social network the like social media has done and the internet has done is that it has accelerated the question of the relationship between between attention and the way in which social forces function and what it has done is that made it possible for us because it's accelerating it so much it's helping even secular people see the types of agencies which take over and you know act through people and it's made it easier at least well i've noticed it made it easier for me to talk about these this notion that there are types of agencies or principalities power you know saint paul uses different words to talk about these that that kind of let's say have a type of agency over human behavior and this in some ways is one of the subjects that ilu has treated you know in a moment where it was in some ways very unpopular to talk about these types of subjects so can you give us a sense of how he perceived these these types of transpersonal agencies yeah it's a it's a big topic and i have to be humble to say i'm still sort of unpacking his perspective and then what i think about it he definitely felt and believed that there were real principalities and powers simply because the bible treats them as real and marva don is someone who did a fair amount of work with this topic she did her whole dissertation on on elul's view of the powers and principalities and then wrote some other things about it and she highlights that a little kind of hedged a little bit on what might be called the ontological being of powers when it comes to agency and personification which you know through christian tradition when we think of of of powers is having volitional dimension he he i would say he wasn't like fully there in his descriptions as you'll find in other christian writings and yet for him they are they do have independent force beyond what you could just study empirically as a social scientist just a couple examples for him was like the power of mammon which is a biblical word related to money and wealth and material things which have a certain power than over our need to protect our ours what we save it's similar to the way we we kind of think of a power over someone who is an addictive or a compulsive relation to what what enslaves them and everyone who's in the recovery world kind of knows that these powers are are way beyond what they themselves can control and that's why we use terms like agency from beyond because it's it's it's it's it's the metaphoric language that helps us be honest about the fact that there's something greater that's influencing us yeah in the text that i i was reading there's a letter in the from jacqueline to marva dawn and he seems at least in some of the parts of the letter to to to be wary to be to be cautious like you said it's as if he's a little he tends to have a bit of a reductionist approach to it where he doesn't want to fully talk about agency but you know let me just read a a little text from it here and so he says he talks about these powers and he says that is to say they certainly exist but not as entities comparable to human and materializable persons they exist in as much as they are manifestations and not as beings thus one finds the evil phenomena the fact of money of the city of the state and of technique and these phenomena reveal the existence of an evil spiritual power but not as a sort of powerful angel reigning over the world and using money or the state and so satan is the accusation therefore everywhere there is an accusation there's satan but it is not a personage who provokes and produces the accusations the accusation exists by itself and so in that i i can see that he's really struggling he is really struggling to talk about this and and in some ways i i'm i feel like i don't i kind of understand especially in the moment where in the time when he was writing this you know how he was dealing this but there's a way in which in some ways what he's saying about these agencies and powers is something that a reductionist would say about us about humans you would say there is no agency there's only the fact of there's only the actions there's only the cells there's only the the the the electric impulses you know in your brain because you cannot detect true agency through through material calculation like you can't agency always appears above let's say the the material facts and so i was a little surprised because i i really do think that someone would take his argument and apply it to a person and it would be as valid as the way that he tries to skirt the problem of transpersonal agency by attributing only the the factors now i i i i understand that it's difficult because because we are we are materialists and therefore we're not used to thinking analogically and so when we think when we think of these angels and we see these beings with wings we we kind of freak out because because it bothers us to think to think that way we we can't think that even those representations are always analogical to some to some other form of yeah to an invisible agency let's say yeah this is a deep topic i i might kind of come at this topic from a different angle and i'd like to throw out the word symbol symbol you know sim greek for with bowl greek for throwing something you know we get our word ball from that part of the greek words that have the bowl in it so symbol to throw with parable to throw beyond diable or diabolic to throw apart so the the reason i kind of want to start with symbol is that in in a way god's effort to reach humanity and c.s lewis is kind of big on this has to go through symbol to reach us and that doesn't mean that we we can deconstruct it and then there's nothing there we we we come to realize it's the necessary means for one realm that's so incomprehensible and beyond to reach us has to go through metaphor and and symbol for us to make sense of it and so i think even when it comes to the darker powers all we have is language and symbol in a way to apprehend it yeah but like wind like gravity like frequencies now that you know make our garage door go up and down we we know that this stuff is like really happening because we see the effects and so i think that's part of being just limited human beings is that we have to learn to to know that we're really not going to get that much more than symbol and yet that's still a rich area for us to traffic in and what what i kind of find interesting is that the dark powers want to use symbol in a way that sort of obfuscates what's really there so powers are always based and i mean when they have a kind of a bent agenda they have to have some kind of lie that's in inherent to the way they're working in the symbolic world because true symbol is integrity between what's on the inside and what's on the outside it's it's kind of the way i think about glory true true glory is like pure integrity of what's on the inside and the outside like kind of like when you get like like a piece of amber you know and you put it up to the sun and it's just like this beautiful translucent thing that you look through and it's solid all the way through where whereas a distorted symbol and now we get into things like idols and advertising and and words and stereotypes and things that kind of like have a certain force socially they're they're all predicated on some kind of a lie they have a duplicitous nature yeah and they they function precisely because their insight does not have integrity with the outside the outside has more of like a grandiosity which we we kind of like almost a tribute to things by by virtue of association but they're hollowed out they they really don't have integrity of meaning yeah would you say that the very because this i think would fit well with what it says which is that the lie in some ways is the autonomous existence of the thing itself that is you know the state presenting itself as the summit of authority for example that itself is the lie which forces the the disjunction between this the let's say the outward appearance or the outward symbol and the inter interiority of the of what is symbolized and so it forces you know when a state believes that it is all-powerful like in the authoritarian states that we saw in the 20th century it is forced to use a religious language which is not appropriate for itself in order to apply it to itself because it is in some ways like the tower of babel taking up the the place of god we could say yeah and and i i think what fits with what you're saying is the is the phrase pretentious hours one of allul's favorite verses right out of second corinthians 10 has this phrase of pretentious powers you know that we can deconstruct and bring captive to the lordship of christ and by pretentious it means it has the appearance of being very powerful this is this is what i call the outside manifestation of a power that presents well like a state like a nation you know like like a new car or whatever but on the inside has some contradictions what you're calling a lie there's always an achilles heel you know on the inside of of these duplicitous symbols because they're they're they have to continually be propped up with with falsehoods and narratives and and things which you know again lack the integrity of meaning of the way things truly are in the world and so one of the ways that i so this is i think in terms of maybe i can phrase it this way because i think it relates to what we're saying now which is that seems to want to portray the negative the negative in the sense that in some ways right the crucifixion of christ the humiliation of christ the the you know the the capacity to embody weakness subverts the whole structure right and so in some ways it it it it exposes the powers right in that in the same similar to the way that the kanijah talks about and i think that in that sense he is completely right and there's something about what he's saying which pierce is very truly where i wonder is that in scripture there's also a whole other strain which is the tabernacle the temple you know and even ezekiel's third temple which is a kind of vision of an eschatological temple yeah and and the same and this image of the son of man and so for example in revelation you have this final image where you have two so even in the text i was reading you know he was alluding to the lamb and to the to the idea of the lamb as this this insane image right it's like why the lamb at the summit of the of the hierarchy right this that's the subverted image but in the in in division it's actually two images right it's it's the son of man and the lamb so it's the the king judge ruler and the lamb joined together so there are these two strange in scripture it's it can seem contradictory but they're there right the the vision of the the tabernacle where the god asking moses to build a tabernacle is is very much using tropes related to cain you know the bezalel the way that he's described as an artificer you know the only other person called an artificer in scripture i think is is tubal cane and so it's like there's this whole other strain and that's the one that that that i see a little let's say ignore which which would i think would lead them to say to be something like a christian anarchist like it's as if all structure is is dangerous in itself so i don't know if what do you think of that i'm kind of poking here but i want to know which yeah well i'll kind of talk out loud speaking more more of my thinking than trying to represent a little yeah okay okay but then i will come back to him but if you think about renee gerard's concept of sacrifice as having cultural rootage in the hebrew tradition as well as the ancient near east and from his perspective it slowly is being or it's evolving into a new perspective which upends the whole sacrificial system itself it's it's like a a counter narrative that involves non-violence and forgiveness and relationality and and upending so it's it's possible i think that when you look at liturgical and artistic and you know the those physical traditions that come out of the old testament that those themselves have a type of evolving understanding so by the time jesus is talking to the woman at the well in in samaria he says you know it's hey it's it's neither that temple or this temple people are going to worship in spirit and truth i think elul kind of shares a little bit of that kind of sympathy where the the temple itself has has like aspects of legitimate tradition but ultimately it it becomes not just replaced by something spiritual but it actually becomes sort of there's a tension with it there's a subverted element and jesus himself is using language to confront the temple institution itself by by kind of broadening people's minds into into these paradoxical ways of thinking that are trans-cultural so i i don't know if that's a window in in talking about that but i think a lure kind of shares some of that sense of there's a trajectory just like a trajectory for gerard about sacrifice maybe there is for visual culture too and i think yeah and so i think that that's maybe i have a yes and way of thinking you know not a not a not a this but this or like i tend to have a yes and way of thinking and so and so even in the story of christ you have those images and then you also have the fact that he cleansed the the temple he wanted to purify the the space that that god had established then i also think of the eschatological vision the image of the heavenly jerusalem is very powerful because it seems to solve the problem because the way that it's presented is is that the kings the kings of all nations you know offer their crown up into the heavenly city and all the glory of all the nations are elevated into the heavenly jerusalem and so it's not that the nations are destroyed it's not that the kings don't exist is that there exists in the proper order so whatever whatever particular glory a nation has is given up to something higher and that's its glory actually right it's like that is what is glorious whatever it can offer up and whatever it doesn't hold on to itself and and tries to to you know like like the kind of the kind of dangerous nationalism that we can see that that is actually a kind of way in which all this participates on this so there isn't a there isn't just a negative part there's also this kind of positive way that we can that civilization that art that culture that that that that that authority that all these things part can participate ultimately in the kingdom yeah i i think i i would affirm that and there's there's a affirming incarnational blessing of of things that that are with integrity reflect the nature of god and the the intended you know creation that was set out for us and at the same time jesus is the great disturber of everything and every culture that does not align with with all of that yeah that's kind of the way that i i tend to i tend to see it myself yeah it's so so in terms of in terms of how do you feel that speaks now because you know we're seeing in some ways the the radical acceleration of technification you know everybody's talking about ai right now it's it's wild because it it's as if now these principalities and powers are almost like appearing in front of us and so and so what do you what do you think yeah well just as an aside i'm i'm a real fan of c.s lewis's ransom trilogy and the third one that hideous strength is you know you can get away with saying things in fiction that you can't always convey a non-fiction and so i i just think that that's a great example for us to think into some of the trends that that we're wrestling with now when when you think about how powers are related to institutions and whatnot for allul i personally think that one of his most important books for our current time is the technological bluff it it in many ways is the third of a trilogy if you start with the technological society you know that he wrote in the 50s and then in the 70s he wrote the technological system which adds some new perspective on his original thesis and then thirdly he wrote the technological bluff and by bluff he's he's talking about how technique driven methods in our society present well to provide solutions even uses the the word salvation that at times you know because of this problem this technology is going to save us from what not and yet the bluff is we really don't know exactly how the the rollouts are going to look we don't know what all the effects are he uses terms like consequences are unforeseeable they're unpredictable sometimes even unmanaged unmanageable yeah and because we have such a high general faith in technology we think that's the only way to really solve something you know we we have a a pandemic which arguably comes out of a technological malleol but now we have to find a technological solution to to deal with it well now that presents some additional fallout challenges and this this is the bluff that he says we need to call if we're really gonna not let ourselves be in these cycles of technological soteriology yeah yeah yeah and one of the things that elude seems to present which is very powerful is that in some ways what happens in a technological state when what happens when the technological takes over the narrative is that it's only means that matter that that in some ways we don't even know what the goal is the the it's only the implementation of means which seems to be the very purpose of society itself and it's almost like you said it's as if and then the the side effects of the implementation create new needs and new problems that have to be sorted out by the implementation of more and more efficient and technical means and so it's like it makes you feel like you're moving and you're moving towards something but there is no there is no end point it decides what more technical efficient things like you know what what is the purpose of all this where are we going well when we we get away from yeah healthy sustainable systems that have give and take and balance and and whatnot yeah there's a sense in which we you know for example like the the the idea that this the techni the techniques this technicity you know is supposed to make us happy i guess it's i guess maybe that's like the best thing that you can or like the most positive idea you can makes it easier maybe in order for us i'm trying to to be generous to the to this kind of run towards technicity to make us to make life easier to make to make things for us to do the things that we care about which are not related to life or something like that like that leisure and and and and and pleasure like that but but we can see through like the increase in depression and the increase in kind of a kind of madness that people are falling into you know especially as as identity starts to fragment you know they they don't know where to look for meaning yeah and i i think this aligns very well with with c.s lewis's abolition of man yeah another one of my favorites because he in the same way you're talking about means separated from ends that fits well with what lewis calls you know agendas of progress being untethered from traditional ethics yeah because ethics are ultimately about understanding our best ends and then balancing ourselves in in relation to those they have a claim on on society to create good ends but once once you remove traditional ethics from the realm of applied science then you can see how the means becomes more dominance it's the same way in the artistic and image culture where the form begins to dominate over content and meaning similar application there yeah you see that i mean advertisement is the ultimate example of that you know and and i mean it's it's it's fascinating i don't know if i mean i for sure c.s lewis had that intuition very much so which is that in some ways the the increase in man wanting to free himself from transcendent you know attachment the the desire for man to kind of fulfill his own destiny to fulfill his own will and to to kind of fulfill his own desire for power ultimately leads very surprised it's not that surprising but it can seem surprising to some to an anti-human narrative ultimately where in some ways you know we're seeing it now in the more extreme version of the environmental narrative where it's almost as if humans are just parasites in the world and that they you know all they do is consume and it'd be better if there were fewer of them in the world and you see it now with ai as well this kind of idea that we that you know we need to be transcended ourselves like we're going to give birth something that will ultimately destroy us or consume it percent there's almost like a suicidal ecstasy it's very it's very disturbing to see that that's at the end of this this kind of desire for technical power but i know phil had insight on that if you know that he had he had kind of foreseen something like that well i see what what you're saying as requiring social compliancy in other words you you can only go in that direction if you if you don't allow for dissent and that everyone has what might be called a shared reality and since you're in canada i'll reference an interesting video that comes out by horizons canada which has a tower of babel motif in it and what's really interesting about this the narrative because it's all about where technology and and humanity find a way to work together for a better future but it has a tower of babel image in it you know that's that's all about you know people all coming together for one big project and it reverses the narrative because god is now the the antagonist in a scenario where it's good for people to come together think alike share one language and create a better shared future it's unfortunate that that project was thwarted and god scattered people laterally back you know back into their creature hood yeah and this is something that has been going on for a while the you know the building one of the main buildings for the european union i think it's your one of these globalists association is literally designed based on brugel's tower of babel and and that and when the european union decided to kind of meet one of the posters they put out was a huge poster of brugal's tower of babel and it was like you know we're gonna basically we're gonna finish the project you know we're gonna finally do this right and you know the those 16th century artists there's so many babel painters many of them show the tower incomplete as a both social and theological statement yeah because because the the fact that it was not completed is itself a commentary on on the you know the the false efforts to to try to build something independent of god yeah and that's the right that's the right way to see it is that to imagine that anything is complete is the sin in itself right yeah do you imagine that anything can be self-contained and complete is a is the is the era of idolatry so here's a nice way to bring our topic back to powers and speaking of 16th century did you know where the phrase hideous strength comes from no no i don't know it's a tower of babel phrase okay david lindsay a poet from 1555 wrote about that hideous strength and the shadow that it casted six miles in length mm-hmm and so this is lewis as a medieval and renaissance scholar of literature comes across this poem recognizes this phrase hideous strength as about the archetypal force from the babel project and and then uses that all through that hideous strength and of course the nice which is such a playful jester-like acronym you know for the institute of of the technocrats because they're aspiring upward you know to have you know to build a utopian society they poke through the heavens so to speak just like my hands sort of poking above the box here and without them knowing it that opens up a portal for other benign celestial powers to come down to earth and to support the you know the team that's fighting against the bad side so they brought down on their heads their own demise yeah this is a beautiful image to say that powers have a duplicitous nature because on the outside again they present well with with great force and and everything but on the inside there's an insecurity and a lie and a contradiction which which means that they're they ultimately bear the seeds of their own destruction yeah and i mean i'm interested in knowing about this as well if because one of the things i haven't seen in in also is a mention of angels that is there is a whole vision in scripture of the divine council you know this is something that is becoming i think with good reason more more popular and talked about today the idea that that and and the way that it was recuperated in christian mysticism right for example in in dionysus is divine hierarchy he he literally uses the words that saint paul uses to describe what he's talking about in terms of negative influences that that that that oppress us he uses them to talk to them about them in terms of their positive you know as like a as levels of of manifestation from the divine down into human so throne powers all these things are used by dionysus to to describe the way that god kind of descends into the world and so has he did has he talked about that like the the the the reality of angels let's say in the new testament as well i i think he kind of hedged on that you know you got to understand that he's he's starts out as a marxist and so his his notion of power and forces like akin to the fetishism of commodities yeah yeah and and and so ultimately when when elul has interest in powers and principalities biblically he's interested in their function not their ontological being yeah so he's not denying their existence but i think this goes back to the symbol thing he he recognizes that that everything is symbolic whether it's the new jerusalem or or winged beings or or whatever as a way to help us grasp that there's something there that's additional to our you know our human cultural realm yeah but even in like even in terms of functionality and if you think about saint john in in the in the book of revelation when he addresses the angels of the cities right and so there's a sense in which in that case the angel of the city right or the the principality of the city is not seen in a negative way it's just seen as you know the it's a kind of a a place where the identity of the city comes together in its agency and so i address this this angel in a in a positive way not in a negative way yeah yeah so i mean because i think that that image that you just gave us of the tower of babel poking through you know and then the surprise that it lets in you know benign principalities or good principalities i think that that's something that we're already seeing and it's very interesting so a good example is that during during during covid especially in places where the the the power of the state was felt very strongly all of a sudden it's like it kind of exposed certain things which were already there hidden in certain capacities that the state had that people didn't realize that that were there and then all of a sudden this crisis get you know exposes and makes real the capacity for the state to really control us you know in in ways that we didn't think were possible both through narrative through kind of inner propaganda like using tools of propaganda inside our the country but then also real power of like you know when i was in quarantine the policeman showed up in my at my door right it's like these are real these are real power steps but another thing that happened is that it in seeing that agency and in seeing the the state act with such force and and and feeling i was like nobody's controlling it right exactly like an agency it's like why is it happening all over the world and there's nobody in charge of this and it's nobody with like that is like is there's no like evil genius sitting there rubbing his hands and and making it happen it's just it's just like it's it's a form of it is a pattern which is laying itself in the world the reaction to that for a lot of people was conversion you know like in the orthodox church we have seen a massive wave of converts at the end of covid and i'm talking parishes doubling tripling all young people that through this desire of the state to gain absolute power they were able to perceive something about how the world works that made them want to to to attach themselves to something higher you know and that probably did not happen as much in the mainline denominations i don't know i don't know i just know about of course my own my own my own church and so why would you i don't know why would you think that wouldn't have happened in the mainline domination denomination for example because most mainline denominations lean a little more progressive and liberal at least in the united states and so they were more compliant to not gather and in many cases they were whittled down more and many of them are struggling more so with not just attendance but leadership transitions vision of what their church you know direction is where whereas in in churches which might not have struggled as much with that sense of compliancy to official narratives there's probably more of of a sense of resistance and alternative community and perhaps that becoming a an attractive magnet for other people seeking community yeah and even the even like the i think because one of the things that happens in these totalizing patterns is that they there's a sense in which we need to be reduced to individuals like we need to be reduced to just dots you know without without competing allegiances you could say to the to the massive power of the state and that and then reducing people to lonely you know to like you're just a lonely especially those that didn't have families and only guys lonely women you know sitting there in front of netflix for a whole year i think it also made the problem very acute where people realize no actually i need intermediary communities i need real connected places where i physically go and talk to people and have and and do that with with something that is meaningful and and not just not just yeah not just arbitrary louisville talks about that as a key priority in his book presence in the modern world really his first major book written in the mid-40s and in contrast to institutional systems that want to have a one-way communication to kind of can control things he he talks about needing to be with neighbors needing to have real conversations prizing localism you know and later of course his famous phrases you know where dialogue ends propaganda begins so he had a pretty strong advocacy for those local real life relationship dynamics as a way to kind of maintain a type of resistance in the world yeah so maybe that's a good place to transition and and and let's move into the last question that i have for you is maybe you can tell people about your work and and how you see what kind of solutions you see for modern people in this this increasingly technified world and also increasing centralized authorities how do you see people finding real-life solutions for the for their lives and for their families for the people around them yeah it's a compelling question and my my primary work is in the field of restorative justice and conflict resolution for about 25 years and it's it's a great calling and you know one of the things i've observed as a facilitator is that there's almost a paralysis of dialogue in in our western cultures people just having more caution and reservation about having hard conversations with each other because they're not maybe maybe they're not sure how the other person is thinking or how they'll react or maybe they do know how the other person is thinking and they're afraid that it'll cause a rift in the friendship so whether it's red blue issues or pandemic issues or race issues or cultural correctness issues whatever it is we're experiencing a type of paralysis that's deadening healthy dialogue on so many levels whether it's family and interpersonal or friends or co-workers i mean i i know university teachers that feel more afraid to to just freely say things or choose things within their curriculum because they feel like there's eyes watching them not not just from above but students who who will who will say you know i i didn't feel safe when when that content was presented without warning i have a friend who lost her job because of that of that very thing without any dignifying learning conversation from both sides so practically and positively the way i see dialogue opening is in the word story usually when we think of civil discourse we think of people you know having healthy debate and and there's a good place for that but it's not necessarily a starting point so when i talk about story i'm talking about people getting into the experiential realm of what they're really observing and noticing and living through and maybe some hardships that they've gone through and just narrating that across the divides to people that might have oppositional perspective and what that does is it gets people out of what i call their head zone where they tend to be defensive they want to win arguments and persuade people and into the heart zone where we tend to think more about our common humanity with others the the heart zone is where we listen better where we apologize where we have some humility curiosity and it brings us into these story realms so that that's a big part of what i do in my workshops now with different groups is i'll talk about what are skills and structures that help conversation shift away from head zones into the heart zones where there's kind of a bonding potential and that doesn't mean everything just stays in kind of this feeling story zone yeah it actually creates a foundation for people with differing views to then come back into the head zones and have more capacity and more trust to really have iron sharpen iron at that point yeah because i think we still need those hard logic based conversations but we're just not able to start there so we we have to have foundations of of shared understanding shared bonding shared appreciation for what other people have gone through and then find ways to come back to the the more debatable issues yeah and i think i think that what you've just said is key because in some ways what we see it seems like what we see is an excess of both and a new capacity to bridge because what you often see the clash and and i see it you see it even in the in the sad online world is is someone coming with a story perspective and then someone answering with the facts logic perspective and that can go wrong in many ways in the sense that maybe the person who's just telling the story just wants to tell their stories that you understand where they're coming from sometimes the person telling their story confuses the spaces so they think that their story is is an argument for the head head place and then and then there's a misalignment but the idea of of both exploring both and understanding the difference between the two and saying like you know of course we should like we if we know each other then that that bound that that basic place for trust is set and then we can like you said then we can talk about the difficult issues in terms of more in terms of of of how reasonable things are and and what makes sense in terms of what we're doing so so that no i think that's that seems like a great approach well ted thank you so much for this this conversation you know the the i appreciated you that you went there with me because as you saw like my this my my relationship with dilute is like a 50 50 relationship and that's maybe why in some ways i haven't talked about him so much on my channel but i think for people watching it's a good it's a good place to to leap into a little especially as someone who had very deep insight into something into all the problems we're dealing with now in terms of of technification and also in terms of of of state powers becoming all-powerful and how as christians we can deal with that so thanks a lot for your time yeah i'm really really thankful to be here and i just want to tack on one short piece that kind of brings powers and story together as a theme the counter narrative for elul with respect to the tower of babel is philippians 2 where jesus empties himself not wanting to take on the importance of being like a greek roman god with lots of status but becomes a servant and it ends up dying that's the reversal of the tower of babel impulse to to be autonomous and i think that that incarnational story in elulse talks about this as a juxtaposition numerous times in his writings validates the whole notion that we live in a real world we live in a messy world we live in a visual world and so to be able to engage without the same power dynamics it really does have validation in that story because it's it's it's the ultimate symbol of god reaching us yeah and it's the surprising image of the one who does that you know with that with the headboard which says that he's the king simultaneously that kind of simultaneous clash of imagery where he both envies himself and is raised up to the highest you know he goes into death but then enters into the holy place like it's a yeah the story of the cross just kills you every time you think about it it's so it's it it just smashes everything together so seeing the world through the cross is definitely the way to solve the problem of of principalities and powers and how you know the highest gives itself to the lowest that's the best way to understand true christian hierarchy and true christian power so ted thanks this has been great well it's a delight to to come converse with you and and kind of see where our conversation leads us all right
