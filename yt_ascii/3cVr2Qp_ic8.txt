despite what we were told in the west for decades that the soviet union is perpetual we have to learn to live together they're not going anywhere look you can't antagonize them we just got to figure out how to work together and at a certain point reagan said do you want to know what my policy is for this the cold war some it's it's simple some might even call it simplistic you want to hear it we win and they lose [music] right [music] hello everyone i have the pleasure today of sitting and talking with michael melis and we start by talking about his book the white pill and his book is a walk through the catastrophes of the soviet era the dire hell that emerged in the aftermath of the formulation of the hypothetical workers paradise and a description of of how that dreadful system how and why that dreadful system came to an end but we also talk about something i suppose more fundamental if there is something more fundamental than that which is a conceptualization of what appropriate social and psychological relations might look like in alternative to dogmatic and structured government i i hashed out with michael the the the precise reason that his attention has been attracted by the claims of of anarchism per se i'm always curious about dissociating anarchism say from a kind of impulsive hedonism we drag ein rand into the mix to sort that out and and come to conclusions that i think are well they're interesting and likely appropriate concentrating particularly on voluntary association as the antithesis to power right power and compulsion the power and compulsion that inevitably leads to tyranny and hell so that's the conversation so i was reading your book this morning the white pill and i've read a fair bit of russian history in the 20th century and some before that and but every time i reencounter it it it never really stops stunning me the brutality that was associated with that regime i mean it's obviously the case that the same can be said about what happened in nazi germany and perhaps even to a greater extent what happened in ma china although that's a competition between pretty deep hells but it never stops being surely unbelievable to me that things can go that badly and i thought maybe what we do here is start with two i'll read a couple of things from your book one kind of ideological and then the other just a description of the consequences of the ideology so you write about this burkeman character who was a anarchist agitator for the working class in the united states who had the what he thought was the good fortune to go to russia after the revolution to see the workers paradise in action to be deported he was deported by hoover right right right right and he said with his with his friend what was her name emma goldman goldman emma goldman of course that they were virtually motivated to kiss the ground when they landed in russia okay so now the burkman's talking to lennon and lennon says liberty lennon told burkeman is a luxury not to be permitted at the present state of development when the revolution is out of danger external and domestic so that's kind of an interesting idea to be out of danger that's when you get to have liberty when there's like zero danger you know that happens a lot in life then free speech might be indulged in might right and indulged in right right right lovely phrasing he's a man who meant what he said insisting that quote enemies must be crushed and all power centralized in the communist state lenon admitted that in this process c the government is often compelled to resort to unpleasant means but that is the imperative of the situation right that's the other thing that the totalitarians always do is that the situation right now is so bad and liable to get worse that any means whatsoever are to be justified now not only that that if you stand against them then well all you're doing is contributing to the eventual catastrophe and then given the magnitude of the catastrophe no no punishment could possibly be severe enough for you but that that is the imperative of the situation from which there can be no shrinking that's lovely too now it's a moral obligation to torture people in the course of time yeah these methods will be abolished when when they have become unnecessary so that's lovely okay so what does that end up producing that attitude in in in mere years when when lenin is still alive so burkman and goldman left the soviet union in 1921 with complete loathing her memoir of her time there was split by her publisher into two books given the titles of my disillusionment in russia 1923 and my further disillusionment in russia 1924 because there were two books worth of disillusionment and that wasn't nearly enough burkman's the bolshevik myth came out the following year and the two never stopped speaking about what they had seen firsthand in russia warning the rest of the citizen rest of the world of the horrors that the russian citizenry were enduring and remember these were people who were hoping that a worker's revolution would produce a broadscale improvement in the working conditions of ordinary people so okay so let's let's let's go up a little let's go down a little closer to the actuality on the ground so this another quote from your book life remained difficult in the ussr for years after the russian civil war had been won by the bolsheviks the communists housing became even more of a concern as rural citizens flocked to the rapidly industrializing cities in search of work and food families became crammed into apartments that had already been occupied by other families yeah well it was a bersa conceit that people needed like their own space including their own bathroom right well we'll get to that right away here and both eviction and trying to find a new place to live effectively became impossible well that's lovely so no matter how terrible the people were who you lived with there was no possibility of doing anything about it some of this was by design in keeping with communist ideology the ultimate vision was to have homes without kitchens so that everyone would eat communally and government run cafeterias it's a lovely idea assuming that there's food and that the people who are cooking are motivated somehow to cook and decently and that the people cleaning up are motivated somehow other than by terror to clean up and then you know if you let the government provide your food every single day and you don't even have a storehouse or a kitchen then what's to stop the people who are hypothetically giving you everything from stopping to provide everything that you've so foolishly allowed them to present yourself with whenever they want on any pretext whatsoever people think no one would ever do that it's like yeah right true true believer communist architects lovely group designed buildings where everyone would have to share bathrooms as well part of an assault on burgeois concepts such as shame privacy and individualism this created an enormous incentive for families to turn turn in those living with them to the authorities for the most spacious of reasons if not downright lies one phone call in the living quarter for quarters for one family for one's family instantly doubled what's the harm if they weren't guilty of one thing then surely they were guilty of another yeah i remember that from soul shiten right this is this is what the good thinkers in the west think too you know when when something happens when the government extends its its tentacles and takes away more liberties or starts threatening people the idea is well if you didn't do anything wrong you you wouldn't have anything to worry about we still hear that today oh abolutely we hear that all the time it's like i see so if i never did anything wrong i wouldn't have to worry about you okay so that means only the person who's utterly innocent has nothing to fear right well yeah that'll work out well for everyone and if they hadn't done anything then surely they would have nothing to fear from the czech we'll talk about them right this became such a commonplace occurrence that was even joked about in popular magazines of the time just think masha how unpleasant i wrote a denunciation on galan and it turns out that balan had a bigger room yes very funny okay so what's the end consequence of this i think this is in the early 20s this is in ukraine v mass deportation starts victims were about to be deported were stripped of their shoes and their clothes taken and given to lower peasants as a bribe to ensure their cooperation kulac children so the kulacs were farmers who actually produced food that was basically the definition of a kolac or who could conceivably produce food or had ancestors that might have once produced food these kulak children were left as beggars on the street those transported to siberia where there was no buildings by the way and where it was winter often often often yes well in siberia after all often yeah those transported to siberia faced insuperable hardship yes and insuperable by design if a village existed they were squeezed into it otherwise they were simply abandoned without shelter in extreme cold and ordered to build dwellings many managed to do so by working almost around the clock without sleep in order that they and the others would not freeze to death those employed as forced labor and mining regions faced starving rations of one bowl of thin grl a day and 8 to 10 ounces of bread they died in waves no matter their numbers were replenished by the arrival of new deportees and then we'll read this too i think cu this is where it i don't know is this as bad as it got probably not you'd never find the bottom it does became common this is during the kulac starvation it thus became common for villagers to spy and inform on one another turning in a neighbor for having a sock of grain might be the easiest and safest way to procure food for one's family not only was there a guarantee of a meal but there was now a guarantee that said meal wouldn't be seized by the requisitioners who were going from house to house looking for any evidence that you might have even literally even a grain of wheat somewhere on the premises furthermore those who could not produce a quot of grain during starvation conditions were subject to a fine of five times the value of what the grain would have been yet another reason to seize property and savings not enough not having the food to fulfill one's quota was taken as evidence if not downright proof that one must have been hiding it and if the food was being hidden then why was it being handed over many of of the tactics however could only be explained by pure sadism in some villages the requisitioners went from house to house killing all the dogs and taking their bodies with them for good measure fingers would be slammed in doorways or needles jammed under fingernails those found concealing food were robbed of their remaining possessions evicted from their homes and thrown into the snow without any clothes to ensure that the starving peasants did not somehow steal the food that they so desperately needed fields and barns were kept under armed guard the tivist even came for the tools used for making food breaking millstones necessary to processed grain if they took soup from a hungry family they made sure to take the pot as well we'll end with this one one day as i waited in a queue in front of the store to buy bread i saw a farm girl of about 15 years of age in rags and with starvation looking out of her eyes she stretched out her hand to everyone who bought bread asking for a few crumbs at last she reached the storekeeper this man must not must have been some newly arrang arrived stranger who either could not or would not speak ukrainian he began to berate her said she was too lazy to work on the farm and hit her outstretched hand with the blunt edge of a knife blade the girl fell down and lost a crumb of bread she was holding in the other hand then the storekeeper stepped closer kicked the girl and roared get up go home and get to work the girl groan stretched out and died some in the queue began to weep yes well their little walkth through communism in all of its glory so you start your book you there's one line after that where he chastises the people online who are crying for the dying girl and he says oh looks like enemies of the people are everywhere right so to make sure you're not even showing sympathy for this kid who just starved in front of you right right yeah well one of the things you know one of the things i learned from rud extion it's so absolutely bloody brutal was and it was in keeping with what you just said was that once you establish a state like the russians established where heaven is claimed to rain when hell actually prevails you can't even admit to your own suffering much less the suffering of other people because to admit that you're in pain is a an accusation against the state because like well who are you to be in pain that glorious socialist workers revolution has has come there's no such thing as pain and so then you're in a situation where you suffer and everyone around you suffers and now if you dare to admit it then you suffer more and so there was a line in the gulags where one of the elanor li lipman i believe it's her name says that not only did they want to torture us they want us to thank them for it yeah right so to even acknowledge that something is wrong or an issue is in fact criticism of the state and the only people who are criticizing the state are by definition counterrevolutionaries who not only want to therefore overthrow the government but pretty much want what's worse for everybody so when people like this exist there is nothing that is too bad to be done to them because they are monsters who must be wiped off the face of the earth there is this line one the secret police just talked about how when you're chopping wood chips will fly because his point was it's better to kill nine innocent people to get to that one spy because that is what happens when you have a society based on the common good before the individual good they tell you constantly and explicitly you do not matter we are building a great society for the sake of all you are one little data point you are and your family are completely irrelevant so fall at best irrelevant at best so fall in line because everyone else is falling in line and what makes you so special so i i have to tell you i'm sorry it's just you know being born in the soviet union and having worked in this was very difficult but hearing it coming from you and just this kind of arms length thing is just getting me all agitated once again because it's the kind of situation that is as americans and a canadian almost incomprehensible you know the book starts with ein rand on the back where she testifying in front of the house on american activ activist committee and she says it's almost impossible to convey to a free people what it's like to live in a totalitarian dictatorship she goes i could give you a lot of details i can never completely convince you and she goes in a way it's good that you can't even conceive what it's like yeah like imagine what it's like to live from morning till night in constant terror and at night you're wear waiting for the doorbell to ring where you don't know who or what is going to do or when is going to do what to you because you have friends who spy on you and family m or your family member where you live in a country where human life means nothing less than nothing and you know it and you're reminded of it constantly yeah and purposefully yes right and where power has been delivered to the hands of the most sadistic people you can possibly imagine who claim constantly that they're doing nothing except operating in the name of the highest good i will correct you because i think they're more sadistic than you could possibly imagine because if you and i sat down and tried to think of sadistic things to do we are would not be creative enough as people with the slightest bit of conscience to think of the things that they did in the soviet union and in mouse china it would just never enter our heads so why did you write this book i mean there are other histories of the russian of russian brutality obviously and it's also the case i would say that if people were inclined to educate themselves this is something we can talk about in detail if people in the west were inclined to educate themselves about the inevitability the inevitable consequences of let's say a communist revolution there are plenty of sources to draw from the black book of communism everything soci nent wrote for example i mean and books by robert conquest yes i mean we we know this we know this or we could know it now you know one of the things that stunned me and i suppose it was one of the first what would you say the first source of insights i had into to the absolute corruption of the modern education system in the west was that i taught a module on alexander solan niton in my personality class which was a secondy year class i taught it at harvard and then at the university of toronto so i was teaching it to pretty damn bright students and they were in the 14th year of their education and i taught it because soul niton was essentially an existentialist psychologist in many ways he extended the work that was done by victor frankle who wrote a great book book called man search for meaning but solit went even deeper and what stunned me was despite the fact that we had carried on a cold war for 40 years to try to defeat this absolutely brutal ideology almost brought the world to the brink of nuclear disaster that 13040 million people had been slaughtered in the 20th century in its name that most of the students had absolutely no bloody idea that any of this ever happened and i thought how in the hell can we be that you know what they say there is none so blind as those who will not see and so you wrote this why' you write it you i think you just answered my question because the fact that this was the absolutely unambiguously number one foreign policy issue for the greater part of the 20th century that all foreign policy was viewed through the lenss of the cold war and the fact that the soviet union has now not only been memory hold but has become a bit of a kitchy joke that you can go to whole foods and have like russian brand ice cream and they mean russian like soviet erab brand ice cream and they make little jokes about it strange it's not strange strange can be morally ambiguous it's depraved in my opinion no but here's the strange part of it is you know is that that's true of the soviet union but it's not true of nazi germany now i have heard that in south korea there is nazi k kit and in india as well they have hitler ice cream and in india okay but here it's been the case that apart from the mel brooks broadway production right springtime for hitler what or that wasn't the production exactly i think there was a song that was a song there was a song in it yeah right that was the only time that i actually saw like a kitsy kind of parody was still a dark parody hitler and the nazis are still off limits for for what would demented nostalgia but that doesn't seem to be the case as you pointed out for the communist regime because we're the good guys and world wari to and the people we sided with therefore are the good guys so to have the narrative explain that we had to deal with a devil to deal with the worst devil is too and the fact that there are many agencies the us government and the newspapers who are still in power today that they were the ones who helped to cover up stalin's atrocities possibly in the sake of something that needed to happen to win world war i but they never went back and were like guys this is hardly know someone who is an angel you know churel and and fd and fdr are calling him uncle joe at yalta and things like this there was there was a huge movement to censor in hollywood anything that implies that russia is dishonest or brutal or harmful like there are allies we have to portray them in the best possible light this is the war effort so the fact that there isn't this easy narrative that like wait a minute you know cu our foreign policy is always we're the good guys whoever we're against as the bad guys so to have any kind of ambig beauty in that even historical is something that our i think our corporate media which is very dedicated to promulgating binary thinking good versus bad good you know black versus evil is something that they're very heavily invested in and to answer your previous question that is why i wrote this book because i thought it was insane that something that is again the number one issue of the 20th century in this regard is something that educated highly educated people know very little about but the reason don't want to then don't want to in fact when emma goldman spoke in london shortly after she left the soviet union it was all these lefties standing ovation and when she's like this is not what we want these people are destroying the workers you could hear a pin drop they did not want to hear it but but the other reason what's different from this from conquest and soulist and these others books is this book is a story of hope because why i feel so hopeful in many ways about the west that maybe i'm delusional and that's a separate issue is the fact is this depravity was defeated and it was defeated in our lifetimes and it was defeated relatively painlessly and relatively easily so if you have that model of the victory of all these peoples after so much sacrifice to overthrow these demonic satanic regimes is i think a very one of the happiest endings imaginable right right and the emergence back into freedom of the eastern europeans who are doing well now after another and this was in the 80s we have color footage you could watch it on youtube but you know this again the narrative is too complicated for entities like the new york times to tell that story yeah all right so maybe part of it too with regards to the distinction between the nazi regime and the communist regime i i've thought this tried to think this through a lot is and maybe this is also why we can't exactly remember it it's very difficult to shake the hope that there is a form of hyper organized government let's say that can provide well can provide what that can provide period that that there's a form of social organization that would permanently rescue people from the world of want that seems to be the lot of man i mean now we we have erected a technological enterprise that has freed us from privation to a large degree so it is the case that if we organize ourselves intelligently that we can push back against the tragedies of the world and the logical extension of that or a logical extension of that i suppose is that it's something like a permanently utopian state characterized by the the brotherhood of man right without concern for creed race or color where everyone's equal which starts to become a very you know diff difficult proposition and the communist in principle offered that and it's actually in some ways one of the things that distinguishes them from the nazis because the nazis offered that too but only for a certain group of people whereas the communists did did promote a universal brotherhood you know i i've asked some of my jewish friends why communism was particularly attractive in the soviet union to jewish intellectuals of the time and i would say it's partly because utopian schemes of that sort tend to be more attractive to intellectuals period but the wisest answer i got was that that offering of universal brotherhood where all the distinctions between different creeds and races and religions would be abolished in principle was attractive to people who' been the brunt of ethnic and religious con conflict often murderous for you know for centuries and so we have this longing within us for the emergence of something approximating a paradisal state and then it's very easy to be sucked into two propositions is that one that state could be brought about by organization and government fiat right and two that that what would you say that that organization could provide everyone with what was wanted without there being shattering the negative consequences of handing other people that much power with the holiday season approaching why not include saving a baby's life on your christmas list through our partnership with pre-born an organization that's rescued over 270,000 babies you can do just that every day pre-born network of clinics rescues 200 babies as they compete head-to-head with the abortion giants you see they offer an [music] abortion-inducing you can save a life by sponsoring a mother's ultrasound pre-born also supports both mothers and babies with diapers car seats counseling and more and now through a match your tax deductible gift is doubled too for up to 2 years you are offering double blessings now is the time to put your year-end write-offs to work have your donation matched by dialing pound 250 and saying the keyword baby that's pound 250 baby or donate securely at preborn docomo that's preborn sl [music] jordan so see it's a mystery because you'd think that we could learn why do you think it's so difficult for people to learn that the dream of a worker's paradise that's predicated on something like radical equality almost inevitably degenerates into perhaps inevitably degenerates into something so murderous that you can't even comprehend it because i think it speaks to the inherent narcissism of intellectual because we're the ones who are going to do it right they didn't have me to run the sh they had dumb people oh if only i'm i'm sure you see this every single day with any facult any kind of administration any college we're the one everyone else is stupid but me if i was in charge of this ship we'd land it to shore safely and happily and to speak to why it was so popular with jewish intellectual specifically if the choice was the zar and pilgrims where you're by law mandated to live in a ghetto and so often the police and the citizen are going to ride through that ghetto kill and rape not only with impunity but with the cheers of the populace and the state and the alternative is everyone's going to be equal and you're going to have a stake in making society that works for the sake of all it's not a difficult choice to make for this a certain population yeah well that first comment you made you know that's so i've spent a lot of time especially recently writing about the luciferian intelligence yes and the luciferian intelligence so the reason i use that term in particular is because of milton's characterization of lucifer right so you could think of lucifer as the embodiment of evil b what's his name burkman mar master margarita no there's a book great russian novelist wrote a book called the master margarita in the 1930s and in that book satan himself comes back to earth in ussr but no one believes in him so he can do whatever he wants right and so so vov is his name it's a great book it's like a dovian level book it's a great book but milton characterized lucifer as god's highest angel gone most spectacularly wrong and lucifer is the lightbringer and he's essentially associated with the intellect and the idea the dreamlike idea that milt laid out in his poetic masterpiece paradise lost was that if the intellect attemp attempts to reign supreme it instantly produces hell right that it has to be subordinate to something else now you make a case like that i think implicitly in your book because one of the things that you're proposing is that the if i think and correct me if i'm wrong is that if a society loses its foundation on the presumption of the ultimate worth of the individual per se which is something like a soul concept right right right if that presumption disappears and it's replaced by status presuppositions or even by group identity then hell isn't far away you know i i just read a book by this woman immaculate is her name and she was one of the rwandans who spent 92 days in a 3x4 bathroom she was one of them crammed in there with nine 7 to nine depending on the time other women who were were basically starving to death over that period right and what happened in rwanda even though it was quite a peaceful state although poor was that the notion of group identity became paramount and then one ethnic group was set against the other and what happened in rwanda is reminiscent of the sorts of things perhaps faster and even more brutal possibly than what happened in the soviet union a mill million people killed in a span of mere months right in the most brutal possible way was a consequence of the valorization of group identity you saw the same thing happening in russia right because and this happened soon after the revolution is that the the communists were attempting to eradicate bourgeois individuality and so people started to be classified and judged by group guilt and then almost immediately after the revolution if you were a land owner or property owner or anybody who' had even a modicum of success under under the zars or your family or your well that's the next thing you were classified as an oppressor and as an enemy of the people but immediately it's spread to your family even if you didn't own anything if you had people in your ancestry who ever dared to own anything which meant everyone who was even vag le they identified success with oppression you know which is something that we're trying very hard to do in our culture at the moment too which is absolutely catastrophic we're doing the same bloody things right dividing people into groups making group identity paramount identifying success itself with with oppression you know i mean now and then people who are crooked and parasitical become successful so to speak temporarily but that doesn't justifi for a moment assuming that if one person owns something that another person doesn't that you associate the first person's ownership with theft and and oppression and then of course the communist says you laid out did attempt to eradicate every single form of private property whatsoever and the consequence of that was well we already read about that is that in no time flat you were you and your family were being thrown out into the snow naked for having the tarity to keep like to literally keep a cob of corn on your table so that you might either have something to eat or so that you had some seeds for the next year so so again we're back to the initial problem which is when the evid that this goes your proposition was we can't accept the evidence that these ideological presuppositions go so starkly wrong because of something like the prideful intellect people just show up time and time again they get inced by these ideological theories and they make that move that you suggested which is well if i would have been in charge of the revolution with my indepth and accurate knowledge of the what the niceties of utopian dogma the i would have shephered in the promised utopia and why not try again well i think if you really want to go to the roots it goes to plato versus aristotle right how do you approach knowledge do you look at what's around you and deduce things and draw conclusions so on and so forth or do you start with your mind and this perfect world of ideas and then try to force reality to comport to your ideology and you saw this go through than to hegel then to markx and basically the whole thing is since we know that our you know they called it scientific socialism right that was the whole idea of communism is we're scientific not like this market where you have these little shopkeepers with their prices and you know it's complete mess and food's getting thrown out we're going to work scientifically we're going to have the big brains at the top we're going to figure everything out turn the entire country into either a laboratory or a factory and then when things don't work out thanks to the fact that we have it down someone must be sabotaging it we have the record so you have this concept of scapegoating because since we know so again that's the difference between you know if if my plan doesn't work you know am i going to look back at the plan fix it tweak it because somehow the cars i'm producing aren't working or this arrogant you know idealistic mindset by idealistic i mean this this concept which western don't even understand that ideas are more real than reality since my ideas are correct the output is incorrect someone must be screwing up with what i know is the perfect set of ideas and you can't twist the thumb screws hard enough because you're here to bring a sense of heaven on earth and to save your the country and all of the world so and and stalin even said explicitly that the further along you go in the revolution the more brutal you have to be because it's going to be it's like losing that those last 10 pounds of fat right it's it's going to be that much harder to weed out these capitalistic and bourgeois elements cuz they're going to be so much more hidden so plus plus you have a good excuse then at that point that for things not going well because it's only the real subtle snakes that are left right they're invisibly ruining everything behind the scenes well the other thing that occurs too almost like almost immediately after the revolution when lenard decides that everyone has to be clamped down on is that the true sadists come to the for and so that also raises the spectre in my imagination that it's not merely intellectual arrogance that produces this proclivity to fall hookline and sinker for the communist utopia especially the one that that intellect would be in charge of but that there's a latent sadism that's associated with that pretentious intellect that's looking for a mode of expression and so you know one of the things i used to see in my clinical practice tell me what you think about this and i see thinking like this it's latent in your book you're putting your finger on it from time to time is i'd have clients who were you know say 35 years old they were often men these particular clients women have their own pathology but this this was more a male pathology these were guys who were like they're pretty damn smart in they they were in intelligent in junior high in elementary school junior high and high school you know they were in the top 5% of the class they generally didn't work that hard but they could skate by and everybody knew they were smart and that was really that really constituted their identity and but they never learned how to work and and the fact that they had been differentially rewarded for their intellect in the absence of work meant that they developed a kind of pride that was associated with that intellect you know and so you you can imagine that one of the ways of turning someone into a narcissist is to reward them for something that's intrinsic to them because a lot of whether or not you're intelligent is more or less given to you right i mean you can make someone stupider it's not that easy to make them more intelligent on the iq side if you're if you're if you have an iq of 145 which would put you at about the 99th percentile there's a huge biological contributor to that right and and the benefits of good health so it's a talent or a gift and then you become proud proud of that and then these guys the same guys would often be not successful in their life and that made them bitter because their presumption was always something like well i'm so smart that the world should fall at my feet and then the world doesn't fall at their feet they're not they're less popular with women for example than they think they might be if if the women actually had the sense to see what it was that they were passing up and then that consequence that consequence of having their intellect ejected makes them bitter and the step from bitter to sadist is not very far away you know and you see also you see this idea of being toyed with even in the popular culture so i watched a fair bit of number of episodes of the sitcom the big bang you know the big bang the big bang theory the big bang theory yeah well it was interesting to me because it featured these nerd type characters right who were intellectuals you know they're they're techno intellectuals and tended to be rather unpopular with women and awkward and also awkward socially but they were hyper intelligent and there is this sense of ag grieved intellect that runs through the entire show that's part of the comic trope but it's also extremely true and so i'm wondering if what you think of the proposition that along with the intellect that proposes these utopian schemes right and doesn't like distributed problem solving it wants to acrew all the decision making power to itself because it wants the glory of doing that for itself and it wants that for the status and the fact that that doesn't occur produces this ag grieve nature that can't help but express express itself in sism because lennon's lennon's a great example of that man i mean it took no time at all before he turned in from the like working man's revolutionary which he never was to a sadist whose depths were what what they're they're unfathomable right and and so quickly well he was always talking about how much blood we need to flow even before he got into power this is one of the reasons why they brought him back to russia the germans because they're like once he's there he's going to make a whole muck of it no one ever thought he was actually going to seize power but to your point about sism this is something i do address in the book because there was an evolutionary process so one of the things that the russians did as as you mentioned earlier is they have these things called anot which are little jokes because you can't criticize the state but you can make little jokes about it and get that point through through without the person realizing you're being so devastating your critique and there was one joke where stalin was talking to baria who was his third and most brutal executioner maybe not most brutal competition but stalin lost his pipe and he goes barer you know my pipe's been stolen and then you know barer goes out and the next day stalin calls it in and he's like oh you know i found it it's my drawer he goes but comrad stalin we got three people to confess to it already so meaning bar's most famous quote was show me the man i'll show you the crime but there was an evolutionary process to sadism for the simple reason that if you have 10 people who are interrogators the guy who is the crul and most effective in his infliction of pain psychological physical and otherwise is the one who's going to get the most confessions he's the one who's going to get the most results if i'm at all a decent human being some people are going to stand up to my tortures where if i'm the one who is a complete inhuman monster who will stop at nothing to make sure that that person admit to things which are literally impossible i'm the one who's going to get the promotion so the system itself forced these people to become sadistic because otherwise and the thing is it's not also a matter of well i'm gonna lose my job if i'm not being cruel enough then maybe i'm one of these wreckers maybe i'm counterrevolutionary what's wrong with comrade malice why can't he get any of these confessions well all his colleagues can maybe i shouldn't be trusting you and if you're not trusting me then my wife and my kid are suspect as well so you know to your point it very much the most merciful torturer is the counterrevolutionary yes yeah right definitely well also and one more just one more point because you were talking about it being an assault on private property it goes much deeper than that because it was an assault on civil society on private relationships right because any two people who are talking are a threat to the society to the state because then you have the beginnings of a conspiracy so you the kids as you know very well i'm sure we taught this lesson of pavic marov they taught this in elementary school about the story of this boy who turned in his parents to the police because dad was hoarding grain or something and pic was later murdered by his dad and this kid their statues of him was regarded as valious and the kids were taught you have to turn in your parents to the police if you see them doing anything wrong even if the cost is your life and the same thing it became a crime to be married to an enemy of the people how are you going to plead in in that case right well you should have known that your husband or your wife was engaged in counterrevolutionary activity cuz every citizen needs to be vigilant against the c revolutionaries who are trying to undermine this glorious scientific socialistic society that we're building well then you could see very rapidly if you think about it how love itself would become an anti-soviet act because that's bis love is a very bis value even precisely but even more directly like one of the things that happens if you love someone is that their suffering is going to hurt you yes and so if you love someone in their suffering you're going to listen to them and then in a state that's already perfect if you listen to someone suffer you're basically listening to people utter counterrevolutionary propaganda right and so any genuine sympathy between people that would result in a truthful confession of personal catastrophe would immediately be placed in the camp of revolutionary propaganda and necessarily this is why ran said i ran said that it's impossible for free people to imagine what it's like to live 100% under the dominion of the lie because we can't imagine thank god what it would be like to be so terrified of the truth that while you couldn't even tell it to yourself but but worse perhaps you couldn't tell it to the people most around you who most particularly loved you right children or or parents or spous houses and one of the things that i learned in the writing this book and i'm not sure if even you know this after germany was reunified all the stazi files were made public so you could and the the percent of secret police informers in east germany one and three yeah it was some crazy number it blew the soviet union nazi germany out of the water as se ween thought you point out he goes the stazi were much worse they were germans they're efficient so everyone in that country had to make that choice do i want to look up what did they know about me and as importantly who was the one turning me in and there's this there's a woman nam froud trumman who had a job working in these files and and when the reporter road about he goes how can you work with poison and not yourself be poisoned so she has to warn people and this one woman came in she had gone to jail i think for three or four years because she expressed an interest i don't even e either immigrating or just visiting outside of east germany yeah and she looked up the files and it was the man who she it it was it was the man she still lived with and just that morning he told her have a good day and she's got to go back home to this yeah and she just collapsed in as you would yeah and it's just like again this whole country had to make this kind of fian bargain or decision do i want to know and again dante put betrayers in the lowest level yes but these are people who were like it's been my husband since day one yeah or my brother or you know and the thing that was extremely disturbing and this is something americans do not get but i think have started to get with the result of covid we i i as well was of the belief that these informers had a gun to their head and jordan if they take me in it's like it's either my family or i'm turning in jordan peterson sorry sorry bucko i'm turning you in they were tripping over themselves to volunteer i saw that in toronto these were people who were bored or lonely or just sad or sadistic or just want to feel like they had something over somebody else and that is something that i i think w that's also so that's also this attempt to garner unearned moral superiorities right is like it means if you're with during the covid time you could phone the state on your neighbor and then you could inform them perhaps that your neighbor had gone to their relatives house for a christmas gathering and that they were putting the population in danger and so you got to manage two things at the same time right especially if you had any lurking jealousy whatsoever of that neighbor for any reason whatsoever maybe they're younger better looking or or they didn't suffer as much or god only knows because there's any number of dimensions yeah or right any reason right any reason and then you could you could cause them a lot of trouble which is of course that's quite a lot of fun especially if you don't have anything better to do because now you feel powerful and you are powerful and moral that's the other thing is because you can just pat yourself on the back and say well you know you did the collect you don't pat yourself on the back you go on facebook and brag about it's not even a self pat on the back then everyone else is giving you likes and being like great job you kep me grandma safe yeah yeah right right so that's the kind of thing where i i think americans don't realize how well we have this delusion in the west that in a totalitarian society it's like the freedom loving master and there's like this oppressive guy the the tyrant or an impressive guy with his henchmen putting guns to people's hands all the time and that's nothing could be farther from the truth than that it's like i figured that out in part just when i was reading the gulag archipelago because solit kept making the case that there were nowhere near enough guards to keep the camps running the prisoners ran the camps it's like well that's the definition of a totalitarian state is the prisoners run the camp and so and in a totalitarian state and this is what a totalitarian state is it's not the topdown imposition of power it's the fact that every single person in this society lies about absolutely everything to everyone all the time i was reading the the book of abraham and in that book god is deciding he's going to destroy sodom and gomorrah because they've wandered off the moral path okay and so the implication there is is that a society can adopt modes of being that dooms them to catastrophe all right and we're talking about exactly how that might come about and abraham is concerned about this because he thinks well it doesn't seem fair to obliterate the whole city when there might be innocent people still dwelling in it and so abraham says to god if there's 40 people there if i can go there and i can find 40 god-fearing honest people will you suspend the destruction of the city and god says yes and abraham bargains again to 30 and i think he gets guard down to like 10 but can i interject they there's a part of this story that isn't commonly known they taught us this when i was a kid in yeshiva and i think the number they starts with a 50 and then abraham says how about double check the numbers at home and abraham goes how about five less and guys like god's like okay but what abraham meant was 5050 and you crossed out the five zero so he's really like all right look i know there's no hope for this town but if he's even zero righteous people let's not kill them all yeah well i mean you can understand that and you can well you can also people have ambiguity about the morality of god as presented in the old testament because these destructive waves come but to me that's a reflection of the fact that there are modes of being that will lead to catastrophe but the the implication of the story seems to me to be quite clear which is that in any society even if it's become extraordinarily deviant if there's even a handful of people who don't lie that's enough to turn the tide or or or or or stem the flow right because it means that the grip of hell has become it's not complete enough yet so that all hope whatsoever has been vanquished and you know i think it was solist who said that one man who stops lying can bring down a tyranny and that's but what what that also implies and this is a very perverse thing too is is that the people who are in a totalitarian state are complicit in it every time they agree to participate in the lie and you know you might say well they had to because there is a gun to their head but the thing is there is a gun to their head anyways right i mean and i think that's the same when we face moral conundrums in our current society i saw university faculty back away from the administration onslaught over the course of decades never willing to stand up and say okay i actually think that you guys are pushing farther than i'm willing to go and the rationals were always the same it's like i will be punished unduly for my objection but the consequence of that is is that you're certainly p punished for your silence right you might escape that immediate catastrophe although probably not because i don't think anybody escaped anything in the soviet union but the long-term consequences of abiding by the lie are well it's hell as far as i can tell well a few things first of all you're not going to find anyone more contemptuous of academics than myself a pressing company excluded so to find that they are universally weak is not at all a surprise but to your other point one of the reasons i did write this book was because i am so hopeful about the future and one the counters to that people are like how can you be hopeful we don't have the numbers we're not going to have the numbers and one of the things as you just pointed out is we don't need a majority we just need an alternative if you do have this small cadre of people who refuse to give into the lie who demonstrate there is another chance than the path that we're currently on that is so much more powerful and punch is so much more above its weight than you know a lot of people who are simply ballast and are simply going to go with with the majority decree or the zist happens to be at the moment and we saw this over and over in the countries of eastern europe that self- liberated they did not have the numbers in terms of organization they couldn't have or else they would have been spoted as a whole but poland you know specifically with solidarity this labor movement which brought down first the polish government and then you know was a domino that kind of toppled the the soviet empire it was not a huge percentage of the population and these men suffered you know m hardships and duress but they stuck through it enough that they managed to win so i think the issue with people like soulji nsen and conquest is those books and the black book communism you finish those books you want to put a bullet to your head yeah and what i want to do here is you've only written 80% of the story because the point is this did despite what we were told in the west for decades that the soviet union is perpetual we have to learn to live together they're not going anywhere we tried it with the korean war we tried it with the vietnam war you know we have dayon there's two are you there was a time in our lifetimes when criticizing the soviet union was told was regarded explicitly as inching us closer to nuclear war because they regard as a provocation look you can't antagonize them we just got to figure out how to work together and at a certain point both reagan and that set reagan said do you want to know what my policy is for this the cold war some it's it's simple some might even call simplistic you want to hear it we win and they lose right and he was correct but his entire presidency despite him refusing secretly to retaliate if the russians struck him with nuclear weapons was this commitment to this cannot i i will not have this power of the presidency and abide the continuing existence of this absolutely satanic evil empire let me ask you this question are you a peace with the mindless screen time you spend on your phone every day are you gaining that higher quality of life you know you desire if this sounds familiar i have good news starting on january 1st tens of thousands of men all over the world will start 2024 with a 90-day journey together in search of a more purposeful life it's called exodus 90 and it was built to help men enjoy the freedom of becoming who they were truly made to be exodus 90 guides you in removing the attachments that are holding you back from a better life and it actually works independent research shows that exodus 90 men report considerable shifts after the 90 days a dramatic decrease in time spent on their phones stronger satisfaction rates in their marriages a more meaningful relationship with god and true brotherhoods of men on the same path for the past 8 years exodus 90 has helped more than 100,000 men build their own road map for living with virtue in a culture that offers far too many paths to self-destruction so is it time for your exodus we start january 1st find resources to prepare for exodus 90 at exodus 90.com jordan that's exodus 90.com jordan to start your journey and so what do we do about china we i listen i i i i know i don't know what we do about china i don't let's let's stick to let's stick to one thing i yeah yeah yeah no no well i guess i'll tell you what we do about china we certainly don't valorize them we regard them as a decent state that should we don't use them as a model for emulation during pandemics right we and we don't we criticize and and i think expose their their tactics and machinations internally externally as much as possible but the corporate press is very interested for reasons that i'm not in a position necessarily to aine on to downplay as many chinese atrocities and even just chinese standard operating procedure as much as possible yeah yeah well everyone was hoping for a good amount of time that if china was pulled into the modern western economy that one of the consequences of that would be a turn towards something approximating individual freedom like a gen what an incremental democratization and there was a few years where that looked like a real possibility i mean china lifted itself i shouldn't say that as a consequence of abandoning its stupider policies china managed to free its people enough so that they lifted themselves out of poverty and then for a while it looked promising right and then well and then and then they installed 700 million closed circuit television cameras and built the world's most total surveillance state you know the name of that system is is the same name it's the same name as the system that goes astray in the terminator series skynet skynet no 100% it they called it skynet and the engineers who bu built it said we're building the good sky net this is actually true yeah i know it's impossible to believe wow okay i that wow no no kidding it's like well they're the they're the techno luciferian technologists who think oh this time you know this time we'll get the the surveillance state 100% right but they are getting it right it's in so far as it serves their purposes yeah well yes yes and and and it's drifting quite rapidly into the west as well you know more and more go through like i was in the store the other day that had the ability where you could pay with your palm right we're getting very close to the face id payment systems and everybody thinks well isn't that convenient it's like yeah it's convenient until the centralized databases know absolutely every goddamn thing you're doing every second then they can start putting on differential tax that's calculated according to your hypothetical carbon load or something like that and that's that's a high probability outcome as far as i can tell i mean i'm not pessimistic i think i share your fundamental optimism but boy the slippery slope slide is sitting there right in front of us and we can we could we can take a trip down i don't think it's a slippery slope at all i think it's an elevator shaft yeah well i mean like it's it's really just like that's just the ultimate and slippery yeah yeah yeah an ult an elevator shaft that's bottomless but i i think the other thing i think a lot of people don't appreciate is to what extent people are again this is something that the enlightenment i think gets wrong menin who's one of my great role models he's a journalist from the early 20th century he said the average man does not want to be free he merely wants to be safe so this isn't being done with you know gunto head these are people tripping over themselves because they would rather be convenient because they compete on the metric of obedience so if it's like i'll just do whatever i'm told as long as i don't have to worry about anything what do i care if you keep track of everywhere i go what i buy what i consume nothing i'm consuming is outside the median the bell curve nothing i go where i go is unusual at all doesn't cost me anything and i get taken care of i get to be a pet of those in power if you can understand from their perspective this is a fair this is a great market for them yeah well the the cost is that if you give up all the difficulties of your life let's say because you're looking difficulties and danger of life because you're looking for security and satiation then you don't have anything interesting or meaningful to do so there is no pathway to happiness that's merely a consequence of security and satiation but don't you think it's a brave new world situation where people are perfectly comfortable just living a life of mild pleasure none like a orgastic kind of way but rather than seeking any sort of happiness which is beyond their means i don't know because i don't think it actually works for people well i don't think they have the they don't have the presence of mind to realize that they're living more moment to moment they're not having this kind of long-term strategy a look at their own lives right the ro the the chickens probably come home to roost in times of existential crisis yeah and that's when people do some soul searching and perhaps decide that what it is that they've been satisfying themselves with is insufficient and then there's an opportunity for transformation but not always taken oh well it's it's also c okay let's talk about that a little bit because one of the things i wanted to talk to you about today is know i don't know to what degree you would still ally yourself with the anarchist movement and i want to know well to what degree you do and also i would like to know what that means you open your book with a rand yeah i know that's a bit of a tangential intrusion into that question but she's definitely an arbiter or what a spokeswoman for an individualistic stance i want to talk to you about ir ran because i have some ideas about that that i want but i i'm also curious you you you obviously regard a focus on the individual as the appropriate medication against this kind of status intellectual luciferian utopianism and i think that's i think that's appropriate but i want to know what what your what your vision of an alternative is and why you why you adopted that particular vision well i don't know that i have a vision per se i'm not a central planner but in terms but what anarchism means to me and i i do 100% regard myself as an anarchism is it is an approach to life it is an approach to treating people peacefully it is a a recognition that political authority is inherently illegitimate although sometimes it is powerful and it is regarding the our existence as an amazing opportunity and to live life to its fullest and to realize that to take that away from somebody else is a huge you know moral outrage so that is kind of what anarchism means to me okay okay and and rand was asked at one point she goes if i had to sum up my worldview or whatever term she used in one word it would be this individualism so yes that is exactly yeah so that's where okay okay so so let me delve into that a little bit also just important because you know burkman and goldman there's this boomer idea that more government is leftwing and less government is right-wing and it puts goldman and burkman on the right wing it's just this weird thing because they want hitler to be a leftist because that right wi is good hitler's bad hitler's leftist that kind of mindset point being it was it's very important for me to give credit the fact the first critics of the soviet union with firsthand experience were hardcore unmitigated lefties these emma goldman and b men were both bloodthirsty happy to slit throats but they're saying we're doing this in the sake of revolution to kind of bring about a society that works for everyone not against the workers themselves that we are championing this is not what we're for so they weren't you know kind of this pansy type of lefties they were you know but emma goldman gave a talk in union square and she told the audience she goes go to the capitalist and ask for work and if they don't give you work ask for bread and if they don't give you bread take bread so she's like you do not have a moral obligation to starve so they had this contemptuous why are people starving when there's millionaires out there was their mindset so the fact that these people at great cost to themselves and to their status in this kind of workers movement were so vocal about denouncing what they had seen firsthand and were called puppets of the capit so why do you think that's important i mean you spend a lot of time on burkeman and goldman have i got the first name yes alexander burkman emma goldman yeah right okay okay you spend a lot of time on them and you do show that they were as representatives of the autonomous worker let's say they were appalled by what they saw in the soviet union and you you you're you seem to be making the case that that's important because of their stress on on individualism or because you also wanted not to you know fall prey to the delusion that was only the right that was standing exactly i i hate this idea that right good left bad or vice versa there were the the fight against totalitarianism was a series of dots that are often completely counterintuitive and i think it's very important historically when people fight these individuals who fight against these kind of atrocities that they give give they okay so you're looking at something like attempting to replace the right-wing versus the terrible communists narrative with something more like people who are concerned with the individual against the collect okay fine i see i see okay so now here's i rate read rand ein rand's books the fountain head and atlas shrug yeah in i think it's the third time i read both of them and i read them within the last couple of months oh wow yeah yeah so i was you now and then i i'm looking for a i don't know a romantic read maybe that's somewhat intellectually challenging and now and then i'll pick up one of her books and she's a curious figure to me because ir rand had every reason to despise the soviet union and was a very good counter voice to their machinations but but well and you know i got introduced to her books it was quite interesting so i worked for the socialists when i was like 14 till i was 16 before i figured out that i didn't know enough to presume that the way i wanted to arrange the world in a utopian fashion was credible and i figured that out by the time i was about 17 i thought well what do you know you don't have a job i had little jobs you know you don't have a business you don't have a family you don't have any it's like what the hell do you know really right so okay anyways the person who gave me ir rand's books was this woman sandy notley she was the mother of one of alberta's recent premier a socialist premier and she was the wife of the only elected socialist official in alberta when i grew up and i asked her what she gave me sol nits and and huley and orwell like she was an educated woman and and she gave me iran's books which i read when i was like 13 and you know they're i found them compelling you know they've got that they're they're romantic adventures fundamentally with an intellectual bent and i like the anti- collective ethos that was embedded in them and then i've read them like i said a couple of times since then so here's the problem i have and you can help me sort this out like i certainly agree with you that a society that isn't predicated on something like recognition of the intrinsic and superordinate worth of the individual is doomed to catastrophe right and so but then but here's the rub as far as i'm concerned and this is what i had really had a problem with especially this time when i went through rents books is like her g john g for example and francisco den conia her her and and the who who's the architect howard ror roor ro r her heroic capitalists essentially they're not precisely heroic capitalists they're heroic individualists who compete in the free market okay and that's and that's fine and you can see the libertarian side of that and i'm also a free market advocate and partly because i think that distributed decision making is a much better computational model than centralized planning obviously not obvious right well yeah it should be but it should be it's not obvious to utopian luciferian intellects but it's obvious even if you just think about it from a computational perspective i just say the smartest person is ignorant of 99.9 % of knowledge yes exa exactly well that's exactly it is that precisely why you want it distributed okay so that's partly what i want to go into so now the the randy and heroes identify themselves as fervent individualists and they and you stop me as soon as i get any of this wrong or in some way you don't disagree with they're pursuing their own selfish ethos right okay so that's the rub to me because and i i would think i'm going to think about this psychologically and neurophysiologically so just to make it complicated okay so the first question would be well what exactly do you mean by the individual and the self okay so when a child develops let's say when a child first emerges into the world they're essentially a system of somewhat disconnected primary instinctual subpersonalities right and so they with that with the nent possibility of a uniting ego identity personality something like continued a continued a a continuity of memory across time and but that has to emerge now it seems to emerge as a consequence of neurophysiological development and experiential maturation and so you know the child comes equipped into the world say with the sucking reflex because it's its mouth and tongue are very wired up so that's where the child is most conscious that's why kids when they can put everything in their mouth because they can feel it and investigate it far far before they have control over their eyes or their arms because their arms sort of float around and so what happens is they they they're born as a set of somewhat independent systems and then the independent systems partly under the influence of of social demand integrate themselves right okay now so and and then like by the time a child is two that child is still mostly disintegrated emotional systems and so if you watch a 2-year-old and i use two for a specific reason what you see is that they cycle through basic motivational states so a child is often like a child whose demand oriented motivational states are satiated will play right and play and explore but then they get tired and they'll cry or they'll get hungry and they'll cry or they'll get angry and they they'll have a tantrum or you know or they'll burst into tears well i said they'll cry and or they'll get anxious right and so they're cycling through these primary motivational states now we understand that to some degree neurop physi physiologically because the older the brain system the more likely it is to be operative in infancy right so like the rage system or the system that mediates anxiety or the system that mediates pain those come into being pretty early but it's hard for them to get integrated okay now here's the problem and i don't know how to distinguish individualism from hedonism and i don't know how to distinguish hedonism from possession by one of these lower order motivational states so when when rand says we should be able to pursue our own selfish needs she's kind of taking a class she didn't say selfish needs she saids self-interest okay okay so fine okay okay so so that no well no she i would say she moves between those two because there are never says needs and pos okay she may never say needs attacks that word all the time okay okay right right fair enough okay okay so i'll back off on the need side that was ill chosen and she does she makes absolutely bloody sure well wait a second she say your needs are not a blank check on my i i know i know but does but but she doesn't does she say simultaneously that i have no right to pursue my needs she doesn't use that word she says you pursue your self-interest to the best of your abilities okay but she also uses the word selfish yes okay okay so f in ctic way right okay right absolutely absolutely i would just want to make sure that we're proceeding on grounds that we both regard as appropriate so the liberal types the scottish liberals believe that if people were encouraged to pursue their self-interest that that would produce a a reg a self-regulating system now ran seems to accept that as a proposition yes yes so if people are freely able to pursue their self-interest then a system of free exchange will emerge out of that that has the appropriate qualities of governance yes she says this explicitly on donah hugh she was asked saying that if people pursu their own self-interest there wouldn't be any oppression they wouldn't be war they wouldn't be any hitler goes there should they be less and she goes there wouldn't be any yeah well look when i'm negotiating with someone for a business deal let's say or you know when i'm trying to formulate a strategy that enables me to work happily together with someone over the long run i'm hoping that they'll be thrilled with the deal like i'm not trying to win of course i think well i would like to set you up in a situation so that you could pursue our mutual goals completely of your own accord then i don't even have to watch you right because you're doing things for whatever reasons you have but this this is the thing this is this is what i don't quite understand is that that self-interest okay so it seems to me that for that self-interest to work then it has to be a self-interest that's commensurate with the structure that would emerge if everyone was pursuing their self-interest simultaneously you you see what i mean it's not everyone well okay okay okay so so let's say you and i make an arrangement and it's a long-term arrangement and at one point you decide that it's in your selfin to violate that agreement because you can garner an intense short-term gain as a consequence but there's a long-term cost okay that's fine okay so ruin this relationship and also there's a long-term cost in terms of myself what's the cost the cost is i'm no longer a person of integrity i'm not a man of my word so rand there's two rand quotes where she go first quot she says that man is a being of self-made soul and she also is in the fountain head which is about hard work the architect that a building has integrity just like a man and just a seldom once your business gets to a certain size cracks start to emerge and things you used to do in a day are now taking over a week if this

seeing her interest is something that's nested inside a larger scale conceptualization of integrity yes and and then okay and so in fact the whole point of the fountain head is she's contrasting these two types of selfishness the first is peter keading who's this basic striver social climber who has no internal self at all no values other than what he sees around him in fact the working title of the fountain head was secondhand lives was working in hollywood and she asked the woman who she was working with and there's just kind of this like pin drop moment where she's like i'm looking in the face of the devil where the woman goes i'll tell you what i want if someone has a a a cloth coat i want a fur coat if you have one car i want two if your house is 500 square feet i want a th foot house and rand is like oh my i've she's like this is evil someone who has no self and whose values are strictly a function of of those around her hold on as opposed to howard roor who is selfish in the sense that he pursues his own goals and values in accordance with his moral code and and i think those are the two definitions of selfish i know fine fine so let's tell c certainly keing is portrayed in rand as nothing but a but he's the kind of social climber who will do anything to gain comparative status in his profession but he will never be able to tell you why he wants the status what is he going to do with it it's it's kind of just in and of itself good but he has no values well okay so that's that's the thing that's that's that's interesting to me because i don't think i don't think that it's appropriate to presume that the mere search for social status is not self-interest now i'm not i know you're making a more sophisticated argument than that but i want to elaborate it completely so i could say i'm going to play devil's advocate against rand and and for now we do that okay so i would say well on what grounds are you criticizing peter king's decision self-interested decision to prioritize status above all else that's what he thinks is appropriate apparently and so on what grounds is that an inappropriate conclusion well i would even say that he thinks it i think it's more that he's kind of taken this subconscious subconsciously from the ethos he does not someone who thinks these things through he just goes with what everyone else tells him fine i got you i've got no objections to that i think that's how he's portrayed but what on what grounds do you believe that that's inappropriate because just because his self-interest doesn't match that of and you know peter keing is an archetyp character in the r universe right i mean he's duplicated in many other characters like ellsworth tui for example it's like a meta king essentially al he's the spider behind the scenes who's orchestrating everything but he claims to be selfless but he's certainly pursuing comparative status like king is but but but and there's a very powerful overt and covert implication in ram that the path that king and tui takes is inappropriate and the path that roor takes or friend isco dean i'm probably mixing up the characters in the book at the moment is the path of like true individual heroism that's the romantic adventure part but the exactly the reason they're they're both self-interested they're not self-interested because peter keing doesn't have a self there's no one there that's okay that right that was my mystery so so what does it mean for there to be something there right because so he's reduced he's reduced himself to one dimension which is social comparison but that's not nothing that's one dimmension but it's it's nothing to him it doesn't matter to him it only matters to other people so therefore it matters to him this is not coming from the call's not coming from inside of the house and this is where i would bring in albert kimu because i i sometimes i keep talks about networking and one of the advice i give people i say if you know someone's in town for their birthday right i go i always take out that person for their birthday and i do for selfish reasons right and everyone laughs and i go the reason i do it is because don't you want to be the guy who takes people out for their birthday awesome you could what's it going to cost you 25 bucks in an hour so the whole point of the kimo's kind of absurdism is that life is inherently meaningless but this is a wonderful opportunity because you can be the kind of person that you want and it's not necessarily that hard it's just being consistent so if you want to be someone who's high status who no one genuinely who no one who genuinely knows you likes or admires knock yourself out at a certain point the brain can only dute itself it's counterproductive it's counter or do you want to be the kind of person who when faced with tough decisions as i have in my life and as you have in your life we're like you know what 20 years from now i'm going to look back at this fork in the road and i'm going to chastise myself if i buckle and do the weak thing even though it's going to cost me something in the medium term these are two different paths that brand portrays okay okay and i think that's a very good moral code to live by okay so let me extract out some principles from that and you tell me what you think so one of the things that i proposed was that you know a very young person 2 years old is still a relatively unintegrated yes conflict of internal dimensions motivational dimensions that's a good way of thinking about it okay now we also hypothesize that the problem with keing and tue for example is that they sacrifice to social status so they become onedimensional and you portrayed it as a false dimension and you said there's no self there okay so here's a hypothesis about why it's a false why it's false okay and you tell me what you think about this okay so imagine that there that there's a set of constraints that are implicit in the natural and the social world such that if all these underlying motivational systems want to optimize their inter relationships and they want to optimize their inter relationships in a social world and they want to optimize their inter relationships across time so iterates that a pattern will that a necessary pattern will emerge now i think that's the pattern that your conscience calls you on when you deviate from by the way and i also think it's the pattern that makes things interesting to you in the world so imagine that out of this internal conflict of spirits that's a good way of thinking about it there's a way of a mode of integration and that's that will satisfy all these internal systems in the optimal possible manner and then there's an instinct that feeds that development that calls to you by making things interesting to you that would force you to develop in an integrated direction or that emerges as conscience if you fail to do it and that that's not a unidimensional system of value it's a multi-dimensional system of value and it's a multi-dimensional iterable system of value that also works so that if you play that game and i play that game and we occupy the same territory both of our games will improve right so it's not a zero sum it's not a zero sum optimization okay so then this is where i have part maybe problems with the concept of anarchy per se so let me tell you why so does any of that seem inappropriate to you that seems r that that seems fine okay so okay so let me tell you why i have a harder time placing anarchy in that in in that position okay so i did this seminar on exodus with a group of people and one of the things we did was elaborate up a conceptualization that's derived from the exodus story that's the basic basis of catholic social teaching or much of it as it turns out called subsidiarity and subsidiary out of a particular story in the exodus narrative and so what you have in the narrative is the israelites who have the habits of slaves and so they're basically you could think about them as a mass of peter kings they're they're like they're they're only after short-term gratification right and so they have the habits of slaves they they've never planned they've never integrated you could say maybe the true self is absent that might be another way of thinking about it and so they try to make moses into another pharaoh yeah right in the desert right he sits as their judge and he has to work out all their problems okay so that's the scenario this is happening while they're in the desert now moses' father-in-law whose name is jethro comes along and he says you have to stop doing this he says this to moses he says there's two reasons number one if you take all that responsibility and power onto yourself it'll kill you plus you'll just set yourself up as another pharaoh by taking all this respons possibility that the israelites are abdicating and then you'll be back in the same situation you were in to begin with and two if you take away that decision-making power from the israelites then they'll just stay useless slaves forever right okay so you can't do that right and for two reasons you don't get to be a tyrant and they don't get to be slaves okay okay so then he but then he proposes something very specific as in consequence he says take all your tens of thousands of people and make them into a hierarchical society and so get them to group themselves in groups of 10 voluntarily right so pick your 10 people and then from amongst yourself in the 10 nominate the best of the 10 okay so now you've got your 10 people and leader now all the people are divided into tens now take the leaders put them in groups of 10 have them do the same thing do that all the way up to you cuz you're the voice of god at the moment and then if the israelites have a have a dispute they settle it if they can't settle it by themselves they settle it with their guy who's one in 10 and if he can't figure out how to do it he goes to one in 100 and then one in a th now so you have a social hierarchy in place right but it's a voluntary social hierarchy right and every single level of the hierarchy has a requisite responsibility and that makes a that makes a pyramidal structure that's the alternative to the tyrant and the slave okay so now there's maybe there's two ways you could conceptualize the individual and this is where i have the problem with the anarch anarchical viewpoint i think that the identity that rand is promoting is actually a reflection of the harmonious operation of that whole hierarchy right the whole thing it's not it can't be simply located at the level of the individual because if you're going to comport yourself in a harmonious manner like we are in this conversation like at the moment i know you're not subjugating your individuality to the demands of the conversation because then it wouldn't be a conversation right but you are bringing your i am subjugating some extent this is your show i can't just talk about whatever i want right right right well well but but you're doing it voluntarily and you know the rules of the game and you're doing it because you have your own reasons so so i wouldn't say i don't think it's it's so not so much subjugation as it is your choice to play the same game i'm playing okay so this is a hierarchy of games right right well i set the frame for this particular interaction right and i would return the favor if i was if if you were hosting this right right but but you're doing it voluntarily correct but but then see the thing about rand and this is the same thing by the way that's done by virtually every psychologist just so you know it is that rand doesn't spend much time detailing out the necessary structure of the subsidiary hierarchy that would have to be produced to transform an emphasis on individual orientation into a complex and sophisticated society right and i don't think it's enough to say if people were just pursuing their own enlightened self-interest that society would automatically harmonize because you could also imagine that okay so that that that sit with you it's not automatic at all it's every group if is starbucks an automatic hierarchy no it's thousands of employees working together and they create this international organization where if i go to the starbucks in washington it's going to be the same as roughly as i go to starbucks in paris right so these hierarchies do emerge voluntarily but it's not automatic at all it's just if you're looking at it from the the eagleee perspective it's just these little dots but when you get more granular perspective it's infinite people choosing to work together to create this kind of superstructure yes right okay okay well so so automatic is it's not automatic at all fine fine well that that's i'm perfectly happy to accept that because i don't i also don't think it's automatic i think that those structures have to be set up and and maintained yes and in keeping with an ethos i think okay okay okay so one of the point is this is why culture is so important and having this kind of promation of ideas and morals and values because if you just have people who are all very uh high time preference and just are not thinking past the next moment you're not going to be able to build a society out them unless you get rid of that first cuz if you're only thinking to the next 5 minutes in this kind of like maybe someone who's been in prison all his life and don't have been trained not to think long term it's going to be almost impossible to have any kind of working relationship because he'd rather have that candy bar today than two candy bars tomorrow because he knows he's not going to see tomorrow okay okay so so you you you brought in the the concept of time preference which you think is absolutely appropriate well yeah because crucial okay why why did you to the conclusion that that first of all why don't you define time preference so everybody knows exactly what you're talking about and then i want to know why you came to the conclusion that there's a reason that you brought the time preference discussion into this discussion so maybe you could elaborate what that is i always get them backwards there's high time preference and low time preference point being like we see this with kids in inner cities who they aren't sure they're going to ever see old age the people they deal with are not trustworthy so if they're offered look i'll give you either a candy bar today or tomorrow if you wait one day you'll have two candy bars they will overwhelmingly take the one today bur hand because the odds that the person is going to be there tomorrow or is trustworthy are quite low and this extrapolates in a very nefarious way because if you're living moment to moment you're not going to school to plan for medical school how long do you have to go to medical school if you're a doctor it's years and years you're just thinking just getting past tomorrow is a function also of poverty when someone's worried about their next meal it's very hard to maintain that vision of what i'm going to be doing when i'm 40 right so that is that concept of the crucial right okay so the the and this is also why having a stable society is important and why governments are often a problem take inflation if i don't know how much a dollar is going to be worth 10 years from now how am i going to make a contract with you that yeah well right well you're also punished then for foregoing gratification right that's one the terrible things about inflation is that you actually punish the people who are the conscientious people upon who labor society would be imagine you tell me that okay in a year from now you're going to deliver 10 yards of silk but the definition of a yard today is 36 in but tomorrow it might be 3 in it's just like i i or or or 50 in i can't make any kind of plan if the definition of a yard changes so if the definition of what a dollar changes year to year and it loses its value you can't make long-term planning because if you say i'm going to give you a million dollars 10 years from now i don't know what that means it could be mean it could be worthless right right right right right okay so now back to this neurophysiological spectrum okay so of one more point rand is very much and this is where i very much par with her very much a child of the enlightenment she has this enlightenment delusion in my opinion that if a bunch of people sit down and they're given all the data and they hash it out they're all going to come to the same conclusion and i don't think that hold imp yeah i don't think that holds up at all no no but but the but you're outlining a you're outlining the the the the structure of the proper constraint through which that mass of data would be interpreted so your correct okay so well so so because the once you bring time preference into it you you're starting to work in the domain that implicitly assumes that there is a higher order integration so these these initial systems these initial motivational systems they're very shortterm so and they want short-term gratification so when a baby whales when it cries it wants to be satisfied now but can i say one thing this is the distinction rand draws between hedonism and her philosophy because she thinks that the more moral a person the more longrange his thought whereas hedonism is very much pleasure of the moment and i'm going defend hedonism a little bit because the term gets a bad rap hedonism isn't co orgies hedonism is martha stewart where you're having coffee and and book club with your friends and having the pleasure of that's more this okay but would put you you can actually separate those tech because that kind of hedonism would be more on the aesthetic end right and it's more sophisticated i'm talking about pleasure per se isn't bad right with this epicurian idea of hedonism how was pitched you know thousands of years ago it wasn't at all this maximizing pleasure the moment right right right okay yeah well so so okay so we'll define the kind of hedonism that we're objecting to as blinkered by the short term but i also hate this kind of wasp susp i of heis and this pure t like if you're having pleasure you're doing something wrong and it's like pleasure is wonderful people should do it more in the sense of i'm reading a nice book i'm enjoying a fire i'm having a walk with my friends these are all well everything in its place is the prop notion for that right right and so so the demand for hedonic gratification shouldn't be put forward in a manner that sacrifices the overall integrity it's the reward yeah yeah i worked hard and now i get to watch a stupid tv show and not feel any guilt about it because i did my work for today right right well and it's necess no shame about it yeah yeah well the psych psychologists know if they're wise that you you want to have all the forms of motivation that are available to you working to push you forward and and certainly the draw so technically the source of reward that people work hardest for isn't satiation reward you know they would if they were starving you know like you can you can put animals and human beings into a situation while they'll work like single-mindedly for satiation right like if you haven't had anything to drink for 2 weeks right you're going to be pretty motivated that aside this is something the soviets understood very well that is something yes definitely yes well tyrants understand that very well yes yes because they they they they leverage the force of these basic motivational systems right mostly the sort of pleasure that people pursue is the pleasure of noting that they're moving forward towards a desired goal okay there's a whole neurophysiological system set up that mediates that and it's the system activated by drugs like cocaine that's the dopaminergic system and it it has its origins in the same system that mediates voluntary exploratory activity right so it's a very ancient system it it emerges it's hypothalamic the hypothalamus is a part of the brain that sits right on top of the spinal cord it's an absolutely ancient system and the pleasure that we generally are most motivated by does activate these systems and if you want people to be actively engaged in a meaningful way in their own life and in their social pursuits then you want to make sure that that system is operating in the direction of those pursuits right so then one of the things that happens when people make an agreement is that they set up a shared aim right so we our aim today was to have an interesting conversation that we could share with people okay so that sets up our nervous system so as long as we're uttering words in a manner that moves us towards that aim then we're going to stay engaged and enthusiastic because that well because that the system that produces enthusiasm and engagement is now on board in relationship to that aim okay so imagine this then so that your aim becomes the participation in the social system that's optimally balanced when people are pursuing their enlightened self-interest in a manner that's of maximal social utility that stretches across the longest possible time span i i i i don't have any use for social utility i don't think that term has any meaning okay this is okay so so so that what does that mean let let me explain that and you tell me what you think about it okay so let's go back to this idea of subsidiarity right this hierarchy yes okay so you can think about that in your own life so maybe you have a an intimate relationship with someone might be a child or a parent or or sibling or or your spouse okay now so that would be the primary domain of social interaction all right so now how would you characterize your how do you characterize that relationship like you want it to sustain over a long period of time you have an obligation to it you have a responsibility to it like and is that the beginning of the polity that like just that dietic relationship if you want to be a good person i think yeah then you do have a kind of again this speaks to what kind of person do you want to be do you want to be someone that your family can admire and rely on and knowing that when this hits the fan they'll be in a position to reciprocate do you want to be that provider or that source of strength again this is your opportunity to be that person or do you want to be the guy who's not there for his kids you have that opportunity too and at the end of the day you're going to have to look yourself in the mirror or avoid make or avoiding eye contact in the mirror and face or waking up at 3:00 in the morning being tormented by your conscience if you still have one or or deadening it with alcohol or whatever the situation might be so yeah so so then that that was what i was trying to portray as a social good but it's i i mean the the social good is the consequence not the goal how about how about the good is the harmony between the social manifestation and the individual manifestation so look part of the reason i've been thinking this through is because i think that the modern definition of mental health subjective is sorely wrong because i think that mental health is actually the harmony in that hierarchy of being and not something that you have in your head i mean ran called her philosophy objectivism so i completely agree with you i i don't i think anytime you're introducing subjectivism to a large extent you're treading on thin ice okay so so then let's go to the object objective in relationship to what like where's the objective reality that that ran's pattern of behavior is aiming to to what would you say to adapt to everywhere we live in it there's nowhere else to go okay so it that seems to me to be the same notion as this subsidiary structure so so we can walk through it so you've got your wife let's say okay and you make a bond with her that's long run and your narrow individuality is integrated into the broader diad of that we're all then diagrams okay okay then you do that with there's you and your co-workers there's you and your employees there's you and your friends there's you and your daughter you and your city you and your town right okay peers right so we agree on that so that's the polity that i'm thinking about so how do you it's fluid it's not it's not it's it changes all the you could job podcast get divorced right but there's principle it's not entirely fluid because no it's not entirely fluid right right it's hopefully it's optimally fluid sure right right right okay so that's fine and that optimal i would say say part of the marker of its optimality is fluidity yes right right that's why the dow is water right it's not stone it has this capacity to adapt and and sometimes you have to cut your losses and that's fine the the sun cost just because you've been in a relationship for 10 years does not mean well i should continue it for in perpetuity right at least any relationship i don't mean marriage it could be just your the contractor you work with or a lawyer right well so your your point seems to me to be that your alliance in any of those subsidiary organizations shouldn't be a prison correct but it's something that's that should be that's something that thrives and needs maintenance and and is re reborn every single day like every single day you anyone has the option to get divorced or to not talk to their kids or to fire whoever or to so so if you accept the necessity of these embedded relationships multiple embedded relationship okay so why do you conceptualize that why exactly i'm not trying to catch you out here i'm curious well why do you conceptualize that as anarchy voluntary yeah okay fine so that's the fundamental princi yes yeah fine fine fine that's it that is okay so so here's a rule of thumb so this is actually a rule of thumb that we implemented in this arc enterprise that i've been trying to promote let's say is that all policy that's not based on voluntarism is to be regarded at minimum as suboptimal if it's force if there's any use of force ied well so so let me take that emma gold let me well i think the principle of volunteerism is extraordinarily important right because it's actually a sign of the optimization of the relationship correct yeah yeah okay okay but all right fair enough yeah but wait now wait is i think we should cut it here i got what i wanted isolation can only go in a bad direction i there's a complication here's the complication all right so so well it's unfortunate there's a complication but there there is a complication so imagine that if we engage in in interactions voluntarily right that we can cooperate sure okay now imagine we set up a whole domain of cooperators who who's we you you you and i have another friend sure right and and we have a conversation with nine people right and we're having a good conversation okay fine now we're all playing by the rules that enable that conversation to continue and the rules include the fact that anybody can step out of the conversation whenever they don't want to participate okay right so it keeps so it keeps the playful and and aimed in a positive direction and self- sustaining okay now we get one person in there okay who plays status game that's okay right okay now so and let's say for the sake of argument let's call him lex that that that that game what a jerk that that that that brings the conversation in some ways to a halt okay so these these dynamic voluntary model associations have been moded so you can imagine imagine you could set up a stable society of cooperators but the problem is if you drop one person in there who's a shark like a short-term hedonistic psychopath they can take everything they can take everything okay so you said you said you can't use force what do you do with people who don't play fair if you're at a party let's go this party scenario and there's someone there who's just being an ass yeah whoever's home it is it's their domicile at a certain point you tell them get the f out okay but but then then you have the problem of the necessity of force in that force it's your home if if they're a trespasser at that point you have no i'm not saying it's unj okay let's no one has the right let's define okay define okay we we already agreed that an optimized relationship is dependent on voluntary asset correct and we also agreed that and that they're fluid right and they're fluid so my right to be here on this show is fluid and any moment you could be like malice you know what you are really crossing a line we're cutting it here get the hell out and that's not force it's still your this is your house your show okay then we need to define force no that and that's what private property does private property delineates who has the position to determine what happens within that area okay your house and you say if you want to be in my house you have to wear an orange shirt i'm not giving an explanation i have a choice a i can show up an orange shirt or i can push your buttons and be like i'm going to show up in purose see well so you're you're defining private property as i believe as a domain where you are sovereign yeah well and so what so when what that means is that you have the right and maybe even the responsibility to use requisite force in that situation to maintain the necessary peace that's a precondition for voluntary association i wouldn't even call it force because if i'm trespassing i'm the one who's initiating force if i go to someone's home where i'm not welcome i'm the one who's using force i need a definition of force because look if you throw prisoners in prison sure because they continually violate other people's property they're the ones who initiated force by by going after somebody else assuming that these people were actual criminals you know that making that assumtion some actual rapist and now they were locked into a cage they're the ones who initiated force as as a who started this chain and what is done to them as a consequence which is let's assume it's done to rational and above aboveboard manner is a consequence of their actions so okay okay so so you're implying i believe that the use of force this is why we need a word because like if i have to throw you out of here most people would say by the normative meaning of the word force that i use force to throw you out now you're cl not in moral sense right right not in the moral sense right right so then the the issue becomes i've been welcomed in your in in your home right at a certain point if i outstay my even if i'm you're like hey malice come crash on my sofa you know what i mean i know you're here at a certain point if i'm blasting music or outstaying my welcome and you're like okay your right to stay here has been revoked and if i start squatting i'm the one who is infringing on your pr right so for you to either yourself or call private security or the police to be like get this guy out of here that's not initiating so that's minimum necessary self-defense something like that yeah well that's a good principle i mean i think i think one of the other principles of appropriate social organization is minimum necessary force so your claim see but the problem with government the thing is is that people won't see we already agreed that the proper social organization is one based on voluntary ascent and if you're crashing on my couch you might not want to leave voluntarily so i'm transgressing against again you're the sovereign is your home that's what private property adjudicates who's whose opinion matters yeah and if it's your house it's yours period yeah right right right right well period within some some appropriate limits and i think we have actually worked those out quite well you know generally speaking especially in the united states with our definition of what constitutes private property so see i'm i'm still i'm still i'm still having trouble with the domain of how you organize policy if your emphasis is on what's voluntary people break the rules ebay does this all the time if i buy a fossil as i have recently from czech republic and that fossil turns out to be fake i can adjudicate it through ebay i could adjudicate it through paypal where i paid or i could adjud through adjudicate through my credit card company none of these are governments but they're all in a position to reverse that transaction this is an example of anarchism in practice because the idea that i'm going to sue someone in czech republic for a fossil is is no possibility of that happening okay so this definition that you use that equates anarchism with voluntary volunteerism do you think that that's i wouldn't say necessarily that that's how anarchism is viewed in the popular culture and by that's by design just the say way the soviet union is viewed as somehow infinitely preferable to nazi germany in the popular culture right so okay so you're because those who are in power i wondered why you were relatively easy to get along with for an anarchist and it's fundamentally because you predicate your notion of anarchism on voluntary aset but they all did i mean emma goldman and berkman did as well they they wanted a society based on peace and they viewed the capitalists as exploiters so even at the end of the day they this is one of the reasons berkman and goldman were both yelling at lennin they're like we're for their version they call anarchism and socialism regard to synonymous in that school at the time therefore we're for the individual complete free speech emma goldman fought to have f fight the draft in world war i she was correct and for to teach women how to prevent pregnancy at the time it was a felony to distribute condoms or to explain birth control from a doctor to someone who wanted to prevent a pregnancy so and books were banned you know you can't use the mals for ulyses james joyce was banned for example so that was their version of anarchism and they're spot on in that regard that the government s has the position to tell you what you can or can't say to whom right so so your your claim pro probably is something like it seems to me that you're claim is something like you have the right and perhaps the responsibility to respond in a manner that restores the peace that's a good way of thinking about it if someone violates the principles by which any interaction could continue on the basis of voluntary asset i i don't know i i don't know if i can follow that train of thought but well i'm trying to figure out the exactly the justification for me being able to throw you off your couch my couch it's like your your point is that the fact that you've overstayed your welcome means that you've already introduced an element of compulsion and force okay exact correct well and the reason that that would be wrong is because it violates that principle of voluntary asset i no longer want you on my damn couch right right so you've already language right right exactly you've already you've already you've already initiated a process that violates that that integrity the integrity of the relationship right and so then i'm not only justified but required i would say well that's a tough one right because yeah well you can imagine let's say in in the situation that you already described is you did someone a favor and they're in on your couch and they they've been there for 3 months and they didn't get a job and they're eating like cheetos and it's like it's just not a good situation what what the alternative is like it's it's it's toronto and i'm going to be on the street and i'm going to die right so like that might be a situation you're like okay maybe put let me put you in a hotel i can yeah yeah yeah no no fair enough but but the requirement would come because maybe the reason you're not calling me on my behavior is because you're afraid or because you don't want to you don't want to appear mean or you don't want to hurt my feelings so that when you're but when you're in your room at night you're like pissed off at yourself and your conscience is gnawing at you because you actually have something to do right and it's time to call this person out because you are vi you are violating your integrity okay so that's what i meant by the responsibility okay yeah yeah i didn't mean a deterministic responsibility i meant because we're we're elaborating the idea that there is a principle of long-term integrity here that's actually real or maybe the most real thing what kind of person do you want to be at the end of the day is what it comes down to and this is again why i'm such a kimu fan and the idea that existence precedes essence in i don't know if i'd say that literally but the idea that we have we the i always use this metaphor and i think it's very informative where there's two types of people you go to top of mountain top and you see the blank canvas and a bunch of paints and a certain mentality like what is this this is just stupid and the other type is like this is a one f opportunity i can paint this mountain side i can paint something abstract i can paint myself i can paint you know just this blade of grass and that is what life is like that that kimo's version of life being inherently meaningless is a great opportunity for any of us to be the kind of person to a certain extent that we want to be and this is very very exciting because we're not really taught i mean you're taught in school that you could do anything you want and that's kind of a lie but in terms of you can be the kind of person you want to be morally that everyone does have that capacity to be and we're all going to make mistakes and that's what institution is for okay so let me ask you why you conceptualize that as meaningless and why it is that because the it sounds to me like the the meaning of what you mean by meaningless is something like the freedom to choose the direction yes correct okay but but but but you've already made it clear that you don't regard that okay so back to the exodus story i i'll tell you something that h also that happens in exodus very interesting so when god enables moses to stand up to the pharaoh he informs him that there are certain words he should use he says let my people go right it was very famous phrase but that's not what he says he says let my people go so they may worship me in the wilderness and that's that's very much relevant to this issue of subsidiarity because what it posits is that there's a form of escape from tyranny that isn't well i would say anarchic hedonism let's try that out right which is what happens when the golden calf gets worshiped right is that everybody reverts to immediate gratification and everything descends into hell it's an ordered freedom and that's a vision of ordered freedom that's the proper worship in the desert and that's the alternative to tyranny and slavery and that ordered freedom seems to me to be something like the service of the principle that allows for voluntary ascent across broadest possible range of circumstances right and that would be a very good there's is there a difference then in your argument for anarchism and the libertarian argument for radically restricted government like did they dovetail yeah six months okay so what do you mean meaning this minarchist delusion is completely incoherent there's no such thing as a minimal government and and we've run this experiment the constitution was designed to create the smallest government possible and it ended up creating the largest government that's ever existed so if you're go so talking aristotle so you think it's inevitable that the government just i don't think so that's what the data tells us yeah so you know one of the things that happens in the old testament and by the way before the ink on the constitution was dry people were going to jail for violating the first for spe free speech so it didn't even last five years before the sedition laws were being passed sorry maybe 10 in the old testament the israelites once they escape from the pharaoh call out to god continually for a king yes and god says no you don't want a king and the israelites say yeah we really want a king and god says no you actually don't want a king what you want to do is take responsibility for your own lives and the israelites go no we want a king right and so so so that's your point clean your room yeah well the thing what what i've realized more and more clearly too is that part of the reason that you and this is an ethical requirement i would say and this is part of why i was struggling with ran's conceptualization but is that every bit of responsibility that you don't pick up for yourself will pay use against that's like yeah right right right so that's also that's really the core problem with the utopian delusion is because you could just imagine you know you can hear you can see i've seen whiny ticktockers  about the fact that they have to go to work and their complaint is well why doesn't the government were rich enough so i could be provided with a universal basic income and i think well if you don't have the imagination to see that if the government made you so dependent or encouraged you enticed you to become so dependent that now you're dependent on that universal basic income if you can't see that as the door opening to a tyranny so absolutely pervasive you could hardly imagine it then you're just not thinking because of course that would happen right but a lot of people don't want to be free they want to be in that cage we see it nowadays where people are desperate to have co restrictions back and they're wearing masks yeah well that's a false security right yeah yeah it's also a cue that you're part of the in group it's a that you're one of the good i'm well that's a that's a form of security too a form of unearned moral of un un moral virtue yeah all right so so let's maybe we'll close with this we probably should so let's let's try this so this is a complicated question all right lightning round you're contrasting that that form of in that specific comment you are contrasting a kind of security and status seeking with the proper moral moral orientation so let me try something on on you for size i don't it's necessarily status necessarily i think a lot of people just want security they don't care about status they they okay that's fine that's fine but you can imagine some people would concern themselves with security and other people might corre that's fine that's fine and both of those could be illusory and unearned correct okay so obviously there's an orientation that isn't that right that's an alter alternative to that that you would find admirable yes okay so here's one of the things that i've been deriving i'm writing this book on the on the biblical corpus called we who wrestle with god and i've been trying to understand the nature of the ethos that's being presented okay so one of the things i would say there's two elements to the ethos one is that you sacrifice the short term for the long term right so that's a time preference issue and in fact that's the definition of sacrifice so part of what the old testament is about is an inquiry into the form of sacrifice that's most pleasing to god and it's clearly something like a longterm sacrifice right is you put up with the privations of the moment to ensure riches in heaven yeah exact exactly so so it's actually it's actually a time frame that's extended out into into eternity right which is a very interesting thing right i mean i mean i'm i'm not even sure what to make of that is that like is the proper time frame infinite like is that how you should be regarding the echoing of each of your actions because the answer to that could hypothetically be yes well this is a big distinction between judaism and christianity or at least as i was taught in yeshiva where we were taught that this whole when i went to church for the first time with a bunch of friends in the midwest they never met a jewish person before so they started interrogating me i didn't have a lot of the answers and one of the points is judaism is not at all thinking about the after life because the way we're taught is this life is a beautiful gift the creator and if you're looking if he's giv you this amazing meal and you're like what's for dessert it's almost spitting in his face so appreciate this gift you've given and do the most you can with it in accordance with his wi as and he let him worry about the dessert he knows what he's doing right william blake would have a good a good objection to that idea i would say because he his transcendent vision was to see eternity in a grain of sand right so that instead of replacing the present with the forestalled and suffering the error that you just described is you integrate the eternal into the moment yes right right which and then well that's you see that you see echoes of that in the gospel insistence that christ has that the kingdom of heaven is spread upon the earth but men will not see it right so it isn't something like it's ambiguous because it's also what happens in the infinite future but it isn't only that it's what happens in the infinite future that's infused into the current course there's very different kinds of christianity and how they approach right right right well and it's a complicated problem because you know one of the things we've talked about today is the notion of time frame and the fact that as you mature and i this is actually the definition of maturation is that your time frame expands right so that you're trying to calculate the proper path along along across the broadest possible variety of iterations but i just also feel very very strongly that this is this this life as we have it no matter what your religious view is not dress rehearsal right and don't take it lightly and no matter what your faith is god put you on this earth for a reason and don't just be like h whatever i'm i'll worry about it you know after with in the afterlife yeah yeah well the you can see that the what the exaggeration of that viewpoint leads to the marxist criticism that religion is just the opiate of the masses is you can suffer all you need to now because reward in the afterlife will be infinite yeah well i right no no i it seems to me that has something much more to do at a more profound level with this notion of infusing the moment with eternality is that and n you kind of caught on to that to some degree right because when he was trying to work out what you would be motivated by if you actually what would you say express what he described as the will to power properly that you would try to live every moment so that if you were destined to have to relive that moment for eternity you would say yes to it right so yeah yeah so so that is that is a concent you see and you see this in the sermon on the mount too though because what christ basically says in the sermon on the mount is that you should orient yourself towards the highest possible good yes both transcendentally and communally but then you should concentrate intently on the moment right right and then that brings eternity into the present moment yes do what you can with what you have and you have that opportunity every single day right and that's what presents well and i actually actually think that that is the reality that presents itself that what we see your metaphor of being on a mountain with the with the with the easel in front of you is a metaphor that if so you climb the mountain now you can see everywhere right so that's a transcendental pl place and so your metaphoric claim in that imagery was that if you climb to the place where you can see everything that what presents itself in front of you is something like a blank canvas now you associated that with meaninglessness but that's a strange association because i would associate that with the deepest of all possible meanings is that you have the ability to participate in creation itself essentially so why do you why does it cuz cvus is blank and there's no wrong answer per se well there might be a an answer that violates the principle of voluntary ascent sure and there might be that you're going to draw a painting that looks like complete garbage right but the point is this is an opportunity and this is an opportunity that's uniquely yours and and this is not something to take lightly okay so but still why meaningless like this is tamu's word right he says life is inherently meaningless meaning this idea that you have to live for the sake of society right okay oh i see so so you see it you see that as a rebellion against an arbitrary moral cod essentially that's one of his books is called the rebel so yes yes yeah okay okay okay so that's right all right so i would see that as a variant of of what the the insistence that you should follow the spirit spirit instead of the dogma you don't substitute dogma for spirit correct okay look that's a good place to end actually and unfortunately you never said the second thing you said there were two things oh yes okay oh i'm sorry yes yes ab oh sorry absolutely okay well so so the sacrifice there has see see the question that emerges in the old testament corpus is what's the nature of the optimized sacrifice right and it it is it's something like it's something like we've discussed already it's the sacrifice it's the ultimate sacrifice of the narrow self to the transcendental self and this is where i was having trouble with ram because i wasn't sure how she organized the transcendental cell we've already defined it like the transcendental self is the self one of the ways of thinking about is the self that enables you to establish a voluntary relationship even with yourself across long spans of time while simultaneously doing that with other people who are also voluntarily doing it right there's a pattern there and this is why the meaningless thing got me a bit because if there's a pattern of voluntary ascent that's optimal which is what you're striving for in this anarchism then and then that's not meaningless it's just structured in a very complex and sophisticated way that can't be reduced to a simple dogma correct and also in terms of being transcendental we're still talking about her 40 years after she died so her mission has been accomplished right her works and engagement right well that's that's the thing about you know if your work is infused with something approximating eternal truth right which means that it would highlight certain archetypal realities those be objective realities in her phraseology then it's going to last because part of the tradition that lasts and the tradition that lasts is a reflection of games that can be played iteratively voluntarily okay okay okay so that's even a better place to end okay you are welcome all right all right so it turns out that we agree that's very very annoying i love being annoying it's my brand all right sir very good to talk to you everyone watching and listening today thank you very much it was a great pleasure to hash through these these topics with michael and i hope that you you enjoyed let's say our walk through the terrifying consequences of a dogmatic utopian state and took to heart the fact that that that is so dangerous that to call it unimaginable is correct the the depths of horror that were produced in places like the soviet union are enough to turn you inside out if you have the barest comprehension of what happened and the notion that that could be in any wise attractive is i think it's the most terrifying thing that i can apprehend and then the question starts to become you know what's the alternative to that and is there an alternative to totalitarianism and misery in the final analysis you know and our conversation today revolved around the notion that whatever that might be it definitely has something to do with iterability and voluntary asset and you know those are those aren't merely subjective claims and that takes you out of the domain of an idiot moral relativism but idiot moral relativism that makes all things permitted you know everything permitted in the dovi iness so all right good thank you everyone for paying attention and and following this and to the daily wire people for making this possible for michael melis for showing up today and and being able to do this live with me that's a great privilege as far as i'm concerned and so now we'll flip over to the dailywire plus side and i'm going to talk to michael a bit on the autobiographical side talk to him about his future plans as well and if you want to join us there please please feel free to do [music] so
