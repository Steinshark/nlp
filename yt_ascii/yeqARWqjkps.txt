- please put your right hand on this cash. dead serious, last one
of you to take your hand off this million dollar
stack of cash, keeps it. i don't care if it takes an
hour, day, week, month, year. i don't care if it takes a decade. last one of your hands to come off this million
dollars, keeps it. as you can see, you have a
clear view of all their hands. so if you lift it up, that
bad boy will pick it up. and we also have an in person referee and he has a ton of experience of watching people keep their hands on a stack of million dollars, trust me. you can back up a little bit though. a few more steps. thank you. now remember, if you
win the million dollars, your coach gets 10%. so feel free to ask them to do anything. so literally, if you want him to sit there and lick your toes, he can. - i don't think that'll be necessary. - please don't.
- your coach is chandler. what are you gonna do to
overcome that obstacle? are you confident you'll win the million dollars?
- i'm confident. - you know, that would go
down into history books. now, before we get too far i wanted chandler to give you
guys a motivational speech. he can just fill you in on how you'd feel if you know you don't win. - what happens is you get a
feeling of regret and sadness and then it never goes
away, so don't lose. now, i'm gonna do some tests
to try to get someone out. hey, jorge, you wanna
play rock paper scissors? - yeah. - oh, darn, i want you
to use your other hand. okay, he passed. he passed. hey, kira, high five.
- nope. - yo, omar, high five, man. lame. - hey, akira, you wanna
powerade? here you go. - stop. - they actually have a decent
iq. i guess that won't work. come here, children, it's
time for our first challenge. i need them all to just rotate clockwise. - [chris] guys, make a clock. - that is not what i said. just move around. we gotta
keep you guys moving. let's see it. let's see it. - i'm watching. - we're watching. - watching. - so how terrifying was that? - not at all. i'm confident,
my hand's not leaving this. - what about you? - that was fun. what
do you mean terrifying? - fun? okay, let's do it again. do a full rotation back
to where you started. there we go, okay. one
of you are gonna mess up. ref, are they good? - hey, you guys are doing great
and i believe in all of you. (upbeat music) - all right, red light
me, please. red lights! - ooh, red team. yeah.
- okay. - throw this marshmallow in his mouth. (buzz rings) since you didn't catch it in your mouth, your punishment is you have
to wear a very tiny helmet for an hour. (buzz rings) (buzz rings) (buzz rings) here you go, sir. does this make one of you wanna get out? - no.
- nah. (upbeat music) sir, can you stop- i'm decking, bro. i'm tech decking. - this is literally a million dollars. - 3, 2, 1. let a rip! (laughter) - oh.
- oh, wait? - we also brought you guys
your own little skate park. - let a rip! - you all have your own tech deck hopefully that can keep you entertained throughout the night. (dramatic music) - [man] jorge, i know you
had a little accident. we're reviewing the footage right now. we'll be back with an answer, okay? - all right, for sure. - so our hand referee
noticed something fishy. he thinks jorge took
his hand off the money stacking up the tech decks. what is that? chris, it is final.
jorge is officially out. this is indisputable facts. - i got the big sad. - all right, let's go. morning, boys. - good morning.
- morning. - let's clear this off and
we'll let you watch the footage. we're still gonna give you 10 grand. we don't want you leaving
with nothing, man. - [chris] i feel bad. - [man] team cheeks all the way, baby. - team cheeks (giggles). - give me a hug. team cheeks, team cheeks. - bro, i'm gonna miss you. - you guys are too nice. - [man] they bonded so much overnight. - [chris] jorge, you did your best, man. - did stuff i never thought i would do. sit on a toilet for 33
hours. who's gonna do that? - you're taking this better
than i thought you would. what's going to your mind? - through boxing experiences, whenever you lose, you don't really lose. you just learn off of it and
you just move on in life. probably didn't become millionaire here but for sure in boxing, i will. wanna keep these? (laughter) - [akira] honestly, though, i didn't think jorge would get out. i thought at least we would
all make it to the big thing that they try to get us
out with or something. - omar, do you need anything? - no. i'm good.
- akira? - can i get a kickstart?
- wanna gimme something too? - i'm not your coach, so no. - chandler! - i couldn't leave you hanging. couldn't be that guy.
- is this a trick. - you have to take your hand off now! (upbeat music) - good morning, guys.
you survived the night. so it's been 19 hours, which is a lot. but for this challenge, i
don't think that's much. i think we're literally just
a drop in the bucket so far. now that you've done
this for almost the day how long do you think you'll go? - i think i can go at least
to the end of the week. as long as it takes, i'll
be the last one standing. - what about you, mark? how long are you willing
to leave your hand here? - as long as it takes. months, years. i need to be the last one to
take my hand off this box. - you wanna know what i just realized? we're keeping away a million dollars. - how much does a million dollars weigh? - i think that's like 2,000 pounds. - that's a ton. literally.
- literally. we didn't even plan that. anyways, yes, this is by far
our most expensive video. a million dollars plus this... - everything in here. - this is gonna cost $1.2 million. i won't be able to feed
you for a few months. - looks like i'm going on a diet. - if you end up winning, you'll get a hundred grand of
your guy's million dollars. - oh yeah. - you should go make sure he wins then. - okay.
- seriously though, i can't believe we're
spending a million dollars on this video. that's so much money. it's just crazy, 'cause three years ago i was making nothing off this channel and now we're literally
giving away a million dollars. what happened? so it's been a while, you guys are probably
getting a little bored. so we flew your family down and now we're gonna bring them
in and see what they think. maybe encourage you a little bit. akira has a twin. you're
identical twins, right? - fraternal.
- tell us what you think. - oh snap. i'm gonna be honest, my
heart's racing right now. - just looking at it?
- this is a lot. this is a lot to take in. oh my gosh. that's so much money. - you're more nervous than him
and he's the one competing. - i'm excited to be
here. i'm not gonna lie. this is intense. - before you go, what
do you wanna say to him? - keep going, you made it this far. just keep doing it, bro. - and what do you wanna say to omar? the guy standing between you and your brother being a millionaire. - omar, if you could just
get out, that'd be nice. - [mrbeast] okay, we're
bringing in omar's uncle. - wow. - that's a stack of $1 million. - how you doing?
- good, i'm feeling so fresh. - you're looking amazing, man. everybody's rooting for you. - thank you. yeah. - everyone's sending love. on the other side of the world in india. - just tell them i'm doing
great and i'm gonna win this. - just keep that focus, man. and just remember, the
whole world's watching. - omar, you're gonna win
this! hit it high, baba! (applauds) yeah. - i was already motivated but this just gave me that boost i need. - i'm motivated too. - so mark didn't have
a family member here, so we brought jeremy from the bike video. how much did you promise
jeremy if you won? - 50k. - you win the million dollars,
you wanna give him 50 grand? - yes, i wanna give him 50 grand. - aw. - so what do you wanna say to him? 'cause you're just as invested. - i've got complete faith
that you've got this. - who do you think's a
bigger competitor to mark? omar or akira? - akira. - you'll see. 'cause i don't
need to say much, you'll see. - i wish you'd trash
talk. i want it so badly. - you're looking tired over there. - me?
- oh yeah. i see it in your eyes.
- maybe. - [omar] you still think he's
a better competitor than me? all right. cool. - there we go. that's what i want. (upbeat music) in five minutes felix is gonna call us and tell us who he thinks will win. - who's felix? - pewdiepie.
- oh. - get out. you lose.
- get outta here. i can't wait to hear his voice. - pewdiepie is calling. - how are you doing? - great. are you ready to see this? - you guys look so happy. that's awesome. - this is a million dollars in cash. - do not remove. don't remove your hands! that's a lot of money! - of these three people, last one to remove their hand keeps it. who do you think will win? - you know, i don't know these guys. what's the first guy? - omar.
- hey, i'm omar. - omar, you got the eye of the tiger. so i'm rooting for you.
- thank you. - thank you so much.
- there we go. just for that, we're gonna let
you sit in a pewdiepie chair for five minutes. - yay!
- there we go. - well, i wish you all good luck. - thank you so much.
- thank you. - all right, thanks for calling, man. yep, later.
- see you. - [man] bye, i love you. - appreciate the support.
i'm not gonna let him down. - so you guys might think this isn't fair, but pewdiepie's our king. so i'm sorry, he picked
omar. he deserves it. you still have to keep this hand on top. that does not change. yes, but if you can while sitting down, you have five minutes. there you go.
- i think it's fine. it works. - keep that hand there. ref, i want you to keep an eye on it. - i have crazy pain tolerance.
that's not a problem. i'm just getting some rest right now.
- you're crazy too? - i have crazy pain tolerance.
- oh. (upbeat music) - is it up? that worked well, thank you. - here we go. my back. (dramatic music) - we stood for 32 hours on that rope, so this is gonna be cake. (dramatic music) - just like that.
- i definitely just did. - oh, you picked your hand up? - i definitely just did.
- yeah, he did. - i felt myself touch my elbow. - gentlemen, do you know
why i called you here? - i heard there something up. - word on the street is
that akira took his hand off the million dollars.
- yeah. - you can't see the footage
with the bag on your head. okay, okay. - oh!
- oh, oh! (claps hands) - he had his arm like
this and he pulled it off. (screaming) - yeah.
- yeah, you see that? - no!
- there was a lapse, bro. - i bring news. the culprit in question
is akira. this sleepy boy. there you go, as clear as day, akira out. - no! - we went through so much together. akira, how do you feel? - i'm disappointed a little bit. you know, the sleep got to me. i gave it my all and that's
all i could ask for, honestly. - if i give you $20,000,
would you be slightly happier? - that would make me a lot
happier actually, yeah. - well, here you go. - this was probably my favorite challenge. i love you guys. i'm root for
both of you at this point. - why you so nice?
- i know. you just lost a million
dollars. i thought you'd be mad. - good luck, bro. - appreciate it.
- it definitely was harder than i thought it was going to be. those two that are still out there, their mental capacity is insane. you guys know me, i get sleepy sometimes. - but this, i think, was
an awesome experience. - yeah.
- i love you. - love you too, dad.
- proud of you, boy. - i appreciate all the love and support. you know, i gave it my all.
hope everyone knows that. - it was really surprising. i'm trying to focus so
i don't be that one. - oh, nothing can stop me now. until i'm the one with a million dollars, you won't see me smile anymore and you will see me with the
million dollars, trust me. - mark, are you intimidated? - i just do what i do. - all this money right
here goes to one of you. good luck. (upbeat music) are you guys hungry? - yeah.
- perfect! okay, so we have a cool challenge. chandler, i want you to go to your house and with what you have
in your home right now, make him a meal. - all right.
- it's not gonna be good. - and jake with whatever
you have in your house, you're not allowed to buy
anything, cook him dinner. both of you have to make
your contestant's dinner and that's what they have to eat, go. - let's go.
- all right. - all right, let's go cook. (upbeat music) (objects clattering) - [man] why is that in the freezer? - who says can't put stuff
like this in the freezer? (upbeat music) - [jake] omar! - whoa, that looks so good. what? - chandler, you better hurry up. all right, let's see. let's see. - it's just mac... is that? what is... is that goldfish and cheese? oh my god.
- what is this? - [chris] just gonna... chandler, you wanna sit with
him? your boy misses you. - [chandler] do you miss me, mark? - i miss you a lot. where you been all day, buddy? chandler, you're a bum. you just left me hanging the whole day. i wanted to take my hand off so many times because you just left me hanging, man. - just do it then. - yellow team's falling apart. mark, you just went savage. omar, this drama, it's
pretty dope, isn't it? - oh yeah. - what would you do if you won? - first pay off the debt.
definitely buy a house. new car, another one for the wife. a better ring because i was a
little cheap the first time. - gonna get a business going. i probably might open a
restaurant, get a car. give back to the people in india because they desperately need it. give back to my mom, my dad, everyone that's taking
care of me my entire life. (upbeat music) (dramatic music) - [mark] you took it off? i can go home. i can go home. i can go home! - okay, guys, we come bearing news. i don't know how to put this. omar's hand did leave the money. i know it hurts, but hopefully $30,000
still makes up for it. i feel kind of bad. - i just wanna apologize to troy and everyone who believed in me. i'm sorry i let you guys down. - you didn't let 'em down. come on. leave a nice comment
cheering him on, come on. - i had to get troy's 20k for his dad and i couldn't do that. - [man] it's okay. it's okay. (sniffles) - why do i get mushy every
time i talk about this? i felt my kneecap spasm, so instinctively, like my right
hand got off to check on it. at that point, the competition is over because once your hand
gets raised, it's done. - it's okay. you know what? valiant effort, man. i don't know if i could have
stood for 48 hours, dude. it's all good, come here. - [mrbeast] and he still won 30 grand. so it's not super bad. yeah.
- still won 30 gs. - thank you so much, jimmy. - i thank you. i'm just
glad you don't hate me. - give him a hug, give
him a hug. he wants a hug. - yeah! - mark is the winner of the
million dollar challenge. - no way! no way!
- yes! - no way! no way! no way! - a million dollars, mark. a million dollars, you can
buy a house, a lamborghini, another house depending where
you live, another house. - this is unbelievable. wow, man. - we did four challenges. the winners of each competed
for a million dollars and mark walked away victorious. between all four of these challenges, not a single person
went away empty handed. every single person either
got a bunch of cool items or they got 10, 20, $30,000. so there's nothing you should worry about. even though there was 16
people and you stood on top, all of them went home with enough money to make it worth their time. and that's one thing
we wanted to emphasize. - man, it's a million dollars. - all right, mark. - so, jeremy, i promised you $50,000. and i came through for you, man. - i never had any doubts. - this is now your family's money. - yeah, all of this. - [wife] oh my god. - a million dollars.
- seriously? - yeah.
- yes. - [wife] you lying. - yeah.
- oh my god! - so your boy's a millionaire,
so i promised you that ring and then it is coming
towards you when i come back. - look at that. it's literally
a crate full of money. - [wife] bro, i'm about to cry. he competed for days. - days. - i don't even know how to
react. i'm so frozen right now. - that's how i was at first too. but i'm a millionaire, so it's natural. (rock music)
(explosions) - [wife] babe, i love you. - love you too. thank you, guys. - two days from when this video drops, a video of him spending the
million dollars will go public. he's gonna spend all of
it. i promise this is real. see you in two days. goodbye. [music] mrbeast 6000, oh [music] [music] mrbeast 6000, yeah, you know his name [music] [music] he changed it once or twice [music] [music] but i think it's here to stay [music] (explosion)
