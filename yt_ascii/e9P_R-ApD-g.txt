this is a professional ubiquity approved installer approved way to hoist stuff onto a roof is it close yeah oh god gentle what gentle oh god it's scraping now wait go this way go that way but that's the entrance are we gonna be backdoor boys today i mean aren't you always a backdoor kind of boy i wanna i wanna walk down the thing you guys already know about some of our expansion plans we've got the lab which we're gonna fill up with testing equipment but what you guys don't know is that but what you don't know is that our creator warehouse team also needs a new space now in a perfect world we would have gotten another unit in the same building so we could use our existing infrastructure but instead we're stuck in another building which means we could get a new internet connection that would cost money but that would cost money and i already spent it all regularly on this building every month so instead we're gonna use air fiber oh boy to share our internet connection from the other building it's gonna be great with dishes on the roof unless it rains and ubiquity claims that we can do up to six gigabit i think six gigabit a second they're not even gonna want a crappy you know internet connection with fiber here they got air fiber and i got this message from our sponsor crucial's p5 plus nvme ssd gives you storage that lasts and for a limited time if you buy a p5 plus x6 or x8 ssd on crucial.com you can get the guild wars 2 heroic edition bundle for free haven't even seen any of this yet no i haven't they absolutely wired the crap out of it for ethernet like it's crazy look at this room i think there's 70 ethernet ports it's all cat5e that looks freaking amazing at least we've got a ups though right yeah a little baby one technology now how are we getting from here to the roof it's already been done you did it already the leg work is done the leg work is done yeah well let's go the hard work is done except well except aligning the dishes the dish is not on the roof yet cool do you want to see how big the dish is the dish the dish is like bigger than him oh no oh so with the mount this dish is almost 30 pounds oh yeah that's six gigabit right there gorgeous doesn't that look glorious see look it is bigger than him we have some stuff to bring up stairs obviously we have to get these up to the roof i don't really have much of a plan for that other than rope yeah that could possibly be hazardous no i think there's a dot or something to line up it's really heavy jake so i'm thinking we just kind of lay it on this foam yeah and do a little tapey tape that way when we're pulling it up the phone kind of protects it from scratching we don't really have a backup plan because i'm not buying internet for this building separately it's like 20 paces away that would be so stupid it's like 150 bucks a month if we have any issues it is going to cost well more than 150 just one time but it's monthly okay this is forever this is like a diamond we allow one issue per month yeah i don't think it's gonna leave a residue jake as long as we take it off right away yeah it should be fine okay it's gonna be fine oh yeah beauty okay i hope we can get that off amazing see this is what i'm talking about i want to buy new internet when our office is right there i mean this seems fine right it seems pretty up we go hey guys hi oh there they are oh you got to keep going there bud okay okay like do we if it's just going to start pouring do we really want to bring this thing up there i don't know if i know how to tie this well enough but i'm going to try i don't think that's going anywhere you tied it oh i don't like i don't know how well but hopefully well enough oh god it's heavy okay that makes sense if it makes you feel any better it's probably lighter than the next thing you have to pull up okay well this is great the system works i really need to tie this well because if it falls we don't have another one stop looking at me so closely i don't know what i'm doing do you know how to tie a knot linus hey can you tell the difference between if it's rain falling on you and if i'm spitting on you i don't want to find out here i found some schmoo i'm going to drop it no i found some i found some schmoo i don't watch move from the moon's coming in incoming shmoo get your own schmoo okay that thing is freaking heavy man this is no joke come on it's 30 pounds yeah it's like stretching the rope i can feel it i can feel the rope stretch they carried cinder blocks up there with this so oh gosh wow that's actually going surprisingly better than i was expecting you got to warn me if anything's going bad yeah don't drop it eh i do not want to go over the edge i would probably die so getting my center of gravity real low like this is a professional ubiquity approved installer approved way to hoist stuff onto a roof is it close oh god gentle what gentle oh god i do not want this wrapped around me if that thing falls it could take me over the edge don't drop it whatever you do now would be actually the worst time to drop it i'm just gonna get low here hey don't drop it okay i hope he has like andy holding the rope or something hey that's a fresh paint job on the building okay oh sorry oh god come on [music] [applause] heck yeah only slightly dangerous hello the logistics buys already put here you go these two rj45s here for us so these are my understanding is just for redundancy and then the stands are real simple like we just got four cinder blocks on this little pole buddy here and that's it it's a straight shot right to the other building over there it said great it just rained a bunch so this is gonna be wet it's really not ideal okay are they talking to me oh one sec kind of in the middle of something that's fine you still suck oh god okay what do you want i was just saying that you sucked oh my god thank you that was definitely worth interrupting what i was doing hey is your dish mounted oh i didn't think so i mean you got me there now the problem is on our side the mount is like sitting on top of the stones i mean given how much play there was even going across the water which was like three kilometers or four kilometers i don't think it's going to be an issue i don't know i'm just using my butt powers to kind of wiggle wiggle it i'm gonna move the rocks man this is so much more fun being able to see what the other team is doing we've done these long range wi-fi dish things before but this is a a whole other level of baller like six freaking gigabit a second over the air and additionally this is something we're actually gonna be using day-to-day like to be clear my parents are gonna use that thing but i'm barely gonna touch it and the first one we did was just for like the sake of doing a demo this is actual critical infrastructure for our company so it's just you know the stakes are a little higher but that also makes it more fun you ever just take your cinder blocks for a walk david all the time is this what working out feels like asking for a friend holy crap yours is like already like on there what are you waiting for look at him is that what's on your head there is that a is that an ltt store beanie that's toot to you what kind of canadian are you hey jake jake ltstore.com i can actually hear what was that lttstore.com sorry just one more time ltt store.com come on what you heard me fine jackass said look how mint that is it's a it's a time saver hey he did send a wrench over it very nice if you watched our previous air fiber video you'll know that we basically just magically lined it up first try i think it's going to be a little easier this time i could actually just see him binoculars or not so i don't actually think we need to get that close on the alignment i think as long as we're you know mostly there i think it's gonna perform well beyond what we need now our angle's not quite right but that's something we can adjust you see right here these guys right here i just want to bring it up just a smidge you know okay so let's bring it up a little bit last time we eyeballed these we actually got them really close we're gonna want this right pretty darn near level and that looks pretty good to me come on come on and this bad boy is the actual brains of the operation that's the air fiber 60 x g we've got our indicator lights here okay so 5 gig 60 gig oh that's how they're doing these crazy speeds power and then i believe that's just a network transfer indicator and that right there one for poen and one for our actual 10 gig signal that jerk he does stuff like this on purpose you know giving me like this b and stuff like that i had thought that i needed to remove it in order to plug in but i don't so i wish i had just left this attached because it was pretty easy to put on before and now it might be a bit more of a challenge oh crap there we go awesome one thing we're going to want to be real careful of as we're plugging in our ethernet cables is one of the easiest ways for moisture to get into our connection would be to drip down the cable ah wrong button hey jake are we using outdoor rated cable i suspect what do you think of some kind of jump the black cable that you brought up with you is shielded outdoor rated cable from infinite cable you fanboy so in the bag you brought up there should be a a surge protector because we're trying to do this somewhat properly this is our surge protector right here i guess it's not directional just a coupler okay cool well that's easy okay this is indoor cable but what we're gonna do is just cram it down here i guess come on come on baby you can do it there's no way this bend is going to be to spec okay got my second surge protector here and the coolest thing about all this is that if this works lab one is right there so we could totally just have the one internet connection for the main office and be like yo internet satellite offices i'm internet man friendly neighborhood internet yeah we didn't anticipate the cat 6a in compatibility here so i bet the cable back to hopefully where it started and then we're just going to jam these in here for now well we just wait for a new part to arrive and then hopefully they'll survive until then all right i need something that's long enough to get us all the way to those tubes i don't want any of that indoor rated cable exposed to the elements because it's not rated for it my side will be done imperfectly slightly and they're going to ground it in the ceiling so for now all you're gonna need to do is just i don't know what the that means just cut the white cable like pretty short this is right there we go cool so theoretically if i plug that bad boy into the dish it'll light up then right yeah but plug into the port that doesn't have the ssp converter in it obviously where my indicator is that oh yeah we got power baby no no heavens no not necessary andy [music] you're an inanimate object no one cares how you feel it's not great it's functional something like that make sure that this doesn't accidentally slip out oh come on come on let's there we go this could stand to be something a little bit more permanent but this is definitely enough if we get a little bit of rainfall tonight to not explode that's not bad hey pretty professional install as long as you don't look too close david look at it right there what's that our download is 6.2 gigabit and our upload capacity is 4.3 and this is us just eyeballing it you were the one who was all like oh we should get an internet connection of rain i mean come on what kind of rain what kind of monsoon could we have to cause a problem between these whoa i'm about to find out how fast our freaking yolo dish install is with no alignment whatsoever oh yeah we could do 2.5 to start here cool where's our two and a half gig all of them really every single one are these new from ubiquity yes they're new so we just exceeded a gigabit per second like real world over the air yeah so it's already the same as the fiber yeah as if we had gotten a whole new internet service just for this building now you can see and we haven't even tuned it yet okay well we should definitely do a file transfer and find out if we're just limited by the server on the other side here we go seriously you ready boys one millisecond ping boys we we yolo pointed it and hoped that it was close enough so this is already way beyond what we were expecting [applause] let's do a file test yeah oh god i'm on a mac how do i how do i max finder okay we have 164 gigabyte file it's a pretty i don't know if i have that much space on my mac okay let's see if it just do you have right click on your mac oh of course are you kidding me who doesn't have right click on their mac where the hell do i see the speed that's whoa that's definitely not slow though yeah it looks to be going about a gigabit still give it a sec oh it's dipping a bit it's probably more like smb in my laptop going okay so we need to tune it i think we should adjust the dish a bit all right crap i forgot my wrench on the ground i need the wrench to adjust the thingama bobber if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball here we go boys field goal hey guess what that was really stupid i feel like i called it beforehand yeah see what i mean you idiots god damn it hey hey hey it wasn't his boss who hit his car with a wrench it was some other department bus let's get this bad boy adjusted wait i didn't even need the freaking wrench i don't even need the wrench yeah you do no you adjust it with the dials we don't have walkie-talkies today i left it on and the battery's dead you're just trying to click on the device right yeah hey there we go antenna alignment here the dish man here we go boys so i already messed with my side for like a good 30 minutes it's really freaking hard to get it to line up especially right now because it's so freaking windy up here i don't really see any it's it says it's great look at your dish and like just see how lined up it is play with the dials a bit let's just point it down see what happens way worse all right let's bring it back up see what happens okay so that's worse so we want to be somewhere in between which was pretty much exactly where we were it might be so close that it really doesn't matter that much maybe like it seems pretty straight honestly it just does not feel like what i'm doing is affecting this like i'm way off now i'm sure of it and the signal is still the same jake i don't feel like anything i'm doing is affecting this okay so we played around with it for a bit and i think we've leveled off at around minus 37 minus 38 on one way and around -40 the other it's hard to say because he's still tightening it right now and i'm gonna have to tighten mine so it'll move a bit but i think that's as good as we're gonna be able to get it yeah it's great i'm walking it off that's it i'm done well that didn't make a lick of difference i guess we're gonna go down and try it again see what happens that was totally the best thousand bucks i ever spent all right now that we're downstairs i'm looking at the signal progress again for the antenna alignment looks like we got about 44 on the local which is i'm looking at the hq one so that's the one at the main office and 38 on the remote which is 107. winner winner chicken dinner it's almost the same as it was before but honestly i consider this a gigantic w if we even get gigabit yeah even if we get close to gigabit yeah does mac os have like a not stupid way to monitor a file transfer oh there's like a system monitor or whatever i'm believe 134 megabytes per second okay that's inaccessible are you doing stuff right now yeah i'm transferring a file oh oh yeah well that's that's awesome yeah it says it still says we're at like a gigabit this is consistently a gigabit more than it was before so we definitely made it a bit better okay that was the bigger concern for me was if it was going to be a latency issue yeah it seems to be exactly one gigabit perfect is it weird weirdly exactly one gigabit yeah well no because it was more when it was transferring the s wait what holy crap what just happened oh my god it's more than gigabit that way you want to upload some videos over here boys we were going to pay 200 a month for this and now we'd get to pay zero well we weren't going to get that we were not going to get that that was not happen i actually think upload's gonna make more of a difference because when people are saving stuff to the server yeah okay i'm super super happy just to see if that three gigabit upload translates into faster transfers to the server we're going to do a quick transfer to the test folder yeah it might just be one of those things where it ramps slowly well it's also samba yeah and it's done it's like exactly gigabit again whatever i'm thrilled just like i'm thrilled
