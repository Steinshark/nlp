bring their heat oh did you come here we can okay yeah darn there's gonna be a three-minute video okay aer pots recharge power sport sling who named this so basically you take the air pods out which are have some ear pods here okay we take them out of the case we put them into the base which is the will then charge and also keep the air pots from falling out of your ears okay this might be the point where we could have some music yeah so i'm gonna attack otherwise what are we doing it's okay don't worry about it okay just embrace it let's what you listen to if you don't just play some music i mean oh white gesso better than me right do i give him a try like i just around your neck and see how it feels okay i mean so they're pulling these out more out of my ears it's the way it's the weight this one is holding what if i move yeah look i just who needs to bite like i guess if who are running and do exercise which had it i don't like people who who do exercise it sir sighs like as in the physical and you know reason right i don't think those people exist okay because i've clearly i've never heard of that you know okay but you you've heard of it oh my the phone came over why'd you still hide your cell phone don't tell phones are your phone just know it is ken he's widely response like this is nice viii cell fly we can unleash our camera so we put the phone on the drone i'll hope not look the flying phone case camera yeah we don't use your phone when we're using the phone that he threw apparently yeah wait this is the truck this is the drone is nowhere phone is not no phone on one side drone on the other side which actually to be fair can fold up so you can just use this as your phone case oh you have a drone attached hold on because i'm feeling some creepy stuff i can do it mind my building here no i just meant okay the creepy was not the work they can do some accurate surveillance of my neighbors just to make sure they're complying with the with the rules the rules you know what i'm looking at you know what it's really about so does it just fly like this oh you know what dude that's why you need the camera for it doesn't use the phone at all i don't understand why the phone is here what is the purpose of the phone is the case just just like it's like a carrying case for your drone and eagle watch it probably that makes a little bit more sense something like well who's buying your phone around yeah i mean controlling is actually where we just done to take us out okay now it is all time you know it all fairness to you guys i was thinking the exact same thing right quiet down pretty good roulette add some bacon ken pass it around who's going to burst the balloon take your turn and cringe we're always thinking with your party revolver if i had this on my channel even it was a video mm-hmm they would be knocking up my door at my house i'm just saying we've got reports of now so okay same for me you know his on let's just be real past the party roulette revolver with a balloon in place to a friend your friend the hammer then pulls the trigger hoping they can take the shot without popping the balloon if it doesn't pop because the next person the anticipation of the big bang if the balloon pops is amazing watch your friends faces they wait to take a turn this seems really up know i teach kids fix you really passed the gun passed the party revolve around and surprising a gun in the middle of the floor like [laughter] wasn't a hood man are you a smoker okay whoa that is too much air that's pretty impressive actually shall we begin i think we shall begin okay about we i mean you okay i'll start nothing no problem okay you don't the hell what you doing man [music] it's your turn it's best pop you do it's about to fall no i miss not okay this is literally taking forever i mean come on well it works as you see i've never been shot it because clearly i'm not sure what's gonna happen eventually but i was so confident that it wasn't gonna be me you know cut this really slow motion of that no no no i mean what could possibly get worse than that i mean lots of things oh okay remember when we got shocked last time that's looked oh yeah that's not good no i didn't like that [music] okay i'm laughing literally just got this yesterday oh yeah okay so this is the sony srs ws1 immersive wearable speaker it actually doesn't

you need a headphone to micro usb cable so these are surprisingly love not bluetooth so you can so there are 2.4 gigahertz alright wireless why says that bluetooth / latency because there's a problem cause latency my headphones like a psp are set up oh okay that she will be pretty cool for psp are so right now i have my phone connected with a lightning to aux jack into little transmitter which is then going to transmit that via 2.4 gigahertz over to the headset where we can listen to a wirelessly that makes sense no okay cool okay so i hear it but i'm not immersed in it are you immersed wanted one that one i just had these in your in your ear like what can i did you like this mmm yeah so what you're hearing is because we have mics on is probably a lot louder than actually what everyone
