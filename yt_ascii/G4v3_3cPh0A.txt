that is one of the most different smartphones i've ever seen so you've probably heard about the red magic 3 the frankly insane value for money gaming smartphone but you probably haven't seen what's inside here so where's my knife ok there is a insane amount of packaging here as well as product so far you can see these two massive boxes you'll be good to just okay so this unboxing experience has actually four primary tiers so in a stop with one work our way through to four and in my opinion they kind of get better and better okay so first up is a red magic t-shirt pretty simple design it's just the company's logo it's a large size which is kind of generous but i'll take the compliment and the second part of this first tier over here is this little box over here let's take a look failed i failed again just going terribly cool these are the red magic nerds and they're definitely some of the better reference you can get for just over $20 they've got a snug fit and warm bc sound okay so the second tier of this unboxing is kind of a lot so let's get cracking on that that is efficient packing right there that's how you do it one two three enough to get rid of these okay so 10 red magic threes and we're not done yet and 10 so this right here is a case designed specifically for the red magic 3 with a particular function in mind the packaging is pretty simple and the case is self made of polycarbonate and this adds bulk to an already massive smartphone but the end of the case allows you to slot another accessory on to it and so as you can probably imagine there's another thing 1 9 10 so this right here is what they call the pro handle it comes in a matte black cardboard box and it's pretty simple you just get an instruction manual as the first thing on top and then the handle itself and essentially it's a controller but because it's built with the phone in mind it works particularly well you've got shoulder buttons on both the top and the bottom and what that means is you can slide this over the top of your phone as you would expect to be able to but also you can flip it round and slide it the other way as well to map the buttons you literally just give this red key at the bottom a tap and then drag the overlay on top of the virtual buttons of your game and then straightaway the physical buttons of the controller will be controlling the virtual buttons of your game and it feels good at least definitely a step above a cheap $7 controller you could find on ebay and we're still not done on the second tier of this unboxing 510 so this right here is what they called the red magic docking station there are essentially four elements to this you've got the glowing red magic logo on the back and then a headphone jack ethernet port and a usb type-c port the ethernet is pretty self-explanatory but the other two are ports that are already available on the phone itself and so the idea behind this is that you can have your cables coming outwards from the back of your phone so they don't interrupt your gaming so there are still two more pretty amazing things i wanted to show you but as you can probably tell we've definitely got the quantity of stuff here to do a giveaway and so if that's something you want to keep up-to-date with then be sure to follow the mister who's boss instagram page there's a couple of logistical things we need to figure out so it's not 100% confirmed but if we do launch it that's where it will be anyways tier three and on the outside this looks pretty similar but inside the box it looks quite significantly different ok so you've probably seen the black version of the red magic three before this is the version i was given this is the version most reviewers would have been given but there's also a red variant yeah but it looks visually quite distinct and is definitely the one that i would go for high at the - it's quite cool how they done this the red version of the phone is pretty much the inverse of the black version pretty much all of the accents the highlights have been flipped from red on the original model to black over here so also inside the box underneath that you've got the standard three compartments one of which has the fast charging brick inside that one right there the other one has the cable which is usb type-c and the third one is your standard stuff your sim ejector tool your instruction manual but then you also get a few red magic branded stickers that's done but there's one more thing i want to show you the thing that i personally was most excited to see out of this entire unboxing and that is what is inside this box over here this is a limited edition version with a bit more of a punch that's the one that is one of the most different smartphones i've ever seen you'll probably think the same it's it's out there so this is the camo edition of the red magic 3 it's based loosely off the original black model but with a camo texture and then another decal on top of that and it's kind of ironic that for a phone that already stands out with this much camo is the finish they've gone for it's definitely not gonna blend in but at the same time that's not really a bad thing no i mentioned that this device packs even more of a punch and so compared to the black and the red models which have 8 gigs of ram and 128 gigs of storage this thing right here has 12 gigs of ram and 256 and so if you boot this up into gaming mode which turns on the fan which restricts background processes and then you run antutu you get a really really impressive score on my first run i was bordering on 390,000 now whilst it does have its caveats the red magic 3 is a shining example of value for money even if we go for the slightly less price efficient camo variant with all three accessories bundled in it is still cheaper than the asus rock phone here in the uk which has a last generation snapdragon 845 chip and eight gigs of ram bear in mind that that device alongside a couple of other gaming phones are pretty likely to get a new 2019 variant soon they'll definitely need to offer more because i've no doubt they'll be more expensive the magic also has a huge five thousand milliamp hour battery a house capacitive shoulder buttons and a dedicated fan inside which in my testing was keeping the phone about 8 degrees cooler than my samsung the main caveats with this being the build which is bulky and makes the phone wobble on a flat surface and the camera which is only a single cam but does still have the same 48 megapixel sensor seen on the whomper 7 probe alright guys if you enjoyed the video a sub would be massively appreciated my name is erin this is misty who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
