okay we're back so we're we're here we've got selenium up and running we've got ourselves logged into instagram this is the second episode in this playlist so go to the first episode if you want to learn more about getting selenium up and running writing this initial code to actually log into instagram before i continue don't forget this would be a really good opportunity for a project to put on your resume so please subscribe or like if you get any value out of it and make sure to make an improvement make it your own a little bit change something about this don't just copy it line for line and then put it on your resume that's not how you learn and that's not how you get your next internship so let's just get to it so first things first what i want to do is just remove those lines and put them into their own function that's pretty straightforward nothing special there and then all we have to do here is call it one thing you'll probably notice is i left the sleep here because it takes takes a half a second for the web browser to actually navigate to this page and by the time this thing kicks off the username field won't be there yet because it hasn't actually navigated to the instagram page you'll see we have fixes for that there's a function called webdriverweight that we're gonna use in a second and what i would do is come back and replace these with webdriver weights let me put the put that here replace with web driver wait what i actually want to do next is i want to click on my profile i want to go to my profile because if i go there i can see my followers and i can see my following okay so one of the differences the only difference between your code and my code now is i've started to include my password in a different file something we're gonna go over in another video series about following and liking random accounts based on hashtags they post on but right now this is basically how i'm going to import my password without you guys seeing it but you can just leave your password right here in the file another thing that i'm doing i had to include driver as a parameter to log in i forgot to do that and when you run it it just says driver not defined so now it's defined and we threw in a wait here so let's see it should log us in and it should wait for a long long time it gives an opportunity to look around now if i wanted to find out who my followers were where would i go i would click this button and then click profile then i would click followers and by the way this is not enough to see who my followers are i have to scroll down and then look more load and then i scroll down more and then more load and i keep doing that until i get to the bottom then i click this x then i click following and i do the same thing there and then i can compare the two so that's what we're going to have to do here let's go back to the main no please so if i right click this bring up that inspect tab this lets me click exactly what i want basically what we're going to do each time is run it and then look for the button css that we want to click like what is unique about this button that will let me click it what do i find here so i believe there's an alt name for something here look okay alt name tech interns profile picture so tech in turn is the user name maybe i can say if the alt name has the username the username in it like so tech in turn if it has that in it then click on that icon because that will pop up this menu and then what we need to do is click the profile button in that menu so basically need css for the for this button the tech and turn button and we need css for the profile button so let's look at the at this here okay here we've got an anchor tag and it's got an href slash tech and turn slash that's perfect we can just use this href and say hey if tech in turn if the username is in that href click it and for here it's the same thing but instead we have to be a little bit fancier about it and we have to say if the alt text includes the username then click it so let's write a function called nav navigate to followers of course it's going to take in the driver because we're going to actually make changes to it we're going to navigate so let's just write some remember those css selectors we talked about well what are they let's make a a new variable drop down css there was this alt name so we're getting a little fancy here remember i said if the alt name includes the username well that's what this star equals is it's about it's a bit of a regex and we are creating a string for an actual css selector okay so the other css selector i have is this remember we talked about that href again we see that regex now wouldn't it be really useful if we had a button that said click if we had a function that was click button with css then all we would need to do is provide the driver of course and the drop down css and then we could also call that function with the profile css wouldn't it be really useful if we had these two functions we could click the button that would bring the drop down and then we could click the profile button so let's just assume we have it and then let's implement it that makes this function really clean and we can also implement this fairly easily and it's going to take a driver and it's going to take a css selector all right so here's where we use that web driver weight thing we talked about web driver weight driver for say 20 seconds before it dies and what are we going to wait for well we're going to wait until ec dot so that this is a a condition element to be clickable by dot css selector this is just one of those things you need to know and you will get better at it as time goes on and then we're going to pass in our css selector there and now that we've actually got the element make sure to get those brackets right they can be a little tricky this function is actually taking in a tuple it's not taking in two separate parameters it's taking it in a tuple with two parameters so don't make that mistake they need to be wrapped in an extra set of brackets and now that we have that element all we have to do is say element dot click now like i said in the last video try to re-implement this login function using this webdriver weight you could say click button with css and find css instead of doing the find element by name but just try to reimplement that it might actually jog your understanding it might get you learning this better now also this thing i blew back blue passed really fast i just want to explain what it is this is an expected condition our expected condition is an element will be clickable there are other things element to be to exist but not necessarily clickable it might just be an element that's there right so there are tons of them you can go on selenium.com and start looking through the documentation to learn more this is the one that we're probably gonna use the most for element to be clickable now back to importing we need to basically import the rest of this stuff we need to import let's just grab it because there is a lot there's this expected condition we need to import there's the web driver weight we need to import this buy is another thing we need to talk about by css selector now there are other ways to select elements you could have by xpath you could have by i don't know what else there is actually by will it tell me no it doesn't xpath is the only other one that comes to my mind but basically there are a few different methods for you to select stuff and so this by is just specifying which one you want to use so let's grab all of those and let's bring them over here so now that should work that should click the button the buttons that we want so let's give that a shot all right so let's run what happens did i leave the weight in too long again i do that a lot i never called the function how often does that happen to people is that just me i feel like i do this all the time i wrote a function and then just didn't even call it there you go so now we have written code that's gotten gotten us onto instagram and it's gotten us to the profile page now there's really not much left right all we need to do is click the buttons and scroll through them now this is gonna actually turn out to be a little bit tricky because it doesn't load everything at first you have to scroll down for it to load everything so keep that in mind that's what we're going to tackle in the next video really hope you guys enjoy this episode remember there's a great project for you to put on your resume here that's going to help you get your next internship remember to like and subscribe if you do look for internships if you are a student because that's what this entire channel is dedicated to so i will see you in the next episode where we are actually going to finish this program off
