i'm in the rainforest specifically this 
is the amazon in peru and it is a hot bed   of biodiversity i mean at least currently but 
there are thousands upon thousands of species   and even if you ignore the fun ones like the 
jaguars and the monkeys and the cayman if you   just focus in on moths there are thousands of 
species of moths in the rainforest and they're   just the ones we know of what about all the 
ones we don't know of well that's exactly   why i'm here we're going to use mathematics 
to both predict the existence of species of   moths that no humans have ever seen before 
and we're going to use some maths to find   a new species of moth but not up here i 
have to get down from the down from the tree this is actually happening i am here 
at the tambo research center which is in   the middle of the amazon rainforest we are a 
long way from civilization and here they do a   lot of conservation work a big part of which is 
documenting and tracking the various populations   of the species that live in the rainforest and a 
particular focus for this research center is moths   i'm so excited so they are trying to work out 
all the different species of moths that are in   this region so every night they go out and try 
and sample them and they're constantly on the   lookout for new species and the very important 
thing i cannot overemphasize the importance of   this if you just discover a new species of moth 
it's named after you so if i find a new moth it's   going to be the parker moth come on stand up moths 
who knows what we're allowed to call it okay but   here's what we're going to do very importantly 
number two we're going to look at the mathematics   and statistics required to predict how many 
species are yet to be documented which i think   is incredible that you can predict the existence 
of a species using mathematics that no human has   ever seen number zero i'm going to get out of 
the range this whole rainforest bit starting   to run its course and number one we're going to 
go look for a new species of moth i'm going to   get out there and give it a go but that doesn't 
work during the daytime this is a terrible time   for moth hunting we need to wait for the nighttime 
and then night time it cuts me it cuts me shouting   night night time a couple hours ago they put this 
light on and at the same time every night after   dinner anyone who's staying at the center can 
come out and try and find a new species of moth   and there were definitely a lot to choose from 
so isa here is going to give me a hand we're   going to get them off we're going to put it in 
this magical jar we don't discuss what happens   after it goes in the jar and then we find 
out if it's a new species so what would you i   mean which of these are standing out to you yeah i 
would recommend this one this is an aoid moth and   that's another one of the groups besides tiger 
moths that we're interested in capturing right here got it there it is but closer got it and 
one went right down my sleeve i'm going to very   calmly give that to you right and then go have 
a little panic over here we spent a lot longer   there that night looking at moths catching moths 
being smothered by moths being smothered if you   will until at last it was time to pack it in go 
inside and wait for very early the next morning   when we reconvened to see what we had caught 
[music] it's the next morning e has got all   the jars we just emptied the first one of my jars 
onto this is particularly smooth paper yeah to not   damage the moths excellent we're going to have 
a look at them if they're interesting they get   to go in a grid on this sheet i'm optimistic once 
these are carefully lined up on the piece of paper   we'll then take a photograph of them and that gets 
sent off to an expert at a university we'll have   a look at them and request they ask for mon to be 
sent to them yeah so basically juang galos he   works at the museum of science in lima natural 
science and basically a lot of them will be   sent to him as samples for the collection in 
the museum right and it's one of the largest   collections in peru and the largest of tiger mth 
in peru amazing and then ones that he thinks could   potentially be a new species or that he needs to 
extract dna from we put into a jar one of their   legs into a jar with alcohol and that goes off 
to the university of wealth in canada for dna   barcoding oh so they they'll take one leg's enough 
yeah and they'll get the dna yeah sequence see if   it's a new moth yeah and the alcohol absorbs 
the dna oh when it gets there it's just like a   alcoholic dna cocktail as we were sorting head 
of moths gabriel stop by to see if any of the   ones from my jar looked new to them that brown 
edge that one we this has got the extra stripe   coming up the middle there y that could be my moth 
that could be your moth you remember the number of   your jar yes it mine that exent that could be the 
lucky one that's great you didn't even know which   one was mine pick my mo that's the stand up moth 
ether is now sorting all the other jars of moth   that don't know why they're bothering obviously my 
jars are going to have the new species in it and   we'll hear back before long if one of them might 
be brand new to humankind we'll put a leg in one   of these post it off to canada for dna analysis 
but i'm starting to wonder given how many how   many moths we saw just last night how long have 
we been doing this for seven years seven years   yeah they've been doing this for seven years 
i'm i'm curious what my chances actually are   finding a new species first up let's to have 
a chat with gabriel about moths and how you go   about discovering them my name is gabriel sereno 
i'm one of the resident researchers here i'm a   biologist and i'm in charge to keep running 
the three main projects that white amazon have i   think the tiger mods is one of the most biodiverse 
groups if we are talking about mods there's like   80 different group of mods and the tiger mod is 
just one of them that's why it's necessary to   have a lot of specialist to identify a lot of the 
different groups i think i can recognize around   200 or maybe 250 different species of mods so far 
i know that i collect four new species but we need   another specimen to be sure and start writing the 
paper about that one one of these specimens is   going to be to take micr photographies of the 
inner organs and also the genitalia of the of   the mods that's why we need a second specimen 
to be put it in the museum so other scientists can   come to the museum and also check that specimen 
we have one one very rare tiger mod that have   completely clear wings it's not without scal it's 
just completely clear and i see that just one   time the last year most of the people thinks 
that the only pollinators are the butterflies   and the beast but since there's only six group of 
butter flies and 80 of ms so the hardest job have   the mods yes ms are important because they are 
key pollinators more important than those showy   butterflies and i was surprised to realize that to 
document an official new species you had to catch   a to twice i was struggling with once but i was 
starting to wonder what are my actual chances of   discovering a new species which means it's time 
to do some maths on some hypothetical creatures   of our own creation so imagine you come across 
an all new novel habitat and you think what new   species possibly hilarious math ones are living 
here so you set a camera trap to see if you can   document any new creatures and sure enough on 
the first night what's this it's a ringtailed   ring that's great first night new species we are 
off to a racing start on the second night you set   your camera trap and you get this it's a hook 
build hexagon which is either learning to fly   or is just bad at flying whatever the case it's 
an all new species two knights two new species   incredible third night oh it's it's another ring 
tow ring that's fine they can't all be winners   we're going to get some repeats fourth night what 
do we got oh look at that it's a rainbow footed   rhombus we maned a spot oh it spotted us i hope 
it's friendly it looks friendly yeah it's friendly   so to recap we've been looking for four nights we 
found four different individuals and they give us   three new species which is great but then on the 
fifth night we get another ring toiled ring okay   day six ringtail ring day seven another rainbow 
footed rhombus we're not get anything new but   then look at this it's a 20 eyed trapezium that's 
playing basketball yeah that makes sense why not   day nine we got species four but then for ages 
nothing it's just like more of the same over and   over it takes until day 30 when when we get our 
next new species let's see what it is oh it's a   teal winged triangle look at it fly oh that's way 
more majestic than the hexagon mark that down and   then we're back to capturing species we've seen 
before so the question now is have we found them   more or are they're more out there so let's have 
a look at a plot of how many species were found   over time to start with if we look at the first 
four we found over nine nights it looks like the   curve is does that count as flattening out or is 
it still going up in fact if we bring in when we   found the next one on night 30 now we can start to 
ask ourselves does that look like it's flattening   out or we can predict way into the future and we 
can try and have a guess where this curve is going   to go eventually we will find all the species 
and it will flatten out and mathematically we   can try and predict the shape of this curve it's 
going to start going up very quickly and then it's   going to flatten out however now we've arrived in 
assumption town and there are lots of new assump   itions to discover here about the different size 
of the populations how often they come out how   many we're catching at a time because we've been 
just looking at one individual at a time this is   often called a rare faction curve because what 
biologists can do if you're capturing multiple   animals at once in different sample sizes 
on different nights you can use software to   randomly select a subsection from them to kind of 
even out the biases of the different sample sizes   and so you can then do this plot either in terms 
of number individuals you've come across or number   of times you've sampled so we would need to work 
out for our situation exactly what shape curve we   expect and then we can work out with what level 
of certainty we anticipate we've discovered what   percentage of possible species and it's going 
to get difficult towards the end looks pretty   flat in our case unbelievably on night 100 check 
it out it's a orange spotted octagon wonder do   we miss that it's tiny tiny but wonderful we can 
now add that to our plot we can update our model   and once again we can try and work out how many 
species are left out there must not the only game   in town i also had a chat with a researcher named 
mark from the university of suffk who's actually   the person who invited me out to the rainforest 
in the first place and they study some different   creatures and you actually use rare faction curves 
in your research which is not moths no no i'm far   fewer species i work with mammals so i got 
20 or 30 l mammals oh which mammals are you which   mammals are you researching so where we've used 
r refraction before is in surveying the canopy we   used to study primates by walking transects 
y u but we wanted to switch to cameras in the   canopy okay so we could get nocturnal species 
and dial species but when you change a method   you need to compare the methods to find out which 
one's working best and which is most efficient   because you're going to spend money on it at 
the end of the day so we plotted curves   for the accumulation of mammal species with the 
camera traps and curves while working transects   see how many kilometers versus how many trees we 
have to climb got to compar them to see which is   best you're working out what's the most efficient 
way to log all the species that are around exactly   i then said to mark could you take the rare 
fraction curves you're using with mammals in the   canopy and apply it to the moths cuz this is moth 
matics and i want to know what my chances are of   finding a new species and first of all you had 
to log all 178 of the currently known tiger moth   species and you only specifically doing tiger 
moths because that's what youve got the expert   in and so you sat down and worked out this is 
incredible and some of these didn't exist you this   is these are just the moths that we're getting at 
trc in two and a half months so yeah other other   months there will be many more species as well 
so this is specific to this time of year yeah   at that location ones that are attracted to light 
and are nocturnal and you've got 178 just tiger   mo alone and you had to go through and work out 
what all the all the informal names you've been   using for these y then you have to go through and 
get estimations for how many of each of these you   see because as we saw there were too many moths 
to count every single moth of every single type so   you put some rough numbers on this y and you put 
them into a rare fraction curve y and we got these   so what are we looking at here okay so you got 
species diversity up there yep side and as you   get more and more species you add them to the 
curve right but this is done several times   and they take an average program takes an average 
so we have some eroric okay so there's like   there's like the the funnel and the most likely 
path through the center of it and that's where   we are now yeah and then this one is abundant 
as opposed to occurrence okay yeah so so this   is based on the number of sample nights got 
it and this one's based on the number of sample   individuals so this one tells you how many more 
moths you would have to find before you before   you found all the species and this one how many 
knights you would have to sample these are looking   real flat at the end there and the completeness 
rating is 0.994 s and 0.9983 yeah so so what what   the difference between these curves and the ones 
i get with mammals is that you've actually got   quite a complete sample there nearly complet but 
actually they're not flat suggesting to me you're   going to have to sample a very long time to get 
those new species but this is also assuming that   this there's some assumptions about the number 
of individuals per new species because talking to   the moth people they're finding them a bit faster 
than this because this would indicate there's like   one species left yeah so i think these curves 
they make some assumptions so they're assuming   that your conditions are similar your season not 
changing got it but actually you've got rainy   days hot days frii days that you found out about 
when it gets a bit cold oh my goodness and   the seasons's constantly changing the habitats 
are changing too right and and i think the   key is in that sample those rare species they're 
specialists so they're living in different parts   of the forest the forest is always changing you 
might get a tree fall you got a clearing that's a   micro habitat forming right next to the trap right 
there so and it would change because of that so   so if i wanted to really find a new species i'd 
have to look somewhere different that's not all   these you need to find yourself a new environment 
new location new method maybe give yourself a   better chance okay we can do that to increase our 
chances of finding the yet undiscovered species   of mothu parker we decided to change everything 
instead of looking at night for nocturnal moths   we're going to look in the day instead of using 
light to attract them we're going to use a special   plant that produces a smell that moths like and 
instead of looking in a clearing on the rainforest   floor we're going to go up to the canopy initially 
we tried hoisting the moth attracting plant to a   tree at the very top of the canopy but that was 
fraught with all manner of problems so we can   very quickly abandon that idea on site there was a 
viewing tower a terrifying distance off the ground   so you can see across the rainforest canopy and 
we put some of the plant up there left it for a   while and went back to check i actually got there 
first clambered all the way to the top and saw a   surprising number of moths we were soon joined by 
a resident moth expert and we collected as many   of the ones which appeared to be new to science 
as possible there were so many after a while we   ran out of space to keep them in the container 
i had to chug the remaining water in my water   bottle so we could then use it to collect moths we 
did ask the moth experts about this moth on my arm   and they said that the photos and video we got is 
not good enough to be conclusive but potentially   that's a moth never seen before by humans science 
is unaware of it and landed on my arm we had a   wonderful time together it left never to be seen 
again confirming a new species is a long difficult   slow tedious process and i've been back from 
the amazon for a few months now and i've only   just heard today that my candidate moth from the 
light trap has been recognized by an expert as a   pre-known species so oh well i mean i still have 
all the ones from the tower we haven't heard about   those yet but i thought i'll put the video out now 
and if i hear anything about the m from the tower   i'll give you an update to let you know if any 
of them were new to science and of course i was   not out in the peruvian rainforest just to look 
for moths that was the highlight obviously and   huge thanks to the rainforest expedition folks 
who organized our travel and our accommodation   and managed to get us to the research center and 
they're not sponsoring the video but i have put a   link below if you'd also like to go and visit the 
rainforest i have to warn you though you were very   very in the rainforest and i which i thoroughly 
enjoyed but just no you're going to get real rain   foresty and while i was there i was able to check 
out the other conservation work that they're doing   partly funded by the tourism side and an aspect 
of that involved climbing up a very very largee   tree with mark and as not a natural climate it 
was a bit of a challenge however it was totally   worth it because it turns out moth's not the only 
creatures which we need to keep tabs on there are   a lot of other animals in the rainforest that 
we have to count so right now mark and i are   up in the canopy we're about 30 m off the ground 
because this is one of this is like an artificial   mcco nest and the idea is they're able to nest 
in this because the trees they normally nest in   are being cut down and obviously you want 
to know if this is working so what i thought   i'd do we're going to start with mc i'm going to 
name a bunch of animals and mark is going to say   how we count them m point count point what's 
a point count you point at it and you count no   right you stand on a point oh a certain amount 
of time you you count all the birds of all the   species you're interested in as i go past okay 
that's pretty good what about monkeys that's   your speciality yeah still line transacts 
if you actually want to know how many there   are yeah old school walk through the count the m 
the side of the line measure the distance to the   to the animal when you see so you pick a specific 
direction you cut a trail you cut a trail oh   right okay right that's fine about cayman these 
these are like the happy looking crocodiles so   that's a a count along the river with a spotlight 
at night oh you literally there's one you see the   eyes shining yeah some people say they can 
identify the species from the color of the   eye that's incredible anteaters that would 
be the giant antier on the ground with a camera   trap boreal anti to line transact maybe camera 
traps in trees okay sloth camera traps in trees   the only way i think you put so camera trap is 
where there's a camera with a motion sensor on it   and then you just look at the footage afterwards 
um what about moths with seen mosquitoes   number of slaps slaps per minute so many and 
bush dogs probably impossible impossible and in   fact all of these you've got to then take what 
you've counted and extrapolate up to a whole   population right yeah we've got to use some tricks 
to account for imperfect detection y and it's   always an estimate there's always some error in 
there there's always error buz but the point is we   can't conserve things or at least track impacts on 
populations would like to conserve unless we have   some data so whatever data we can get is better 
than nothing but the better it is the better it   is and if you are wondering how i ended up in this 
tree we'll put a video on the second channel that   shows mark and i climbing all the way up and while 
we're up here we did some extra maths you're going   to enjoy it oh and check out mark's channel if 
you like ecology you should be subscribed to mark
