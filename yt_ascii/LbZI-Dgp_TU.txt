i'm gonna have to go find dude i swear this is everything okay so i work with a bunch of c plus developers so maybe i need to maybe i need to watch this okay i work with a lot of c plus plus developers so maybe this is maybe this is the maybe this is the play here maybe this is the play right maybe this is the one okay you will learn how memory works by creating sec faults that's a cool feature of c hahaha [laughter] oh man great that was pretty good okay i liked it i liked it can we start the advantages over java where should i start using java what is your company rich memory allocation hybrid inheritance i mean i think c is a real hero here i don't really like c plus plus c you know every every i've heard that statement maybe a million times you know c is really great i don't really like c plus plus and then guess what somehow all the code is c plus plus about all has classes and inheritance and virtual inheritance and diamond pattern and just everything sharp yeah good driver will say learning to fly stupidly complicated because everything is done with the say dan but if you ask a pilot he'll simply laugh at you c plus plus is low level low level for hardware programming low level try writing a kernel in javascript try programming an fps okay first off i think someone is actively trying to write a kernel in javascript so let's not just say those kind of things okay let's you know let's just be very careful here okay because you know when you say phrases like that there's always the possibility someone will do it and so you you know like you never say i bet doom can't run on whatever someone writes doom running on that every single time jsos yeah and java try programming in fpga in javascript in the other languages where do you again stop saying these things you have pointers structs references oop procedural even types and where do you have virtual constructors in other languages that you wouldn't understand struct am i still not sure i understand virtual constructors i'm not you know half the that's in c plus plus i'm like you know i have no idea what's happening at this point you you've you got me okay you got me at this point just give me just just let me knew up something put in a unique pointer and never think about it again okay that's all i want i just stop stop with all this other stuff people get all fancy with their c plus plus a good knock joke knock knock raise condition oh no no no no did you get it the reference do you need pointers it's not an error it's a sec fault that's a casualty memory leak it is more difficult to create unsafe software in java well then where's the fun water leak what software is written in c what software isn't written in c websites we're talking about real software all platforms are built in it how can it not be cross-platform how can it not be cross-platform you're right we need to see them by the way linker errors are by far the worst anyone dealing with linker errors every single time i get a link or error i just get up from my computer and walk away for five minutes they're just the worst i have no i sometimes i have no idea when i break the netflix application and and you get those linker errors and these are like big ass linker errors okay these are not like just little linky errors okay this is not like okay i i i i just landed in hyrule and i have to go find where princess zelda is here's the kingdom and i have no idea what i'm doing okay i'm actually playing tears of the kingdom like it's elden ring right now that's linker errors for me no idea what's happening tyler as anime the key league the runtime era the runtime error detection is the programmer's responsibility we don't need a package manager we write everything ourselves we do use at netflix we did have an entire stack in c plus for networking but we did decide to write it ourselves in javascript i'm a part of the problem okay probably nothing wrong i i did try to suggest let's use wasm and rust okay i would just like to say that i did throw out wise i'm in rust okay you rascal okay and you were listening and when it didn't work out i wrote that  in javascript okay hdb2 wrote that in javascript okay http 2 pretty neat also in javascript i remember writing colonels and drivers when i started with c what were you doing painting gooeys you learned c in one night people build applications we build applications that let people build applications no my favorite book 10 elegant ways to create a sec fault let me show you how you would do it at sea great it's beautiful that was fantastic i like that you know as someone who works with a lot of c plus developers i feel like i feel like there's something missing there okay it was close but it wasn't quite it wasn't quite it okay i don't know why they recommend me all my videos okay i don't know why i've literally never watched them yet somehow they could recommend them to me non-stop i don't know what it is i can't get them to stop okay why is it motley crew the fat rat and me okay why are half your wrecks yourself i don't know i created those videos
