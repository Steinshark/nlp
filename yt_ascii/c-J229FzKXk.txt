this may look like a boring workstation from the.com era and it is but the eagle-eyed among you might have noticed that it is also adorned in xbox logos that don't quite look like xbox logos that's because this alpha one dev kit was the first dev kit created after microsoft unveiled the big metal x at gdc back in the year 2000 unlike the big x this one certainly didn't cost eighteen thousand dollars to build and require a solid block of aluminum to be milled for each unit in fact as i'm about to show you it is built entirely out of relatively low-cost commodity pc parts that anyone can get and there's more this is the alpha two the second xbox dev kit that's right we have two generations of these things both with working hardware and the wildest thing about all of this is that unlike the other console dev kits that we've looked at these can be recreated by anyone using leaked software that you can just download imagine being able to build your own xbox sort of it's possible most you know what isn't possible to do by yourself though segue to our sponsor thorum elegant rings made out of unique materials from meteorite to dinosaur bones use the code ltt to get 20 off today and stay tuned to learn more the alpha one dev kit isn't very well documented so i am really excited to crack this thing open and especially to compare it to alpha 2 which is pretty much a known quantity at this point but before we do that the origin story for the xbox project is really interesting and it kind of starts with this sticker on the front that says powered by directx the way the story goes is that the original os was basically windows 2000 but stripped of everything but the bare minimum for running directx so the name is actually short for directx box now bill gates apparently hated the prototype bastardized windows that they showed him so much that he screamed at the original team presenting the first prototype for over two hours on the night of valentine's day like late enough to where most of them had to cancel dinner with their wives but then he gave them the go-ahead because he liked how fast it booted and feared that the playstation 2 would take over the living room while also taking the place of the home computer eventually right out of the gate there are some really fun hallmarks of early 2000s computer design i mean you'd hate for your tower to tip over right if we were to pry off this fascia here which seems to be just a piece of sheet aluminum bent and then glued onto the front of a generic case we could probably figure out the exact model but video gaming historians would get super mad about that i'm pretty sure yeah i'm getting the nod and really that's not the important part anyway we want to see the guts which yeah it's a little what the heck come on your secrets wow that is generic yep that right there is about as exciting as your grandpa's pc i mean at the time it was pretty exciting the motherboard is an intel vc820 code name vancouver by the way yay go vancouver as for the cpu i really wanted to pull this out and give you guys a closer look at it it's got a a cooler master cooler on it young up-and-comer company right there but unfortunately these ancient plastic push pins are proving to be a bit of a chore to get out and the last thing i want to do is damage any of them so it might have to stay in there but that's fine because the reality is it is a run-of-the-mill intel pentium 3 733 megahertz cpu but that's a really interesting story the processor was as the legend goes supposed to be amd who really did have the superior technology at the time but sometime between the aluminum monster and the unveiling of what would become the retail xbox microsoft switched suppliers to intel amd though had no idea and they were actually sitting in the front row at e3 2001 when they found out that they were usurped by intel sitting feet away from dwayne the rock johnson he was presenting the xbox yeah yeah the xbox got unveiled by bill gates and dwayne the rock johnson at e3 2001. he's been that culturally relevant for that long moving on to the memory things get quite a bit more interesting and thankfully this comes out rambis is probably best known today for its role in the industry as a patent troll but back in the late 90s and early 2000s they alongside intel were pushing rd ram in this rim form factor as the next big thing in system memory it had a huge advantage in terms of bandwidth over the sdram of the time this module right here remember this is from the year 2000 was clocked at 400 megahertz and utilized both the rising and falling edge of the signal to achieve effectively double that 800 megahertz wow unfortunately it came at a much higher cost due to its larger dies and allegedly very high licensing fees to rambis making matters worse while the bandwidth was much higher the latency was also higher meaning that in the real world performance on rambis based systems actually wasn't higher so when ddr sd dram came along randice got the boot our alpha one came with a total of 640 megabytes of this rd ram the 128 megabytes and a second 512 megabyte stick and this is the first way in which it differs from our alpha 2 which actually only contains the 128 megabyte module and this what in the heck is that this is a filler cart because the way that rdram worked you can't just have an empty slot on your motherboard you must populate both channels either with a single dual channel module or two single channel modules so you had to use one of these if you wanted to use just the one but that's weird why would alpha 2 need a filler stick and have only one-fifth the amount of memory as alpha one actually that's not that unusual dev kits particularly early ones tend to have more system memory than the final system and the reason is that the games that they're running on them are not exactly optimized at that point in the console's life cycle so our alpha 1 had 640 megabytes our alpha 2 had 128 megabytes final dev kit had 128 megabytes but the system memory was actually shared with the gpu which is different from alpha 2 and finally the retail console had 64 megabytes of shared memory that is less than a tenth of our alpha 1 which either means that the software got that much less bloated over time wow or more realistically means that when this dev kit was repurposed as a software development workstation the it department popped or open for an upgrade and threw in another stick of memory and that's probably not the only thing they upgraded because how else would our alpha 1 have a gpu that is three generations newer than our alpha 2. see how our motherboard has onboard usb and onboard audio and they added both a usb card which isn't that abnormal just so you could have more usb ports words but also an add-on audio card that's because within the xbox os the only functional ports on the motherboard were serial so these are likely to be close analogs to the audio and usb controllers that ultimately made their way into the final console but might not have been included on whatever random intel motherboard that microsoft used for these systems then there's this raid card okay so this bad boy is called a raptor and it was used for dvd mastering that is kind of all we really know about it at this point it connected to a 40 gigabyte hard drive that could hold all the dvd information and if you weren't mastering a game disc it was not particularly useful and maybe even made it slightly worse when these were deployed as workstations it apparently functioned just as a regular raid card coming back to our alpha one for a second we are missing both the raid card and that special sound card which could be a big problem for us you see the stripped down version of windows 2000 that these run only contain support for the exact hardware that it's expecting to run on so if we don't have exactly the right alpha one components this thing isn't going to boot and since alpha 1 is relatively uncharted territory we're not even going to know necessarily what parts have been ripped out and put back in when this was frankenstein's together as a workstation i mean it's a functioning computer as it is it just wouldn't boot up into any of the dev builds that we tried and we made it as far as december 2000 which should have worked but didn't we could have started ripping hardware out of alpha 2 and putting it in here but we had no way of knowing if that was actually going to work and really alpha 2 is the more interesting one from a gaming standpoint anyway can we fire it up now one other fun thing while we're getting set up for that is you guys might have noticed that the floppy drives in these are facing backwards as far as i can tell the only reason for that is that when they put on that front fascia piece in order to have it look cool and sleek they covered up all the rest of the external five and a quarter inch bays and external three and a half inch bays that would have been on the stock case you still kind of needed a floppy drive back then for you know installing your operating system or just like loading software onto the computer so they would have had to throw these in and i'm assuming anyone using them would have had to pop the panel and like throw a diskette in there if they ever needed to use a floppy that's freaking hilarious also can i just say that i love this pci card retention mechanism it's a little janky like this support braces at an angle for some reason but man those cards are in there that is awesome something to note is that even if you have all the correct hardware for your generation of alpha that doesn't mean you can just load up windows 2000 strip out the extra bits and start playing xbox games the software that these run is highly microsoft proprietary and should never have actually left microsoft from legal standpoint it's thanks to software preservationists that we were able to download it from archive.org and while we were willing to take that risk we can't in any way guarantee that that software hasn't been tampered with so you would do so at your own peril if you did find yourself wanting to build one of these though one of the hardest pieces of hardware to get your hands on is going to be the sound card because they've been out of production for kind of a long time fortunately a net is in by the name of n64 freak has actually created a blueprint that you can send to an overseas pcb manufacturer to have one made for yourself an exact replica of it for about 50 us dollars so if you're interested in playing around with it that is an option though as you can see if you just want to play xbox games there's no advantage to one of these versus just getting your hands on an old xbox we're in the dashboard right now and the build you're looking at is from about may of 2001 so this is around the e3 time frame and about six months prior to the actual launch of the xbox what we need to check right now before we go any further is to make sure that our oh nope nope to make sure that our audio recording is working ooh parental control yeah that evidently does nothing at this stage okay is this all i can really do with this one or what yeah so if you want to load a new xdk you actually have to restart the system oh and the way to do that is power button oh wow up top other side oh my gosh that feels awful one moment please bump lens and i guess this is just showing off a light distortion rendering effect of some sort 1300 fps damn daniel i i just have to shut the whole thing down now yep okay well that was worth it credit to the team it does boot really fast yeah like now think about how fast windows 2000 loads yeah this is back in the days of three and a half minutes this is not a hard drive guys a slow slow mechanical hard drive they really did optimize the crap out of this thing okay dolphin classic now with 1100 fps i think i've seen about enough of that dolphin swimming around oh wow turn it turn it back off and turn it back on again yep i didn't press the button but it's probably fine i mean other than the resolution that's not bad so they're showing real-time shadows working and then what is this that is our ip address if we were to plug this into a network it would actually show us what the ip address of the system is and with that we can hook up a developer's workstation and use the xdk software in order to load up games onto here so that's actually how simpson's road rage got put on there e3 demo 50 complete okay can i even change which driver i am ah there we go well obviously groundskeeper willie even loading off a hard drive this is pretty awful i've never played the original game though so maybe you guys can shed some insight into whether this is normal or whether this is just because it's an early build that's a lot of it's a lot of loading screen all right nice what's this 12 seconds what's get game mode i clearly do not understand this game very well i haven't verified this i only heard about it this morning but apparently you can plug in a keyboard no way remember remember with the ps3 how we could plug in a keyboard and access a console i guess we'll find out soon enough oh this is i don't think this supports hot plugging windows 2000 didn't even get support for usb 2 until service pack 4 and we have to run service pack one so it's only got support for usb one which definitely doesn't have some of the creature comforts of modern usb i think we should try a ps2 keyboard just for lol's humor me you never know when you're gonna need a ps2 keyboard tanner that's why i always keep one in a nearby drawer there we go we got lights on this bad boy oh what is this that's the that's the bios they had a customized bio splash screen yeah that's freaking awesome i didn't even know you could do that back then i mean you can now every system integrator does it but back then i don't think that was a thing this does not appear to be doing anything there might be some hacky way to do this but maybe it's not a default behavior there was another build of this game that i could not find where they didn't have all the voices finalized yet so instead of hearing homer's voice you would just hear a microsoft sam kind of voice read off the file name oh that's awesome nice hey i'm getting better at this let's go oh yeah i'm a road rage pro now look brandon it's an xbox but it's a computer it's the directx box yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna get ten thousand dollars i've never played this game before it's fun but we have videos to shoot come on move it yes all right let's try another game and to do that we're gonna show you how we can actually load games onto this thing because you can't just like pop a game disc into the front oh wait can you do that tanner there were some game discs that were made that you could do that with really they were all green discs green discs but we don't have any we don't have anything they're quite rare okay they're usually dev builds they were also sometimes completed builds that were just sent off to members of the press though and they actually continued past the lifespan of the alpha one and alpha 2. so those continued on throughout the life cycle of the xbox now that we've connected both of these machines to our network they can actually see each other and all we have to do is take one of these games that we have on our local hard drive here like say for example dark summit and drag it over to the shared folder on our xbox no estimated time it takes as long as it takes which is a lot more honest than what they give us now like i guess i'm having the early 2000s game developer experience time to go get some coffee and this you're cool i didn't actually notice this before but these are not just two file explorer windows this is xb explorer which presumably stands for i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding xbox the look on his face he was like i worked for an idiot anyway xbox explorer and it allows us to do all kinds of cool things so we can select our target machine we can reboot the xbox remotely actually that's about it about all we can do but we didn't try this before filming but our understanding is that the mob 2t version of dark summit was supposed to be the playable one clearly not loading on our alpha 2 so let's try the debug version and see if we have a bit more luck with that i really kind of missed the loading bar now yeah no wait no i'm kidding i'm kidding what the crap that was so fast wait oh because it doesn't have to do a full system reset it just resets the software oh that's awesome version 010101.0 no game object data oh look at that hairdo though whoa here we go oh oh okay which pad am i supposed to my controller is not working i don't think my controller is doing anything oh man am i ever gonna get down oh boy oh i don't think so i think i'm stuck hey there we go oh no no this is early 2000's game design brandon experience is how basic and commodity and almost kind of bootstrap the origin of the xbox is they just took off the shelf honestly not even amazing computers turned them into a development platform and just a couple of years later the ball was rolling on what would become the juggernaut that xbox is today just 20 short years later the tools were janky they clearly had no experience no right to be there compared to the powerhouses at the time nintendo sega sony and yet they did it just like i did this segue to our sponsor forum thorum has been in business for over a decade handcrafting unique bands and rings out of rare materials they're made out of titanium ironwood meteorite and even
