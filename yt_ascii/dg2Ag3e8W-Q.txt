- i opened up the world's
first free restaurant. and if that wasn't enough, i also paid people to
eat at my restaurant. we haven't even opened yet
and the police just told us they had to shut down a mile of traffic and there's a thousand cars in line. put it on up. yeah.
- yeah. i've never ran a restaurant before. money for you, money
for you, money for you. money for you. you better
come get a beast burger! what's up, boys? welcome. what can i get you? all we have is burgers.

first customers wait. i'm sorry for making wait,

second, here's another hundred. - oh my god.
- go, mr. beast. - we got burgers now.
- we got burgers. - here's a burger. (jimmy laughing) (rock music) - cooking is way harder
than i thought it was. so, you're gonna have to stall people. - play the clip of the line. (man laughing) there's no stalling,
we're blocking traffic. - figure it out. - oh my goodness. carl, the line is too long i
need you to just grab burgers and just start go giving them away. you two, go, go. - hi, hi, hi, here.
- hi. - hi. i already ran out, oh god, okay. - hi, who wants burgers? thank you. want burgers, burgers? - i'm not gonna lie, i
thought owning a restaurant would be easier. it's actually kind of hard. (upbeat music) - check the back out! check the back out! - oh, show, hey! hey, check the back. - hey, look at our merch.
aim, big stack of cash. - whoa. woohoo. jimmy, jimmy. - oh my god, that's amazing.

ever worked in fast food. it's stressful. where's the flavor? this is my last one, this
is it. this is all i have. - chandler, i heard you ran out of money. - yeah, what about it?
- here's $200,000. - what? - there you go. he should be good. - wow.
- till the burgers catch up, just keep giving away money, okay. - all right, sounds good. gotta give away money 'cause
we don't have any food ready. all right. one, two, three, four,
boom, boom, boom, boom. got no food, sorry. - brad.
- in this bag, i'm putting a burger and in this bag i'm
putting a bunch of airpods and a ton of money. let's see what they pick. hey, would you rather
have this bag on the left or this bag on the right? - the one on the left. - this one? okay, well congratulations. this bag is a burger and fries and this bag is a ton
of money and airpods. so, here you go. - yeah. what there's
more then just one here. what? can i still get
the food, is that okay? - all right, fine. you can
still have food, here you go. - thanks bro, holy crap. - i wanted to check on
the line but the thing is nothing changed, there's
still a ton of cars. i never publicly shared this address. that is literally, just
people seeing the billboard out front. (upbeat music) [music] woo [music] - i got three so far. i know, i know. - hey, you guys want a burger? - i severely underestimated
how many people would come for free food. i'm calling all of my
friends, we need backup. guys, guys, i have good
news. bailey's here to help. - [kids] yay. - i know you've never made food before, but just throw burgers together. get in here, go, go, go.
just start making things. give me that camera. go make some burgers. - go, we need help.
- okay, okay, okay. all right. - how much money have you
given away at the window? - a lot. - how much food have we given away? - a lot.
- i'm going broke. - you could just charge people money. (record scratches)
- get outta here. he suggested we charge money for the food. - not.
- get outta here. go. i don't ever wanna hear you
guys talk about charging again. wait terry, are you holding a camera, man? get that camera outta your
hand. you're not a cameraman. - chandler, you hold the
camera. just go film things. - okay. i like holding this camera. it's really easy of a job.
i mean, anyone can do this. - for an unorganized
restaurant full of people that have no idea what they're doing, i'd say we're doing pretty good. (people hollering) - okay, how many people? oh my god. - there's so many people.
- holy smokes. there's so many people. you guys seem to be the
exact last people in line. so, i figured i'd give you
guys a snack to hold you off. okay.
- okay, thank you. - oh wow.
- we have two burgers left, guys.
- thank you. - just to hold you guys off. all right. we gotta get back. jimmy needs us. - all right.
- he needs more burger boys. - we need to get more burgers. (upbeat music) - put the burger in the bag
and here's some napkins. - we ran out of napkins so
we just put money in there. - oh, thank you. bye.
- thanks. bye. - how much money have we given away? eric called every single
chef that he knows and they're outside waiting. are we ready to bring 'em in? - let's go get 'em. - all right. we're about
to bring in an army. all right, come on in everybody. they keep coming.
- you're on mail. you're on mustard.
- keep on coming. - you're on the grill.
- keep 'em, what? you're on rent.
- how many people do we get? - you're on cheese.
- oh my god. - you're on the burger. - we shouldn't have to struggle anymore. now that we have a ton of extra help here, we can keep up with demand. so, we're gonna open up a second window. we're gonna start accepting cars on both sides of the restaurant. chris, you wanna man this side? - i got it.
- all right, let's do it. carl, you have competition now. chris is open across the aisle. - that's not chris. - hey, we need a book bag
full of money over here. - here's some cash for
you and chris's window. for this next customer,
let's give away two ipads because we're not letting
their window show us up. - screw their window. here's
two ipads, here you go. have a fantastic day.
- oh, thank you. - his window's doing really well. - yeah. well it's been- - he just gave away ipads out his window. - well, give me ipads.
- good idea. here's some apple products
you can give away. - all right. so i only
have one beast burger but there's a bunch of cash in there and then here's a brand new ipad. - name one other restaurant
that looks like this and this. everyone that ordered food
today got really lucky. - hi.
- hi. - this is the cash register.
- what? no. - there's some money in there.
- are you? he just gave us a cash register. - money, money. - what do we got, like four hours left and we're only a third of the way done. we got all these buns to
get rid of and that rhymed. i think. did it rhyme? - yeah.
- okay. - how's it going? how's it going? - how are you?
how many of you guys? five? - there's five of us. - their car got hit while they were waiting.
- we got side swiped. - you got side swiped? no way. they got side swiped
while they were waiting. - wait, really? hold up, right here. - whoa.
- holy cow. - you got side swiped. did they stop for you or just- - no, she just kept going. - oh dang. well, we have good news. give me a second. i may or may not have bought
an extra car to give away. this morning i went to
my friend, i was like, "hey, i think i'm gonna
wanna give away a car. can you buy one?" and
he just bought us a car. so, if you can hear us over
all the screaming people, this is the car i bought. i bought that car this morning
on an impulse, to give away. and since you got side swiped,
i thought we might as well give it to you. - mm-mm.
- yes. - no, 'cause i was just
sitting here complaining about how we was gonna get my car fixed. thank you.
- no problem. are you crying? oh,
she's gonna make me cry. - no, getting this is like, for real, i've worked hard for everything i got. i don't get nothing handed to me. - oh my gosh. i can't handle this. but here you want to come
check out your new car. (people screaming) - it's awesome, right? - thank y'all so much. y'all are such a blessing, like, for real. - [man] yo, do what? blessings, on blessings, on blessings. subscribe to mrbeast, i just did. (rock music) - apparently one of the cars
ran outta gas waiting in line. so, we're gonna go fill it up. word on the street is
you guys ran outta gas. - we ran out of gas a while ago. - oh really? all right, well
chris is gonna fill you up. that's funny. chris, you no
longer work in the restaurant. you're just the gas man. i'm gonna leave you in the hands of chris. i'm gonna go give away more food. - they're not very capable
hands, i'm not gonna lie. (upbeat music) - so, i heard that your car broke. so it turns on, but then
it turns off. ah, gotcha. there's a lot of people watching us. i feel kind of scared to give them money. so, here you go. transfer,
transfer, there you go. there's a lot of people watching. here's $10,000 to fix your car. (family screaming) we're surrounded by hundreds of people. we just gave him 10 grand. i feel like for our safety,
we should go back inside. - we should definitely go back inside. - even though we were
rushing to feed people as fast as possible, there was literally a 20 mile line of cars
and long story short, we might've been holding up traffic a bit. and after talking with the local police, who were very helpful and understanding, we decided to be responsible
and close to restaurant early. and these are our final 30 customers. (rock music) this next person is our last customer. how's it going? so you guys are actually the last people. here's three burgers for everyone. oh, and also, since you guys were last, here's a bunch of money. i don't know what you're
gonna do with it, but... - you serious, brother? yeah, there we go. bye, and
that was our last customer.
