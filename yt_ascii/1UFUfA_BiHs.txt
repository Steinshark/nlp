is none other than grandmaster hikaru nakamura streamer top three grandmaster and fisher random world chess champion going up against the 14th world chess champion vladimir karnick this is my second update video of this whole situation in the first one i gave you a big overview of a very very mysterious post that karnick put out but in this video we are going to deep dive into some of the crazy comments that have been posted mathematicians analyzing the situation and we will get into chess cheating scandal number two before we do i'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video which is

me just give you a little bit of background we are on my twitter page but let's go back to hik caro's page for a second this was posted not too long ago just a one minute overview so essentially hikaru on november the 20th tweeted vladimir aka karnick appears to be referencing my record and this is all born out of this grandmaster vladimir karnick posted on his ch.com page that a player on ch.com scored 45 and a half out of 46 consecutive games and he was averaging 29 50 3600 rather against a per an average of 2950 right and so basically hikaro and yan pishi who tweeted because he's the hero gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now hikaro was saying wait a minute yanomi and vladimir kiik are you insinuating that i'm cheating because i managed to beat people 45 and a half out of 46 games now it was determined and it was seen that it's not like hikaru was beating magnus carlson 45 and a half out of 46 what hikaru is doing when he plays blitz online is he gets opponents that are anywhere from 100 to 300 points lower rated than him and he plays them and he plays them a lot cuz there's nobody else online and he farms them like that's like that's that's life when you're 3200 okay for you and me we have opponents at our level all the the time so karu is playing these people and he's rattling off these ridiculous records and yes there was a little bit of speculation like why did kramnick say that this is interesting what is interesting about it well karnick made a post karnick doubled down and not only did karnick double down he quadrupled down and cleared the air that 100% he is basically saying hikaru is worth investigating i don't know because again chess players are like these weirdos like we never come out and say that guy's cheating you know like in in sports somebody will say oh he's on steroids we don't do that in chess instead karnick wrote a post on recent hysteria resent resentment recent hysteria okay this came out the next day i was flying from london so i couldn't make a video about this he said i have check tonight a few comments and a couple of videos chess bra for example thank god that he did not pose this after he saw my video cuz he would not respect me at all i'm hardly high enough fay to even speak kick's name on the previous post frankly a lot of nonsense has been written on the web about this but that is nothing unusual still i would like to clarify a few things and explain my stand while i was listening to eric hansen's youtube video was quite surprised to hear something no one tells publicly but everyone is aware of in private in the last few years particularly a lot of professional players have either expressed to me that hikaro is cheating or they've asked me if i think hikaro is cheating karnick is saying that eric hansen from the chess bro channel on twitch and youtube has been asked privately about hikaru's success okay let's break that down real quick essentially hikaro was born in 1987 not essentially that is literally verifiable so he 3536 years old when he started streaming he was 32 and essentially the question is well how does hikaru who used to be number two in the world and was always known for his raping bl how is he having such a career renaissance right how was he top three in the world how was he winning the official random world championship how does he win basically every online event how is he very clearly the second best chess player in the world right now behind magnus in my opinion so i guess some people have privately shared concerns like wow hikaru is so good online how is that possible right he's he's older he's 35 36 like how's it but i think literally to anybody on the planet i mean not anybody on the planet not everybody agrees with this but my take is there's a lot less pressure on the guy's shoulders being a professional chess player before 2020 was very difficult if you weren't magnus carlson you're trying to get get into these invitations and these slots and if you're not winning consistently your rating is dropping then you're not going to get those invitations to top tournaments there's less opportunities to make money not playing chess you can make a lot less courses there's not much social media there was a lot more pressure and this has taken a huge weight off his shoulder now he can just play for the love of the game but also take the little bit of the edge off and he's always been the best online three and probably 1 player in the world like undoubtedly no increment blitz and that's important like that i it he hearu cheting is impossible it's just not possible and why why would hearu cheat against 2900s like why would hikaru not wait to cheat in a $2 million event like it just doesn't make any sense anyway what a coincidence the same thing happened to me and those were different players karnick is saying that he has had conversations with people who don't fully believe that you know car was legit okay i never really checked or i thought about it therefore i decided to check statistics i shally believe no one is caesar's wife i had to look up what this meant i think it's basically saying you know caesar's wife is above the law and everyone from time to time heavily overperforming must be checked seriously including myself of course i don't know the last time karnick overperformed in an online event but that is i'm not trying to be rude but that is just the reality he was of course very very very very good but having checked hikaro statistics i have found numerous low probabilities performances of him and his opponents some of which have extremely low mathematical probability according to math aans way below 1% according to the calculation of those professional mathematicians one of it presented recently and more to follow considering all above said leaving it without any further checking would be an insult to the professional players who might be wrong in their conclusions but have full right seeing numerous highly unusual performances to ask for explanations even it's not my goal or legacy to give conclusions it's obvious to me that deeper checking must take place in cases whatever the name of the player no idea about the outcome of this checking which of course never be done by chess.com but ignoring so many huge inconsist consistencies is nonobjective and completely biased there is more than one possible explanation for statistics of a well-known streamer but the least likely that all players involved are clean mathematically and according to basic common sense combined with basic knowledge of chess in the meantime i would offer to make detailed investigations of my games and performances would only welcome this yeah we don't need that nobody's above the law should have special stuff i will continue to prevent true statistics couldn't care less about the names of the players involved because we ch has players in one boat equal in rights must be treated in the same manner rating on pr whatever rating pr some might have all in all like this is like what he is basically saying is that no player is above the law everybody should be subjected to fair play scan whether that's you know getting your shoes you have to take off your shoes like at tournaments like maybe they have you know extra security at tournaments magnus has to take his shoes off just like the rest all the top players in the world have to subject themselves to some sort of fair play measures where this doesn't make any sense to me number one is like why would kramnick post this without the statistics and this mathematical stuff that he claims this is the part i do not understand if he truly in his heart of heart believes that hikaro is an illegitimate chess player why not wait like two weeks why why start this complete insanity and then say oh you just wait oh you wait i'm going to post it like why didn't he just wait i i don't i don't know i i i don't and for the record a mathematician did respond and people were responding i'm going to go through these comments some of these comments are crazy i mean you got karnick in here responding to people saying in short because of most of these tests do not fit the criteria just one falsified number from many to get some form of probability which would be very shocking the whole data science research presented by the streamer is laughable for anyone who has a clue about it but believe it if you want basically now karnick is in the chess.com blog responding to these random folks like i it's crazy so here was a comment that was actually deleted from this thread that kick is talking about so real mathematicians and statisticians like real data scientists real people who have jobs and know how to crunch information like this responded right and so here was one it's a very long one if you you could it if you'd like but basically a mathematician responded p bash hopefully i'm pronouncing that correctly and he said look with all my great respect to you karnick well all my admiration i believe it is clear you don't fully understand how probability works essentially this is one event the hikaro winning streak is one event he plays thousands of games every year so yes you ru such chances below 1% but you roll them over thousands of possible sets of 46 games so overall he is very like to have several winning streaks of 40 games all right so here we have p who's a mathematician from poland and here he gave some numbers i'm not going to sit here and pretend to understand any of this but if you toss a coin five times you get probability you get five heads in a row it's 3% but if you flip it six times you get this right and i mean it depends on how when the scenarios occur and in what order and again we're not going to sit here and deep dive all the analysis but you know p says he sees this mistake pretty much always among respectable chess statistics commentators of course one tournament it can happen but when it happens multiple times it's suspicious people often say this grandmaster had a one in 10,000 performance but let's say there's a thousand active grand masters on average they play 10 tournaments a year so let's say in a few consecutive years there's a dozen such performances it becomes highly unlikely all of them are fair but several of them can happen karo's case is not a simple cuz you have to factor in chances of victory in any given game and essentially long story short i believe it's almost certain karo gets multiple 40 game winning streaks every year but to estimate the exact number you'd have to model individual winning chances for every game put it a chain of events etc etc etc so if we take karo's last year's blitz stats we get 77% wins he car wins 78% of the time that he plays over 4,100 games let's assume he plays 750 games with this percentage blah blah blah blah blah so 10% of such a win streak of course it's still far from the reality of his games the frequency and pattern of farming but the point is the closer we get to the reality of life good and bad conditions for winds are not distributed evenly the higher likelihood of an abnormal event occurring somewhere down the line so real mathematicians who have no skin in this game they they don't care whether he car's a cheater or not like that is not what they're interest interested in and for the record he's not okay like he not and it has nothing to do with you know the kids there's a big term right now that the young generation uses called glazing don't look that up but but it that's that's that's not what's happening here okay i am that's you can't say that in a courtroom your honor i believe there is glazing no like that's not nobody believes this nobody nobody it would be bigger than the i don't i mean it just it doesn't again you look at the numbers you look at real mathematicians responding the chance that hikaru wins multiple 40 times in a row over the course of a year is very high you know how i know cuz he did it he did it yesterday literally to prove a point while he was streaming hikaru he lost a couple games after hikaru literally went on a winning streak of 45 games he lost the game and then he won 1 2 2 3 he made a draw 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17' 19 20 21 22 23 24 if you count this all the way up it gets over 40 i i tweeted about it now if you look at the people he played he played a 2700 this is like a young prodigy he played him many times you know there's a big rating gap there then he played a 2800 2800 2800 many many times 28 27 right these are all guys that okay it wasn't 2950 but the point stands like hikaru is able to beat somebody that many games in a row it's it's not that that's not that's not that rare and he could do this with 2900s and 3000s 3000s are tougher but if he's really focused it and now yeah karnick kick's been in here and you know he's been saying at some point i will share all my numbers and he said the answer is it's not true you should you if you spend five minutes on your own in instead of checking respect others and i mean it is really wild like this is a world champion and somebody asked karnick if he's worried about getting sued he said sued for publishing open source statistics or because some group of excited degenerates degenerates claiming it's an accusation which is i guess me he's saying i'm an excited degenerate but i i don't understand how karnick wants this perceived like he's claiming that that you youtubers are excited degenerates claiming he's accusing karo and yet he's posting like one day at a time saying this is so interesting and then somewhere later down the line he he posted that you know it's an appetizer i mean yeah this one was wild i delete calculations of statisticians he he deleted this he deleted this from the thread and he said he deleted it cuz it's misleading if you know anything of statistics a little bit would understand that most of these stats they write pure amateurish nonsense all those numerous commentators suddenly become very active be why because they he knows what is coming next he knows i mean karnick is literally in parenthesis got to give him credit by the way he's using karo's desired pronouns that is that is really sweet of him i mean read this sentence numerous commentators suddenly are becoming active why because they he hikaru knows what is coming next and her discrediting karnick and my research in advance because the next coming will knock out him i mean read this sentence they're going to knock him out how is this not supposed to be interpreted as an a fullon accusation of cheating what do you want me to do what do you want the people to do commentators in hikaru are discrediting kramnick before he can publish anything because they know that the am i living in a fantasy world like how am i supposed to read this there is nothing to answer everything will be revealed and clear get ready to shout nonsense spread false numbers discredit me agony and concerning deleted messages i hope people understand i'm i'm not i'm saying you are not welcome here it's my blog my home please leave it go write your nonsense elsewhere so you can only agree with him i don't understand this is one of the greatest chess players who has ever lived it's so wild oh my goodness and he's a legend in russia i mean he is a legend in russia like do i agree with what he's saying about cheating in general do i agree with that nobody's above the law yes but once you start going down this path all credibility is lost the way he's handling is oh my goodness this one cracked me up there is a joke on this theme that why he's deleting comments two birds are sitting on a tree one looks down sees a guy washing his car and tells another bird look at this we've pooped on his car and this bastard is deleting our comments bustard but this is so wild to me this is the 14th world chess champion i don't know why i'm like not allowed to comment but i guess ch.com has me censored now some of you might not know this you know and i think i just have i just have like some more stuff in here some more comments some of you might not know this you know karnick was involved in his own massive cheating scandal you would think a guy that was involved in a massive cheating scandal would know better than to handle this the way he's handling in 2006 karnick played against vessel and talv in the world chess championship match and it was called toilet gate because the topalov team said karnick been going to the toilet too much and they shut down his toilet they literally in 2006 shut down kick's access to the toilet in a world chest championship match and he forfeited a game in protest i mean karnick literally did not show up like you would think of all people on the planet to go down this path you're going to discredit me before i publish the report that's going to knock him out like what what is happening and the one of the last things that you know i want to say i've been seeing stuff about like karma right like hikaru got on the bandwagon early with the hans nean stuff that's a big thing so let me address that real quick right i it's a little you could argue there's a little bit of karma there but all in all if you remember correctly what came out about hans after magnus withdrew from the event was that it was sort of a very well-kept secret about han's online history which he then addressed he addressed it publicly in that interview in st louis he could argue it was under duress he he could argue it it's not but hans himself said that when i was 12 and 16 i cheated online this is a complete completely different situation like this is not even this is not even close and also it doesn't help that like hans is now like the bad boy like the villain of the chess world he's like going after the bozas for playing poker and he's going after me for youtube titles like i if that's where he wants to do the go fine fine i defended the guy and i said we shouldn't pile on there's no physical evidence of him cheating and i don't necessarily know if cheating online as a teenager when you're 12 and 16 damage should should prevent you from playing forever this this is not the same should hikaru have like not piled on in the early days of the hans thing probably in retrospect that is the way he thinks but i don't know i haven't spoken to hikaro could he have been a little bit more delicate a little bit more careful i know i was i know i was because i i had no idea what was going to happen and i was going to give the young man the benefit of the doubt okay but i don't know and like that you could say it's karma but that's like a really this is ridiculous like what karnick is doing it is ridiculous if you have a legitimate case against the guy wait why is he posting on his blog and being like i i don't the whole thing is so strange and the last thing this was very interesting i i figured i would just share this last with you this is t senson he's a norwegian journalist primarily in chess i think and one of my best crnic memories was when he brought a bottle of gin eats better than nothing from his hotel room in norway stanga while playing blitz versus maxim vra and theur this is 200 i don't know when this was actually what a photo how far we've come what a photo kids watching this drinking is bad alcohol is bad but if you have to drink jin be of age though what a photo we have g we have come a long way from this this is this is wild and that's all i mean that's you know that's what i have for you today i'll let you know if there's another update i i hope karnick doesn't come after me again i my my my stance on this is there's absolut i mean there's just no way that and by the way ben fold even came out in sport of hear say there's no way hiar cheats just no way this thing is always focusing focus on me oh my goodness hold on on me now hello camera there you go i don't know why it's been doing that fine gold came out in support of hikaru yeah look i agree with the need for there to be better stricter fair play measures in chess anti-che measures in chess but once you start doing this little crusade your credibility is lost and and that's why you know karnick to me is a chess player aside is worth listening to but after you do something like this it's it's it's really hard to do that that and that's unfortunate so that's all we'll see what happens next i think hikaru is unequivocally 110% innocent and i don't know what karnick is doing and if but let's see these numbers let's see these big numbers the you know and that's all check out displate and black
