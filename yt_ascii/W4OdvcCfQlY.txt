tether just lost 10 billion dollars and i want to talk about it welcome to coffeezilla i'm your internet detective so tether is the world's largest stablecoin and it's had so many controversies i couldn't even fit them all in this 35 minute documentary i did but despite the critics saying for years that tether isn't backed and that its collapse is imminent tether has just sort of managed to stick around like a cockroach in a greasy crypto kitchen nobody likes them we all try to ignore them but getting rid of them is impossible without hurting business so if all of that was true 11 months ago when i first talked about tether what's different this time well tether is in danger of collapsing because for the first time they're seeing an unprecedented run on their reserves 10 billion dollars were redeemed over the course of 14 days just these last two weeks which is over 10 percent of their total supply and in the event that tether is not fully backed this is the way we find out people keep asking for their money until there's no money left you can see it from the chart actually there's never been anything like this in tether's history already we saw what happens when a coin the size of luna and ust fails and tether is four times their size so a collapse could be catastrophic but if all of that sounds very scary let me tell you the other side of the story reasons you shouldn't be worried because according to tether they're fully backed one-to-one by us dollars or equivalents unlike luna which wasn't backed at all meaning tether could keep losing billions in theory and still have money to redeem their tethers right until the very last one which is very unlike luna tether also claims to be world class in transparency and regularly releases reports from accountants that agree tether is a hundred percent backed your money is safe so you might be wondering why are so many people including myself afraid tether will collapse the answer is quite simple actually because tether and their executives are about as reliable as amber heard if you want to know where all their money is if you haven't already watched my documentary on them tether mints new lies about as often as their magic dollars they lied for years that they were backed one to one by us dollars and the new york attorney general accuses them of covering up losses to quote protect their bottom lines like holy crap so that's the thing i'm not exactly accusing tether of beginning to lie i'm saying if you want to believe tether you have to believe they stopped in the first place and that really is the bullish case on tether nobody even tries to defend their past actions other than to say they've changed in fact here's an example of that a reddit post which says tether is shady but is it a scam let's find out yeah believe it or not that's a defense of tether and in other news that house over there is smoking but is it on fire not only that defenders of tether also point to attestations from independent accountants how could this be a big farce they say when tether releases reports that are checked by accountants right the only issue with this is that those accountants are from the cayman islands which you know it's sort of the place you go to if you want to dodge financial regulations and look i get it some people think that accountants are mystical creatures that are bound to the truth and literally incapable of lying but unfortunately they're just humans there are good ones there are bad ones and then they're outright fraudulent ones like people seem to forget enron you know which operated for 16 years on the basis of fraudulent audits which tether hasn't even released an audit they've only done attestations meanwhile enron got one of the top accounting firms arthur anderson to say that they were making billions of dollars in profits while actually losing money like that happened and if you had listened to their independent accountants instead of paying attention to all the red flags you would have been fooled right up until they collapsed and you lost all your money so i do think something similar could be happening here i think people are underestimating the risk that mha cayman which was formerly more cayman is just lying outright and that's not an accusation it's just a statement of probabilities either tether has stopped lying or they didn't and of the two of them i personally think the second is more likely but obviously it'd be great to know for sure and one way we might do that is by trying to get the exact records of their reserves which incidentally coindesk tried to do and tether fought and has been fighting in court they don't want to release the information saying it would expose proprietary business information so there's that tether doesn't seem to want everyone to know the exact truth of how back tether is really but whatever the number really is whether it be 100 backed 99 back 50 20 really what that ends up meaning in reality is that's just the number of dollars they can redeem until they're insolvent and that's exactly why it's scary when suddenly people start redeeming billions of dollars because now we're stress testing this thing that's sort of propping up a lot of the crypto markets you only find out if a bank doesn't have the money when people decide to withdraw all at once and so that's actually another thing i wanted to talk about incidentally is who is redeeming all this tether because it's not the individuals making a run for it your average joe it appears to be the whales the guys in the know which is a very scary thought we know this because protos did a massive investigation into who bought the majority of all tether ever acquired and what they found is that most of tether was bought by market makers and big funds and companies individuals only bought a tiny fraction add to that the fact that you can't redeem tether except in chunks of a hundred thousand dollars or more and this isn't retail traders that are heading for the exits it's the whales the institutions like alameda research and funds who are taking their money out and that begs the question what do these big whales know are they just scared of what happened with luna i don't know it's possible or is it something else either way i would say if you see a lot of people running towards an exit and you're not you should probably wonder why they're doing so and while i certainly hope nobody loses any money on this thing i think tether is ultimately a ticking time bomb which incidentally is what their logo sort of resembles a nuclear bomb explosion anyways that's basically all i wanted to talk about pump the stock it's fully backed and thanks for watching
