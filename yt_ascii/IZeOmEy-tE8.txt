i told you this would be horrible oh god i can't even tell what any of this is hopefully whatever is in here is durable that's right ladies and gentlemen we are gonna water cool a whole gaming pc using nothing but parts from wish.com do you want to know how much all this literal garbage costs oh i don't know over 1300 it's the second most expensive pc i've ever built what is this you're laughing but it's not funny unlike my segway to our sponsor nzxt wants to make building a custom pc easier with nzxt build just set a budget see how the computer performs in your favorite games and build takes care of the rest use the link below to get your own custom pc today and it'll probably be better than this one it will [music] even ignoring the outrageous prices there were three main problems with trying to water cool from wish.com first was shipping it took two months to the day for all these parts to arrive and actually that's problem number two not all of them did three of the items we ordered never made it and we ended up having to cancel them fortunately sort of alex ended up ordering extra thank you alex so we should have enough to build a system finally even finding water cooling components on wish.com was extremely difficult their seo is terrible you search for something as descriptive as g1 quarter fitting and you end up with clothing actually no matter what you search for it's mostly thongs bongs and that's just wrongs that's a good line can you tell he's a professional writer thank you and that's pretty much everything that was written the rest is just a list of all the random crap we ordered well do you want to just see like the kind of crap that comes up good video prep alex thank you is that a wearable breasts yeah so this is a search for g1 quarter fittings which is very descriptive and in the name of the fittings that we got like i don't know what all of this does and like why is there just a high pressure fuel pump for a sonata why is this here just one left to order now alex it's almost definitely not there i don't even know how you found any water cooler it was very difficult there's not a single water cooling thing so far yeah none but there's a massage gun that one's actually not a bad deal assuming it works oh is that a tube no but yes it was really difficult to find this stuff okay where do we start do you even know what's inside these boxes yeah i do the case is where we should start that's the case yeah the wk 500 schematic happy mining and keep believing believe god yeah so finding water cooling compatible cases was very difficult so we ended up with a mining rig yeah because this i know you can just like zip tie the stuff to and it should be fine our other option was like a define seven for 500 bucks but i just didn't want to do that how much should i pay for this mining rig 105 plus 16 in shipping i've had worse yeah are there any instructions yeah this is the schematic so i'm pretty sure all the pieces are here 10 screws to put it together i think it's pretty easy i got it snugged up over here look how far off this is oh my god it's not close this is clearly like cnc machined how did they even do it that bad i'm gonna snug that baby in there oh yeah repaired oh yeah not bad okay with this next part you're going to see kind of the vision for this so this right here is our radiator oh that i like it's rad yep 480. it should be copper this might actually not be a bad deal so this was 78 dollars plus 16 in shipping oh my god though it's very crooked but it flat on the table you can probably see saw it now that i've got the main pieces screwed into the tolerance is actually seeing not bad what you could do is you could mount the fans first which would give us an opportunity to open up this cool moon r4 rgb fan pack hell yeah i gotta say i don't really know what to expect here alex hydraulic bearings wow hydraulics i'm actually pretty disappointed our first fans that we were supposed to get got cancelled oh really but they were what did they make an off-color joke no they were rgb they were rgb but there was just a green a red and a blue fan in there oh these appear to be actual rgb they come with a remote and everything i got some fan filters i'm taken way back to the early days of pc modding uv blue freaking acrylic fan filters are you kidding me wow this is just bits power yeah so they covered the upc this may actually be a genuine bits power fan grill but from like 10 years ago yeah crazy and it's just been sitting as dead stock in a warehouse all this time and now i have it great the weirdest thing about these is that they were called bits power cooled pc fitting personal computer water reservoir sled tube compression rotary screw adapter extender expansion parts i found them when i was looking for fittings i paid 26 each alex yes why did you order so many the thumbnail oh god oh wow this paper is so old oh my god it comes off in tiny pieces alex also this uv blue acrylic seems to have lost a lot of its blue with age so we're going to be using our shunt modded 3090 i chose this card because one i don't want to potentially screw up another 3090 and two i made a custom vga mounting bracket for this because i assume that even though our gpu block says it's universal it's probably not going to fit oh wait how are we going to plug in the i o for the graphics card if you're planning to mount it here and have the radiator here that's a good question because on a mining rig they don't have io well shoot so the reason we're using matx it's the board that i grabbed off the shelf not really okay fair enough i have a terrible idea that might fix all of our problems instead of you know mounting it right here we could just mount it right here the i o comes out and then we have a nice way for our tubes to come back around to our water cooling stuff it's genius actually thank you i mean it's still got like six hole screws into the radiator that ought to be more than enough for anyone yeah you only like two or three i don't know what's worse the fact that you think that's a good solution or the fact that i agree if you push down it looks like one of these screws is lining up okay yeah there's a temperature readout built into our water block this is from freezemod.com rgb full color remote control components that's pretty cool if it works at all that was 73 dollars ah that's not the dumbest thing i've ever heard oh right we're gonna need thermal compound now we've got the biggest tuba thermal compound i think i've ever seen but hey at least it's high stability and reliability apply to cpu vga led chipset and other pc components i'm gonna put this all over my leds and my pc components here also it says it has an excellent thermal conductivity of 3.05 watts per meter kelvin that's better than some thermal pads it's very watery oh hold on maybe thermal paste okay that's really gross yeah should be fine this is the gpu block that we got now the listing says perfectly fit the gpu carry away more heat from gpu quickly yeah that sounds good oh that doesn't fit yeah it's not even close to fitting i'm not surprised unfortunately we do have a backup plan well i already made one of these for our other video to mount a vga cooler to this card so we're just repurposing it cool meanwhile i'm trying to mount the cpu block and it comes with these like gnarly metal washers you don't secure the back plate at all you just plonk the block on and then the back plate is secured by just screwing it into it oh so you could just like destroy your cpu by titling it down too much yeah you could you could you could mangle your board you could mingle your board with this for sure yeah nice i love that we went trident z royal by the way oh you've got to also i see that you started looking at our fittings yeah they're terrible they're terrible and we don't have enough why don't we have enough because wish is a terrible sight so i ordered 20 and they only charged us for five and we only got five right but i took a screenshot of the cart and we without a doubt had twenty selected why five why would they come in past five so i did bring over fittings from our warehouse but like if you tried to water cool from wish you'd just be screwed what size are these i think they're the same as the tubing i haven't double checked it yet though okay because both the tubing and the fittings said underneath note it can be plus minus three centimeters which means they can throw literally anything in because this is what 10 millimeters across yeah one okay you could literally end up with a fitting this big oh my gosh and i would say that could come down to translation but like s-i measurements are sort of a thing internationally not my finest cable management here it's pretty not amazing yeah i don't know i mean that kind of works right oh we have new cable ties on ltt store lots of different colors and they come in 50 packs now for the same price as 20 of the old ones and they're the exact same quality we do kind of have to figure out what we're going to do about the gpu no you have to figure out what we're going to do about the gpu i am going to keep opening wish water cooling components what the hell did you order it was ac yes what well you know we have our uv reactive fan grills we need to be able to have some color what makes you think these are uv it said they are it just says purple on the packaging no uv ir or radiation image what i specifically bought these because they were uv lights oh my god what am i even looking at here wait what is happening right now so this because these have to be dc so oh what the hell so yeah you just go ac straight into this this says uv they work it does work they're definitely uv okay okay and my uv blue acrylic here is definitely uv blue awesome problems that aren't so easy to solve our gpu cooling yeah so you keep trying to drag me back into this gum first of all i bought this back plate which says specifically that it's 3080 and 3090 compatible oh yeah it's a lot smaller than i thought it would be uh-huh these are a lot bigger than i thought so i thought that these were going to be memory chip coolers that's what they were called they are not that at least there's only 20 bucks plus 10 shipping i mean that'll keep something cool yeah i think we can cool the back of our gpu with those we had some people helpfully point out that this thermal shmu what's it called again k5 pro k5 pro is only really suitable for like up to a certain thickness but realistically what other choice do we have here ladies and gentlemen well we could also scrape most of this off get some thick thermal pads put them on here i am a little bit concerned about this shorting on these caps that are here these appear to be covered in silicone though oh is that dielectric grease yeah it's not electric grease oh okay how are we going to get this shmu off i found that a guitar pick and patience works not too bad oh this project is horrible yeah that's literally the first thing i said in this video linus i don't know what's worse the fact that i've removed this much thermal goop or the fact that there's still this much on the card like if i just went toothbrush alcohol bath on this with that alcohol doesn't do anything i tried really yeah oh our memory chip heatsinks are a little bit too big so i'm just gonna make them touch smaller [music] perfect in other news i'm making great progress on removing the k5 pro not bad it turns out if you add a little bit of friction and heat it kind of flakes away so this toothbrush is removing it actually really well now we can see if alcohol does anything because we've got little enough k5 on there that it might actually make a difference oh yeah it helps so you wanted to talk back plate mounting yeah so i'm thinking back plate can just get zip tied on these are the screws that mount our block and i feel like that they are higher oh i forgot about this you need to screw them in oh wow these are threaded they aren't threaded it's just like the same size oh i see well they're threaded now yeah the head of this is a little bit higher than the memory chips yeah so we do need thermal pads on here just bring it up a bit and i think you can just zip tie this down it'll be fine we could also just screw straight through this and hard mount it i love it probably break that and break that and break this no no with the thermal pads thermal pads okay yeah we got a plan let's mark it mark me daddy well it's really soft copper not that that really matters but normally don't get holes quite that deep there it is you don't you dare you get that out of here now which way do you want our cool moon fans blowing into the red yeah probably okay oh oh oh fan grills yep i did think that those came with mesh oh they don't they don't no it's going to involve bending the radiator and the fans a bit but it's on one problem i observed with the mid-2000s aesthetic is that we're not going to be getting a lot of it oh i didn't even notice that yet oh come on and also how much airflow is actually getting through this fan here this one it's gonna be fine ah you get almost all of your airflow like right that's yeah it's blocking the wall yeah it's blocking a lot oh sick you got one of those double helix reservoirs that's awesome how much did i pay for this originally i actually had a helix one that was rgb that i was super stoked on oh that's cool but they canceled it you know i bought one of these from the original guy on xtreme systems even did tubes down the middle so you could actually have your uv like cathode down the middle of the helix and i had a frosted i had a frosted blue acrylic double helix it was super cool that was 30 plus 16 in shipping wow that's not bad yeah so actually i was thinking maybe like here or here we could go sideways it's not the best for bleeding air out of the loop i was also really tempted to just buy a bong and use that as the reservoir because there's just so many more of them that moment when you expense a bung to work we're going for it we're going top mount i don't care if it's going to bleed worse watch this you're going to love my nuts what's better than a double helix reservoir a double helix reservoir on stilts hell yeah i still haven't found a pump oh god is this it so it comes with suction cups for mounting because it's obviously an aquarium pump but then they include one of these double-sided foam jobbies as though the suction cups are gonna oh it does stick to it that's pretty impressive i wasn't expecting that me neither touchewish.com touche i'm kind of thinking i want this flow meter like right attached to the reservoir what do you think of that sure that looks sweet right alex this is absolutely crapped here too it's so stiff including shipping it was thirty dollars a roll thirty dollars a roll you know when yvonne hounds me about waste from the writing department i defend you people that's fine it doesn't matter oh oh i pinched my boob what what the back end oh boy did that ever hurt that's a nice clean cut though poor alex has been working over on the other side of the table i have almost taken it out multiple times here's a nice little pro water cooling tip if you have a choice with your radiator on your side you want the inlet to be at the bottom because that way the water will push the air out the top makes bleeding a lot faster wow that motherboard is bowed eight air that probably over tightened the cpu block check it out oh yeah jeez have you given any updates on the gpu lately we're almost done heck yeah and it goes this way other way it looks kind of sick yeah the other side looks pretty sick as well functional oh hey okay sure oh my god not a fan of what you're doing right now it's not like threaded threaded why do people even watch this it's cause you can't look away isn't it [music] [applause] there's a good chance we need to put in our fittings before this gets attached i also just realized that this is really small at 90 degrees for some reason so we might yeah this is a big die we don't necessarily want that mounted at a diagonal like that seeing like it's like that with that in mind i guess this is what we want in terms of tubes coming off sure everything outlined in gold has got to go aluminum dust is very bad for you so if you are going to grind it first of all make sure that you have a grinding wheel that's okay for aluminum or it might explode you know put on a face shield put on a mask it's a huge pain in the butt but we're going to do it [music] you know what the funny part is is in my bag of tricks i already had solutions to all these problems low profile memory sinks ones i had actually bent from tubes getting in the way before many years ago but we have to use these so this is what we ended up with [music] oh what what we haven't put on our rgb tube sleeving oh my god that's a cooler master product that's not even yeah wish stuff well on wish they didn't say it was cooler master but it is it might be because if they told you that it was cooler master it would be really easy to go and just buy it somewhere else for way cheaper yeah so on amazon.com it's sixty dollars on wish.com it was 95. oh really actually we didn't pay for this oh really we saw it on wish and we were like cooler master already sent us this it's really stupid just buy it again thanks alex for the rest of this project you were entirely merciless so it wouldn't have surprised me if you had bought it yeah that's really dumb it is really dumb brandon i mean we don't even know if this is non-conductive actually it actually looks like poo that gpu is definitely just like kill me please but we won't do it because it's a 30 90. now after our shunt mod video for this 3090 people were like oh yeah it's a lot of tech tips they can just get a 39 whenever they want we also can't get them yeah we got a couple new editors they took our last ones we haven't been able to get a 30-90 for quite a while there's a shortage ladies and gentlemen it's real confirmed okay holy this is awful wish.com this is there's your thumbnail oh it's clean i was hoping that one work yeah right this is a moment in computing history the way that i see it it truly is i thought we had reached peak meme build but this proves it we weren't even close this is next level this is the lord of the memes two more things oh this oh my god i don't know like there or something could work hey what about you get it leak testing and i'll use twenty dollars of vhb tape to attach it how we doing so far here buds okay well one thing what about we move my laptop away from where you're spilling oh yeah your laptop could move okay not gonna lie that flow meter is kind of cool look at it go i don't know that i would add four more points of failure to my loop over it but like it's pretty it's pretty cool these fans out front i don't even know if we need the uv i know right that looks amazing i haven't even seen this yet it's like a party and every color in the rainbow's invited oh she works the operation was a success 32 gigabytes of ram do we have our ss nice oh my god also cpus at 24 degrees it's pretty good well it's got a quad rat on it right yeah this is awesome i am i'm just jazzed right now system's working great but before that i just want to talk about this guy for a second so to combine these together they gave us this yeah i showed the camera that earlier yeah it's terrifying and it made me think it's to combine them it's to combine them that's so stupid so look at this it's not ac is it is it ac there's 120 volts ac just right here just just exposed if you stuck your pinky in there you'd be electrocuted just are you just right there serious mate so my solution for mounting these is putting a straight in the garbage that's terrifying well the e-waste bin we're gonna take it out of there and put it in our e-waste bin but yes wow just has exposed as freaking ac just right there 120 volt that is unbelievable and then that's why it comes with these so you can frickin just freaking they're not plugged in okay so you could just twist them together yeah geniuses tynan from engineering creator warehouse who was that i didn't think it was that bad unreal okay but the rest of the system the rest of it's great is sick right so i ran time spy and temps are awesome so gpu core 63 degrees max frickin memory did get up to 100 degrees yeah but that's acceptable it goes up to 120 like who cares yeah cpu max temperature 80 degrees and you doubted the memory cooling solution it's 100 degrees it's not great it's it's fine that's so awesome sorry what our cpu you end up at 80 degrees 4.9 gigahertz all cores that's not bad at all yeah this is like actually acceptable yeah i mean it costs too much we could have spent half as much to get better performance but i could have spent a tenth on aliexpress for basically the same thing minor details minor details alex oh and we do have control of the rgb on the fans it's ir also fan speed's on there which is also ir for some reason oh okay but at least it has and the music works so put it on like music really i guess i could sing my own song hi i am singing this is flashing with my beats i i'll never walk on the streets late at night because i'm small and people could mug me but they don't bug me i what are you doing [music] it's doing something yes definitely doing something confirmed how did this compare to a typical 30 90 score so is it actually adequately cooled with the shunt mod yeah average score' oh so we're actually in like really good shape then like thousand points higher than this typically would be pretty good just like our sponsor msi's mag z690 series is a great fit for your 12th gen intel processor there's both the torpedo which supports ddr5 memory and the tomahawk which supports ddr4 both motherboards have an extended heatsink design with an m.2 thermal solution for their quad m.2 connectors and feature pci express gen 5 to get the most out of future m.2 ssds as well as future graphics cards they've both got wi-fi and two and a half gig lan and you can learn more about the tomahawk and torpedo msi z690 series motherboards at the link down below if you guys enjoyed this video you might enjoy our aliexpress pc or other wish one yeah or the other which one that one has enough fuse
