in 2024 hundreds of number enthusiasts gathered in 
a school hall in london to try and calculate pi to   a record number of digits by hand a project which 
would require untold hours of doing laborious   calculations with nothing but paper and a pen this 
was all the fault of ridiculous maths person matt   parker and it was not going well it is where 
we now 10 7 we're about to start packing up on   the end of friday day four of six and i'm still 
working on a sheet here which goes up to digit   the 100th digit so that's as far as we've got and 
the record is 527 i don't think we're going to do   this we're going to do this it's the first day we 
have a small number of volunteers in setting up   all the sheets working out the systems getting 
it up been going it's all going so well we are   a few short days and several hundred volunteers 
away from a record amount of pie by hand it had   started well enough on day one a core group of 
50 or so nerds had gathered to do the preliminary   setup calculations matt and his team explained how 
the pi formula was going to work and what initial   calculations needed to be done as the rest of the 
week would be spent doing long divisions a lot of   time tables had to be generated for the various 
devisers these would be referred to extensively   in all future calculations it wasn't exciting work 
but everyone was in high spirits so far it's very   exciting very busy i think there's a lot of 
the initial admin that needs doing that you forget   about but it's nice to get get calculating 
um and i'm now we've started i'm more hopeful   than i was yesterday we haven't actually done a 
calculation like this in 80 years we don't need   to do this calculation it's just you know can 
we still do it do we still have the ability to   do these things i think that's interesting to find 
out well i'm sort of i'm cautiously optimistic i'm   fairly confident we'll beat the 2022 record yes 
this wasn't the first time matt and the team had   tried to calculate pi by hand he had made several 
attempts by himself since 2016 but never getting   more than six digits correct in 2020 he had a team 
of five people for one day who managed five digits   in 2020 2 20 people gathered for 2 days to achieve 
11 digits this time matt wasn't messing around up   to 200 people a day would churn out calculations 
for six solid days and matt had a whole new   formula there was a category of pi equations 
known as machin-like formula and of the hundreds   available we picked this one pi / 4 equals 
and then you've got the sum of seven different   arctans each with a coefficient out the front this 
means in theory we're doing seven different arctan   calculations which can all be done independently 
this is quite parallelizable so we can keep track of   them we gave them all names and we went through 
the rainbow of colours as well and so the final   answer is pi itself we preemptively multiplied 
all the coefficients by four and all we have to   do now is calculate a lot of arctans the record to 
beat was set in the'70 by british school teacher   william shanks over several decades shanks had 
calculated 707 digits of pi but it wasn't until   the 1940s that someone found a mistake in the 
528th digit making the current world record of   digits of pi computed by hand 527 digits matt had 
even brought a little momento of shank's work to   help keep him motivated yes i bought an original 
1873 print of shank's calculation which is right   there that's that's shank's pie that they thought 
was right made a mistake little embarrassing   we're hoping to fix that but i thought it' be 
nice just you know this is kind of my spiritual   predecessor having it here today i can't take 
it actually in where we're doing the calculation   because as well as being a no calculator zone 
which makes sense no calculation devices in   there i probably shouldn't take in 527 correct 
digits a pie as well as the setup the day one crew   did start doing a few of the main calculation 
steps and the answers which came back were not   as correct as they had hoped yeah we're getting 
a lot more mistakes than we expected i'll be   honest i was hoping most of the sheets would 
match when they come back in again but the   folks over here you can see the discussion on 
the checking table they estimate when they get   two like duplicate sheets back in again they 
don't match 75% of the time which means we're   getting a lot of mistakes now we' got systems in 
place now we're going to over here we're going   to send out more copies so be three each time 
which will slow us down a bit but everyone's   having fun so we'll see how that impacts us 
when we have a room full of people in on day two day two and 100 new human calculators have 
joined the core team bringing the room total up   to 150 people matt had asked in previous youtube 
videos for volunteers and people had shown up from   around the world the only requirement was the 
ability to do long division because division   is all you need to compute an arctan how do you 
actually calculate an arctan thankfully there is   something called a tailor series it's an infinite 
series of things you have to add and subtract   together to give you the value of your arctan 
you're adding and subtracting these different   fractions with odd powers and odd coefficients 
underneath we just need to calculate enough of   these we did it in two steps because the powers 
are always the next odd power power up we could   first of all work out 1 /x and then we just 
divide that by x^2 and then we divide that   by x^2 and each time if we divide by x^2 we will 
get the next 1 /x to the power of some odd number   once we have those we then separately divide 
each one by its appropriate odd value to put   the three the five the seven the 11 and so on back 
in and by following those steps we have the chain   of dividing down that main spine of values and 
separately with dividing by the odds the process   for each human calculator was simple they would 
join the queue and wait to be issued a calculation   which needed to be done from one of the seven 
handout desks one desk per arctan then they would   visit the pi-brary to borrow the devisor times 
tables they would need and then find a seat on   the calculation floor and get cracking once their 
calculation sheet was complete they would hand it   back in at the check-in desk return their times 
table to the pi-brary and start the process again   we're doing the pi-brary section so our job is to 
make sure that when people come down to do their   divisions they need their appropriate division 
table so if you're dividing by seven we got a   seven table right here and if you're dividing 
by pacific square pacific squared which is this   absurdly large number well you get that table and 
they've all been checked and double checked for   errors and mistakes so our job is to make sure 
people know what to divide by i just finished   dividing by do squared which is the largest 
number that we have i completed it and i give   it to checkin and all i know at this point is it 
was legible so it's been accepted the error rate   in the first days was higher than we expected and 
so we have put some stuff in place to catch more   errors we are we're handing more sheets out at 
once so we're originally going to hand out three   copies of a sheet and if two of them come back 
correct we then check them more thoroughly   we're often getting three come back incorrect so 
for the critical pass we're now doing five copies   at once so rather than three come back then you 
wait we send the another out and wait again for   that to come back we're doing all of it at once 
and hoping that that means we only after a single   time by the double time for those computations 
but for this to work the arctan calculation   needed to be split into tiny chunks which could 
be done individually one at a time by a swarm of   different humans here's how we actually calculated 
the arctan in practice we did it in chunks of 20   digits at a time so first of all we calculate the 
zeroth digit to the 20th digit then we do 20 to 40   40 to 60 and so on down the main one divided by 
x whatever x is for that arctan spine we divide   all of those by x^2 to get the equivalent set of 
digits for 1x cubed 1 x 5 and so on the issue is   once you've done one chunk of digits whatever the 
remainder is has to feed into the next chunk of   digits so each sheet of working out is waiting 
for the sheet above it to be finished and the   sheet before it to be finished to visualize the 
step we can turn this wonderful 2d grid into a 3d   arrangement where now every single chunk has to be 
divided by the corresponding odd number to get us   our actual series for the arctan and like before 
each of these requires the appropriate spine chunk   to be done before it can be done dividing by the 
odd number and there's a carry value which rolls   from each chunk to the next chunk after it in 
the series this ridiculous plan devised by matt,   katie, scroggs and the rest of the pi-by-hand 
council meant that there were thousands of pieces   of paper that both depended on and fed into other 
bits of paper in an attempt to make tracking the   pages easier each sheet was colour coded pink and 
green for positive and negative spine terms and   yellow and blue for positive and negative odds 
terms surely that would help keep mistakes at all right day three i feel like we are still 
making a lot of mistakes i i think we're still   over half the sheets of a mistake somewhere on 
them which is fine we have systems in place but   i think we've caught all the errors we it's now 
definitely got a lot more complex we've had a lot   of logistical challenges today where we've had 
to invent new tasks recruit people to do various   checks we've had to buy a lot of clipboards 
this it turns out moving 10,000 pieces of paper   around a room that all rely on one or two other 
specific bits of paper and have to feed into one   or two others is a logistical nightmares but i'm 
pretty sure we' found all the ones we lost all   recreated them we've audited all the gaps my 
job now is just to finish this long division   very carefully the slogan we've got now is 
we want long division not wrong division so ah   when a complete sheet was given to the check-in 
desk they would do some initial checks to make   sure it had been filled in correctly and then 
pass it on to the next stage the verification   station would wait for two duplicates of the same 
calculation to be handed to them and see if they   match if there was a match they would pass the 
paper on if the incoming answers conflicted more   copies of the same calculation will be sent out 
to be done again until two results were the same   next the mod squad would perform mod arithmetic 
checks on every calculation these calculations are   not able to produce the full answer but they 
can verify the answer matches the inputs mod   9 10 and 11 now convinced the answer is probably 
correct the team moves the pages on to processing   and staging where the sheets sit waiting for any 
other outstanding calculations needed before they   can progress once all the dependent calculations 
are in a complete pack of previous results and new   blank sheets are given to the human photocopier 
who copy the required info onto the new sheets   which are then given to the handout tables and 
the cycle continues so behind us we have a table   the verification station right they are getting 
uh calculations from two independent people and   if they match which we hope they do they come 
to us and we're checking to see if they match   by a fluke or if it actually correct so we're 
doing a little mathematical check of casting   out nines which is what we used to do years ago 
and if it passes our check then we can say yes   this is actually mathematically true and not just 
randomly happen stance happens to be equal to each   other unfortunately everything coming to us is 
passing our checks here are casting out n9 check   except for very dramatic moments yesterday yeah 
absolutely so we had a super dramatic moment where   we checked the nines cast out the nines it's all 
good checked the 10 cast out 10 it's all good and   then they had els and we checked it we checked it 
again and we checked it again and we realized that   there was definitely an error and this was quite 
early in the calculation so what happened is   two people had made exactly the same mathematical 
arithmetic error that our casting 11s checked   otherwise it would have all been passed into 
the sums and everything would have gone very   good yeah everything from that point on would 
have been wrong the next three and a half days   and most of the stuff we're getting is passing 
which is a lely sanity check because without   this we wouldn't know that things are actually 
working so we are we can tell you things are   actually working and and dramatically cut out a 
mistake that's it it was very exciting my five all around the record i think is something that 
we've all kind of got in mind as it would be   nice to be able to break that record and 
i guess comparing it to what shanks did was   literally just sit on his own and work on it and 
that's fine if you've got you know 30 years   but given that we've got a week we kind of need to 
compress that into a much smaller time scale which   is going to mean a lot more people are involved 
it's a lot more i think it sort of scales badly   right so the more people you have involved the 
more time you need to spend briefing them the   more logistics you need around all of that so 
scaling up doesn't necessarily just mean you know   this much time times this many people or whatever 
um but i think from what we did last time we've   kind of figured out maybe how to scale it up 
and we did all of the maths on like how many   more sheets of paper we need how many terms are 
we going to need depending on which formula we   use you know how is that going to change but 
even then there's going to be things that you   don't anticipate so like delays in terms of 
you get little backlogs you get little kind of   bottlenecks where one particular calculation 
gets done by a few people and they come back   and they don't match so you have to resend them 
out or you have to do again we have to find where   the error is that then slows down not just that 
one but all the ones after that so that kind of   thing makes it take longer than you're expecting 
it to right you can sit at home and do some long   division but you can't calculate pi on your own 
um and i think the fact that people will come   here to to get involved is partly because they 
want to you know contribute to that and also to   be able to say actually that was me i was part 
of that thing and i guess wherever we get to   we've all done something we'd never otherwise 
have normally done and it's a fun time it's a   good excuse to come and also the these people 
are great like we we've met so many new like all   the volunteers new friends new cool max people 
that we didn't know before and i think that's   really nice also in the room was the current world 
record holder for computing pi by any means emma   i happen to work for a cloud service provider and 
i had access to you know re computing resources i   could use and my team was celebrating pi day every 
year so when we were planning for 2019 pi day i   realized maybe we have enough computing resources 
to break the world record i see these are these   are two separate categories and humans like human 
processors and as a software engineer or someone   in computer science i see this whole process as 
someone said microarchitecture but yeah it's it's   a processor like par process processing system 
so you have a large number of computers and   human calculators doing the long divisions 
and then we have so in in the actual computer   you have when you look at the cpu you have actual 
processing unit in a tiny portion of the overall   processor and then the rest is keep to keep these 
processes pet so you break down the instructions   reorder them and then re retire so take so and 
dispatch them out of order and then reorder them   so everything is in in in package process and i 
find this process really like similar and to that   that analogy and i enjoy kind of watching this 
kind of mechanism and system processing running smoothly day four and things are only getting 
more complicated the collapsing station has   now kicked into action they are taking the 
final results coming in for each arctan and   start adding up all of the terms together 
it's slow methodical work meanwhile at the   far end of the room a new department has sprung 
into existence the central intelligence archive   originally envisioned as a cardboard box where 
used papers could be dumped the archive now had   a full staff of people maintaining a highly 
organized record of the calculation thus far   and running extensive double checks and audits 
on the pages they have also trained up several   progress enforcement officers one for each arctan 
who roam the hall with clipboards making sure all   the pieces of paper are accounted for and are 
moving through the system but despite all this   admin the papers are not moving fast enough 
day four and we're excited that we got to 60   digits which is i mean good 60 very far very 
carefully calculated digits but it's not it's   not 600 is it for the record so we've got 
a a room full of 200 people working very hard   to maybe get to 100 by the end of day four so 
uh yeah i mean i've just got to keep dividing with ever increasing complexity and still a high   error rate matt realizes the world 
record has slipped out of his grasp matthew why aren't you doing your long division 
shanks is it you well yeah yes even though there   are no confirmed pictures of me i think we can 
probably agree this is bang all the money yeah   no good point look i can i call you william 
will billy billy no mr shanks is fine okay   mr shanks emphasis on the mister mr shanks i 
cannot believe having been through all this   that by yourself you were able to do 700 7 digits 
with a single mistake well i've had years decades   toiling away on my own and i'm better at maths 
than you okay valid point but but i've got you   know over a 100 people most of which are better 
at maths than me and we i don't know we're doing   this for a week and we are going to struggle to 
get to 100 in my day i had to work alone it took   me years by myself and when i was finished and 
dead no one even checked for over 70 years but   you look at your vast group you put a call 
out on this youtube and hundreds of nerds   descended from around the globe and sometimes 
the real irrationality is the friends you made   along the way that's that's transcendental of 
you is everyone having fun and a good time you   know i think everyone is well then w dividing 
hard enough and you get back to work yes sir   that's mr sir mr shanks sir goodbye and get 
back to work matt did he divided harder and   more carefully than ever before doing his part 
as a tiny cog in a massive calculation machine day five and no one seems to be giving the record 
a second thought the room full of 200 number fans   continued working away way as fast but as 
carefully as they could everyone now fully   in the swing of doing something which hasn't 
been attempted for over a century everyone   was curious to know just how far through 
the digits of pi they would be able to reach i think a lot of us there's a lot of people 
here who have done maths in the past and kind   of just missed doing the simple stuff say simple 
long dividing by 150 billion is an exactly simple   it's it's just a nice to reminds yourself 
of i guess where your roots are in a way   yes we've only got a couple hours left before 
um we're done on kind of the last day tomorrow   we have to do the final calculation and we've 
realized we're not going to get past 140 and   what's amazing is everyone's having a great time 
and working together and and no one's sad that   we're not i mean obviously it would be great 
to have gotten more digit but everyone is so   excited the prospect of 140 just just like that's 
a thing we might be able to achieve is great and   we're over a 100 digits we're confident about 
and i mean there's 200 people 200 people who   are despite everything that's happened to us 
are dividing but they're not divided with one   day remaining it became very clear that if the 
team wanted to hit the next digit milestone they   would need to try something different so the 
core team planned out the hail mary protocol the new plan was simple the human machine which 
had evolved over the week would continue as is   for all sheets up to digit 120 anything above 140 
was cancelled no so the check is still happening   but the check is happening concurrently to 
the next division happening so that we can   hopefully go faster try and get down these last 
returns we get yeah we kick off the next division   before we've checked the previous one as long 
as we know we got two copies that are the same   that's a kind of facing lev check we start 
the next one and then the more thorough check   happens sort of in parallel with that so we end 
up if there is an error we can kind of chase it   back and go stop come back do that one again 
but it means that we can just jump straight to   the next one so we've been able to do the 
remaining trunks for the whole of the next i   guess set of digits in the space of 3 hours so 
it's been fast it's been faster than yesterday   but we also have made no progress for the next 20 
there's no point now starting the next 20 because   they are there's even more things to do on those 
because it's long more yeah i think we're sort   of secretly in our heads wondering if this is 
actually a better method to use for next time   or what the problems with it are and we're 
sort of i guess we'll we'll continue thinking   about that until we try this again if we try 
this again when we try this again when we try   this again the final steps were adjudicated by 
ardent tau fan and someone who would find it   very funny if matt's calculation had a mistake 
steve mould if there's any uncertainty about   how how legit this calculation has been we 
have an independent observer who's just here   to check everything as we're wrapping up from 
the right place yeah and and i haven't seen any   calculators come out it's all been above what 
everything seems to have been done by hand i've   checked some of the numbers as well you know i 
love half to day i don't know why we do it   on the half but that's just you've got you' 
got a special word for it haven't you i follow   steve around to make sure you doesn't try and 
multiply anything by two when i'm not looking the collapsing station is carefully summing 
up all the final positive and negative terms   into two grand totals these are dutifully copied 
out onto two large pieces of paper for the final   grand subtraction digit by digit matt subtracts 
one number from the other with hundreds of eyes   watching out for even the smallest mistake number 
now all that is left to do is to verify the final   answer and see how many digits of pi are correct 
if they get fewer than the previous attempts 11   digits this is going to be really embarrassing 
you got pi got pi so we're going to do it like   we did before i'm going to read it out katie's 
going to say yes or yep or or uh-huh and sophie's   doing the over the shoulder checking i think 
i will i just point i'll just point and when   when we get to the bit that's wrong i'll 
draw a sad face job done okay to be clear   sophie's also going to check that we don't walk 
backwards into anything oh that's true that's a   very important to us halfway we'll swap and i'll 
go back and you can be you can be okay three yeah so it's on a different line that's a 
good point that's a good point the three   is like yeah yeah yeah i like no 
i was expecting one no three point   one yep four yep one yep five yep nine 
yep two yep six yep five yep three yep   five yep eight yep nine yep i don't think 
anyone is surprised so far seven yep nine   yep three yep two yep three yep eight yep 
four yep six yep we're ahead of last time okay how can such a chaotic flurry of calculations 
give such a predictable result like maths ah two   yep six yep four yep 3 yep three yep 8 yep three 
yep 2 yep 7 yep 9 yep 5 yep zero yes two yep eight   eight yep eight yep four yep one yep 9 yep s yep 
one yep genuinely surprised okay that's that's   four if you want to swing around over there try 
not to say numbers that's really confusing i just   instinctively said eight yeah it's fine mix it 
up "do a scroggs" as we call i'm i'm not going   to say any numbers that's not it's not happening 
okay now we've just read 971 yes okay six yes nine   yep three yep nine yep nine yep three yep seven 
yep five yep one yep zero yes five yep 8 yep two   yep yep zero yep 9 yep 7 yep four yep n9 yep four 
yep four y 5 yep 9 yep 2 yep 3 yep zer yep 7 yep 8   yep 1 yep six yep four yep zero yep 6 yep 2 yep 
8 yep six yes two yep zer yes8 yep n yep nine y yes okay okay okay [music] okay i've got to stop sounding so 
surprised every digits i feel like   i'm going to get increasingly surprised at 
some point instead of yes i'll just say some what eight yes six yep two yep 8 yep zero yep 3 
yep 4 yep 8 yep 2 yep 5 yep 3 yep four yep two yep   one yep one yep seven yes zero yep six yep seven 
yep 9 yep 8 yep 2 yep 1 yep 4 yep eight yep z yep   8 yep 6 yep 5 yep 1 yep 3 yep 2 yep awfully 
drawn eight yeah it's all right on here okay   just when i think my respect for shanks couldn't 
get any higher two yes three yes zero yep what yep did you say zero and i heard no i said 
yes oh said yes you said zero i think i'm i   think i'm just slipping into a dreamlike trance 
yeah it's good that we got the three tiredest   people in the room this is really good so just to 
recap we just had 230 yes now we are coming up at   120 digits so we are we are safely into the 
hundreds we'll see how far we can get now so   let's get to 120 we just said 23 0 it then goes 
six yes six yes four yep seven y okay okay okay final i mean what's nice bit of a miracle i me what's nice is we were if there 
was a mistake like we were so confident we   check so much i don't know how we'd reverse 
like it i was it be some systematic or you   know phantom error but we're okay now now we 
hit the uncertain zone we're semi-confident   with the first 15 so let's check those 
zero yes nine yep three yep 8 yep four   yep four yep 6 yep zero yep 9 yep five yep 
five yep zero yep five yep eight yep two yes we can't applaud every digit so join us we need   moral support yes i i will 
fall over it's not a race okay i'm they can't see them i'm blocking 
them okay here we go we just did 582 yeah   then there's another two yes three 
yes [music] yeah one y [applause] no [applause] okay okay i mean this 
is a lucky dip seven [applause] yes six no that's it that's pretty [music] [applause] [music] good i'm i'm as surprised as anyone that's phenomenal 
that's it huge thanks to the pi day organizing   committee of alex, ayliean, ben, christian, 
deanna, james, katie, max, nicole, scroggs, and   sophie who've been working on this for the past 2 
years and thanks to all the volunteers who stepped   up and did all sorts of phenomenal work above and 
beyond the call of duty that made this possible   more names than i can possibly possibly think 
they're all scrolling by here and if you want   to be involved in something like or maybe this in 
the future there's a link in the description below   you can sign up and i'll let you know when i'm 
next planning something this ridiculous and this   was funded by my kickstarter funders who funded my 
humble pi standup special filming i said i'd use   the surplus funding on something else and that's 
what paid for this ridiculous pi day calculation   if you want to help fund other videos and projects 
uh of course you go to my patreon get involved the   more support i get the more ridiculous maths 
occurs in the world thank you so much everyone   i'm feeling great we got so many digits i i really 
can't believe that i was really fun and now i got   to go back and finish my phd i took a week off 
for this i came here for for pie and all i got   was sandwiches yeah it was like comicon just for 
mathematicians pretty emotional feels like the   end of a pretty incredible couple of days 
pretty sad it's over but i think we did a pretty   good job great i really enjoyed the bit with the 
mats i should probably get some sunlight and some sleep i'm looking forward to calculating 
more things i had such a good week i was here   since wednesday and honestly everyone here 
is absolutely lovely and we we calculated   a number i think the mathematical community 
will be shaken by our new discovery that pi   just ends abruptly at 139 digits this has 
been some of the most incredible few days   of my life to be surrounded by so many people 
all passionate about the same thing has been   an incredible experience say what you want 
but that surprise ending came out of nowhere   incredible results i can i literally cannot 
believe it this was very worth the trip yeah   well i mean after at all you know matt was 
going on about how once the only remainder   that he has left is the good memories we'll do 
it again but i can't help but think if that's   the remainder where's the quotient yeah well 
i mean i don't like giving things a scale from   0 to five but i give this one probably a a 
3.1415 honestly it just felt kind of nerdy
