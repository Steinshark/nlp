hi i gave a lightning talk at cppcon as you can see and i quickly thought i record a longer version which is not timed out at five minutes for you to talk a bit about the last year was meeting c plus plus online so that's what the talk is about you know the lightning talk so yeah so online events have become popular last year somehow you know and also in easy plus plus so i started experimenting with the new online format and what you can do with the user group and i decided that i would like to start a user group which by definition only meets online okay i wanted to embrace this and i'm happy that i did it's a big success this is a user group which will always only meet online and this is what this talk is about so i also saw this as an experimental space because online settings is different than when you're on site and also was on site for a long time i have preferred to you know not only do talks but also to experiment with other formats so i started experimenting with fares and this started with raimo this is a picture of ramo i have now a different image for the user group but for a long time this has been the main image of the user group which showed raimo which was the platform which hosted the most of the meetings of meeting zippers plus online and last year's meetings plus conference and basically those tables were meant to have conversations at the breaks and i thought what if there could be a format which puts those tables as a feature and uses them for a meeting and makes that the main point of the meeting that you can jump from table to table and have a conversation about various things or other topics and so one of the first things that came to my mind was that a job fair would be great and this is the second job fair but the first in drop job fair in this year which had to attend to 10 companies and this was a great success the job fair now happens once a quarter and the last one was in september and here's some statistics on it we had 82 submissions from all over the world yes india is a bit strong in the submissions as always i have a lot of reach in india and there's a lot of folks which take the online space for finding jobs very serious and so they come to that event and they also submission submit over my online platform and in total it's 26 countries and then there are the chosen zebras plus skills which is the options in this field so you can see that super sports 11 is very popular and there's other things like zebra 17 14 which are also popular with most folks and qt and boost even mfc is still there conan is there and i have on my blog a bit more about the data from the last job fair by the way this is just a short for the lightning talk i cannot go to too much into it so the next job fair is on the 16th and 17th november and i'm still looking for employers that want to join that so if you have open positions and you still want to find and interview people in this year that is your one really really great opportunity to to get folks to you know come to your table talk with you get an impression and if you sponsor the event you get also access to all the other folks which could not make it to the event okay but there's more i did run the user group and was you know thinking the fair format has such a potential that you should not only use it for the subset of the community which is looking for jobs i thought maybe it's also good to have people meet and debate tooling in cbs bus to to watch demos to have the tooling companies which are believing and you know using online platforms for interaction with the community which not all of them do and so this is the last tool fair i do want to mention that sonar source came to the first two tool fairs but they did not have time to come to the last one in october they will be present as a sponsor at the conference and well that's the next slide so compiler explorer i want to thank matt goldport for being there all the three tool fairs which we had and he's also going to be on the next one in at the conference also thanks for tipy build who was the only two companies sponsoring the last one with the table and also thank you for piano and also thank you to strobodan dimitrovic i also added the for the last two fair books to the well to to to the possibility to to to come and the book authors written to the book authors and gianna and slogodan reacted and they came to present their books and it was a very nice evening which we will have again but it will not be an evening i'm organizing a book and tool fair for the conference and if you have a a tool if you have a book you should the register for the for the for the book section and c plus plus and meeting c questions and then there is a form for adding that to the through to the book and true fair but here again yeah that's that was it over the last days also that again matt got bored has signed up so compiler explorer will be at the conference during two days from 16 20 to close to six o'clock we will host on next week wednesday and thursday this book and tool fair at the conference which i'm really looking forward to and a few words on the platform which we're using now i had to buy a license for this year for the conference and this is a yearly license so i by by definition made it that this license must be able to run everything from the user group to the conference and that's what i'm doing with this now here you can see a screenshot of the launch which is the feature which we are using for the affairs and then that is the screenshot of the of the next meeting with lazy holman and her cppcon talk and there you can see how you know talks look and are just you know counting down to when they happen when you start into the event and that's the whole year now and we're gonna spend the next year on hubilo and from what i can say for today is that i do like ubilo a lot and i think that it's gonna be a great year and so my last words i have to you is well maybe you know join us with meetup.mecv.com you will get directly to the user group but also we'll use this url to forward you to the meetings during the meeting when we have a meeting and with that thank you for listening i hope to see you at meeting supervisors online
