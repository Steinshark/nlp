so hello everybody i am delighted to be here with aiden hart aidan hart is an iconographer he is a writer and for me it's very personal because he's also let's say someone who came before me as an icon carver someone someone who represented icon carving to an orthodox world that that had forgotten a little bit about that tradition and so earlier very early in my own career i reached out to aiden you know for advice and for criticism he was always very gracious to give it but beyond that he has written several books on iconography i would say the the bible of iconography and and he's also written about theory he's done so many things and so i'm very delighted and grateful to have him with me today [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [music] aden thank you for coming to talk to us thank you jonathan thank you for the honor of finally having time with you i guess i've known you so well through our correspondence here face to face virtually virtually exactly actually yeah several years ago i had the hope of you know going to england and studying with you and doing all that things but you know then then reality of being with the family and trying to set up a carving practice hits you very hard but maybe tell people a little bit about your your story because you are in a way a precursor to many of us being some you know one of after uspensky and that kind of very first seed of iconography you were one of the first people to plunge in completely into the world of icons of sacred art and representing it to the world so i want people to know a little bit about how you came to where you are thank you i did my degree in english literature and also mathematics i've always loved the arts and the sciences and this actually played out quite well later on when i became an iconographer and then i changed the teacher and left that quite quickly to follow my my heart feeling be a sculptor so i was in a heineken church so i was aware of the role of art in general that in my sculpting i was searching for ways of showing the inner as well as the outer eyes we're interested in bringing together the spiritual and the material and i was looking for art that would help me do this and i came to some conclusions how to unite the two and then a friend of mine in new zealand i was raised in new zealand i just visited two orthodox monks in new zealand one of whom was an iconographer so i went and visited these monks and immediately i saw the icon i realized that the icon i've been doing for two thousand years almost what i had been trying to do in my own little sculpting work and plus a lot more of course and then i was really drawn to the monastic life and realized that behind the whole icon culture was a way of seeing a way of seeing the world where you seeing god so to cut a long story short i became orthodox and ended up coming to england i was born in england though raised in new zealand so it wasn't a problem settling here and because i had been a sculptor before i became orthodox and actually started carving and then my parish priest suggested i also start to learn to paint icons and it all grew from there really i was able to to go full time pretty soon which allowed me to dedicate my whole life to iconography which to me is a form of prayer as well it's not just being an artist it's i've always been interested in mission as well about knowing god as well as i can but also communicating that to others and i noticed through the icon all sorts of doors open like i've given talks at the british library and places like that where you could never be asked to talk about christ but you couldn't talk about icons apart from talking about christ in the secular setups everything just fell into place very nicely all these different parts i mean that had been a little bit separate orders naturally found together and you also at the beginning of of your work you also spent several years on marathons living as a monk for several years maybe tell us a bit about how that fit into your work as well that's right i was very i'd always been attracted to the monastic life even before i became orthodox and my original original intention was to join the monks in new zealand as an office but while i was overseas they suggested i traveled overseas of it before returning to them things changed for them they had to move into the city to look after parish so i stayed in england and there was a nun in the parish i was in and so a lot of monastic services and i really wanted to join a monastery in the english-speaking world but at that stage the door wasn't open at saints of phony's monastery so i thought well poppy athos is the only place i went to greece to study modern greek first bishop callisto's my spiritual father suggested that i studied the language first so i was taking one step at a time and really intended to go to athos slightly with the sadden heart because i really wanted to be in the english-speaking world so after studying for a year i went to run back to england to arrange my affairs and ended up staying with father barnabas the welsh monk and joined timberson office and so i was him with that three years and then i think he found it hard to have people with them he wanted people but being old and that he found it hard so the bishop said well it seems you've got to move on from there and land was bought in news in england for me to be a hermit but it was at that point my archbishop sent me to mount athos for training not to stay there but for training before settling as a hermit here so i say about i don't know just over a year and a half with my beloved abbott there father vasilius of him of entry and i've been came back and lived as a hermit for about six years but every year went back for about a month to verdon monastery which was my monastery at athos so for six years i would say living as a hermit but in fact as i say jokingly to people if you want to live a quiet life don't be a hermit people find out about lisa herman on the hill let's go and visit him so it's a pretty tiring and social life sometimes one of the things you right sorry no i because i was i was trying to think about some of the things you talked about in terms of wanting to be in the english-speaking world and i think this is something with really which really characterizes your work as an iconographer is a desire to both meld into the universal tradition you could say the universal imagery of iconography but also try to adapt it to transform it or to connect it let's say to the place where you are let's say the english-speaking world its own tradition and try to connect it i think that's one of the most important aspects of your work and maybe tell people a little bit why you think that's important to do yes thank you it's true right from the beginning i thought well christ was incarnate on earth and not just kindness in the world in general but the whole christian life i think is extension of an incarnation so yeah i'm british i'm not from from greece you know greece has in many ways retain that icon tradition but i feel my job as a christian is not just to introduce byzantine into britain but to resurrect the the icon traditional britain so i think it's both theological but also pastoral i think if people think that orthodoxy is an exotic import from greece then it's not really reflecting life with christ accurately you know life is with christ me aid in heart as a as a personal as a personal experience and i'm i'm british i'm not i'm not greek so i think it's theologically it's really important and also historically it's always happened that the icon tradition has gradually expressed itself in a unique way it always struck me how russian russian churches initially were quite byzantine they had a rounded dome but then gradually they developed the onion dome partially perhaps practical reasons to shed the snow but partially they felt that that expressed their experience of god more accurately than around the dome they extended the drum they did all sorts of things it's identifiably orthodox but it's russian you wouldn't get that and by stand him so fortunately in britain we have a long tradition of of of early sacred art that is in the orthodox sort of ethos the romanesque in particular to my mind so quite often if it's appropriate i i've drawn on that so for example the church where my parishes it's a 7th century 8th century foundation the church itself is about 13th 14th century so when i fresco the east wall i drew heavily on some illuminated manuscripts from what's called the berry saint evan gospel it wasn't hopefully pastiche wasn't just a straight copy but it was clearly influenced by that so when people visit it they realize actually this church is orthodox but it's also british you know the iconography reflects that and what is your approach because i think this is my one of my big concerns is to create something which is both traditional completely traditional completely soaking in the language that has been given to us but also like you said not a pastiche or not something which is a nostalgic piece of art and it's it seems difficult to find the line between the two but i'm wondering if if what is the approach that you have to be able to create something which is both traditional and authentic at the same time i think it's an enormous challenge in in some ways we can say that the icon tradition has revived after a time of decadency for like both in greece and byzantium but i think we're still incredibly immature as a sort of a orthodox iconographic culture that we don't really understand the timeless principles well enough to do this well i think people like yourself and the orthodox arts journal are exactly on the right track and that we know what you're trying to do but i think it's take a few decades for us to really understand those timeless principles so as you say we're living within the tradition we're locked in your pastiche we're doing some something that's authentic but to do that we need to not only just know in our hedge those timeless principles and therefore what can be changed adapted but we've got to be in it so i think i feel myself i'm still learning a second language you know it's not my first language so though i'm i'm happy with some of the things i've done i'm so aware that i'm i'm speaking a second language so i think the first thing this is to be intelligent you know not not to be scared not to think oh yeah i've got a copy something from moscow 15th century iconography if i do anything else i might get all decadent yeah for the rest of my life i'll copy these i made them harder and do my own thing you know that's the other extreme but both extremes i think are extremes so i think it needs a lot of intelligence to sort of think well you know actually what is essential and and what can i draw from my own culture that is usable i was talking to one of my students yesterday who's not from norway my husband's an orthodox priest and hannah was thinking of doing a doctorate on how to develop say an icon screen appropriate for norway drawn on the norwegian folk tradition of amazing folk patterns they paint on the wooden churches and i've got the stave churches the state church as a stand probably doesn't express the orthodox liturgy well enough but one can start with that and then adapt it so i think the more more people thinking like this they'll be fully in the tradition but love the culture feel that a lot needs to be redeemed and completed and and show that you know christ is in china now in norway or brisbane or canadore in the u.s yeah and i think this is what you said is is very important because there's a we have a tendency to have a kind of duality which is on the one hand we we we find people who are really attached to their culture almost in like in a nationalistic sense and they feel like this is the the thing they need to grab onto in order to to survive you know in this this chaotic world so we have this extreme and then the other extreme we find are people who want to deny all particularities and and see it as suspicious you know see it as idolatrous and everything and it it seems like this breathing in and breathing out let's say between how god is the source of our identity but that we have to be careful not to be attached to these secondary identities but see them through the lands of christ let's say and that's when they actually take their their full color that's when their their true colors appear and their true value appears is when they're submitted to something higher submitted to something which is beyond it and i know you've had some insights into that let's say in terms of in terms of of iconography and so as i'm sorry i'm a bit selfish because i'm asking this in a way that just for me you know there is a temptation also this is a temptation that i have i don't know if it's a temptation or if it's a if it's an appropriate desire because we live in a world where we have all these images we can we can go online we can find images from you know the catacombs to russia to greece and everything it's difficult not to have this mosaic in the back of our minds you know as as we as we work and so and for myself also living in america where we have this strange collage of culture so i'm french right my first language is french but i live in canada and you know i live in america with all this english-speaking world and so there's also in me at least there's a desire to create something which is synthetic is the only way to say it which is particular but also draws not only from let's say i would draw from the french romanesque or from but also kind of pulling in little threads from from the scandinavian world you know from even from coptic icons and pulling them together to create something which is moving towards synthesis so i don't know if there's something of that that you find that if you find it's a dangerous way of working or if you think that it has some value that's a really good really important point you're making jonathan because as with most things a strength is a potential weakness but the fact is we do live in a world where all these different icon styles traditions are available and even impinge themselves on us whether or not we like exposed to all these things so it's a fact we can't pretend that it's not a fact so i think we've got to be real and think well this is going to affect us and that's a good thing so the next question is how to make it authentic you know how to have it become within a living experience from within a living experience rather than just just being gluing together arbitrarily how to do that i really think ultimately it's only living the life of christ and the church so you've got that sort of music we have that music of heaven in us and it's only while we're making all these millions of decisions when you're carving something painting something designing it if you little choice we make it's got to consciously or unconsciously be decided against that music within us that that that experience of the life of christ and if it jars with that enemies you think no i'll leave that to say but if it corresponds with that then we can use that element of norway or egypt whatever i don't think there's any formula we we can use and i think it's just living that life in the in the community of the church living a life of prayer because in the end literal arts got to support worship and awe and thankfulness and joy and humility and compunction and as we experience that ourselves we'll make the wrong decisions so i think i think in summary we do live in this post-modern age we exposed all these things and i think it's only natural whether or not we do it consciously unconsciously that what we make is going to be affected by that but we've got to measure it against that experience of prayer does it support it does it support the right virtues or does it make us noisy inside and confuse us and so i mean that brings me also to another thing that i've at least experienced in myself as i'm working because there is also a desire to be you know let's say how how can i say this there's a desire to impress in the sense that we want like i want to make the best image possible and i'm always on a line between you know making something which is amazing so that i can impress others and then saying to myself that i'm doing it for the glory of god but it's not always true right it's like sometimes i just i just know that if i do it this way it's going to it's going to be it's going to be impressive and so for me at least you know in in light of what you said i think i struggle with that quite a bit as well trying to to find the balance between being technically proficient and having something which kind of embodies this music or this kind of living music that you that you talk about yes and this is one thing that father vasilius the albert of aviron taught me he had this lovely term there's a perfect imperfection and that imperfect perfection so and there was a wonderful exhibition of byzantine icons that came to the world academy in england a while back and in the very last room there are quite a few icons from sinai festival icons i remember in particular from about the 12th century what struck me was how free and messy they were and at the same time incredibly beautiful and you get the impression that the person who painted just like a prophet and the word of god was in the soul and burning in the soul and you just had to get it out he wasn't too bothered about you know putting every two now then and that was done with great skill it's exported skill but they weren't bothered about the little details the buildings were a bit wonky but you felt the spirit come through whereas i've seen a lot of icons that are made with consummate skill but somehow the skill encrusted the spirit it didn't embellish the spirit so you notice the skill first and not and not the spirit so i'm really interested in the approach of the japanese traditional chinese painters and i've done a few articles on elements of the philosophy of the painting especially from a book called the mustard seed garden book of painting and one thing they say there is a different stages first is to gain great skill consummates and the top though is to discard skill and just express the the the lie that the inner essence of things of course the skill comes through but it's like your first language so you don't have to think about grammar because it's part of you so i think a lot of us i mean a lot of people around who don't even have the skills they're just really badly painted icons then you get the next level highly skilled but you're weighed down by that skill the highest level like theopharm the greek is frescoes there's here's a prophet speaking the word of the lord burns out it's a burning bush you're looking at not a not a topiary bush bushel nice equipped so it's that fire we're trying to communicate yeah yeah and you you see i think you know i there are some artists right now like that seem to have kind of this internal i'm thinking about cordless of course but cordis who has internalized the language so much you know that like you said it's not he's he's not in the second language anymore it's not something he's learning he it's become his own inner grammar and so when he's working there's there's both kind of this deep tradition of the church and there's also an idiosyncratic aspect to it which is just him just doing it and when you watch him draw something and he just goes right in and there's no sketch and there's no measuring and it just goes straight there is something about this chinese approach where you know once the skill has been mastered and centered then there's almost a letting loose or yeah there's a capacity to just do without thinking without planning and you almost it's almost suddenly there's something theological about this idea too that that the idea of will or freedom we tend to think of it as deliberating but if you're truly in this music you know truly in this kind of this this song that you have inside of you there's no deliberation there's just action there's just just you know the a straightforward manifestation let's say of these higher things i think there is that but at the same time there must always be sobriety and you must be listening more than speaking artistically because i've had the blessing of knowing some saints saint pious amid father for furious a bit same silhouette same and i noticed they wouldn't always answer immediately you felt that there were tons of things they couldn't say all of it should be true technically but they would listen and then speak and it was just precise it was just just the right thing that was said so i think you can get highly expressive by callographers but to me it's too expressive okay it's a story about some some highly educated people looking at a painting in the wall i think it was an icon but i don't know what i thought it was but they were just saying how live it was and how wonderful it was then a peasant lady was overhearing us and she said i couldn't help overhearing your conversation and may i say something see of course you know she said i don't think this is a good icon because it's too alive it's just too noisy it's too much full of itself it's like a charismatic person that swamps everyone else and you think oh i'm a charismatic person but it's just that person no one else is in the room so that was interesting it wasn't that quietness so i think that's amazing that theopharm the greek you know he could be highly expressive in his frescoes but then you look at his panel paintings and he's really quite gentle and quite highly worked there and he knows how to be appropriate in each situation so i think it's it's really it's sometimes difficult to get the balance but yeah this is explicitness but this could be quietness as well yeah so you're not aware of oh that artist is so free you know you're not talking about the art rather than the saints you know i want people to forget my icons but if you're talking about the same type of victim you know that's the important thing that's when you know it's working no i totally agree my i had the chance of having my first experience at as a commission you know i my bishop asked me to make a panagia for him and that was the first time i was getting a commission i had no idea how to make miniatures i had no you know i was just just thrown into this and so i found someone a serbian carver that i had exchanged with and he guided me through making this this little thing and i was so obsessed with the technical part of it trying to get it right trying to you know to have it you know and he he was serbian this this iconographer george belak so he was ruthless with me he was just ruthless he was he kept insulting me as i was making the icon it was wonderful and so i you know i worked on this i made this thing and i brought it to to my bishop and all i was thinking about was if i had done it properly and i he he he took it he unwrapped the little icon and when he saw it he crossed himself and he bowed and then i was just i was floored and i realized okay this has very little to do with me like you know i am a vehicle for something much bigger and that's when it that's when i knew i wanted to be an iconographer because i thought you know picasso will sell his work for millions and millions of dollars but no one will kiss his icons no one will kiss his paintings no one will venerate them and the only thing i have to give up is the credit for that to happen and i was like okay i'm willing to do that and just be hopefully be as much as i can a vehicle for for the saints that are that are being represented but yeah yeah that was that was my first experience as a commission yeah and so i wanted to to to shift a little bit and talk a bit about culture because many of the people watching this are people who are just interested in culture where it's going one of the things that we have in common and that i've seen in your writing and in your work is a desire to not want to completely oppose the world of sacred art and the world of secularity of secular culture but rather see them as let's say say the sacred as the source of the secular and the sacred as something which can feed into other arts and and become you know like a light for for for culture and maybe i know people would love to hear you talk about that a little bit okay yes yes it's interesting when i was a sculptor in new zealand before i became orthodox i was looking for art that helped express this sense of otherness i mean i just wanted people not to see a face that's interested in faces primarily but i said we're the spirit behind the face and vancouver funny enough was always into quite sort of naturalistic sculpture vancouver really seemed to be very profound and i realized gradually that behind the incredibly refined word was actually the orthodox solicitor he was actually a charger in in the in the orthodox choir he's romanian and sort of rose out of the romanian culture and then you look at his endless columns all these things were actually rooted in in liturgical culture the indus column was inspired by indus columns which were over gravestones so in memory of people that was like the soul ascended to heaven and the other thing that got me on this track was the vision of ezekiel where he has a vision of a temple and an angel is showing him around and then from underneath the altar the temple runs a river and wherever the river goes it brings life so i thought well the worship of the church the the whole liturgical symphony if you like is the source and then it's not a fountain that goes up in the church and comes down again it's a river that flows out into the world and whether it goes in his life i thought well if a culture is falling apart it's because his worship is blocked you know there's no river flowing out and so going back to vancouver a lot of his aphorisms are to do with this he said my studio in paris is just an extension of the monastery and he names the monastery of his village in romania he talks about simplicity of complexity resolved all these wonderful pearls of wisdom sort of come out of that whole orthodox culture so i think with a lot of scholars beginning to realize that early 20th century modernism abstractionism actually had a religious inspiration and you look at kandinsky again actually he was russian a lot of his insiders from orthodoxy for him abstraction wasn't to depart from reality we need to think of abstraction as departure from reality from it was to distort the essence to abstract to draw out the essence of something and depict it visually and this is just what an icon does you know you're indicating the fire of god within and then of course vancouver was the father of a modern abstract art convinced you the father of modern abstract painting and these came out of religious roots then all that was forgotten and i'll be to sort of play around with this abstraction they'd actually forget what they're trying to do whether one likes their art that's what they're trying to do to abstract and reveal the invisible so i think deterred to call out and unfortunately now a lot of zealot orthodoxy sort of write off in the other art but i think healthy art in the world that isn't liturgical but feeds the soul like doskieski's writing i think of his son this category i've dubbed this threshold out it can help to bring us to the threshold of the church in fact the man who baptized me father ambrose in new zealand he came to christ through doskiewski he was studying russian literature so he sort of wasn't ready to go into the church in the fullness but he touched the hymn of christ's government by reading dostoevsky and then went further and then looked up and there was crying looking at him and so how i'm curious to see because i think a lot of people will see that in principle let's say we'll see that in principle and so are there ways that you're seeing this happen today are there some places or some areas some art or some literature that you feel that you're or ways in which iconographers are able to maybe help or feed into this because i know a lot of people have that desire and we see it like dostoyevsky is of course an example but very few of us are dostoevsky sadly you know do you see places in the world where this connection can happen of course the question i don't know about places but it's more international communities like i think orthodox arts journal is really important because it's trying to work toward a fresh authentic understanding of tradition but it's not exclusive in the sense that it has this sort of openness to liturgical art being eleven to inspire healthy secular art in the positive sense of the word what i might call gallery art or threshold art so i think not so much places it's it's sort of places of culture of thinking of a way of thinking in the individuals who can be inspiring there's a thing called the orthodox arts festival which just went online briefly and so they've got a category for iconography a category for also just writing you know so i think there are some writers there doing short stories so i think there are online experimental bodies as it were for people to try things out and get honest feedback from other people and it's all false outstanding has been you know there's some openness for genuine professional caring response to people so you can iron sharp and zion as it were i i've always had this long-term dream of of a liturgical art center where you're training people in the church of a lot but also we have conferences and meetings for those who feel perhaps they're not called to be literal artists but you know perhaps they're composers like john tavin i knew you said john taverner very well he wasn't really good at liturgical music on the whole sometimes he got it right but his role was actually to be in the world and as it would be like a horse of troy sort of smuggle the sacred and the profound into the world so that's been my sort of dream i don't think it happened in my own lifetime i've worked with prince charles of it and trying to have something happen and my my literature to go out three-year part-time course as part of that but i just love to have a sense of it it's that buzz where people can come and share ideas but like the french cafe was during the 20th century where they discuss ideas but essential where there is a church where there are different serious liturgical training programs apprenticeships but also we we have artists who are not as orthodox but christians who feel that their role is in the world i think this i think this idea has been buzzing around now for 10 years you know and and i think that it's slowly starting to show fruits you know in in the us andrew gould is also working on something similar the antiochians here have this these ideas and so i think we just need to be patient and slowly work towards something like that happening you know people have also talked about here we know people talk a lot about terence malik as a place also where this type of there's with his recent movie a hidden life where you really get this this desire to create i don't know to visually show in a movie a a christian experience you know so i think i think that there are definitely places where where this is happening now i guess i'm gonna turn the tables a little bit and ask you there's also a very experimental iconography going on right now and so on the one hand we have this sense that that liturgical art and the power of of our traditions can infuse popular culture but there's also the the things happening both ways and so i obviously i don't want to name iconographers this is it's important to i want to avoid polemics but do you i've seen a lot of icons that present themselves of icons but go very far in integrating either modernist or even postmodern aesthetics you know effect i would call it something like that and so do you feel like sometimes that can also go too far or do you see it as a sometimes i see it as a laboratory like this this is bubbling on the edges and it's not going to continue it's just going to be idiosyncratic but a little bit of it will enter into a tradition and follow the kind of enter into the stream but i don't know if you have some perceptions about that type of work happening yeah it's a very important point to raise it jonathan i think the two sides to it i think there needs to be a certain freedom and fearlessness and experimenting it means what spirit that experimenting has done you know is it to show off my ego or am i genuinely trying to make literal art iconography composing whatever it is that helps people get closer to christ but because i wanted to be authentic you know i've got to try some different things so that's fine that's fine i think life in christ shouldn't be dominated by fear and you throw these things out there and if they're not quite right they'll just buy a natural death i think there is a part for certain a place of certain experimentation on the other hand i think you get to certain point we experimenting with things that you're playing with fire you know experiment as an artist that don't put it in front of people saying no you try to pray with us you know so i think i think some iconography there i just think it's just too it's great i appreciate it as art but don't pretend it's an icon i think it's just going a bit too far so i think on the one hand you're people who say iconography is not art i think it is art it's much more than that but it's at least out in other words it should have a beauty or harmony but then some of this contemporary economics i think is just getting a bit too arty and lovely as art you can't it can't be taken a case-by-case basis i think and so one of one of the things that i think is happening and this is difficult because you know we have we have a sense the modern man has has a feeling you could call it you know the the shock of the new or the the effect of novelty and that the effect of novelty has a surprising element like when you see it it surprises you and it creates a certain a certain sense that a certain sense of wonder you could call it and to be fair to it and so i think that what i'm seeing at a lot of the a lot of the more experimental iconography there's a danger to confuse let's say this deeper this deeper encounter that you talked about the stillness of encounter with the icon to confuse the experience of shock of the new and this kind of surprise because it's there's an elation in that surprise and it makes you want to even on the in the online word world especially because you want to get attention and so you people will share an image of an icon which is slightly askew because it'll be able to gather get people's attention quickly as they're scrolling down their facebook feed and so i to me i see that there is a little bit of a danger to confuse the the the experience of novelty with the deeper you know encounter with the sacred the sacred i don't know what you think of that i think if we look at nature things adapt by very slow increments you know if if environment changes you'll find that nature begins to adapt slowly bit by bit yeah there's a mutation most mutations i i'm not useful but the odd one is useful they really do get something you know there's a bird suddenly grow four wings so i think in our time we need to move toward a more more authentic western iconography by small increments that's how i approach it you know i'm not a particularly great painter myself i've got to move very slowly and gradually gradually i adapt there are some people far better than i you can can can can move more quickly but it's just my insufficiency but i disagree with really small increments and and i think you know some of the works as you suggest are just a bit bit too shocking really they're just jumping too far ahead of themselves as well but on the other hand i think just to do mindless copying it might be safer but i think it's a bit dangerous because basically we're saying life with christ is well it's like the the man who buried his talent he buried was he was afraid exactly risk you know they they invested their two talents five talents they took a risk it might have failed but they thought well you know this my master trusts me with this money so he must believe in me so i'm going to take a risk and invest it and hopefully it will increase and it did but the one who only had one he was afraid and he buried it and he was told off so i think just mindless copying is actually acting out of fear and it's it's fascinating because the we talked about the world of technology as creating this mosaic of of images you know and this this constant novelty and this constant change that that it's difficult for not to attract us but the same technology is what is making it possible for people to just slavishly copy you know 16th century russian art because we have these high resolution pictures that people can have in front of them as they're working you know the ancient medieval artists couldn't couldn't stand there in front of these amazing images and just copy them you know to the letter they had to to draw them from afar and then bring them into the studio and you know and so this was that would create a just a natural transformation without it without a desire to be in to create innovation it would just happen on its own because you can't completely remember the thing you saw in the cathedral right yeah exactly yeah but to internalize it they saw it for half an hour then three months later that he get back home and they're painted so they'd have to internalize that image and of course that would mean that they were translating and i've done some translating from greek into english and it's quite a creative act you know you're translating a content rather than a word and so one of the things that you've also been known for i think that you know we we talk about you as an iconographer as an icon cover but you your your work spans much more than that you you've designed churches you design liturgical objects you're really more a liturgical designer and so i'd like to know a little bit about how you see this coming together because there's something there's something different about let's say designing a reliquary or designing a a church and the icon itself and so maybe you can speak a little bit to how this these different languages come together in in the experience of orthodoxy in like as a european like as an english person you know to to be able to create these these spaces that are you know you've created iconostasis with icons on them and i've seen you done everything from a bishop staff to to you know to reliquaries how do you decide or how do you kind of pull in your different influences when you are creating things i suppose i start with place first you know where's this place i've done work for a church in madrid and another in amsterdam so for example the stone icon screen i made the church of saint nicholas and amsterdam there are lots of different cultures there so in the the roughly one meter by one meter three foot by three foot stone plaques and then with the icons i made designs that reflected the different cultures there against anglo-saxon there was something more from the netherlands something that was russian something was greek so i start with the actual place i think place is important you know the gods and kind of in that place and and the fire of of of the burning bush is in that particular bush you know it's it's it it wasn't a bush bought in from england that was that moses saw it was a it was an egyptian bush that was burning so i researched the the art of that culture suppose this is where discernment is quite required you know what what is usable in that culture what isn't a slight deviation but it does express what i'm saying that said nicolas of japan to my mind is the great one of the great missionaries because for seven years he just studied japanese culture you know and he really gained got a respect for it so after about seven years he began to speak to people about the faith and then when japanese converted they realized that they're actually converting to christ not to being a russian he was able to embed the faith in japan so but all that required quite a bit of research and an appreciation of the japanese culture so that's the first thing research really and secondly this object it might be relictly whatever's i realize it can be part of a larger symphony and it's got to work with that symphony and i think this is why i got involved in so many different media that i feel i'm here to serve the church serve christ and the worship and that requires a certain unity of worship and i think we suffer too much from yeah this iconographer then put an icon painting in the ward and you get a another person from another place to do the icon screen it doesn't fit but you know he he's remaining sort of romanian one or whatever he's drinks he'll do a greek screen so get this completely credible mishmash and this upsets me you know i feel there's no just aesthetically you know no attempt to make the uniform a beautiful thing that dances together you know everyone's just jamming doing your own thing it's cacophony so i think it's out of that that has felt compelled to try to you know respond to the need and get involved in different media i'm actually going to be working on a novel sin partially out of the desire to create a church i probably would never be able to design and and make a whole church so in this novel it's all about this process of this man who's [music] who whose uncle is according to the reading of his will and the uncle was a very wealthy man and he made a vow to god to build a church but he got cancer and he knows he's not gonna have time to build it so in his world he says to his his nephew i'm giving all my wealth to you as long as you build a church this church for this monastery and then you can have the rest of the money and the whole novel goes on about the process of him and other people changing in the process of not just building a building but decorating it inside so yeah i suppose the basis of it is that you're not just creating an individual art object but you're creating a symphony and that symphony is an improvisation in the sense that god just doesn't drop from him and a complete score and jordan was just a player he he sets a sort of theme and you improvise on that so yeah you're going to improvise in canada in a different way this from the same sort of not tuned but the same theme that christ has given to us both yeah there's definitely i love the images you use i think that really theme and variation is exactly the way to to to see it you know and that there is this there has always been because we we're so polar in the way we think you know we we tend to think of tradition as something which is completely solid and completely fixed and then we have the idea of the modern world which is idiosyncratic and improvisational but when you look at like you said the great iconographers you see this strange play between the messiness and you know and a desire to be in tune with the the inner music let's say or the hidden music one of the biggest difficulties i think one of the biggest questions this is a very practical question but it it's not it does there's also something theological in the question let's say is that many of us like let's say example of the parish where i am you know the parish where we are we are renting from a catholic church and so we have this space which is a 1960s catholic church you can imagine you know what that means and we we're taking over from a romanian church that was there before and you know for all my love of them and respect of them they put up an iconostasis which is as if like an extraterrestrial ship had come down you know it's baroque you know it's highly ornamented and it's spray-painted and it has you know all of that and so what is your advice to people who are in spaces which are not liturgically conducive in the outset how can you what kind of advice you have for people who are in spaces that are ugly or that are look like strip malls or you know how is it that you can without like i said without creating this strange disjunct you know how can we adapt our our work to to these kinds of spaces sorry for the hard question oh yeah i think this place is going to be taken in the same mirrors and sometimes it's damaged limitations of this probably more from the not as damaged limitation it's probably impossible to make something really beautiful but i think the first principle is be appropriate to space you know don't force it to be something that it isn't it's one parish i know where they they bought a methodist church which is just a rectangle really no i think they should have treated that a bit like a basilica you know but what they did was they created inside a four column dome church at a plasterboard you know and once you're if you're blindfolded and walk in i thought it's really nice you go outside well that's rather weird so i think that that was being dishonest to what was there it would have been better to think okay this is like a basilica basically a rectangle let's work with that you know so i think authenticity so if it is just a 1960s white wall geometrical thing or circle whatever it is then well let's make the best of that there's a limitation but let's make the limitation our strength i think that's surprising to listen i think often we don't listen enough to the space you know we just jump in and do what we saw down in greece romania so i think listen a lot if you just worship in a place look at it and think okay well you know what can this split place teach me you know what are strengths it's weaknesses how can i capitalize not just be one strength how can i capitalize on that beyond that i think that's all i can say at the moment yeah it's gotta take each place as it goes sometimes you can put it in reverse and take things out that can be a pastoral challenge because we've always had that and you know joe blogs gave it to us and has been insulting to take it out so that's a job of the priest ready to really gradually educate the feast the icon skin i made for amsterdam the priest was brilliant there he i think a lot of the russians were expecting a high russian screen so about the year before we we did the work he had in the back a whole and head talks and all that about the history of the icon screen and you had this display in the back with photographs so gradually people realized actually the russian icon screen with five stories was actually quite a late thing so in fact you know having this one layered screen is actually quite traditional so there's often a lot of education that is needed patient education into history more often than not not just theology but history you know how's the church from the past dealt with us so education and humility and listening i think are things that can all help yeah yeah well thank you because i think this is at least in america it's definitely a struggle that many parishes have because you know we end up in these very odd spaces and the temptation to create you know for example like you said to have a flat ceiling but then put a sticker of of christ pantocrator you know and on the ceiling even sometimes it's even a low it's not very high you know it's not that high it's like 12 feet high but there's this there's this you know instead of really kind of but it's hard because the space is ugly so when you say listen it's difficult we don't want to you know because we we actually don't have a lot of love for the space but i seen what you're saying really even in a way maybe the way to approach popular culture in general or or modern culture which is that in order this is something that that i think that in order for something to exist there has to be at least some seed there has to be there has to be some seed which is making it exist and so if we're patient and attentive and we we watch we can find these little these little these little sparks let's say sometimes they're very small and sometimes they're very hard to find but they they kind of have to be there or else yeah or else we we wouldn't even be able to perceive it you know but i think sometimes we've got to acknowledge that one generation is not beyond salvation but you're not going to find much good on that so you've got to think ahead what about the next generation so what i'm talking about future purpose-built orthodox architecture and at the moment most of the orthodox churches i've seen in america just don't work you know they put our orthodox students got to do they put a dome on they've got archers instead of archers but we don't understand at all what we're doing acoustically for example i when i was doing work in houston texas i was talking to a priest there about domes and he said not one purpose-built orthodox church ever been through in this country which has good acoustics you know and you see we don't know out of our hubris we haven't really studied byzantine churches properly and but i did read a very good article by an orthodox man who's acoustic engineer for nasa he knows his stuff and this article was outlining some principles of acoustics and often they're surprising you know right angles is not a good thing flat floors isn't a good thing i think one of the reasons why we're finding it difficult to make successful contemporary architecture is the materials we use unfortunately concrete is here to stay but with stone you've got to have a notch if you want to have you know a roof that's out of stone you could have an arch so all these shapes arose out of the weakness of the materials and they're natural and they work well the concrete doesn't necessarily need an art sometimes you do but something we've got this material reinforced culture that's really strong it doesn't have many limitations but we pretend that it's something that it doesn't so i think we need to think ahead and figure out well what are the principles of good orthodox architecture so what can be changed what makes makes most old orthodox architecture work consistently so we need to be thinking one or two generations of here do you really get serious about this you know orthodox church is an orthodoxy so it's got a dream on top and i think we really need to look into this and do some serious thinking and yeah we've got a lot even in terms of culture i think what you're saying is true that is there's you know i there's something this is i get this is one of the reasons why we started the orthodox arts journal at the outset is that we realize that it was the seminarians that we had to talk to in a way that that we wanted to create something a vehicle of to show them to show beauty to show adaptation to show all these things and our target was not so much the older priest would thank thank god if they if they can hear it but it was really to affect the seminarians so that you know ten and we're seeing it now you know andrew gould if ten years ago you know was within the balance of his work he was struggling to get liturgical commissions now he he gets them there he has to refuse them you know and so you can see that the transformation is slowly happening of course it's not it's not complete there's still a lot of work to do but we can see the the fruits of the seeds that we planted and that you planted you know you know 10 years ago 15 years ago are starting to to appear in the culture and so i think there's a lot to be grateful for that yes i was approached by the chancellor of chichester cathedral a major cathedral in the south of england to help them start at a surgical arts center so i said that's fine i myself can't do a lot with the practical training of the technical artist wasn't just icons the whole thing but my two apprentices they can go down and be the core of the practical training but i said i don't want us just to look at training the legitimacy but i want to look at training future priests well ideally also contemporary priests but most of them already set in their ways because the commissioners need to be educated i see it as much as the makers of the typical art because hey a lot of them don't realize the importance of putting her to go out they think they do to go out of just getting a painter to paint something that's of a sacred subject but it's it's how it's done which has fixed the soul as much as what is done like you can't you know sing the psalms to rock music and liturgy it might be great rock music but it doesn't help prayer same words but have the same words to byzantine and gregorian chant have a different effect on the soul so you've got to train the commissioners which is basically the priests and i think they've got to go hand in hand i'm just astounded that orthodox priests and anglican and catholic have all told me the same thing that their seminarian training doesn't have any compulsory training in in liturgical art or literal beauty i thought you know what converted russia you know that's right exactly first of all to orthodoxy it's normally some aspect of the beauty of it that's the fragrance then they find where does this fragrance come from but the thing that stimulates in longing is beauty but you've got nothing there in the liturgical in in the seminarian training i think something's wrong here so this needs to be facing every theological academy to have a compulsory at least one day you know after three years one day please where you give them a taste of the importance of literal art i think that's i think that's so true and there is a these there's here in america we're kind of seeing a little bit i don't know how it's integrated into the semi the seminars but we're seeing you know saying vladimir is developing this this arts kind of art center that i mean it's not it's not a practical it's more theoretical but that's okay because they're priests you know a and you can see it at centicons as well they want to have a kind of art center so i think it's ver it's coming it's burgeoning but we yeah we definitely need to encourage it and to all you i know a lot of seminarians will be watching this you know you need to put pressure on your own seminaries as well you know to make sure that you're able to to get a and like aiden said the you know i'm seeing it the people that are attracted to orthodoxy through the things that i'm saying it really is the beauty which is attracting them you know the beauty you know of the scriptures the beauty of how this integrates into liturgical life you know these these powerful patterns that show us that the world is meaningful that the world is is actually leading us towards god if we are capable of engaging with it and paying attention to it in the proper manner and so so you know i think you're completely right i when i was in my hermitage at priest i came with his parishioners to talk about things and i didn't deliberately said something i knew that which would shock the priest and i said to the the parishioners look and they're all converts forget about orthodoxy it's life with christ you know orthodox is just a name orthodox and all that i mean i know orthodoxy is is the fullness of the truth but it's the thing is that you're a human being before god forget all the oxys and the isms and beauty this is thinking of beauty it doesn't have an ism or an optism it's the beauty affects your soul profoundly i remember when i was doing up the hermitage it was run down this 20 acres of property and had to do a lot of work on it and i converted half the barn into a chapel and frescoed it and made a wooden mosaic floor and and such like anyway there's still work to be done and the i'd get 10 tons of gravel delivered or sand and there's one day this big truck comes up and it's a really wild place it's up in the hills this big muscly man with tattoos all over delivers the truck and he delivers the sand and he said what are you doing here i said i'm making him hermited i said i'll show you the chapel and this guy sort of walks into the chapel and he just stood there it didn't say anything i saw he began to cry you know just began to weave and i didn't say anything you know he wasn't a religious man i think but it just just touched him just beauty touched him so it's just one person he didn't know about orthodoxy anything it didn't matter you know he met god in that place so i think we just have to go back to the basics you know it's all to do with life as a human being on this earth and god's wonderful creation loving god and beauty is the fragrance that comes out of that loving one another and loving christ well aidan i think that's a really wonderful place to to to finish our conversation thank you so much for the encouragement and for your wisdom and also thank you for your work you know i know how much influence you have and you know you you remain you remain humble and and discreet but i know that so many iconographers have been influenced by you and not just that but just as a person you know for me as well i want to thank you for the the advice you gave me at the outset you know when i started and just knowing that you were there i could always send you things when i was when i was struggling with some images i've always sent you you know some some carvings to get your opinion and and even sometimes you've been harsh on me with some you might not remember but there's sometimes when you said you know stop doing it this way and i was like well you know i think he's right and so i've actually changed the way that i carved because of your advice and so thank you for thank you for also talking to the people for i'm happy that people are able to discover you a little more everybody that's watching this please go online you will find several books by ayden you if you go on amazon you will you will discover his writing his work on the orthodox art journal there's several articles by him and also you'll see some of his projects so aidan thank you for your time and and for being here with me thank you so much it's been a joy to talk with you
