[music] our bezel is future has finally arrived kinda sorta hey what's up guys i'm cabby hd here and remember that vevo apex concept phone we saw a couple of weeks ago at that trade show it was a concept phone meaning it's never gonna go on sale they only made a couple it's more like a working prototype but it was a vision or this idea of technologies that could come to eventually be more affordable but sure enough a couple weeks later vivo said wait hold that thought we're actually gonna make a real phone that we're going to go on sale with that's just almost there almost there it has a lot of the same technologies from that concept phone that's gonna be brought down into something that we can actually sell so that's how we got this vivo nex or any ex i'd consider this the closest thing we have to an actual bezels phone right now so just opening up the box and looking at it for the first time it is pretty striking this is that nationalists phone people have been clamoring for and honestly the phone i've been wanting the future to bring since we started getting notches in the first place this one happens to be a six point six inch 1080p super amoled display and it's a little taller than sixteen by nine it's 19.3 by nine has these well rounded corners that we're seeing in every phone now and with these super thin bezels you end up with a ninety one point two four percent screen to body ratio so cracking that holy grail ninety percent number highest i've seen in a real phone here and i think it's pretty sick it does have the looks it's not perfect but the top bezel is tiny the side bezels are about the same as what we see in a lot of other phones now and then a little bit more of a chin than the concept phone you get about a five millimeter chin at the bottom looks pretty similar to what we have in like a one plus six maybe even a little bit smaller than that but i have no problems holding it even though it's a huge display my hand doesn't really touch the edges but if it does the accidental touch rejection is on point this is truly the most screen we have in any phone but that actually brings us to the question what about all the stuff that's normally on the front of the phone what about the front facing sensors what about the stuff that's normally in the knotch where that i'll go and that's where you get those apex concept phone technologies trickling down in this one already so number one is that fingerprint sensor and this is the under glass fingerprint reader that i've tested to the max in a previous video same deal here no fingerprint reader anywhere else on this phone is just under the glass at the front with all the pros and cons that come with that in 2018 so you know a little slower a little more finicky but definitely cleverly hidden for this concept and then number two the front-facing camera where is that this one is actually hidden just like the apex concept phone it's in this mechanically retracting chassis that slides up and down whenever it's needed and makes this noise in the process now that might seem a little cheesy but you can actually choose between three artificial noises you can pick your favorite or you can just leave it silent so that that that's the front-facing camera that's what happens every time you want to take a selfie every time snapchat opens every time you want to do an instagram live all that the concern naturally with this is that it's a moving part phones normally don't have moving parts so normally completely solid-state for things like waterproofing and durability that kind of stuff here is probably a little bit questionable you know if you drop this while the camera is out does it just snap off you know something happens in your pocket it gets scratched what if the app freezes or the mechanism fails what if someone pushes back against it all that stuff of course has probably been tested by the evo but you never really know what might happen in real life and i got to be honest i wasn't even expecting the camera to be that great but it looks pretty good on the phone like it isn't a phone that's gonna be coming to the us as far as i can tell it's just china but there's a lot more to this phone than just the design and the rest is pretty solid too like you might remember when i first heard about this phone i tweeted like the rest of it could be trashed but the design is still really cool but this is this is a full flagship from vivo so this is getting the full treatment this is snapdragon 845 inside eight gigabytes of ram 256 gigs of storage and a four thousand milliamp hour battery it's like everything lenovo wanted to be seems like a pretty quality pair of dual cameras on the back it's 12 megapixel primary and 5 megapixels and they're in this super shiny rainbow reflective metallic type of material they actually named it they call it graphic diffraction dynamic color illusion technology it still has a headphone jack it is a dual sim card tray at the bottom as well it has this ai button vivo software is pretty specific like it's not my cup of tea it's not for this market obviously so a lot of stuff isn't even english here but overall like i said it's a real honest flagship and i'd love to see them actually try to make and sell a us version 100% but yeah let me know if this is this the future we asked for is this how bad we hate the notch that we're willing to go to mechanical moving parts to get rid of it hit me with those comments let me know what you think also definitely check out my two other videos that are pretty specific to this phone and possibly another one upcoming but i've done the english fingerprint reader tested to the max to the extreme i'll link that below that like button and there is also a video all about notches and how that technology is shifting towards this either way thanks for watching talk to guys the next one peace
