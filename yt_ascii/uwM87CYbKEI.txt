is emac harder than vim i would assume it's easy to type the word blimpy a common question i hear amongst the unwashed masses is look i don't even know what unwashed masses mean in this situation but it feels like such a great insult okay it feels so good it feels so good i'm not even sure what it means i'm happy about it i've never felt better ever how do i typ the word blimpy in em the answer may seem obvious to seasoned elis gurus and as always there's more than one way to skin a cat emac today i'm going to show you the simplest way to type blimpy in emac i don't know who this guy is i don't know what his problem is but i absolutely love this shall we go on we shall first we're going to go over to the blimpy package homepage and we're going to blindly copy paste and evaluate the first code block that we find okay like it okay i'm not exactly sure what that did but let's see it looks like we now have access to the blimpy type the word blimpy into emac command let's give that a shot okay so it's prompting me here it says typing the word limpy in emac may alter the current file are you sure you want to type the word blimpy in emac so we're to say yes here and we're going to hit enter and it's going to type the word limpy b oh oh that's right i have evil mode enabled let's see if the blimpy read me has some configuration tips for us let's see this reminds me of how people try to make vim solve every problem you don't need to solve every problem you know sometimes you can go to the terminal and just type an a command you know you you don't you don't have to solve every problem with your text editor okay yeah here jq exists the docks are so long oh here we go one size fits-all configuration going to blindly copy paste that and evaluate it okay you can just ignore these warnings they they never mean anything so goodbye and let's try that again blimpy type the word blimpy in emac going to confirm here and hey we've typed the word blimpy in emac i can already hear some of you out there saying hey i type blimpy all the time there's got to be a faster way i don't know what it is about this guy's voice but it reminds me of dunkey this is the dunkey this is literally the dunkey of programming and i was like nice try guy like this is this is dunkey this is dunkey and of course there is you can pass a double global prefix argument with control u control u to skip the prompt whoa look at that i can hear some of you still saying i don't know i have to type blimpy a lot in emac for that there's a special minor mode called blimpy mode which when enabled doesn't matter what you type it just enters the word blimpy over and over again blimpy blimpy blimpy and yet some of you still aren't satisfied right for those users there's the mx blimpy command which when executed blimpy blimpy blimpy blimpy blimpy blimpy blimp that ending was so so good i don't know who this guy this guy is legitimately this guy is legitimately the dunkey this guy's the dunkey i'm subscribing i'm subscribing to no wayman no way man he is the donkey of programming blimpy blimpy blimpy blimpy blimpy no way man dunkey of programming dude the man's programming hard i absolutely love that i love seeing anything that's the world's most useless creation useless creations make me so happy they just they just make me so happy and that one is clearly one of the most useless ones ever read the comments okay short and to the point shows a problem and and walks you through step-by-step solution what torial should be like absolutely we now have blimpy factory generator design patterns at work that's pretty good vim user i can't even comprehend blimpy level of power i i just i want to see one that says something that's like not like that's like serious about it like why would you make this using microsoft service through eax is peak capitalism oh this joke i miss what mean what does this even mean capitalism capitalism wow really 21st century stuff you got there as a ne viim user i find this tutorial pathetic now listen up you antiquated emac peasants because i'm going to learn you good first off new vim i don't need 35 plugins to sacrifice to the ganu gods to type blimpy n man i got that magic at my fingertips with minimal configuration it's so easy i don't even need a tutorial unlike some people by the time your emac even boots up i already typed the word blimpy wrote a python script to automate my blimpy type in even found time to pity the emac users of the world neovim is like the sports car of text editors while emac is well it's like a hse drawn carage historically but not exactly a speed demon it was a good try but neovim will always be a superior text editor for your blimpy needs and we're going to copy that we're going to go over to twitter and we're just going to paste it in and we're just going to post it not that any of it makes sense for anybody else but for me it makes sense and for me it's funny for no other reason than that the name is neo vib actually is superior it is the sports car so i hope you enjoy the carriage pick
