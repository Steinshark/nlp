so well we've just seen a fully populated data hall which we've reached capacity within and we never take you to what we call phase two dateable 3 which is the most recent capacity that we brought to the market really to facilitate the large demand that we're seeing from the researchers and the higher education institutions it's kind of after and before isn't it ok assuming we can get in so this building was built three years ago, and the building shell was built three years ago it was designed from the ground up as a data center most data centers are converted buildings of some description predominately where and distribution warehouses so a lot of thought went into just the simple building fabric to make it simpler more cost-effective and easier to operate in life support stories where the fire suppression system resides so there's an if there's a fire within the building the system in the each of the data pools can figure out exactly where that fire is and provide directly the fire suppression to it to make sure that we put the fire out this is very responsible so this is the second phase of capacity that we're bringing on live within the facility it delivers two thousand five hundred kilowatts of it load and what we've just shown you is a fully populated operational data hall with all the racks and the it infrastructure running in anger within it this is just about to have the first item of structure installed within it and that will be going live in the next six to eight weeks the space the power the connectivity yeah, yeah so we are simply the facilitator of the building the infrastructure that supports it all the resilience that they require to make sure they're comfortable they're there i t's housing the right place in the right location that it's always on and we are the kind of the base layer for the foundation if you like of the it stack in that regard so how many customers? in a date or this side we would look to get between 20 and 30 higher education research customers within this sort of space of capacity doing there'll be a loss of high-performance computing in here but we will see more and more standard applications and standard ic footprint coming within this space yeah, where email web access and the way we put that into context is you'll have a standard enterprise rack of computing wall really supported by four kilowatts of electricity a high performance computing rack could be supported by up to 30 kilowatts of electricity and that's the difference that's there they can be very different in the amount of variety hardware that's within it, and is the power of the supporter in the past these are institutions are trying to go and procure these services directly in the market themselves in effect what's happened is janeth genic straight jessica brought them together and consolidated their requirements and we treat them as a single customer even though there are many customers that sit underneath the jisc agenda framework and in doing so we can therefore offer a wholesale type price the pod that we were standing in previously would be costing them probably thirty thousand pounds a month or something like that depending upon the it load within it if you look at the analysis that jessica and jennifer done they reckon that they are the customers are saving up to two thirds of their cost from trying to provision it themselves put it in within their own campus estates or trying to go to market directly without having the framework around them so the cost is cost savings are significant so obviously we're all now no no he's not here. how long before this is a heathen web computing well the space we were just in we filled within eight months and at the beginning of the framework it's a wizard that the quietus piece of time period of time if you like so i will forecast this will be filled in the next six months and because of our confidence in that we've already started phase three which delivers a similar amount of capacity in space that's just behind you for your finger onto the finger vein reader it's part of the cloud we're not the cloud it's part of the cloud and what are we are we don't have an ambition to be a cloud provider our ambition is simply to enable the cloud
