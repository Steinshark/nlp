so now i want to show you another type of turtle program we can send to the to the plotter machine.
- (you're) (there, waiting for your next job)
- yeah, and we're going to continue with this idea of just giving it a list of angles to turn through. and i just need to find some source of angles, and i thought maybe let's look at the digits of numbers like pi and that kind of thing. here we have our original thing where we started exploring the euler spiral; like what if i just start sending the digits of pi? ...8,4,6. (wow you know that many off by heart?)
- i know more than that but- the next one's a 2. you always need to know one more. if i sent this this would just be like 3 radians, 1 radian and stuff it- i think what would make more sense would be to do- well what i've marked up on on this here, i've split this into ten directions. so if i do- for the first three if i do one two three, i could- that might make more sense. so i'll be turning three tenths of a full turn, and then i'll turn you know then i'll turn one tenth, then four tenths, one tenth, five, nine;
and then we'll see what- see what picture gets drawn. 
- (so does that mean 1 will be) (36 degrees?)
- yeah, yeah we're doing multiples of 36 degrees. so yeah let's put in that, 36 degrees. it would have been pointing this way and it turned back three tenths to go up this way. and then it here it turned just 36 degrees, the smallest amount it can turn, and so on. here when it got to 5 you'll notice that it just did a'0 degree turn because 5 tenths is a half. any time you see a 5 that means it goes back; so if i see two fives basically it doesn't do anything right? yeah so let's draw more. we're going to stick to base 10 to start with, and and then it will do this picture, it'll plot the turtle drawing for that number. so here we have pi in base 10, and let's do 3,000 steps of pi. 
i got this picture here, kind of like a fractal island or a sort of wild walk going around everywhere. let's do more digits, see what it looks like, so here's 10,000. our original picture, i think was up in this corner here, now it's branched off and gone over here. 20,000 100,000 so like here is some way of visualising the digits of pi; let's just sort of come out from playing around with turtle programs. (i've got so many questions coming to my) (mind like) (where will it ultimately go? will it ever) (come back to the start? will every) (possible shape be formed at some point?) (like, you know you know how they) (say the monkeys writing shakespeare?) (will you eventually draw the mona lisa) (just by luck?)
- right, yeah yeah. i have those same questions as well. one conjecture about pi is that it's normal, the digits of pi are normal, meaning that every possible sequence that you could think of: 0,1,2,3 up to 9 would be in the digits of pi. that- i guess that means if you had some shape that you could draw with 36 degrees turn you would expect that shape to eventually show up in this drawing. i guess you don't know exactly where in the paper it would be right? so i'm- so i i don't know if you would expect after drawing for infinitely long, would you just have like a black sheet of paper that's fully filled in with ink? (when you get a very long string of) (0s you'll get like really long) (straight lines?)
- long straight line yeah. another question i think is natural to ask is like, if i gave you this picture could you have worked out the digits of pi? right? or if i sent someone this as like a secret message or i broadcast this across the universe as like a sign that there's some intelligence on earth; would it be a good way to show like, hey we know about pi? let's do 3,000 so we get this kind of like dancing off away from the main kind of hub. this is pi base 10, almost 3,000 digits. base 10 is arbitrary right? so i mean you want to try a different base? got one in mind? (well let's go base 3.) 
- base 3 is cool. so let's let's change the base to 3 and let's boost up to 10,000 points. so one cool thing about base 3 is that our our turns are going to be 120 degrees, that means that we're going to be constrained to this triangular grid, triangles that tessellate the plane. whereas with base 10 we have this weird 36 degree angle, it's kind of like pentagons right? and pentagons don't tile the plane so yeah you can get a real mess. you're always going to have sort of collections of triangles if you use base 3. 
- (so will base 4) (give us squares?) yeah that's right! so now we've got squares. i like this as maybe if i needed to generate some kind of like roads for a zoomed out city in a video game or something, you might you know create a network like this.
- (they) (look like world maps to me)
- yeah some people say they're kind of like- like ways to generate an island. it looks like japan maybe. we're could do more uh- let's do 100,000 in base 4. so i'm- i chose pi because i want like an infinite list of turns that is just going to spew out the mona lisa at some point. a less interesting digit sequence would just be a rational number. so let's change pi to 1/7th. i like 1/7th because it's 0.142857 142857... if you do that enough you're just gonna end up back where you started in the same orientation and you're gonna create a rotationally symmetric picture like this. could make it like one over some bigger prime; like i guess 119 is a prime probably? then you get a like a a more detailed but still rotationally symmetric picture. it's kind of a nice way to see a stark difference between rational numbers and irrational numbers. do more irrational numbers, will we try e? so let's do e, base 10, 100,000. there you go, that's e. (what's going on here? that's a cool) (little place,) (there's a lagoon)
- yeah this seems like an unlikely configuration.
- (that) (looks like britain, up there)
- yeah yeah oh yeah! we're here right now.
- (yep) (scotland, yeah) i like golden ratio? so what? you got square root of 5 plus 1. in some sense the most irrational number. i don't know if it gives a sort of more squiggly map but it looks cool to me. (imagine if you just put some arbitrary) (number in one day, like randomly, and) (pressed it and your face appeared!)
- yeah! or conversely, could somebody send me the number that draws my face? this is the feynman point, so six 9s, 99999. so that won't be beaten- there is a string of seven 3s but that takes another seven hundred and ten thousand digits, so we'll be nearly three quarters of the way down the mile of pi before we find a longer string of the same digit and the first one is within the first two metres.
