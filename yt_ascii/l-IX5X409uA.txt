ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the chess world cup 2023 this is a knockout tournament being held in baku in azerbaijan massive names are playing magnus carlson hikarana kamura yanyuponushi fabiano caruana you name it and this is the round that we say goodbye some games were decided in less than 10 moves some games were nail biters thrillers back and forth action and half of the field has been eliminated once again after today the women's side is moving on to the quarterfinals eight players remaining and the open side is in the round of 16. and oh my goodness today's games were absolutely nuts sit back relax and enjoy your flight to baku i will be your captain here we go today normally i've been starting with magnus's matchup today magnus had a lot of games so don't run off anywhere okay a lot of you you watch the magnus game then you get out of here hikaru's match vs prague young 17' year old prodigy and then we're gonna take a look at how magnus fared so to break the tie in the world cup they play rapid they play 25 minute then they play 10 minute 5 minute and then they play armageddon hikaru sits down against prague and plays the move c4 so he plays the english once again it's been an all english matchup between the american and the indian player and this time we have a four knights and hikaru plays g3 last time that prague did this against hikaru hikaru played knight to d4 this was the game yesterday prague this time plays bishop before which is the most common move and hikaru plays knight to d5 now what black likes to do in this position is utilize the relief over here and play this move e4 and now what white does is move the knight to h4 and this looks really stupid but the night is going to return sometimes it even returns this way but frequently it will go to f5 and also you'll kick out this bishop and then you will fight for the center and you're never gonna lose the knight with g5 for two reasons number one you can always run away and number two once you move the bishop the g5 score is going to be covered castles hikaru plays the move bishop to g2 you may wonder why is hikaru not taking on before isn't that the entire idea yes but if white tries to do it this way then then black is going to get a very dominant center and then g5 might become a reality in the future after h6 is played so bishop to g2 and now we have d6 okay and at this point there is a spot where white can play knight takes or white can play a3 and after something like bishop to a5 white can play b4 and then and then white castles you also will notice that in this position that the move g5 now suddenly is a thing it traps the knight because the knight doesn't have any moves you can't go d3 that's why you have to start with a3 or knight takes before hikaru castles and prague plays g5 and it's not losing yet but hikaru's night is trapped and according to the computer the only way to deal with this is to go here to hit the pawn because if takes there's bishop g5 which is actually winning for white and after something like h6 white actually has to do this to threaten to remove the knight and after this bishop h6 knight d5 cd5 like apparently white is doing okay hikaru plays a3 and all of a sudden the move d4 is no longer as possible because there's simple and you're gonna see it in the game hikaru plays d3 there's just this there's this hikaru's knight is just trapped he's just losing a knight he's not getting that what you're supposed to get he's just down a piece just down a full night just a full night down after nine nine ten moves prague moves the rook out of danger takes with the queen and just prevents anything from going to the g5 square brings this knight to the center of the board prague can't believe it he's just up he's just up at night that's the danger sometimes of opening move orders like in these some of these sharp lines and now prague just holds everything together hikaru obviously trying to create some counter play given the fact that this bishop is not really participating hikaru rocks solid but brock just moves the king to f7 and hikaru lunges forward again but prague deals with it and the big trades pay karo's pieces hikaru lunges forward again but prague just defends himself and at some point he is going to bring all his pieces and there are no plot twists hikaru just resigns he he can't do anything he can give a check but then rook e7 or rookie seven production up a full night he's got this on the way there's no way to get to the king there's no way to get to the king because it's defended there's mate threatened once the pieces are removed hikaru just lost to prague basically in 10 moves because of one move order discrepancy his knight was trapped but in this position instead of a3 first he had to play d4 apparently that was the only way the engine was showing equality he mixes up a move order and he loses which means hikaru must win the next game with black he lost with white that is a massive disadvantage because here's the thing hikaru likes to play a certain system for the win and i mean just in general you you kind of have to play a kg style of chess you have to play a style of chess if you're trying to play for win where your opponent cannot trade all the pieces in chess with whites you you have many options to bail out most people don't because under normal circumstances you are trying to play for a win but prague just plays one of the most solid lines which is just not allowing your opponent to do anything he trades to remove the tension he castles takes the file right hikaru playing this in a very passive way he's playing this in a passive way so that prog has to play this for a win right hikaru's pieces kind of dancing on the edge trying to keep the tension prague trying to make hikaru create some weaknesses and all proc does is just take the center hikaru tries to kick him out but he's creating weaknesses in the process he's undeveloping his pieces but in the process queen c5 and hikaru's position is completely not defendable anymore ladies and gentlemen queen to c5 pawn to g4 that same night there's another knight trapped on the edge of the board at some point it's gonna have to come back to the center but while it comes back to the center the bishop is just falling knight takes d7 progress takes the bishop you can't even take back because rook d7 is going to win you the queen queen takes d7 rook takes d7 under normal circumstances this is two pieces but it's queen and bishop and i'm gonna take this hikaru plays a5 there are no more plot twists prague gives up the queen because he wins it back immediately and as daniel naritzki said during the commentary only a miracle of god can save white here us can save black excuse me and there are no miracles hikaru plays on just out of sportsmanship that's kind of what you do but prague solid prague clean the king is basically checkmated on h7 you would have to take and go to just a completely lost end game hikaru resigns and he is knocked out of the world cup by pragna nanda ramesh babu of india this is absolutely sensational proc to owes hikaru in the rapid but this the strangest part about the match was the first game was was over in a flash and and that is like chess is so brutal prague now joins three other indian players in the round of 16 gukesh and eric icy mated gukesh one in the playoffs today and vidit gujarati 25 of the round of 16 is indian in the open side that is insane four out of those 16 players are from india it's not i saw on twitter people were like well that technically doesn't mean it's a world cup that's this is just how our world cup works so somebody's fault that the the entire future generation of chess is indian every other country has to step up ridiculous stuff my friends this matchup was unbelievable magnus carlson versus vincent kaima was vincent winning game one in the classical then being winning in game two but losing in game two here is their first game of the 25 minute segment it is a queen's gambit declined magnus with the white pieces playing a slight sideline and then plays in this variation where he plays a very early age four and essentially the idea here is i'd like to create an attack but i will not mind if you play h5 because you will give me the g5 square forever and magnus plays this nice move king f1 this is clearly part of his preparation he doesn't castle keeping this idea in mind and also g3 and king g2 is just the way the king is going to get safe there it is right so this is the position and you'll notice that magnus has not spent any time whatsoever okay he's gonna try to put the hurt on vincent he is the reigning defending world rapid champion when it's 25 minutes or 15 minutes or 10 minutes he is the best player in the world and hikaru is second as far as i'm concerned rookie eight knight goes to g5 because you have been given the opportunity and now a3 and now black plays a5 stopping you but magnus was never interested in playing b4 magnus plays e4 alright he's trying to explode the center of the board vincent takes all right and a couple moves later we also get a trade like this and magnus is not better according to the computer but he's better from the human standpoint for a couple of reasons number one he is the only one applying pressure black has potential weaknesses weak file slightly better bishop you know that's not how a bishop moves and the reason number two he's also up 13 minutes on the clock in a rapid game that's really bad and the reason number three is always he is what we call magnus carlsen bonus none of us get to enjoy magnus carlson bonus because none of us are magnus carlsen right bishop f8 rookie eight and now we get this end game this end game is rook bishop and six versus rook bishop and six the difference is that one side plays white so that side gets the more useful open file first if black tries to also get the open file rook c7 is played and if rook takes b2 there is rook f7 but more likely magnus would have played b4 or b3 and the point is that if you try to do something like this i can play for example bishop e5 rook c7 rook c8 i can threaten mate it's actually a very unpleasant position and maybe magnus would try to win this end game where he would try to you know get in and win these pawns so bishop g7 and a couple moves later rook c5 take take take take now you will count the pawns you will realize it's equal it's not equal it's not equal because white has two outside passers versus one that's very hard to defend rook d2 rook b5 is game over because you will get a two on zero two on zero is just winning it's winning for what f6 rook b5 there it is there's the two on zero magnus is completely winning this is the best end game player in the world this is the best end game player of all time he's also up 17 minutes on the clock like just so you understand you get 25 minutes for the whole game his opponent has two remaining rook d1 can't have a rook trade king f3 king e2 kicks the rook plays a4 vincent takes rook a1 suddenly it's not so easy okay you gotta maybe bring the king up but vincent not going anywhere and all of a sudden 13 minutes versus 19 seconds on the clock magnus plays inaccurately apparently he should have been a bit patient it's not easy to find a way forward because you got to make sure everything's defended as you push it and also your king is going to get he goes here and suddenly vincent gets in and takes and oh my god vince run away 10 minutes versus 40 seconds vincent h3 vincent h2 magnus has to give up his rook to push his f pawn and this game ends in a draw because as vincent sacrifices this the king is left alone with the pawn and the king is going to eat the pawn because he's hungry and magnus was winning but he was unable to do it vincent bulletproof unbelievable magnus once again is going to have to try to bury this man but now vincent gets white this time we have a nimso indian ponzo f3 magnus plays knight c6 very kg approach e5 trying to fight for the dark squares in the center and you see this right white has this big boy center he's got the spaceship of pawns 92 knight g3 brings his bishop and now magnus plays h5 trying to instigate h4 but the knight goes forward we're gonna have a game where magnus has the horses and vincent has the has the bishops horses versus the knights queen d7 rook b1 long castles oh my goodness this is crazy magnus playing for a win with black opposite side castling winner takes all winner takes all in this game the winner moves on to the rounds of 16. loser goes home all right bishop to g5 magnus plays c5 the idea of c5 is to lock the center to try to make it a maneuvering game d5 the center is locked now rook h5 vincent defends but also he protect but he also attacked the center there we go take take queen e1 magnus plays e4 you can take my pawn but then i'm gonna pin you he takes the knight instead now in this position this man magnus carlson with his rook hanging the bishop hanging this bishop hanging plays the move rook to e8 bro what leaving both bishops to hang so now this but now discovered attack on the queen and now vincent has to mummify the bishop on g7 and his time is ticking we have a rook trade rookie 8 at some point magnus's knight is going to come alive it's just a matter of time vince it takes excuse me please rookie seven so now take take take take check block check king moves queen e4 my friends this is this is the magnus carlson special h3 knight c4 there he is he looks he looks beautiful queen e4 the night's coming in the night's been on a5 for a while this is a dangerous thing about these nimso pawn structures magnus plays f5 oh my goodness we have an end game and that's it there is no way vincent is gonna survive this because magnus is gonna get this and then he's gonna feast on all these pawns and bring this down there we go the best end game player of all time taking all the pawns the only thing he has to be careful about is this h pawn but for the second time in a row it is 12 minutes till 40 seconds on the clock it literally does not get any more lopsided than this vincent runs with the bishop the knight is coming for the pawn all vincent has going for him is the h pawn so he pushes it magnus takes his pawn magnus goes to stop that's it the game is over king g2 magnus wins the whole squad the horse has feasted the horse was hungry and here come the pawns you don't have time to guard this so the only thing that you can do is push these pawns and here they go b4 three squares away king comes back now magnus place a5 but apparently he had to play b3 force the king here and then play a5 because then if h6 king g6 there is nothing because you're just stopping the pawn and then you win you can't take this because i push but in the game magnus played the a pawn first and now after h6 king g6 the bishop can come back the difference in this line was that if the bishop tried to come back there is the otherworldly 93. which seals away the getaway square and after something like king c3 this is a fork that is unfindable in in this kind of a format this is the winning idea was to force the king here so that when the bishop came here you had a geometric night sacrifice what that's not findable so all of a sudden vincent kymer is back in the game again knight and three pawns and there they go king h7 but vincent is just pushing the king c5 a3 bishop c1 he's stopping the pawns he stopped vincent kymer has stopped the pawns and this game also ends in a draw which means the winner of this game this is now down to the 10 minute tie break format they started with a six hour chess game then they moved to a 25-minute chess game this is 10 minute chess this time that you cannot break the tie any any other way this is the only way that they were going to find a winner in this matchup winner takes all magnus plays e4 tensions are high we have another spanish a6 last time magnus played the move d3 he goes back to it again last time magnus played bishop to g5 remember that he played bishop to g5 and then he played he played a very early d4 remember bishop h4 and then he played a very early d4 this time magnus plays c3 so he plays it differently doesn't doesn't put his bishop on g5 doesn't do it castles vincent says you can't put your bishop on g5 rookie too a rookie one castles on the same side knight bd2 the knight rotates to f1 and the knight rotates to g3 and maybe we are going to put something on the f5 square maybe we're gonna play pawn to d4 maybe we will trade dark square bishops maybe we're gonna play a4 here we go c5 magnus chooses the a4 plan attacking on the queen side plays h3 h3 is a multi-faceted move covers things coming to g4 also maybe knight h2 knight g4 ideas in the future takes takes now we strike in the center again layers of different middle game plans here queen c7 keeping the tension and guarding everything in the center rookie 8 bringing the rook to the party but potentially destabilizing f7 and g6 a little bit queen d2 now vincent justifying his previous move c takes d4 and grabs the center pawn now the center explodes the rook comes in but the rook is a target for example queen to d3 if the rook comes back you win the knight of course there is this move but then queen g3 and if cb3 you have bishop h6 so dc5 magnus opens up the center of the board apparently here it would have been better to play bishop c2 according to the machine he opens it up then he does it this way vincent doesn't go back according to the computer here the the best movies to just give up the rook which is insane and essentially just line up and laser beam the bishops vincent moves his rook over here magnus plays bishop takes g6 the best move was apparently to take this first but magnus does it like this he takes takes and gives up the bishop bishop takes h6 four minutes on the clock if you take like this it's rookie a check it's king to f7 and it's the cool common collected doubling up if black plays something like bishop b7 trying to trade rookie eight and queen h7 or even knight g5 queen h7 might not even work because you can't take the queen and if you take the rook you lose your queen and you can't come back oh my goodness so it's not queen h7 it's what it's knight to g5 and that's the winning move king f6 rookie eight and and white is winning so you cannot take bishop to f5 vincent trying to defend himself bishop g5 queen d7 queen c3 time is ticking both sides magnus one minute that's it essentially a bullet game is deciding who is moving on you'll notice that magnus has squander disadvantage bishop f5 the best move was apparently queen d5 check and going for this oh not that not that not that bishop d2 because if rook b2 there was bishop by four what what happens on the rook moves knight g5 check what's what happens when the king moves rook a6 what well the bishop is trapped kind of sort of like you might get mated so magnus all of a sudden has lost his advantage and my friends this is essentially just a coin flip it's a coin flip both guys less than one minute on the clock magnus begins trying to speed up knight back to f3 you'll notice that he's playing every move quickly 44 seconds down to 29 seconds that's it equal position the winner of this game is moving on to the rounds of 16. rook cafe queen d60 hits the bishop vincent takes on f3 magnus captures centralizes the queen comes in bishop hits the pawns bishop defends the pawns king to g2 to make sure all the pawns are guarded queen comes back rook blocks queen e8 now we have rook f8 queen f8 no no bishop end game no bishop end game queen to d7 and for some reason vincent does not protect or counter attack he plays queen d7 but magnus takes and vincent does this but vintage is on two pawns for some reason here something spooked vincent and he didn't play a move like queen b3 which could have potentially led to winning the b2 pawn and said he does this and now it's just basically a matter of can magnus win this end game three pawns versus one on the king side and he's trying he gives checks and the only way he's going to catch vincent is to trade the queens king g2 h4 h5 taking squares away here we go queen g5 this is this this is magnesian school of chess right here he's got two past pawns but there should be a draw could it be a draw it should be winning it's got to be winning right should it be a draw could it be a draw i don't know he's gonna try to advance there it is there's the king oh that's it there's the king all the way to b5 and on move 68 of this game as vincent checked magnus magnus blocked and checked vincent securing a trade of queens it took six games but magnus carlsen is moving on to the round of 16. and don't go anywhere because i got one more game for i got a bonus game i got a bonus game for you this game was absolutely nuts and this was yanyupomishi versus nihal sarin and this was a this was a crazy crazy crazy game e4 c5 sicilian defense she played bishop b5 check knight c3 it'll be two minutes don't go what pay attention it's crazy knight c6 queen slides over knight jumps to the middle by the middle game over here nehal sarin had built up a very very powerful position he put his knight in the center he locked the queen side rotated his queen over and then he played f5 while nepo's queen was sleeping on the other side of the board nehal played bishop e5 and queen h4 and he had the cannons pointed at the white position this is a terrifying situation for yani bomshi to be in downplayed a g3 and nehal broke in he just broke in toward that king and then he broke open the center of the board nehal sarin on the verge of defeating checkmating if you will yanyupomnishi bishop c5 now all ignore resident takes the bishop on d3 the bishop goes to b6 oh my god nehal not moving nehal's not going here he gives up he gives up the rook because if this bishop f3 is a mate if you take on d3 check here check here check it's not me but i'm gonna win your queen bishop to e3 played by nepo rook f8 look at this position look at this position this is insanity the king runs here comes h5 in the middle of all of this nahal is now threatening four four moves he's gonna make a queen the pressure has to be overwhelming rook d3 queen g1 queen back to g5 pawn to h4 now how's knocking on the door he's got three more moves to make nepal defending himself seven minutes versus 30 seconds king to d2 rook in c queen on g3 nepo tries to create counter play now gives up the rook for two pieces and is completely winning minus 3.5 queenie one check the point that after the king moves can't go here because of this bishop to e4 and queen b1 is unstoppable and the point is for example if something like we need three this is simply mate this is simply made king c1 he has to find queen e1 and bishop e4 and perhaps maybe i don't know he saw something like this and and c6 we need to check king a3 and click this and the queen gets back in time because you threaten mate he misses it he misses a chance to eliminate nepo then he does it this way but now queen d6 and now he tries the same idea nepo misses queen d a check here playing this instead queen f7 but now unfortunately rook c4 and the queen guards the king and in an unbelievable turn of events how sauron could have eliminated the multiple time world chess championship challenger he could have been the fifth indian player out of 16 but tragically he loses he loses and nepo moves on to the round of 16. this round the women's world cup was actually relatively peaceful i the men were were just unbelievable they were they were doing some crazy stuff this round we will bring back some of the games on the women's bracket as well but it would have made for an hour video so that will be they will be back my friends the quarterfinal is as follows magnus carlson versus vasil ivanchuk that is a crazy matchup ivanchuk beat magnus in the candidates that magnus barely escaped from to challenge for the world championship wang hao versus gukesh an opportunity for gukesh to make it in to the semis from the uae vidit versus nepo that is a very fun one caruana versus youngstuda dominguez perez versus alexis surrender we haven't looked at a lot of la dopes games but we will granddelius versus erigasi and ference berkas versus pragnananda of india that is insane stuff on the women's side we have the semi-finals elizabeth pets versus anna muzuchuk who actually defeated her own sister and paulina shivalova versus nirgil salimova that is a matchup of russia and bulgaria that is very very exciting and that concludes the round of 16 round of 32 coverage on both sides magnus still in hikaru eliminated by prague 4 out of 16 players on the open side remaining are from the country of india indian chess is the future but we still do have caruana and we do have lanier dominguez perez from the us and we still got magnus magnus evancho coming up i'll see you there get out of here
