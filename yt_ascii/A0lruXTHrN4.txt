i had the worst co-op experience at this company someone's at the door hello [music] that'll teach him for trying to use our company's name in his video ever again well he's dead so i probably won't be making forget it okay so i'm obviously not gonna use the company's name i made a whole skit about it if you really care about the company you could just go on my linkedin and find it but again the idea behind these videos is to kind of destigmatize getting a bad internship getting a bad co-op it's definitely not to say that all co-ops and internships are going to be like this so i worked at this old tech giant i did the whole interview i actually did a bunch of interviews finally got the job i was really excited to start and on my first day i learned that the entire team had been sold to a different company what is this major league programming i didn't know you could just sell teams like mark cuban but they sold the whole team they didn't sell any other teams in the company just as one team that i happen to be on and that made for a horrible transition because they were so busy with this transition that they didn't have any time to give me work javin who i've had on the show actually talks about a similar experience he had he was went to a company the whole company was sold to uber and then he ended up transitioning into uber where he works now so this happened to two people including me that i know so i mean it it's not unheard of so basically i didn't have any work to do they had two pieces of of hardware that they you had to rent and you could only rent it for an hour and there was 12 people on the team and you could only test your code on the hardware which means you really couldn't test your code you couldn't really write code efficiently in any manner and i didn't really get anything done in terms of coding i read a lot and i tried to code where i could i was doing odd jobs i really was just doing one-off jobs like writing an app to help this person test their thing and writing a script to help this person i ended up writing a script for our team's local nascar fantasy draw like i ended up just writing one-off code and not really actually building or learning anything so the point being if you do get an internship like this they exist hopefully it's something like javin's case where you'll get to go to the other team and they'll actually have a lot of work for you to do if you do get put in a position like this again just badger your manager to try and get some work if you can't get work just do some odd jobs still continue to program still try to learn as much as you can this is just a product of a fast-paced economy sometimes teams are sold sometimes companies are sold as an intern you'll probably get depre prioritized but you know what what do you expect my second horror story which happened right after the first one so i almost dropped out of computer science entirely anyway let me know what you guys think about your horror story stay tuned for adam wong's which is going to be out really soon don't forget to like and subscribe and leave a comment [music]
