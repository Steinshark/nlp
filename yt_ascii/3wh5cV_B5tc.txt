hello all the way over there i'm trying a new camera angle today's video is going to be a more slowed down step-by-step process of how i did the visual effects from the thaw video or at least one shot anyway we're going to go over this shot here this is one of my favorites from the video a few people said they thought it was very convincing which i was very flattered by obviously it's always nice to hear that you tricked someone into thinking that this is real so essentially what's going on in this shot we have obviously on there some object tracking the bowling pins are there that's literatures are still framed i'm not going to really go over how to do that pretty simple but yeah the main thing is object tracking mjolnir and doing the lightning which i'll also go over because i didn't touch on that in the breakdown first thing is first object tracking the hammer let's go to the movie clip editor so to bring in your footage i exported a jpeg sequence from nuke so that i can bring it to blender and use it as a background image let's do the not the background plate but the undistorted plate which is the one we want open clip so press set scene frames and then pre-fetch we're just going to load it into your ram you want to put in your camera details and your lens information thankfully due to my very well drawn storyboards that i labeled with all my focal lengths i know this was shot at 50 millimeters so you come over here my camera has a 35.6 millimeter sensor and i know that the lens was a 50 millimeter lens because i wrote that down then what you want to do is go to the objects tab and at the moment it's going to do a camera track we want to do an object track so if you press the plus button it will add an object and then you can start adding your tracking points and start doing your object tracking as you can see i touched on this in the last video i made this very beautiful mjolnir out of a few domino's pizza boxes that i taped together so at this point what you want to do is start adding some tracking markers and you need eight tracking markers throughout the whole shot for the tracking to kind of be able to calculate properly let's go for this one slap bang in the middle first i'm going to hold ctrl and click and that will add this tracker by default it might look like this i think mine did the first time if you press alt s it will show the search box so this middle box is the actual kind of is what's meant to contain the tracking marker you can scale the whole thing by pressing s to change the size and the search box is basically the computer analyzing the area around the tracking marker and kind of seeing where it's moving in relation to everything else which helps with the tracking so you want to make this kind of fairly big without going too crazy because the bigger you make it the slower it will track i'm going to turn on normalize over here normalize is the computer accounting for slight lighting changes so if it gets a bit darker in this shot suddenly it's not going to go oh my god i've lost the tracker and i think we're ready to go so if i hit ctrl t and there we go it's tracked to the end amazing and then obviously we're to go to the point where we started from and i'm going to hit ctrl shift t to track backwards at this point it's going to get lost because it gets really motion blurred and so i had to hand track this bit for a few frames when the hammer is leaving the frame but that's fine it's pretty easy to do so let's just go through frame by frame and zoom in a bit you can press g to move the tracking marker and just step through with the arrow keys and move it along it's very simple stuff you want to be quite accurate with this if you can so try and get it sort of in the same place every time it's a bit tough with motion blur and then once you get to the point where it's gone off the screen just don't do it anymore don't try and guess where it's gone that will just be the point where that track ends essentially so now we have one track that's working we just need to do this a load more time so i'm probably going to fast forward this because it's not super interesting pro tip if you can hear me over the noise of the fan if you hold shift when you're moving stuff around it will move a lot slower so it's a bit easier to be more precise i've switched to standing desk my back was killing me so i've just finished all the tracking done a few more tracking points than eight so that we can filter some out for the real shot i didn't even do any filtering the track was so good in the first place that it didn't even require any sort of tweaking really so the next step is to select all your tracking points go to the solve tab i always turn on keyframe this is basically a where you can define two manual frames in the sequence where there's a lot of parallax you turn on keyframe it just does it for you automatically the computer tries to work it out which i find usually works pretty well then you press solve object motion it will do some calculating and you'll get a solver up here we've got a solver of 0.61 which is pretty good i think i got 0.29 on the last one so this isn't quite as good which probably means it's a good idea to do some cleaning we can do it the manual way if we come up here and turn on info we can see the tracking error or the solver of the trackers so i can see this one's 0.94 that's a bit high this one's 0.7 that's kind of high and the others look pretty good so maybe we'll get rid of that one as well and then that will bring down the average solver quite a bit of all of our tracks what you can also do if you have loads of tracks and you don't want to do it manually because that's a bit of a pain you can go to the clean up tab and then put in the solve area that you want all your tracks to fall below so if i say let's go below 0.66 hit clean tracks and it will select all of the ones above that and then you can just press x and delete them and if i select them again to solve object motion i now don't have enough trackers so let's do how many have i got here one two three four five six let's do a couple more and hopefully get a bit of a better solve error okay i've done a few extra ones let's try and clean up some of these again so i'm going to turn on info let's have a look at some of the main offenders we've got a 0.98 over here 0.92 0.184 that's a big one get rid of this 0.98 and i think those are the worst ones so if we go solve object motion 0.6 okay that's pretty respectful let's try get it below 0.5 there's another 0.98 here you can go son oh we've got 0.103 there as well solve object motion 0.46 there we go i'll accept that so now you've got your track done you can go to the 3d viewport and add a camera click on the camera go to the constraints tab add the camera solver constraint and by default you won't really see anything but if you come up to the visibility tab and then turn on motion tracking you'll be able to see these points appear in the camera now obviously these points are pretty tiny so oh god i've lost my camera that's not good what you can do let's just rotate this so it's looking in more of a correct direction as well is go to the camera tab and then just turn down the size so it looks something a bit more like this which is more in line with what i shot and if i hit play now you can see that those points are our checking markers and they're moving the way the hammer is moving so now what i'm going to do is link in my mjolnir files which i made in a separate blender file now all you have to do is go into the camera's perspective and line everything up so it would help if we could actually see what we were doing to go to the camera tab add a background image and open the background image sequence that i made earlier all 72 frames open so now i'm just going to grab it and rotate it into position this takes a little bit of tweaking to get the perspective right and everything you can go into wireframe mode sort of get the scale right also make sure it kind of actually lines up so something like that looks pretty good to me so now what we want to do once that's in position on one frame is select the object everything's parented to or if it's just one object select the object then go to the constraints tab add constraint object solver for the object we're going to go object because that's what we did in the camera tracking tab you know we added an object solve and then for the camera you select your camera and suddenly it's pinged off over here and everything's broken and you think oh my god i've done something wrong nope you press set inverse and it pings back and now we're going to the camera's perspective you can see that the hammer is tracking perfectly with the live action hammer that i was holding then after that all i did was go to the world tab add an environment texture like so and find an hdri on hdri haven that matched this so let's pretend we've hit rendered on that and it's taking about 10 minutes because you've got an amazing gpu then we're going to jump into nuke and do some compositing before i start diving into the new stuff all of this is completely possible in any compositing software so something like after effects even has a better lightning tool than new car to download a third party one which i'll talk about in a second so let's have a look up here we have our footage i did a little bit of cleanup where i frame held the first frame where my hand wasn't in the frame so i could use this for the bits where the pizza box was sticking out so all i did was draw a couple of masks and just reveal the clean plate over the sections where i didn't want to be able to see the handle underneath the next thing i put on top of that was the bowling pins which go over here this is just a single frame rendered from blender like i said i rendered i didn't even render a shadow pass for this actually i just did some rotor shapes on the floor to make a shadow then we have the render of mjolnir this is how it looks straight out of blender so before and after that's just literally no grades or anything put on top of the footage first thing i did is match the black point and make the you know the exposure a little bit better and then there's a couple of other grades making it kind of match the environment colors a little bit better then like i explained in the breakdown i had to roto my hand to go on top of mjolnir which goes here so this is the rotor of my hand here and then all i did to make the shadow was just offset that slightly so i transformed it and then blurred it a little bit like this and i used that to grade down the handle of mjolnir like that and that's just a really simple cheap and easy way of doing a contact shadow on top of that i've got vector blur which adds the motion blur for when it's being swung into the frame like this so that's without motion blur and that's with and that's pretty much it for just getting the hammer to sit into the scene then we move on to the lightning which is a little bit more complicated i will say right now i wanted to do the lightning and blender and i've since seen a tutorial that's quite good that i probably would have done that if i'd have seen it a month ago but i don't think there's a particularly good way to make lightning in blender at the moment it would have been really cool to do it that way as well because the lightning could have reflected a bit more in the material of the hammer but as it was i just did it in 2d and then kind of hacked all the reflections so the way i did it is i used a gizmo that i got from i think it was nukapedia called x tesla which is just like a procedural lightning generator and literally all it does you add it in you get two points and you can kind of drag them around and it makes some lightning after effects has a very similar tool that's built in and i actually think it's a bit better called cc advanced lighting i think i used to use it loads when i used to use after effects so i turned off all of the kind of built-in glows and stuff in the lightning so i just had this kind of white line that had a slight blue fall off towards the end and then i just did all the glows and stuff myself because i had a bit more control over it on its own obviously this looked pretty rubbish because there's no lighting interaction with the hammer and this is where doing it in blender would have been quite nice because i could have made these like emissive and then it would have lit up the hammer but as is the way of life so what i ended up doing instead is putting the lightning on here and then using just a little rotor shape with a glow on it to kind of add this hot spot onto the hammer it's just a little mask of a circle and then i blurred it a little bit quite a lot actually and then did an exponential glow to give it that kind of intensity a little bit more glow on top of that made it blue to match the color of the lightning and then plus that on top of the footage so that's kind of getting there the hot spot kind of beds it in a little bit better and it starts to work a bit nicer and then after that what i did is split out the glossy parts of the hammer which is like all the reflections and i graded that part on its own and added some highlights just into that so it'd be like it was just picking up on the reflective areas so that's what this looks like you can see there's some lighting interaction on the handle and some on the actual hammer there and the nice thing about this is it only exaggerates the areas where the reflections would actually pick up so it's not just like an overall grade over the whole thing making it blue it's only adding the highlights into the areas that are reflective so you can see they're picking up in these small pits and stuff quite a bit where they're catching the edges so this is the rotor shapes that i drew to add the blue onto there it's just again kind of a few rotor shapes with a bit of feather on them in a few places so i did that for all the hot spots where the lightning was quite close and then i also did like an overall one that's much bigger that's just kind of the whole face of the hammer where the lightning was touching and then that goes back on top so that's what it looks like oh wait there we go that's before that's after and when you add all of those things together you get this which i think looks really cool there's a few last minute details like i added some lighting interaction on my fingers here when the bolt goes across the bottom of my hand but essentially that's how this shot was done most of this to be honest just comes from the object track and blender that's the most tricky part so there we go that's a tutorial on how to do this shot the others were very similar object tracking or hand tracking but essentially just putting mjolnir in all the shots so i hope you've enjoyed this tutorial if you want me to do one every week then let me know in the comments and i'll see what i can do as i always say the project files for all of my videos are available on patreon for a dollar so if you want to get all of the files for this so you'd have to make it yourself and you can just get stuck straight in you can download them from there it saves you some work and it helps support the channel so it'd be greatly appreciated the next thing is we recently had a halloween render competition in the discord group someone suggested a couple of weeks ago that we should do a halloween competition and i said yeah let's go for it didn't think that many people would enter but there were some really really good entries in here and so thank you to everyone that entered it was really cool to see your work but yeah if you're interested in joining the discord then the link's in the description and it would be cool to see you there and finally something that i think no one will be expecting i've heard the requests there's been over 50 people that have asked for it and i've caved in so i'm gonna do an iron man tutorial series coming very soon keep your eyes peeled thanks for watching this video i'm out you
