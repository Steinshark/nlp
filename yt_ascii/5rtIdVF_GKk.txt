again let's kick things off with number five the nokia nine pureview and it's been a long time since i've recommended and been excited for a nokia phone but the company has really cleaned up their act with recent devices so far though while they're making really good phones nokia is playing it safe this changes with the nokia 9 pureview a case leaked and various renders showcase a penta camera set up five cameras just on the back of the phones we do know from the galaxy a9 that camera quantity doesn't equate to camera quality but we can be pretty sure it's gonna grant flexibility options to take really wide-angle shots or maybe zoom in further than past devices also close to stock software is pretty likely and to be honest recent nokia phones have been some of the best built products i've used this phone has been leaked and talked about for months already and as of now it's got two potential release dates either february next year or december the fifth which is in two weeks time number four is the pakka phone f2 this phone doesn't need much of an introduction or even an explanation the f1 was a category defining smartphone offering the same performance of $1,000.00 phones at a price of barely three hundred dollars i would expect the price of the f2 to drift closer to the 400 mark but if we are looking at a snapdragon 855 eight gigabytes of ram and a 4000 plus milliamp hour battery then that's more than reasonable this kind of power would come close to or even surpass the peak performance of the iphone 10 s mass i'd imagine that the body of the phone probably won't change too much but there is a rumour that the company will ditch the ir face unlocking on the front so that they can trim down the size of the knotch number three is the samsung galaxy flex it's official samsung's foldable phone is very much on the way and out their most recent developers conference we got our closest look yet what you're seeing is likely a prototype of this phone tablet hybrid but hidden in this chunky protective case so you can't see the specifics it's got one big bold display on the inside but also a single smaller display which can be used one close i don't think it's something that i would use daily just because having a foldable phone introduces a whole series of complications of its own with une main benefit being this larger display when it's folded out which to be honest i'm not even sure i'd use very much even for videos because they'll probably drain your battery twice as fast but this is exciting for a different reason it's something new we're entering uncharted territory here you could have two people watching two different videos at the same time or one half of the screen playing a game while another has a video walkthrough pulled up no doubt even better multitasking abilities and i'm sure a whole bunch of stuff that we weren't expecting number two the hallway at p 30 pro which is exciting for a lot of reasons and just to start with were likely to see a lot of the features that we saw on the meet 20 pros so that stuff like wireless reverse charging 40 watt super charging and the ultra wide camera lens and according to european boss walter g we will definitely see more innovation in the camera and now we have three imagine four for next year he goes on to talk about why you might want this and he kind of implies that the company isn't happy with the current limit of five times lossless zoom and that they can aim for 10 i put together this concept here which shows how the camera module might look since they're adding one extra camera module from the mid 20 they may well also add a second flash to keep the module rectangular it's not to mention also light your face more evenly the only potential downside is that the phone will be powered by the keyring at 980 which is very specialized for ai based tasks but in terms of raw cpu and gpu power looks like it's gonna fall behind the qualcomm and exynos equivalents also probably no 5g because this isn't already built into the chip and as it is huawei is having a pretty tough time selling to us markets and the u.s. is one of the few areas that will start to get some sort of 5g coverage in 2019 so that leaves us with number one the samsung galaxy s 10 and i've been looking forward to this phone well before the note 9 came out and i have covered it in more detail in a separate video which you can find somewhere above but essentially these are the main point it's a larger display with no not but instead this little camera cutout they call infinity oh the new exynos 98 22 which will bring no end of improvements not just to performance and graphics but also the camera and it's slow-motion capabilities i'm also really hoping for a night mode because if you could combine something like that with samsung's already pretty good variable aperture you could have night photos that even leapfrog the pixel three as long as they're generous with the battery capacity i think it may well be the phone to go for in the first half of 2019 okay so those are five really exciting smartphones to look forward to in 2019 and of course i didn't manage to include all of them in this video so if you do want to see a follow up let me know in the comments down below as always thank you so much for watching my name is our and this is mr. he's the boss i'll catch you in the next one [music]
