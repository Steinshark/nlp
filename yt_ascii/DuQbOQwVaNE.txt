- i'm in front of a restaurant, with a $100,000 check. -
- (register ching) hey, how's it going? i'm curious, if you would
quit your job for $100,000. - no, i don't think i would. like, i have got bills to pay. - you can get a different
job and have $100,000. - my boss would not be happy. - let's ask him. would you be mad if she quit, for a hundred grand? - not at all. - - are you serious? i'm your favorite employee! - i would quit. - you heard your boss. okay, i'm putting my two
week notice right now. - no two weeks. (all laugh) - and if you don't
believe the money is real, in this car is $100,000 in duffel bags. - mr. beast, thanks to you, i can quit my job now. i'm so happy. - we're just getting started. we have hundreds of
thousands of more dollars we're givin' away next vid. and now we're gonna do
it again at walmart. have either of you seen
the channel mr. beast? - yes. i was curious, would you quit your job
for $10,000 in cash? - no (employee laughing) - i figured you'd say that. you don't actually have to quit your job. do you want ten grand though? - yes, i would love it - here you go. (microsoft error sound) we're not actually gonna
make her quit her job. oh, you're crying? - we just found out my
grandma has stage four cancer. - [jimmy] i'm sorry. - no, you're fine. it's just god's way of working things out. like, this is such a blessing. - now we're on a football
field with two ex quarterbacks. now can you throw that football to him? (whizzing sound) you guys just made $1. - [crowd sound effect] wow. - you just made another dollar. every time you throw the
football back and forth, you guys get a dollar. now here's the thing, if one of you drop it or
it touches the ground, you lose all your money. (losing buzzer) they literally have all day to make as much money as they want. we're gonna go to the next bit. this is an $800,000 mansion and this is the key to the front door. play dramatic music. (dramatic music) (keys rattling) - that felt empowering. - i feel like a man now. - now. - nolan, if you pick the correct
key out of this fishbowl, that unlocks this door, you
get to keep this mansion. pick a key. - nolan wait! good luck. - oh, he's dumping the keys out. - this could be an $800,000 decision. - nolan, you're taking forever. pick a key
- all right! - four. three. two. one. - oh, that was a bad decision. - if this key unlocks the
house, he gets a mansion. oh, thank god. - it's way too big! (all yelling) screw this game! - we are now at an airport
and this is a pilot. - i fly planes. - and i want you to
take this piece of paper and make a paper airplane. and if it makes it past
this line, he gets, $1,000. 5,000. 10,000. and if it makes it all the
way past this line, $20,000. if there was anyone who knew how to make a perfect paper airplane,
it would be wayne. - that would be me. - do you think you're
gonna win the 20 grand? - i'm gonna give it my best shot. - $20,000 is on the line. (dramatic music) - [jimmy] precision. oh, huh? - [wayne] hey! - [jimmy] that's not bad! wait a minute, chris. it only halfway made it. - this is the halfway
point of the airplane. - uh-huh. (exaggerated scraping) - oh, alright. - you just won $10,000 in cash. - i'll take it, i'll take it. (jimmy laughing) - wayne, can we just throw
this money in your plane? - yes, sir. put it right back here. (register ching) (register ching) (door slam) - now that the money's in your plane, the only reasonable thing
to do is fly off, right? (airplane engine roaring) - [jimmy] holy cow, whoo-hoo. (upbeat music) all right, let's go give away more money. now we're on the side of the road (tire hissing) and we have a flat tire. and whoever helps us change
this flat tire first, gets the car. - hey, we got a flat tire! hey, what a jerk! (upbeat music) - [chris] yes, let's go, we got somebody. we don't know how to change a tire. - we've literally been
on the side of the road for over an hour just waiting
for someone to help us. - [brian] are you serious? this happened to me
like many years ago, and i'm passing it forward. - i really like this guy. he said his car was falling apart. he's being very helpful. very kind. this is a perfect guy. - brian, thank you so much for
helping us change this tire. do you see that camera over there? - oh yeah. we're actually a youtube channel with 50 million subscribers. and since you helped us change the tire on this car, it's now yours. - what? - tereq, come over here. well, after the car, don't get ran over. basically we purposely popped that tire and waited for over an hour to have someone come help fix it. since you were the one
who helped us fix it. here's the key to your brand new car. yeah. -
- are you kidding me? - that's what you get for helping us, man. we appreciate it -
- oh my god. - i'm just glad it went
to someone who actually, you know, could use the help. - i, no words. - this right here is david. he's a professional golf player. dave, if you can hit a hole in one. i will give you $1 million today. - i think i can do it - do you actually? how many times have you hit on this? - too many to count. - [chandler] you ever hit a hole in one? - no, but i don't wanna
talk about that right now. (all laughing) - [dave] karl's 151 yards away. so the wind's coming off
a little left to right. it is a little wet and damp. 60 degrees. which is a little bit cooler so the ball's not gonna wanna fly as well. - he's really calculating everything. i'm starting to get nervous
for our million dollars. (intense music) - [jimmy] oh, dude t's like actually going in that direction. - [dave] oh my god. - [jimmy] oh snap! - [dave] oh - [jimmy] oh my gosh, that is so close! oh my god. dude, look how close he is. oh my goodness. you are less than one chris
away from a million dollars. dave, you didn't win a million dollars, but if you can hit it
in on this next stroke, i'll give you 10 grand. (all groaning) - [dave] get it in there. (all cheering) - thank you so much guys
for this opportunity. it's unbelievable. - yeah - that's the best way to put it. - and speaking of winning 10 grand, i wonder how the football
players are doing. - gentlemen! what is up? dude it's almost dark out. - yeah, it's getting rough out here. - this is how many times they've thrown it back and forth so far. - [karl] whoa! - look at how full this case is getting of money that they've made. i have one challenge before we go. if you go 10 yards back and do one throw, i'll add $5,000 to your total. this is a $5,000 throw. actually this is more, this is 5,000 plus all the money you've made because if he drops it, they're done. - you ready? - [griff] yep. - oh boy, i'm nervous. he threw it. (intense music) (all celebrating) - that was a little
scary, i'm not gonna lie. - [jimmy] oh man. this trash bag has $5,000 in it. our boy chandler here is hungry. chandler's gonna order a
pizza from papa john's. chris is gonna order a pizza from domino's and karl's gonna order
a pizza from pizza hut. whichever pizza is delivered first, we're gonna tip that pizza delivery driver, $10,000. whoever picks that driver
that arrives first, we're gonna give your mom $10,000. - oh yay, my mom! - gentlemen, the weather
outside's very nice, and order your pizzas! - oh my god, i'm so good at this. it'll be for delivery. - i don't want anything. it'll be for delivery. pick up, i meant pick not delivery. - it's delivery. - i want a pizza. - [pizza hut employee] you're not looking for anything specific? - nope. - it's a rush order if you can. tell the driver that. - thank you. let's go! 25 minutes and counting. - this is for delivery. (karl screams) (smack) (laughing) - why do you guys do this? stop it. it's for delivery and the app - (karl screams) i can't deal with this! i'm going to the dominoes app! create new order. delivery. no tomato sauce, no cheese. just bread, bread pizza! it said, "hold up, this
pizza doesn't look right. (all laughing) - [domino's employee]

with no sauce and no cheese? and we're just calling
to confirm that you just want a slab of dough. - bread pizza, yes. - ah, ah, ah - this is my local dominoes

they've made so far. i feel like we should end it in a fun way. i love how serious they are. it's like, i'm not even here. are you guys interested
in doing a little bit of double or nothing? - no. - no? you don't even know what it is yet. this is $17,000. if you do one 30 yard pass, then you can each walk away with 17 grand. just your stereotypical touchdown pass. one pass. 30 yards to here. and he catches it, you both
walk away with 17 grand. you know what? i'll up it. you both walk away with 20
grand and can go to bed. - what do you think griff? - i mean i'm up for it if
you think you can do it. - you, you say yes or no. - yes! (all cheering) - [jimmy] all right! moment of truth. can he make this touchdown pass? this is the most important
