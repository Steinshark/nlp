well i sars idea would read boris pasternak which is a famous russian poet won a nobel prize before every match and he kind of captures that ethic so this is the poem i'll say it in russian okay and then in english please okay draghi reporter vamoose lado prado - i put cepeda patch lapa regina at poppy adidas some need da janela chat he doesn't needi need ok yet post-its at itza no bridge jovem java metallica java metallica the concern i know there's a bunch of russian people that appreciate that the translation a bit crappy is very difficult to translate the russian language but it's the others step by step we'll follow the living imprint of your feet but you yourself must not distinguish your victory from your defeat and never for a single moment betray your credo or pretend but be alive only this matters alive and burning to the end so this is at the end of a poem that represents the fact that fame that most of the poem says that same recognition money none of that matters the winning and losing none of that matters what matters is the purity of the art just giving yourself completely over to the art so like others will write your story others will tell whether you did good or bad others will inspire using your story but as the artist so in the case of pasternak he's a poet writer it did road in doctor zhivago the is the art you should only think about the art and the purity of it and the love of it you
