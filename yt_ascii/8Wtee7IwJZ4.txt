there's something about having over 700 horsepower and rear wheel drive where i'm pretty sure it's mandatory for it to be raining when you're experiencing that so rather than talk about driving dynamics let's talk about engines displacement rpm and boost hello everyone and welcome we are sitting inside of the mclaren 750s the successor to the 720s and so i want to talk about engines because while this has a special engine it's nice to think about what are the fundamentals in order to make a boatload of power like this vehicle has so there are some shared elements that basically all cars that are production cars operate under in that you know they're using gas from a gas station they're using atmospheric air in order to make power and they're using you know fourstroke engines fourstroke is the norm so operating with those fundamental elements there are many different ways that you can make more power but ultimately what you really need to do is get more air in the engine so how do you put more air through an engine well there's three main ways displacement rpm and boost so i want to talk about each of them all right so as far as displacement this is the swept volume of an engine's piston so basically how big is the engine so for example again the theme here being we want more air to go through our engines so let's say we have a 2 l engine and it operates at 6,000 rpm it maxes out 6,000 rpm well if we want to find out how much air do we have to work with with this engine well you have 2 l you multiply that by 6,000 rpm you divide that by two because you have one intake stroke for every four strokes which means every two revolutions of that crank ship in other words one for every 2 rpm so 2 * 6000 / 2 we have 6,000 l of air at that max rpm to work with to make power okay so if we want to make more power using displacement let's simply double the size of our engine now we have a 4 l engine operating at 6,000 rpm divide by 2 and we have 12,000 l of air per minute that we have to work with in order to make power that means we've effectively doubled how much power we can make because we have twice as much air to work with now another strategy you can go with is rpm so let's say once again we have that 2 l engine 6,000 rpm now we double the rpm so 12,000 rpm * 2 id by 2 12 12,000 l of air per minute that we have to work with so we have a much smaller engine but it's doing all of this twice as fast twice as fast that air flow is going through the engine so it's effectively just like that 4 l operating at 6,000 rpm we're just using a smaller engine higher rpm same amount of air flow we're effectively doubling how much power we have and then finally we get to boost so once again 2 l engine 6,000 rpm now instead of using this atmospheric pressure this air that we have around us which is out of about 14.7 psi let's just call it 15 psi let's add in additional pressure using a turbocharger or a supercharger into that engine so our volume of air that's going through the engine you know it's basically going to be the same but we've doubled the pressure so if we use 15 psi of boost 30 psi absolute pressure going through that engine doubling our pressure so 2 * 6,000 * 2 divided by 2 we get 12,000 l of air that we have to work with per minute so again all of these are different strategies very different strategies in order to effectively double how much air we've got going through this engine in order to effectively double how much power it makes now there's of course efficiency differences and advantages and disadvantages with each strategy all right so going back to displacement why would you choose this method what are the advantages well it's simple it can be reliable it doesn't necessarily mean it will be reliable but you have lower stresses on your engine internals because you're using atmospheric pressure rather than higher pressures you're not operating at a really high rpm so the stresses on your powertrain aren't that high it means it can be reliable or cheaper to make overall it does tend to be cheaper it's simple you know it's an easy method of making more power and you have a great response right naturally aspirated engines youve got really good response from them big benefit from them low-end torque with large displacement engines so there's a lot of benefits of going this route a simple example of you know an engine using displacement above everything else dodge viper right 8.4 l it's only revving to 6200 rpm but you have 8.4 l massive engine and so because you have such a large engine it's able to make you know around 650 horsepower all right so why go the rpm route so the big benefit of high rpm means you can use a much smaller engine right so you can double the power output yet not increase your displacement if you double the rpm and so this means you use a small engine and it means you save a lot of weight so there's huge benefits to doing that the downside you don't tend to have that much low-end torque so if you have a really really wide rpm range well it's challenging to make really good torque across that rpm range and so as a result you push the torque curve so that you make good power at the top end so that the vehicle makes good power and then you can use gears to get good torque to the wheels the challenge is if you are at a low rpm and you're driving with this really small engine means you're not going to have much power you're not going to have good acceler ation on that bottom end so an example of a car using rpm above everything else gordon murray t50 right this is a 4 l engine naturally aspirated so you think okay that's not going to be able to make that much power well it revs to 12,100 rpm so as a result much like our dodge viper you know it's sitting around 650 horsepower even though it's less than half the size of that dodge viper engine because it's revving so high and finally we get to boost and so this is interesting right because if you have an engine basically a third of that power goes into creating pressure to force down that piston and propel you forward another third of that power just goes into the cooling system completely wasted and another third of that power just goes out the exhaust again just waste heat so a turbocharger what it's doing is taking advantage of that waste heat that's going out the exhaust that's a lot of power right why not do something with it so you use that power to spin a turbine the other end of that is spinning an impeller you bringing in with this compressor more air into your engine you're forcing the pressure to be higher within your engine and thus make way more power now the benefit is again you can use a smaller engine now weight savings is kind of complicated right because you're adding a turbo you can be adding intercooling systems you can add a lot of weight through you know liquid intercoolers airto a intercoolers your exhaust routing it does add complexity right and so this adds weight but you can generally speaking save some weight if it's all done right and use a smaller engine and another big benefit of that is you can have both power and efficiency in theory so if you're light on your foot then you know you get good efficiency because you've got a really small engine that you're working with and then when you need to make more power you force a lot more pressure within that engine so that you can make the power you don't have to carry around this huge engine and make crazy power and then have this wasteful you know use of mass and space when you don't need all that power so a good example of an engine using boost above all else is kig se's tiny friendly giant 2 l engine right but it's operating at about 30 psi 2 bar so we're tripling how much air we have from the atmosphere within this engine and because of that little 2 l engine revving to 8500 rpm it's able to make 600 horsepower now on ethanol right on pump gas around 500 but point remains if you look at each one of these engines and you look at their strategy and you multiply that by their rpm and their displacement and the pressures you can see you know they're all around 600 650 horsepower and they have fairly similar air flows that they're working with so you know that limiting factor how much air do you have to work with then how efficiently can you make power with that air so you're going to see differences of course especially with turbochargers where you're compressing that air it heats it up it means there is going to be some losses associated with that but regardless you see there's very different methodologies in order to make a lot of power each with their own pros and cons all right so what the heck does that have to do with the car that we're sitting in the mclaren 750s well this car employs all three of those strategies in order to create one of the most powerful v8 engines in a production car sold today so 740 horsepower if we're talking metric horsepower it's 750 metric horsepower whatever a metric horsepower is and hence you have the name 750 d s so we have a 4 l v8 engine so plenty of displacement there it revs to 8500 rpm so high reving engine and it has twin turbocharger so boost to go along with it now mclaren will not tell me how much boost it does use but you know if you combine these three factors even with low boost you can see that the airf flow going through this engine is going to be greater than the other examples that i provided and so it's like pretty obvious that yes this thing is going to make a ton of power through the result of these different airflow strategies now stay with me here because this math is going to be a tad complex this is the mclaren 750s it replaces the mclaren 720s 750 minus 720 is 30 30 is the key number here so this vehicle has 30 more horsepower 30 more pound feet of torque it weighs 30 kg less or about 66 lb and mclaren says it is 30% all new so yes it is very much so an updated 720s but with 30% new parts going into this vehicle so with these changes this car is better in every performance metric versus the 720s except for top speed now why well they use a more aggressive final drive ratio so they're using a 15% shorter final drive resulting in better in gear acceleration in every gear of about 10% so it's quicker right it doesn't have the top speed i'm sure you'll be bummed to know that it goes down from 212 to 206 m per hour now there's probably very few people who can be like ah you know i've actually gone 212 in a mclaren 720s and i will notice the difference in the 750s actually i get to be one of those few lucky people that has gone 212 mph in the 720s so in theory if i were to floor it not going to do it cuz it's raining i'm on a public road but the top speed would be about 6 mph lower now here's the thing with the 750 and the 720s the 720s was already this bonkers machine right like it accelerated it was crazy how good it is acceleration especially when you just look at it on paper and you say okay 710 horsepower rear wheeel drive open differential how quick is it really going to be then compare it to say something like a bugatti veun right 16 cylinders four turbochargers all whe drive 1,000 horsepower right this thing's meant to be insanely quick in a straight line 720s is quicker in the quarter mile right that's crazy the 720s the on paper is just like okay yeah 700 horsepower which like i guess these days is nothing huh it's insane how fast this thing is and this is significantly quicker so while the 720s was doing 0 to 124 mph or 200 kmph in 7 7.8 seconds this is doing it in 7.2 seconds yes this car right here can get to4 mph or 200 km per hour faster than a modern nissan ultima can hit 60 mph nissan ultima the pinnacle of performance we all agree again the numbers are just bonkers the 750s can hit 300 km hour'6 mph in under 20 seconds in the coup just over 20 seconds in the sp which is what we're sitting in now for the 720s mclaren says it can do the4 mile in 10.3 seconds and this can do the4 mile in 10.1 seconds well actually it's been tested in the 720s that it could hit the4 mile in 10.1 seconds stock 720s so in reality this thing might be able to crest into the nines for the quarter mile production car rear wheel drive open differential like absolutely nuts how quick this thing is it's hypercar performance you know for $400,000 which yes is still an absurd amount of money but when you start looking at what it can hang with you know suddenly okay maybe not so crazy of a price tag it's right there with the senna in terms of acceleration now the spider is about 50 kg heavier than the coupe and so you might wonder well on a day like today when it's raining are there actually any advantages of going with the spider versus the coup glad you asked this lovely button right here rolls down our window couple down ships and you get some fire spitting in the cabin wow fantastic they've actually worked on the harmon of the engine lowering the second and sixth order harmonics in order to give you more presence of that fourth and eighth order harmonics and give you a bit better noise as you run through the rev and i must say it is a noticeable improvement on the sound versus the 720s that is cool watching that breake completely blocks your vision of what's behind you who cares your faster you can also get some really cool turbo induction sounds with that down right when you let off that now i'd love to be able to tell you what this thing is like to drive and you know here i am driving it right there are some changes like it has a sharper steering rack so you know you've got very quick very responsive turn in the steering fiel feels great mclaren one of the very few remaining still using hydraulic steering they've got an updated version of their proactive chassis control so we're on the third version of that in this car slightly softer springs up front slightly stiffer in the rear it's got a larger 20% larger wing back there but reality is on today i'm not going to be able to tell you what this thing's really like to drive it's a little wet and i've got way too much power and only two wheels driven in order to find out what the acceleration really feels like there's a reason why i mostly just talked about engines but overall this is taking the 720s and just taking it to another level so lightweighting through the use of lightweight hood lightweight wheels lightweight exhaust lightweight seats it's adding power a little bit more boost they actually had to add a fuel pump so instead of one fuel pump this has two fuel pumps in order to compensate for the extra fuel needed to compensate for that added pressure in the engine it's got a triple layer head gasket instead of of the dual layer that was used in the 720s and with this added power you get shorter gearing so you actually get significantly quicker acceleration again 6 seconds quicker than 200 km/ hour than the 720s that's a big difference so the 720s already had insane performance and we're just taking that up a bit now i am going to be going out on a track later today and hopefully it's not quite as wet and i actually get to feel what the car is like at the limit there are a couple cool videos i'd recommend checking out i have a video on clarence proactive chassis control and how that works in the 720s it's a really cool really clever system that's very unlike what other supercars out there use as far as their suspension and also if you're curious to see what it looks like to drive on a public road over 200 mph well i have a video doing that in the 720s thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave
