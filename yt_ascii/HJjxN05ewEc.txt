ksi is one of the world's most popular youtubers but yesterday he accidentally exposed the pump and dump crypto scams that he promoted they've been hidden for 2 years but only came out when ksi logged back into his old twitter account saying does this still work now if you didn't know this is ksi's crypto account where he used to talk about crypto coins he liked but he messed up because one investigator has been waiting for him to return to the scene of the crime and that person is not me it's zach xbt a crypto investigator on twitter who i'll link below because his work is incredible he's a friend of the show we've collaborated a lot i i just encourage you to go follow him but i was shocked when he said this in before he starts sharing garbage again dumping your tokens on logan paul's lap dog is permitted and encouraged now many people including myself hadn't seen anything from ksi to this point that seemed shady but zach had been waiting for this moment he goes on remember remember when ksi posted this all of a sudden my xcad bag is looking juicy again hoddle gang then proceeded to dump $850,000 worth of xcat over the following days from his wallet address now obviously i was stunned by this but looking at the date of when this all happened i realized zach has been holding on to this piece of evidence waiting for ksi to come back to this account for years he had this tweet in the drafts and ksi logging back in activated the trap card zach also shared a picture as proof series of transactions from ksi's wallet were starting on march 27th when he sent that tweet ksi started selling xcad the same day he tweeted he was part of the huddle gang slang for someone who wouldn't sell this cryptocoin right in fact that wasn't the only time ksi has mentioned this holding stance publicly i'm holding my bags i'm holding by luna my exat videos like this are why people genuinely thought ksi was just buying and holding but he wasn't this time he sold and he tweeted again on march 30th 2022 me looking at zil and xcad right now and it might look like that means he's excited about this but really he was looking at the cell button because he continued to sell xcad to his fans who thought he was part of the hoddle gang once again and this is what i mean by a pump and dump scam he got his followers excited while selling his own crypto back at the same time in total over 800 ,000 with sold by ksi over a few days in these two tweets according to zack xbt now as a quick aside if you're wondering or skeptical of the fact that influencer tweets can have any kind of effect on a token price or volume i whipped up a chart for you showing volume of xcad during the days when ksi tweeted you can see that trading volume spiked millions of dollars on those days which in part were some of his followers putting money in as he sold today the price of xcad has plummeted from 3 $3 to about $1 now as always with such large allegations i wanted to be sure to reach out to ksi to give him a chance to explain these large accusations after all i didn't find this zach did so i reached out to ksi over twitter and he gave me the following statement hey bro i mean i'm still a hoddle gang lmao sold some profit as well as my own money to put into luna thinking i would profit more to buy back more xcad and took a l still fully believe in xcad the ability to earn from watching content honestly you should talk to redacted he's very excited about this project i never left crypto i've just been watching it from the shadows it's kind of hard to leave when you've invested so many years into it so that's his statement he then shared a personal account screenshot showing that he does have some xcad still held but while that's an interesting fact and an interesting explanation it doesn't really change the core accus ation of whether he pumped and dumped his fans and i thought it was interesting ksi didn't deny the crypto wallet was his or that he made that amount of money he's just telling us well i'm still huddling some of it just 800,000 of it i sold now to be honest i don't buy this explanation for a second but i kind of was feeling like i had to leave the story there it felt like a one-off scam that i talk about on my new side channel coffeezilla extras but the story would die there but then i got another message mage which changed everything from zach he said i have one more ksi example with a different coin turns out on march 20th 2021 ksi tweeted this two nft coins i'm very bullish on super and n any other nfts i should look at now normally when you're bullish on a coin you buy that coin but that's not what ksi did see right after he tweeted that 6 hours later he sold $174,000 worth of earn token and then 4 hours later sells another $174,000 now if that isn't a textbook pump and dump i don't know what is he tweeted that's the pump within 24 hours he sells $348,000 that's the dump it couldn't be more clear or so i thought because i asked ksi about this and that's where things got a bit muddy he says i don't really remember the details of every transaction i made these were coins i put my own money in thinking they would do well i would listen to what people said on twitter and just follow stuff i invested in doge etc i didn't have malicious intent in trying to scam i was new to crypto so i was excited putting money in random things and trying to chase the pumps and ultimately lost heavily i hope people didn't take advice or tweets as gold because looking back at my track record i was effing dog i wish i was an evil genius that would pump and dump at the right time because then at least people would say that i had some wit about me reality is i was just at crypto and that's basically ksi defense he was dumb he was bad at crypto but is that true well he says he put in $2 million of his own money and lost it all in the end he says quote i made zero profit on crypto in the end i lost it all on luna look i haven't seen his accounts maybe that's true either way even if he is bad or dumb with crypto i i just it doesn't explain the pump and dumps like telling people you're bullish and then selling is not explained by i was new i was dumb and i said as much i said i'm just trying to understand why you traded the opposite way that you were saying on twitter and ksi replied this because i thought i was getting trolled honestly every time i tweeted something the opposite would happen on the market so i decided to tweet the opposite of what i was actually doing and still took an l so just to be clear ksi's story that he's going with is that he thought the market was against him so he publicly said one thing while privately secretly doing the opposite which is kind of the definition of a pump and dump when you promote that to a big audience you say you're going to buy to your followers while secretly selling whether or not it's a successful pump and dump whatever pump and dump that's what it is now look i understand that people are going to have conflicting ideas of whether this was malicious or not and i think it's going to entirely depend on whether you think ksi's story makes sense i'm just trying to provide full context while also giving you my opinion on that which is that i don't really buy that he had no clue that tweeting one thing would positively affect the price in his favor meanwhile though while i was confronting ksi i heard a final response from zach xbt which i think moved the needle a bit he said i found another example see on may 11th 2021 ksi crypto tweeted this is about to explode only moments later though he sold $25,000 didn't buy it which i get it it's a relatively small amount but it furthers that same pattern of behavior it's just a matter of what you think that behavior was if you ask me i think ksi tried to use his influence to move the market for himself in crypto through a few pump and upums he may have lost all his money eventually in a ponzi scheme but that does not make what he did okay in fact i think it's fair to say that a lot of his followers we saw that you know he influenced millions of dollars in trading volume went into some coins that are now doing very poorly but ultimately i think the true piece of cosmic irony for ksi here though is that he would have gotten away with all of this no one would have known about any of it if he just hadn't logged back into twitter for one last spin at the slot machine
