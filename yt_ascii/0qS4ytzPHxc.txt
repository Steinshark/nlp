like true beauty sort of seduces you toward the good it pulls you deeper into reality but then there's this in these more it because you if you look at how pl was like you know get rid of those artists because they because they can make you think something's beautiful even if it's not right they're tricksters they can become propagandists and in scripture you can see that applied arts are from cain and they bring about the flood so there's this very dark aspect of what of what they can bring but then god is constantly saving that which is fallen this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic [applause] world hello and welcome to climbing on mount sophia i'm excited today to be here with jonathan pajo and david shindler again jonathan pajo of course is the leader of the symbolic world movement which is a youtube channel and a website and i think a printing press now as well right yeah we just started a yeah we just started a press like a few months ago with our with our fairy tale series so yeah yeah so a lot of wonderful things going on there i mean so many resources wonderful people a part of that whole movement and then jonathan also is a orthodox icon carver an artist and today we'll be referencing some things from his video on contemporary art i'll put a link here and then david schindler of course writes under the pen name dc schindler professor of anthropology and metaphysics i think at john paul 2 institute and then author of many great works so david and i have been doing a series on david's book freedom from reality and so i'll post a link to that here as well but i was hoping today that we could talk about art art in relation to beauty and how that looks in the modern world today and how that's part of the diabolical separation from the world that we're all experiencing so i'll throw those out there and any thoughts that come up initially well ken maybe we could start with the question that right before we began that you would raise and we hadn't gotten into and i suspect jonathan would have some really interesting things to say about this but you mentioned that the distinction between tech in the in the ancient sense and modern technology that you know shares a root but there's a there's a very different sensibility implied i mean maybe that would be a good starting point it's you know it's not immediately art in the sense of painting and sculpture but but certainly related to that with that seemed like a good a fruitful yeah i think it's a great place to start it's like my actually my intuitions about art part of my intuitions about art actually came from reading haider's questions on technology and and then reading ananda kumas swami's work on art as well those are the kind of the two sources that brought me to think differently or to realize just how differently the ancients thought about art and in some ways the sense that they had the idea of idea or aist and then tech was applied basically it was just the idea of applying things to the world right so you you have these principles you have these patterns and then you apply them to reality and that application is is tech and so that's actually my that's been my approach to art in general and to technology so to me i don't totally see a difference between the two it's it's just that and poesis for for example like even poesis comes from the word making there's this idea of like you know you have these you invoke the muse and then you make things with you you actually create things and that's been my approach to it and the reason why i take that approach is because i think that that's also what's there in scripture it's it's closer to the way that the arts or applied making is in scripture and it also makes it it removes it from this weird idea of expressing yourself or of like creating beauty you know art for art sake or beauty for beauty's sake and all of these types of of terms that came about with the romantics and the later later artist and rather brings it back to the idea of you know it's just it's a so anasi for example says the art remains in the artist right art is actually a skill art is not a thing art is a skill that the artist has to apply knowledge and principles to the world and to and to make things that are artifacts that have a purpose in life and in society and so technology does that as well and the arts the ancient arts that's that's what they did right the seven the the they say the seven arts or however you want to talk about it that's how how they did it and it's just a different way of understanding which which also breaks that weird duality we have between between the idea of like pure tech in the sense of just gains in efficiency which is the way that we seem to think about about technology today it's just increasing of power basically and the idea of art in the sense of expression of something and so to me they're actually the they're actually ultimately the same and when we separate them and we have something like fine art or music or creative arts and then we have pure tech which is just an increase in means then we have a monstrosity we end up with we monstrosities on both sides yeah i want to invite you all to the very first symbolic world summit over 3 days we will finally meet in real time in real space and everyone from this little corner of the internet will be there to explore the theme of reclaiming the cosmic image of course i will be speaking but there will also be martin shaw who is an amazing mythographer father steven d young of lord of spirit fame there will be richard roland from the universal history series vesper stamper nas kotar and neil deg grade that you've all seen on my channel here and there for entertainment we have everyone's favorite apocalyptic band the one and only dirt po robins this event will be the chance of a lifetime to capture and embrace our current moment so join us from february 29th to march 2nd 2024 in tarpon spings florida visit the symbolic world.com sls summit for more information and i will see you there yeah no that's that's that's great to pick up on a couple of things there i'd like to tease out a little bit more distinction with technology but i'll come to that in a moment this idea of tech being an application it seems to me there's there's another dimension that's that i think is in the spirit of what you were saying but it's formulated a little bit differently and that is that this again would be a hiigaran sort of sense that tech itself is a kind kind of knowing it's it's a distinctive kind of knowing that that would be different from conceptual knowing that then gets applied like in a second moment you have an idea an inspiration and you take that idea and then you try to translate it into a thing through you know paint or or yeah tone or color that there's there's another kind it's kind of interesting and this is i you know i i i'm not an artist like you are i i i do enjoy painting i used one point i thought i might become but that never never materialized but my experience of of art and this seems pretty common is that you often discover the idea as you as you work with it that it's not it's not that you first have an idea and then you apply it but that somehow the very idea itself comes to expression in a way that can take the artist himself by a certain surprise that that it's still a manifest it's not just self-expression i mean some people will interpret that as just being you know arbitrary creativity it's it's it's it's still truth centered and truth grounded but it's a kind of truth that is manifest revealed and manifest in the real thing that you can then think about afterwards would would you accept no well heiger yeah heiger talks about the notion of gathering right so it's like the way in which it's an unveiling is that is that it it gathers elements together towards and it reveals it ends up revealing a purpose as you're gathering them together so you could you can understand it as an emergent from an emergent perspective and from a kind of top down perspective where from an emerging perspective you have all these things coming together in love and then ex then manifesting an a hidden reason as they come together together and then the other way to understand it is from the top down perspective which is it's like it's like a head finding a body or a husband finding a wife it's like an idea coming into the world and and joining itself with a with matter and so i think both of those are are perfectly a perfectly good ways to explain it yeah but if you if you think about like there'll always be so let's say even the the way you talk about it which is which is there's this modern it's a more modern way of understanding art which is this kind of like a you know improvisational approach which then reveals a pattern that you hadn't thought about haven't thought about right it's almost like it's a form it's almost like a form of divination it's like you cast the bones and then you watch the bones move and then you see oh oh it's like there's something there there's some pattern then you start to draw the lines between the pattern and then you kind of are surprised to find what what is being revealed so in that sense that type of art making is is closer to divination in that sense but then you even that you would need to have the art right so if you if you can't do it yeah then you're not going to do anything right you you can kind of see it but if you can't if you don't have the skill if you don't have that art in you then even if you have this revelation of some pattern that you hadn't thought about you need the skill so it's it's still even if you're it's an emergent thing you also need that top- down control in order to to make it happen i yeah i that that's i would absolutely agree with with that that this idea that you're sort of generating order simply from below is incoherent ultimately it never really works out there's always going to be a kind of a a a from above dimension i i think that's the modern artist did everything to attain pure so i don't know if you know the process it's fun to do like i don't know if you know the process of a ki which was which came about with the with the surrealist which was what you would do is you take a piece of paper you'd fold it and then we would each start i would start a drawing and then i would leave just a little bit of the drawing left so that you can see but you can't see what i did and then you would continue the lines and make something and then leave a little bit for the other person and at the end you unfold it yeah and then you have a a kind of hybrid monster but then what you're surprised that you realize that often there's actually a connection between a surprising connection that happens between between the different elements yeah and that's why i mean that it's closer to to the way that ancients would have done divination that's similar yeah i i'd want to try to steer between that because i that there's no governing idea there has to be a governing idea or else or else you know i i think i don't know if you recall the tv series from a few years ago lost that kind of and i you know i i remember at a certain point really getting into that uh it was it was absolutely compelling but at a certain point the compellingness of it just disappeared yeah and i think that was when you know the audience collectively began to realize that they didn't know where they were going they know where they're going they're like making it up you know episod by episode and i mean immediately the drama disappears it no longer has it's no longer mysterious or there has to be a governing idea what what i what i would want to avoid on the on the flip side is somehow that you you've got the concept that the that the artwork is simply a a physical translation of a concept there there's it contributes more than that somehow right there has to be a there has to be a play between between the two i always i think like i've been thinking a lot about beauty i've think been thinking a lot about beauty because on the one hand you know i i remember seeing you know like that kind of platonic idea right that beauty is the is the is the expression of the infinite something like that and i always thought well that's a real interest that's a good it's a good description of beauty but then i also i realized it i had a tendency to describe beauty very much top down it's like beauty is when you see harmony beaut is when you see order beauty but i realized that actually you know what that's not true it's not it's not actually what you perceive as beauty beauty is something like harmony joined to a particular m and so and so it's like it's it's integrated it's integrated harmony into a into the contingency of a particular place a particular thing and that's when you actually perceive beauty so something that is actually too perfect and too balanced is is monstrous yeah but you need this weird this weird like this weird discussion between with the particular material space situation what ever offers and the pattern which kind of comes down and and is married to it it's like when the when the absolute shines through the particular that you see beauty you could yeah but the particular plays a part in it exactly there's no particular the absolute can't manifest itself and there's also a way in which the infinite also appears mysteriously in in an aspect of idiosyncrasy that is properly there right right like the idea of you know this weird idea like if you read in this in the in the pro i think it's in the proverbs where it says you know the it says something like the gray hair like the person's white hair is is his glory and it's it's a beautiful image because on the one hand it's like your hair turns white so it turns into light but at the same time it's you dying and it's like actually your dying is your glory and so it's like as you settle into a kind of particularity that's what kind of shows your particular glory yeah so it's it's an interesting but it but it obviously can be disconnected from from the universal but it has to it has to it has both at the same time yeah you know al along these lines there's there's a the the best most compelling interpretation of beauty that i have read is from a thinker i think needs more attention on this matter and that's fre schiller and you mentioned play it's he he he has this definition on on the surface the definition doesn't sound like much but when you when he explains it it really becomes fascinating he he says that beauty is the appearance of freedom and what he means by that is is jonathan in a way it's a it's another way of saying the very point that you made so he said you know imagine just a a straight a straight line and a a curving line the curving line he says is more beautiful than the straight line and and why is that the straight line represents a kind of an order that imposes itself sort of irrespective of the particularity of the matter there it just mechanically is there and and in a way allows allows nothing of the of of the matter to to to appear the curved line is is the triumph of order but it's a triumph of order precisely in the the particularity and the constraints of the matter where the very constraints of the matter become a means of expressing the the freedom so you get this incredible marriage use that word marriage i think is beautiful here of form and matter the from above the from below the concept and the the the the practice the i mean all these things the yeah universality in the particular some that's beauty is where it all really comes together yeah i think so it it i think that the it's interesting like the i think one of the most satisfying images for a human person and that's why it's so universal is a is a straight line with a curvy line around it i think that that's actually i think we're i think it's like hardcoded into us yeah when we see that that line dna you might say yeah exactly like when you see that you see that caducus kind of structure it's i don't know as i remember being very young and just drawing that over and over just because there was some weird aspect of it that was very very satisfying yeah and i think that when you think of those two together like so christ on the cross is a good example where where christ is usually actually drawn as a as a serpentine figure on the cross but you have that you have the straight then you have the curve which comes and makes and softens it and makes it a you know and is also a kind of dying at the same time it's not it's not it's like there's no going there's no two ways about it it's like there's a a kind of letting go right of that of the of the straight but also attached to it it's like it's weird the cross obviously is hard to describe because there's too many things going on in there but i that my intuition so what you know i remember a good example contraposto is a good example right so if you have a basic simple contraposto that's not too excessive then you really get that beauty but if you have someone standing in front of you that is just like a pillar right with their two feet like together and just like obvious it's not a natural position nobody stands like that but you would feel ve it would be very eerie actually to face someone that way and so the idea is is is to find the contraposto and if you look at christian art there's almost like a good v there's a visual discussion about reigning in roman contraposto but not eliminating it so if you look at byzantine images the the the usual the roman contra paso for those who don't know whato is yeah yeah i don't know contra paso is when you is when you have a figure that stands and then is unbalanced has their leg out in one way so that their body curves okay if you look at a baroque image you'll have extreme contraposto right like kind of like that where whereas if in the in the roman times it was that's how you would always show a figure right it would be like one foot out and one foot straight and it would make the whole body curve like an s and if you look at at renaissance the renaissance would like recaptured the roman contraposto there's something kind of there's something almost erotic about just the the it depends how much you exaggerate it yeah yeahh and so like imagine a woman like putting her hip out kind of like sticking it out right there's something a bit seductive about it and then the byzantines kept contraposto so if you look at a byzantine image you'll see the figures actually are not standing straight a lot of people would say oh the medieval as in icon when you say byzantine like a like a byzantine icon the figures aren't standing straight in the the late modern period in like after world war ii some people started discussing medieval art and started saying oh medieval art is heretic it's straight it's everything is brought back to like a kind of but it's not true if you look at medieval images they do have a contraposto they do they are standing off but the question is how much how much is enough how much is too much yeah and so how do you find that curve in the body which is not overtly erotic but suggest enough particularity for it to be incarnate and human human and beautiful yeah yeah no that's i mean again that's why what i like about schiller's notion is that order is not simp l eliminated or betrayed it's expressed but it's expressed in this precise this unique way that that that in fact makes use of the constraints so that even the constraints become an expression of free of the the inner freedom of the and i that that that sort of thing so so you know imagine you know you can think of a garden or you can you can think of the you know we find certain movements of animals graceful and other you know think of a frog leaping through the air it's i mean there's nothing graceful about it you know if you watch it in slow motion it's there's something ridiculous about it and you see that the the weight of the thing is overpowering its own ability you know so it's it's violently reacting to it by launching itself in the air but but you know it's off center and off balance and just you know as opposed to a you know a gazelle leaping or something and there or a bird flying yeah there you see that that there's a there's a there's the bird has a weight you know it's light but it's it has a weight but that very weight is what gives it the strength to move itself up and and and there's no there's nothing in it that doesn't contribute to so get nothing in it including its constraints including the things that that in a way could from another perspective be oppressive those very things become an expression of its own inner life andity that's and we just find that beautiful to see because the thing that worries me when i see the when i hear like an expression of or how do you say an appearance of freedom yeah the freedom in appearance freedom in appearance is in manifestation right is the i mean i'm sure i'm hoping it i'm sure he didn't mean that but it's like because we see artists that made that move right but did it in a a kind of you could say icon clastic manner right right so you find i mean to yeah to to qualify he doesn't mean freedom in the sense of like arbitrary power to choose right yeah you're meaning freedom in the sense of that of freedom as as a responding to the call of the good more than than freedom as an assertion of oneself that's right as an order in the art world what you have in the 20th century is people who declare you know without thinking twice that that art for art's sake yeah and so what we want is to we want to liberate ourselves from arts imprisonment to particular crafts or to particular ideologies or whatever so i just reread portrait of the artist as a young man and you see right the the the narrative arc of that is that joyce has to free himself from religion free himself from his family free himself from from his nation in order to become an artist that can focus now on beauty as if beauty expresses itself outside of these constraints and outside of these frames yeah right fly past those nets he says yeah no that's that's that's it's a very different i mean that that's why you realize these these questions about what beauty is in involve i mean a a fundamental interpretation of the of the meaning of the world the meaning of being you know it's not just a question of taste yeah the meaning of order and and and speaking of the meaning of order i i don't know if you're familiar with christopher alexander if you he he's he's expresses some of these things really i find in a really compelling way that you know this the the the contrast to art for arts sake would be this notion of the integration of of life and art this is a principle you talk about in that that one video but but a healthy integration where there's you know there's nothing that beautiful that's not useful and nothing useful that's not beautiful and you know you you you don't have like mechanistic use on the one hand and then try to add superficially onto it completely meaningless ornamentation to to to sort of heal the the violence of the of the you know of the mechanical world exactly yeah to heal the heal the vience that's a beautiful way of saying it i think that that's exactly the that's the the good diagnostic of what happened in in the 20th century is that art and it what it did is it also made everybody ultimately alienated because the the art that was born the high art that was born out of the the modern period became so abstract and so difficult that it left everybody behind and so nobody really ended up caring so i mean let's let's say it like james joyce portrait of the artist of as a young man is actually really fun to read it's beautifully written and it's amazing but read fegan's wake and you just want to pull your hair out at every page because it's just it's just inaccessible to people it's just a comp i mean it's it's dense and it's and it's full of of patterns and numerical symbolism and it's all that but it's like it's impossible to read you know and there there's a connection between this is something i've been thinking about uh recently the the marginalization of art and and even philosophy from the the public square you know i mean it used to be the case that the the thinkers and the artists were figures of authority of a certain sort and they spoke right at the in the center of the of the public square and they what they said and what they made then gave ordering to life there was there was something that that communicated itself in terms of the the public horizon but now you know we have this completely abstract sense of what politics is on the one hand and the in the public sphere is again sort of a mechanical order that has nothing to do with human life and then then we have to in a way champion these extreme expressions of life and subjectivity on the side and then you get this strange dialectic between the two yeah where nobody is and and then the the the arts that are available to the public spa public square are basically just like you know like a hit of cocaine like they're just just basically like just the pornography yeah it's basically pornography it's like it's just a beat you know a beat that you dance to or like you know a lit up advertisement that you look at it's like it's like everything has been reduced to to immediate pleasure and to mechanistic to mechanistic to to mechan kind of mechanize cold reality so we don't have the you know and that's why like that's why i tell people go to church one of the reasons obviously i want people to go to church for their own spiritual life but for their own salvation but there's also the idea that the church is one of the only places left in the world where you sing for a reason yeah right where you where you move for a reason where you could have beauty for a reason and that you can be inside and participate and that we all are in this dance and it used to be that all society had some aspect of that dance to it but it's broken down so much that there are few few places except for maybe your home your family and the church or that is still accessible to us yeah you know it makes me think about you brought up the notion of seduction before when you were talking about the contra paso and it seems like like true beauty sort of seduces you like in in the socratic sense of seduction like it seduces you toward the good s it pulls you deeper into reality but then there's this like in these more just in the bible but also in kind of greek greek mythology and ancient thinking it's always a dual it's a dual thing it's not it's not it's not clean it's not just simply there's a there's a there's a healthy suspicion towards it because you if you look at how plato was like you know get rid of those artists because they because they can make you think something's beautiful even if it's not right they they're they're they're tricksters they're they're they're propag they can become propag propag propagandists and in scripture you can see that the applied arts are are from cain and they bring about the flood so there's this very dark aspect of what of what they can bring but then god is constantly saving that which is fallen he's constantly kind of covering the the elements so man develops technology develops cities and god's like all right you know and then he's like okay well i'll give you a pattern for the tabernacle you know and then i'll give you you then will found jerusalem and we'll have so it's like there's this covering of the of the but it's always duel even though even if and the the bronze serpent is a great example because the bronze serpent in the story of the bronze serpent you get the two right it's like god tells moses put up the bronze serpent and this will this will become like an image that everybody can look at and that it'll heal the it'll heal the nation and then later in the bible it's like cut it down burn it because it's become an idol yeah the very same object yeah i i i like how you said plato's concern that that that these artists can make something that look beautiful that isn't i think that that formulation is really crucial because i would want to hold on to the idea that it's not that beauty is morally ambiguous and there's good no it's art that's more of the ambiguous but not yeah right right no but that's a really crucial point because i think people miss that i mean that that in fact beauty itself and i think one of the reasons that it's as you say it's not clean it's not sort of obvious is i like to say that that beauty has something of an invitational character it's sort of it's it welcomes and opens up and invites but that you know that appeals to freedom on the on the on the recipient side one has to respond properly to it and and because one has to respond properly to it there's built into that the possib possibility of of betrayal of taking it interpreting it falsely taking it as kind of immediate gratification so i i think you know there's no such thing as impure beauty in fact i mean beauty always even in impure cases there's there's a glimmer of something that's true that can in fact lead one out of the impurity yeah there's a crazy story from the desert fathers of these monks that are walking down the road and then all of a sudden this this woman young woman you know like naked on a on a i think she on a donkey or something like walking towards them and all the monks are like just diverting their eyes like don't look at it and the one this one old monk is just looking at her like kind of and then when they go by all the other monks like why are you looking at her really she was so beautiful yeah and it was just like for him he had it's like he was beyond the desire it was just he was seeing a beautiful creature of god because it's always just well for most of us that's probably best not that way but it's just like which side of it you're on almost like can can the arrows that that because i think of that in like the problem of the erotic right this problem of the erotic in a downward sense right like i'm trying to consume i'm trying to have i'm trying to take versus aros in a higher sense that this is becoming way for me yeah yeah i mean that's that's i mean and it's not it's not that os is two-faced or something but that that that aos in principle is a call to what's higher but it's a call that that can be falsely interpreted or betrayed i mean i think that's but i mean the the the the interesting thing and this is you know pl plato is so fascinating on this you know the the good jonan you were talking about how modern art doesn't speak to people pe it speaks only to experts you know and then and then the masses chris alexander is really good on this there's a kind of the masses then sort of go along with it because the experts tell them that this stuff is beautiful even though them makes them feel sick or or anxious you know when they at it that that you know goodness there's the idea of the good has a certain kind of inaccessibility and you know kind of a perfection that might make it seem a transcendence might make it seem out of reach but there's there's not there's no human being on earth that doesn't respond to beauty you know yeah truth we c can we can we can ignore goodness we can but everybody responds be there's a c there's a you know if you think of to to use a kind of cryst ogical image that you know beauty in a way is goodness leaving its transcendence in order to enter into the very depth of the of the material the flesh you know the incarnation to the very ends and and and that that place able to sort of speak and call one back up there there's something really profound about the the christian understanding of that i think i think so in in the book of revelation the image of the heavenly jerusalem is is one of my favorite ones to kind of understand the relationship between between tech and and let's say human civilization and its relationship to god and so there one of the descriptions of the heavenly jerusalem it says that all the nations bring their glories into the city and it says that all the kings offer their glory to into into the city and so the idea is that all these externals right they they have to be offered up and that's the way for them not to become dangerous right it's like like you said it's like the aeros if the aeros is transparent and aeros pulls you through things into the presence of god then it's then that's the right that's the right way to to to to deal with it but the problem of course is that because it offers certain pleasure then it can seduce you to stay at the level of the appearance or to stay at the level of the first you know and so i i like the way that the church fathers that well the the the the the herm the the the not the desert father but like the the the monks in the filocalia how they talk about sayic spir hetic fathers like this the spiritual tradition in terms of because it's because falia means the love of of of beauty bea yeah but then in the text they're saying they say weird things like they'll say ignore all spiritual experiences right it's like if you have a vision ignore it if you see a miracle ignore it ignore everything and you think like what a weird thing to say like why are they doing that and and you think are they against a be beatific vision are they against and you're like well obviously not because the tradition is full of them right they're not against it they're saying it's almost like if you ignore it if you don't attach yourself to it you'll actually have more of it right right and then you'll actually be you'll be gathered up higher yeah so it's not so it's like yeah you'll see miracles you'll see all that stuff just don't attend to them too much because then you lose the purpose of them being just a a kind of a pull into the higher states yeah it it's the same as the monk walking down the road right like if it it's more obvious to everyone that there's some sort of shame associated with you know you stopping at the level of the naked woman but if you stop at the level of hey i had a great vision i had this great transcendent experience it's similar you're still doing the same thing it's just it's more acceptable yeah yeah so i i like this principle though that that doesn't mean then losing the pleasure of it i mean paradoxically and ironically it's deepened like the the example that you gave from the church fathers but in plato too you know the philosopher i i i i i wish i had the exact number he says that the the philosopher in a way compared to the one who's seeking pleasure ends up actually having something like 500 29 times the pleasure the pleasure he does the calculation yeah precisely precisely because he's he sees it in relation to its ultimate source it's origin it's its first principle yeah i'm always asking people in in some of my in my talks whether who has most the most pleasure a millionaire at a at a banquet or a monk that's eating bread and has fasted for three days it's like it's pretty sure that the monk is having more pleasure than the millionaire but he's not looking for it right he's doing he's kind of trying to avoid it but then it's it's coming to him like there's no way to avoid it this this reminds me a little bit of jesus's parable of the talents right because those guys like it's the ones that give it away that they get more of it it's like great i got i got a talent or you know now i've got two talents or whatever but every time you get it you give it back away yeah losing your life is finding it it's yeah yeah yeah yeah well that's why the question of beauty in christianity it's like it's a it's a weird and and sometimes how can i say this like i think the i'm the orthodox i think sometimes get it a little off because there's something about christianity and beauty which is paradoxical because there's a sense in which we're we're meant to see beauty in the extreme of its ugliness yeah like we're kind of asked it's almost like we're asked to to be willing to go to the end of what we consider to be pain and suffering and ugliness and all these things and to and to and to have and that there's some glory there's some hidden beauty in that and obviously it's dangerous because i don't want people to think this is a kind of masochistic thing i don't think it is but you know there is something about about the cross which is right weird like it's a terrible thing but then it's also so we say you know the lifegiving cross we say that that it's the the that christ on the cross is creating the world that he's the garden of eden that he's the you know that he's a flower like all these images that were used even in the middle ages of the rose on the cross or different types of of images and the same thing with martyrdom and relics and all of these these things that happen in christianity which is this strange paradox of of beauty in the in the least expected place or beauty in the in the so that's that's a that's one to integrate the uh there's a benedict the 16th has a an address to the ministers of culture it's a it's available online it's just a short address that he he gave but he he speaks about that paradox and the christian appropriation of the ancient sense of beauty and aros and how it it ir ires this paradoxical character precisely in the cross it really is moving you know i i don't i don't want to be sort seem obsessed with plato here but even expect you to be pl has a has a an anticipation of this i mean it's it's it's amazing that he you know he presents socrates himself sort notoriously ugly the those socrates you know as when he opens up you know in the symposium and you see that the he's like the the the statues that have the statues of gods inside of statues of gods and and when when socrates you open them up you see these glories that are are are you know it's spellbinding so there's there's something about that the the paradox of a more radically transcendent and and glorious beauty in the in the most extreme i think i think precisely because of the you know augustine says that that one of the things that constitutes beauty is is contrast and i i think we all find things like paradox striking for that reason that that um i'm gonna actually use that as a way to tie into an earlier point that we made right in the beginning of the conversation you know un unity and difference that we might think that that collecting different things under a unified idea is is the essence of beauty and that that's and there's something really true about that but there's also something about the differentiating of unity that's also beautiful and i think in something like paradox and contrast and then you know the the the ultimate example is the the the glory of the lord as hunor from bazar would say in the cross yeah there you have what would seem to be an a an absolute difference an absolute difference you know move moving all the way to nothing suddenly itself reveals itself to to to be the deepest unity there's something about that that's that becomes unspeakably beau and it's and you have to avoid you have to avoid the sat mass i mean right one can reading it's also because the because like if as as an artist i think as an artist and someone who's interested in art it's the kind of question you have to ask yourself because so let's say if you look at francis bacon as a painter let's say he's a good example where you know his most one of his most known works is is called crucifixion and it's like a it's like these broken monsters really is what's going on in that image and the question is what is so what's the difference right so it's the same like for example i'll give another example i thought like i thought that mil gibson's passion was over the top like i like mil gibson and i like his movies but that movie i just i watched it and i thought that it was indulging in it was indulgent there you go it was indulging in violence in a way that i thought was was not useful but not for some a lot of people had a different reaction to it but it's like and so if i look for i look for example at like a late like kind of spanish or like mexican crucifixes and you see christ you know his his knees are flayed and you know it's like he's got he's he's just like his his whole body is just ripped apart and it's like this is the crucifix in the church right it's it's so i i i like what's the balance how do we find the balance where we're showing the scandal of the crucifixion but we're we're also trying not to indulge our fascination for for something that is you know dark fascinations let's say for death right right and it's the same with music too right no these are these are delicate matters and require real prudence and spiritual discernment i mean because there's a drama in this you you know it's problematic you simply rule certain things out it's problematic if you kind of automatically affirm them there's there's a there's a real discernment is the best word that that is essential at every moment yeah yeah there's also like a shock like there's a there's a sense of shock that is dangerous in the realm of beauty because it's it's it's like it's the popcorn version of yeah of beauty because it creates intense experiences but it usually fades very quickly and so you can create you know it's like watching a horror movie right you can create intense emotion aesthetic intense emotions in people but those are not you know they're not very deep they don't they don't transform transform you yeah that's the word yeah yeah and so it's like i it's important especially if we're we're in a world now that we're kind of struggling i think a lot of the churches are are struggling to figure out h how to deal with the question of beauty and the question of music the question of participation you know i i have weirdly enough like i i have protestant pastors who want to meet with me and talk to me about how do we find this this balance between the entertainment kind of flashy light show rock and roll culture that so many churches have fallen into and then yeah sorry i don't want to interrupt go go ahead go ahead well just just i mean there there you you you you see that's that's beauty that's being used as a a kind of strategy for for recruitment or or we're going to we're going to use this to communicate a message and that's you know become technology in a way yeah right there you go we we need to come back to that technology question at some point yeah it be it's it's sort of a technological use as opposed i would say as opposed to something that that would be like a genuine tech that would be an interesting way into that that like so would you mean by by technological use is something like pure pure utility like yeah i would i for for me it's where you separate means from ends and you you kind of perfect means as a kind of a a a power an instrument it's increase in power that's that can be then used indifferently so it's it's defined in neut as neutral yeah in itself and then it can be used indifferently for good or for evil as opposed to tech was always understood as as doing something useful i mean so it was always it was always a means that's appropriate to the ends that it seeks to yeah i would i would push i'd push back a little bit on the idea that it that it used to be understood as completely useful that there's a there's this weird tradition about for example the esus right so esus is the creates these this medicine and the way he does it is that he takes blood from the right side of the gorgon so he he takes this dead gorgon and he takes blood from the right side and and then out of that he creates the medicine and what is suggested obviously by that myth is that the blood from the left side of the gorgon is the poison right so you have the venom of the snake and then you have the the pharmacon the pharmacon yeah and so the question of the pharmacon i think was already quite and if you read in the in u my mind in plato's when he talks about writing what's the name of the diog yeah the fedra he has he seems to have he seems to understand that which is what kind of jumps on in his text but he seems to understand the duality of of externality the duality of application the problem of that yeah yeah yeah i mean i i the the duality but i i it seems to me that there's a difference between so there's always you know one of the the best examples too is is is uh sophocles i think it's the the second chorus i believe from the antony i want to say heiger made a lot of this but this this celebration of men's ability but it's a celebration that very subtly ironically you know with that kind of sophoclean tragic irony you realize there's something also awful about it and and and destructive and terrible but it's it's that those things are mixed together i mean i i think that that that that is always there i mean from the beginning with the with the the prometheus you know in a way that the arts are are divine but they're they're stolen rather than divine gifts in fact i mean there there so there's there's always a kind of ambiguity so i i think that that's always there but i i for me technology it's not just that it's more ambiguous or something i think it's it's of a very a modern technology is of a very different nature it's a it's it's actually a different kind of thing well it's it's an extreme it's an extreme version of what tech used to be even though it used to be you know in more ancient times they would have been more integrated just but people could perceive through even their integration the possibility of the of the dangers but now we have something like you know a microchip yeah that will increase your processing power by so much yeah you know all for a medical machine or for a missile it doesn't matter like it it's just this it's just increase in power and it can be used to whatever pointed in any direction possible yeah people see that as a good though people see just increas in power or they say that it it can be good right so well that's the problem they they once we get the power then we'll figure out how to use it that's and they're there's a there's a disorder that's built in but canen you're you keep wanting to jump in here i don't know if if we're cutting your oh no well i kind of got distracted there because that just that brings us back to this whole notion of freedom i mean as as as soon as like as soon as freedom becomes takes the place of goodness as the ultimate ts right as soon as that becomes our goal and becomes defined as power to make choices right then as soon as that's i i feel like it has to do with like why you're doing the thing if you're doing the thing because it's actually ordered to a real end that's really good right like if if you're if you're trying to build a house like it's actually ordered to something and so you're going to you're going to build a hammer that has a use in relation to something beyond it versus you know just building a bigger hammer just so you can have it because you never know when you might need it but there's even a trickery like in terms of increase in power especially now because we still live in a kind of post-christian world there's like a weird trickery that's that's put up to us which is that things the technologies that are the most destructive will be the most destructive they're often presented to us at first first as beneficial so it's like elon musk let's put chips in your brain and that'll people can walk i mean think about it like i mean are you gonna say no to that that right how can you say no to helping people it's a total bailey and it's like it's the same with with so many of these these especially these crazy new technology especially the biotechs it's like it's like oh you know all this stem cell research is great because you know all these diseases we can cure and it's like you don't see that there's also some very dark things coming down the line in terms of of transhumanism and transformations of humans into who knows what well that's yeah no and i i think that that problem is a profound and subtle one that requires real reflection because i you know i think we we come to such quick judgments but the the the the the the the supposed neutrality you get the you get the neutral technology and then you know then you get get afterwards the exhortation to use it for good ends but you know we can't help that there's going to be some people i mean but the very neutrality of it is already a departure from reality it it it's it ends up substituting that it creates i mean this is why i you know i use the the language of the diabolical there it creates a kind of a substitute for an engagement with reality that then can try to justify itself by pointing to all of these discreet good uses but that but in a way that's there's there's something really deceptive about the the whole thing and so you can under then you look at the if you look at the at the menite communities or the amish and you you look at how they do it and it's interesting because people always think that the amish or these communities that they're against technology but they're not actually they have they always all they do is they take every time they someone they're presented with technology they ask themselves what effect will it have on our community and then they integrate it or they don't depending on what effect it'll have on their community yeah that's an interesting approach you know obviously on the one hand it makes them constantly in danger of vanishing but on the other hand it might make them more resilient than us in the long term when we're all when we're all gone the amish will still be there no it is it is you know in fact my wife and i just took our kids to a a a menonite community a couple weeks ago to himn sing that they did talk about yeah these four four voice i grew up there that that was my upbringing oh is that right it was but but yeah i mean that's that was the lites too i mean they get sort of a bad rap and people misunderstand they weren't they weren't against technology either they just said that technology is good in so far as it helps humanity and it's bad when it stops doing that that seems to me an eminently reasonable now one can debate about where that line is but it's a reasonable judgment yeah and it seems to me yeah there's there's there's we need to recall it i mean yeah but it's too late now because and this the ai question is the one that is exposing all of this radically which is that you they you know the this famous poll that they put across the people that are developing ai and a large chunk of them believe that there's a chance that it will destroy humanity it's like well what that it'll destroy all just destroy humanity completely and the question is how is it that they're still doing it like what's going how do you go to work in the morning there but there because they think that it's inevitable yeah and so if we don't if they don't if i don't don't do it somebody else is going to right and and right well and this like this brings up the question to me always is like it's probably once a month that i sit and really think honestly about ditching a smartphone and going back to a flip phone and ultimately i haven't done that because there's it would basically it would disrupt my life enough that i won't do it but i mean when it comes to personal application like i don't know what what to make of this sort of question like where do we stop like if i don't if i don't participate with ai am i just jumping off the boat you first first of all have you tried chad gbt i've minimally amazing like it's like you have your own research assistant like full-time research assistant that's what i had it i had to analyze all all the videos on my youtube channel and i asked it you know what how what would you talk about you know what would you say ken ken lowry's doing with climbing mount sophia and what it gave me back was significantly more thorough and profound i think than i mean what i could have what i could have put together in you know half an hour of typing i i have to say somebody sent me a a a a chat gpt little essay on one of my books just to see what i would would think of it you know and i was astonished first of all that that it was as sophisticated but i but i have to say i i quite honestly had the experience that i often have reading some of my grad school grad student papers where you you see that they're saying things that they that they heard you say in class and they can put them together in interesting ways but that they never really got the point no that's why they're your research assistant that's why is not don't want it to write for you but you can use as a research assistant it's a it's quite astounding but i like i i can see it like i'm not you know my it's weird because the first time i used chg pt it lied to me the first time oh really you don't know that right i mean it totally lied to me and then about what like what happened it was oh so i i would my my son had been using it and he said you got to try this i'm like and i was being just like a grumpy old man so like like fine whatever i'll try it and so i just one evening i i logged into to the chat gpt and i and i asked him if he knew about about st christopher because that's obviously what i was gonna ask him about and if if he knew that st christopher was a doghe headed man and first he was like no he's a giant and kind of argued with chad gpt for a while finally he admitted that st that st christopher is sometimes a dark-headed man but then i asked him oh i said has anybody ever written a a graphic novel about st christopher and he said yes and i'm like really interesting and then he gave me the name of two authors and the name of a book that doesn't exist wow and so then i said that book doesn't exist and he says yes it does and i said what's the isbn he gives me an isbn that doesn't exist i said i said where can i find he said you can find it on amazon you can find it on this or that i'm like can you give me a link he gives me a link that doesn't exist wow it was very weird wow yeah very strange anyways yeah well i i mean the thing is i yeah the the the i don't think we can give up on these questions i i and i and i think that the that the the the challenge that this poses i mean you know that jonathan you mentioned the the sanity of going to church and having a a genuine experience of some of these human realities that that we don't have elsewhere some that that yeah i mean this this this sounds like just sort of superficial exer but you know somehow that has to penetrate into the shape of the world too and i and i mean i you know that's i guess the big task that yeah so i the only things we i think the thing we can do is really just because there's also a certain faith that true beauty will survive you know and it's a it's not a just a how can i say this obviously there are accidents but it's not just a a kind of blank statement of faith it's also that people care about beautiful things and they then when they decide to destroy a building usually they'll destroy the nice building last they'll destroy the ugly buildings first and then so there's a sense in which beauty has a kind of evolutionary advantage right in terms of of of preservation so i and so i think that making beautiful things and beautiful art and beautiful music is a good it's a good strategy in terms of this our current situation because ultimately i think that will survive the popcorn like the the the superficial advertisement culture yeah yeah at least as an artist that's been my and also like for me it was aim high it was like okay well where is the place where this is still true and the answer was it's still church art that's the place where it's actually true it's where all of it comes together where you can make beautiful things that are integrated into people's lives integrated into and also directed towards god and directed towards the highest things and so it's it was still it seems still possible you know even i had a good friend of mine who was a he was more he a atheist and modern person and and he said he said he said he said you know what you're doing is also kind of just nostalgic it's just nostalgia it's just pasti and nostalgia and and my answer was well it's not nostalgia for the person that buys an icon for their their nephew that's getting baptized i don't know what to tell you it just isn't like if i if it gets if if i make a a chalice for a church and there's wine in it it's like there's no it's not nostalgia you can say what you want it's a real it's a real thing it's really happening yeah yeah it might seem retrograde to to you but it's a it's not nostalgia it's a real thing and and uh if it's genuinely beautiful we always experience genuine beauty as still alive if it's simply a repetition of an old form i mean people sense that too it's not yeah when it's too when it's too much of a i always say i actually say that i think tradition without nostalgia which is that yeah interesting learn the language from the inside and then create things you can copy at the beginning obviously you have to start by copying but once you've mastered the the the language you have to be careful not to just make pasti images yeah k 's idea of tradition is recollection forward that's a great yeah that's a great way of saying it recollection forward day yeah yeah well this may be a good a good place to to bring it bring it to a close but any final thoughts or anything you wanted to say before we close here for either of you i'd say thanks think yeah and it would be great to have another conversation yeah so hopefully i john john wanted to come to this one but he wasn't available so hopefully we can get another one on the books that would be wonderful yeah i mean i still need to have my conversation with john rei about ai because he made he made a half prophetic half scary half who knows like that video he made on ai was was profoundly surprising and disturbing and so i haven't i've been gathering up my just my thoughts to talk to him about it i would love to be in on that conversation if you do it so maybe so yeah it's it's definitely it's definitely something that he's thought a lot about and that is worth engaging with him about it because he's definitely he's not a he's coming at it with you know years and years of of thinking about these questions but it doesn't definitely doesn't come to the same conclusions i do but it's worth like i think it' be worth exploring it
