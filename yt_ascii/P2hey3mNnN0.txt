i'm about to water cool a computer but with a catch the writer who prepped the system for me has never water cooled a pc before he sought help from one of our engineers who has never water cooled a pc before and we are going to be using an utterly unique one-of-a-kind water block that is intended to cool both the cpu and the graphics card as one the cost for this madness 800 us dollars and by the time we're done possibly my sanity based on how things went last time we built a computer that is a lot of things not a sorry not a oops my bad i don't want to lie to you this doesn't make any sense hd don't think it posted it's gonna be fine don't worry don't worry don't worry about this message from our sponsor super micro introducing super micros h13 servers powered by amd's epic 9004 processors with up to a whopping 128 cores it makes you go whop get the highest core count on a single processor and blazing fast performance for memory intensive workloads click the link below and upgrade your infrastructure today meet the monoblock from billet labs the company was founded by two blokes in the uk one of whom is a professional machinist obviously and the other of which designs puzzles and luxury doodads and boy have they ever designed a puzzle for me today i mean what was the point of this i'm not trying to be a hater or anything but honestly is this really saving that much space compared to this but this is also a little bit misleading you see some of the inspiration for this clearly came from the 2013 mac pro which used a single heatsink with multiple heat generating components attached to its various sides and in much the same way we have a single water block see that right in the middle here that is going to be responsible for cooling both the gpu with this cold plate and the cpu with this one over here and while this obviously actually takes up a little bit less space unless i get special blocks that have the fittings coming out the side it would not actually be possible to build something quite as low profile although it should be noted that such blocks do in fact exist do they call it billet labs because you're going to get a big bill in the mail bill it i get it i'm just not laughing no that's not why they call it that it's because it's manufactured out of copper billet and not just any copper the entire thing even the parts that aren't responsible for cooling like this back plate are made out of c101 the purest copper they could get their hands on in theory this gives an advantage in terms of thermal conductivity in practice though they've been making water blocks out of even more exotic materials like pure silver for many years and it doesn't really do much using pure copper like this comes with some disadvantages you might have noticed that the surface is quite marred and covered in blemishes and even what appear to be etched in fingerprints that's pretty normal for raw copper and is one of the reasons that nickel plated blocks look so nice are they trying to use as much copper as possible why don't they use like a regular size black plate that's a really good question and yes that does appear to be the goal in the words of the founder for whom this is kind of a side project we're never going to be able to go toe to toe with the likes of ek water blocks in terms of being economical and making any sense so we might as well go as hard as we can the other way and hope to pick up a handful of boutique buyers apparently basically the entire inside is also machined with veins so to improve heat exchange around the whole block because this is all thermal mass little buddy boy oh okay those are some pretty finely machined little fins i mean it's no skived copper heatsink like swift tech's been doing for the last five years or whatever but very fine work but that is an unusual choice indeed instead of using a rubber o-ring they're using some kind of gasket material that i have not seen before i don't trust it that is paper thin and not only relies on the gasket material not failing but also seems to rely on the machining of the copper being absolutely perfect this is a really cool internal flow pattern though and i've got to say i wow the machining of this central block piece this piece is an insert it's just so perfectly fitted it seems to be just action fitted that i couldn't immediately tell the water comes in here okay it goes into a cavity in the middle that is sealed off with this pressure fitted slit here that's an accelerator plate that's going to blast high velocity water onto the cold plate for the cpu okay it runs through these fins it gets collected in these two bigger cavities which run all the way through to the other side going into the accelerator plate for the gpu the water runs out cools this larger plate that is going to handle cooling for anything that this other plate is connected to like ram or vrms and then is gathered here where it goes oh this one so the whole thing is in cereal whereas i thought maybe it would be in parallel in order to reduce restriction but this is going to be a very restrictive block is that is that bad it's bad if you have a bunch of other components in your loop that rely on a high flow rate for their own cooling but in this case it's the only cooling engine in the entire thing so maybe maybe it's one of those products where you go wow how did you engineer this why did you engineer this we're going to build this whole system onto that piece of acrylic because this doesn't fit into any sort of case and then we're gonna see how it runs they've sent me numbers and we're going to see if we get them they say that they can beat ek ek has their competitive advantages but they don't actually make the highest performing blocks on the market so beating ek is not the yeah it's worth a thousand dollars massive w that you might think it is and realistically a lot of water block performance these days now that it's kind of a solved problem is down to optimizing for the latest generation of cpus making sure that the cooling patch covers you know the large die of a threadripper for example it's not necessarily about engineering a better copper base anymore so depending on the cpu we install this on it could win or it could get absolutely curb stomped is this our test platform yes okay we had a different motherboard maybe we killed it oh really you guys how bad is it where is it oh i've seen worse yeah so what happened was that we had the gloves on because we were handling it rocky i told him that that's why i said sebastian you should have known i don't believe you i don't know what you guys mean oh the gloves the fibers if you get near the pins it'll catch on them and pull them out they're so they're so tiny and they're so kind of sharp we've apparently gone with a last generation 12 900 ks this should serve us very well as a heat load yeah they claim 650 watts is what this monoblock can handle okay what are you doing what you're just going in there yeah what would you expect me to do i don't know whatever the next step is i don't think it's that you got a threat you want to thread things you need to no no don't do this stop it we need to have spacers here there's washers and it's okay well then why haven't you put the spacers on yet i thought you're supposed to be helping you've done nothing so far i'm gonna play what are you doing i'm just trying to get no it's still no what are you talking about the washers have to go on what washers these or the nuts the nuts which nuts these nuts hey these are not really these nuts i set you up like that and you can't knock it down wait we don't have to take them off what did sebastian do i have too much faith in other people what are you doing hey that's a really old shirt thanks you look nice today too why don't you just sign for me like you always do i'll go away we're frauding just kidding just kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding this is very interesting look at this you thread on these standoffs see kind of wild hey is that a setup for another joke or no no you just you put on these standoffs it's kind of wild yeah huh what wild kratts you don't have children crap which way did you say these tubes went again that's the way they're supposed to go you've got to be kidding me please don't tell me the other motherboard had clearance there and you guys designed it for the other motherboard and now we're just boned we did do it on the other board on the other motherboard it did fit and the replacement motherboard it doesn't fit put sebastian's here to help so we're gonna go machine this down so we're gonna what oh no no oh what a mess you can spray it off what is the tormac juice fluid and don't forget about the metal shards though that's how i want to go out drink a bunch of tarmac juice and then put me in the mri to our credit it does look pretty clean liness how did you end up doing this i don't know he pulled an ester let's see there's multiple esters in your life polyester okay that's good more of a cotton collie blend guy myself but i still like it ltt store.com by the way it's on there and it seemed like pretty good mounting pressure as i was tightening it down it's a hard mount so they better get the tolerances exactly right but hey there's a lot of that going around with this product oh crap it's so close let's put the ram in the tormach it's not it's just like when your kid learns one word and then they're just looking for excuses to use it tomorrow no adam no no not tormach not now why not torment now tormach later no oh you got it crap do you put it backward get a shot of that look at that [laughter] all of the components here are meant to mount into a frame like on a computer case wait a second i'm not the dummy this is ddr4 this is a ddr5 board ah the other board was 10 year four okay i even checked why don't you tell me what you've done over here basically we wanted to put it all in this piece of plexi but these mount in a case right so well brackets l brackets we have a bunch of these brackets so that we can put 240 millimeter rods flanking either side have our all of our stuff mounted all taking up only marginally less space than if we had put this in a normal case with normal water we had an afternoon and that's kind of one of the issues with this product is that while it itself is very small it doesn't really work with other things it doesn't really shrink any of the other stuff that takes up a lot of space yeah like they have pictures on their instagram of like the motherboard and the block and then a pump and you're like wow that's really cool where's your power supply where's that where's all your cables but yeah this is not tight at all whoa okay guys boys boys boys boys okay who's been tightening these fittings these are not tight enough okay okay those are tight enough i am deeply worried about this whole thing oh my god this radiator doesn't even have the piece here you have to put the battery before the motherboard that's the only one the battery the battery the battery do i have to explain that water cooling systems don't need batteries the power supply man this is a cool power supply 11 hundo watts in the palm of your hand i never did power this video is definitely going to have some stuff that doesn't make it into the youtube cut subscribe to flowplane for the cutting room floor cut for all the meming and setbacks this is actually starting to come together here though lower our motherboard into place we've achieved a contrived reason to use this product [laughter] [applause] all right let's get this done this is bad no we had it it was working and everyone said it was good yeah but everyone was youtube no i also all the tubes yeah the tubes that's what i'm talking about the two you'll be mounted the wrong way you have it mounted there i'm just going the sideways all right how okay let me show you guys something amateur hour here literally though how do you put a piece of tubing there how are you gonna run how are you gonna tube that oh more more fittings no made surrounding the asylum okay where do you want these to go i have no idea this is interesting they gave us pre-cut thermal pads and i thought they would just give us strips but like i'm basically just gonna lay this on here did we bring over any other water cooling fittings or just what you guys are things in this in this bin okay show me what you got we have more fittings than this but ad102 is that 40 90 what yeah they told me this was a 3090 ti if this wasn't a 390 ti then we don't have another 39 dtr that we can take apart how the hell did we not know what gpu this thing was i thought it was a 3090 ti so we just casually had a 40 90 sitting on the shelf clearly labeled foreign and nobody knew what it was which tweedle are you and which tweedle are you tweedle one or two yeah twiddle a and tweedle one yeah to be very clear i have my moments but you guys are making me look pretty good today it's actually going on well it's trying do you want to check my work in a moment i would love to get your work one thing that's weirding me out a little bit though is that these are cooled on the corsair design and not on this one i hate to do this but i would put some thermal compound on them gpu time but okay be more careful yeah really you got thermal compound all over sorry adam oh it's me it's both of us no wait that fit before pump fit before what did we do i mean how important is this bit you know what's really funny is i think you're actually right i think we could just lop off this little bit of the pcb there's nothing there should we risk it for the biscuit oh my god save this project l brackets see how they have two mounting points i'm gonna slide it back okay so we're gonna try and line it up again here the thermal pad is supposed to go on the back of the gpu and hold the washers into place yeah the way that the holes line up that's how okay try the top left one there okay don't go too far okay i think we got this huh okay it's kind of a cool computer i kind of want to just plug it in and see if it posts before we fill it with water oh my god we don't have a power button long metal stick let's go long metal stick power activate nope warm up long metal stick yes hey yeah okay a little bit of water is cycling in now okay ccp attempts gpu attempts cpu attempts core temp 30 core die 83. is it possible that the reason it's so slow is the restricted flow of the block it's possible that's part of it but it's also pwm controlled so i can't just tell the pump go full let's go new idea we're going to turn up the fans by running cinebench it's sucking the bubbles right back in you stupid thing okay you just gotta angle it a bit let the bubbles get past it you guys mounted this 90 degrees off of where it's supposed to be yeah it's it's pumping now at least like it's it's circulating now but it's not in necessarily a good way it's just tearing up the water interesting though our gpu temps while we're doing nothing is a 70. because our cpu is just cranking out heat that actually doesn't account for that no pretty bad yeah it might be a mounting issue he's probably a mounting issue if this is what the mount looks like for us don't kid yourself unless you are some kind of epic master builder it's not going to be okay here's here's the thing though they sent us a 30 90 ti kit they said it would work with a 40 90 but they didn't know how well okay well yeah did some research for you billet labs it doesn't work that great the best case scenario for this thing is the temps are slightly better but the experience of building with it is a nightmare and the advantages over literally any other solution are negligible it's a cool concept but unfortunately i think that there are very few buyers for it with that said you know if it tickles your fancy but you're thinking yeah cool idea but maybe if it was a little more like this i wouldn't be surprised if these guys could basically make just about anything for you they've definitely got the manufacturing chops just like i've got the chops for this segue to our sponsor secret lab the world's worst kept secret chances are you've seen a secret life chair in one of our videos but did you know they make desks too don't tell anyone just kidding their magnus pro isn't your average sit to stand desk it's loaded with unique features is cable management something you dread secret lab makes it easy with a patent-pending integrated power supply column and a full length built-in cable management tray and of course the magnus pro is fully adjustable as a sit to stand desk with a sleek integrated control panel and to top it all off pun intended is a premium full metal table top so you can explore one of the greatest questions of our time magnets how do they work check out the magnus pro and all of secret lab's other offerings at the link below and 95 degrees 100 degrees turn it off quick quick off off off okay cool if you guys enjoyed this video you might enjoy the one where we you know what let's throw to the bong cooler because it was super impractical but maybe more practical than this
