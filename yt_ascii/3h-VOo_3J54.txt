so this is a paper on the downward pressure on code quality of co-pilot okay it's not very long and there's some projections for 2024 yeah we're we're getting in here yeah we're we're looking at some stuff so code so apparently cod pilot is not is not getting better it's getting worse by the way just because something is on print paper doesn't mean it probably should have been a blog post okay just because something is on something that looks like printer paper probably could have just been a blog post okay abstract okay abstract is just your first line of your blog post by the way 2023 marked the coming out party for github co-pilot in less than two years time the ai programming assistant shot from prototype to cornerstone used by millions of developers across hundreds of thousands of businesses its unprecedented growth defines a new era in how code gets written quick pll here we're going to do a quick pll because i'm actually curious how many of you guys use co-pilot a lot of yeses no i will not interesting interesting no i won't pay for it like yeah you just you just don't want to pay for it okay so we got a lot of people that just don't want to pay for it we got a people that will just out of principled stance not use it a lot of people that don't care about it and a few that use other coding tools okay all right let's keep on going all right github has published several pieces of research on the growth and impact of ai on software development among their findings is that developers write codes 55% faster i always found this to be such a crazy take like you know there's there's only a there's only one way they can figure out this information likely which is that they have to be gathering data from vs code that's the only way i can really think about that to be true unless if they're trying to say that they're observing repository changes and changes are happening 55% faster those are the only two i can really think of let's see the profusion of llm generated code begs the question how does the code quality and main maintainability compared to what would have been written by a human yes this is this is this is good question right here is it more similar to be careful refined contributions of a senior developer or more akin to the disjointed work of a short-term contractor let's put it a little bit different let's put a little maybe we could put a little different spin on this one is it better to have three junior devs who a senior dev rapidly looks over the code and says it's okay or to have one mega eager junior dev that can inject code directly into your editor while you're typ whilst you're typing and you have to review it at all points whether you are junior or senior dev good question yeah that's that's how github co-pilots always felt to me it's just like the world's most eager intern that gives you pretty mediocre to shitty code totally willing to make boilerplate and does it really really fast junior's greater than co co-pilot's greater than junior i just don't think so to investigate a get clear collected 153 million changed lines of code authored between january 2020 and december 2023 this is the largest known database of highly structured code change that has been used to evaluate code quality differences okay so pre-m to post llm we find disconcerting trends for maintainability cod churn the percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than 2 weeks after being authored is projected to double in 2024 compared to it in 2021 pre- ai baseline okay okay we further find that the percentage of added code and copy pasted code is increasing in proportion to updated and deleted and moved code in this regard code generated during 2023 more resembles an itinerant contributor prone to violate the dryness of the repos visited yeah that's actually an interesting point if if code is really you know how there's you know like inevitably on a lot of projects you will find things that have like some udle folder right some helpers folder some people are just like youles youles are absolutely the worst ever can you please look at my helpers folder right right i just i dude i hate that  so much it's just like yo yo yo dog yo dog that's the same thing that's like literally the same thing shut shut up stop it okay you don't want to a nice bike shed dog yo that bike shed real cool color of blue am i right am i right but with co-pilot if you need to write some helper function really quickly you could imagine that co-pilot is so likely to give you the answer quickly that you are less likely to use udel and maybe more frequently repeat yourself i'm not saying it's good code i'm just saying with like little like especially javascript because javascript has virtually like javascript has one of the worst standards out there it it does not have a huge amount of of helpers right like there's no sum function how many times have you written sum in javascript i have written some so many times and if you use something like typescript which puts the type into it you realize like how quick co-pilot can like kind of understand some and will just create it reduce yeah i'm sure i would use it here we here we'll find out right now vim test.ts we'll put a little ts on this one even though i don't use typescript these days i've been using a lot of js doc some numbers a number array number i mean it it does a pretty good job right i mean it's it's it's like it's mostly there right it's it's it's i'm not surprised they use reduce right you'd expect them to kind of use a reduce right out of context yeah js do and good classes is all you need i love i love js do js do with ts the ts checker it's beautiful all right table of contents we got some okay we got a bunch of stuff let's let's look at this stuff all right get up 55% faster coding 46% more code written 1.5 trillion added to gdp wait github said that they just they just adding gdp like it's going out of style when did i didn't realize github co-pilot added that many trillions in gdps son we can dude let's get more debt with with numbers like this with numbers like these a little wonder that github's own ceo thomas dumy has been taking time from his usual ceo duties to write about ai revolution a blog post and research paper he published on github in 2023 tell a he story about the rapid proliferation proliferation of co-pilot 55% faster coding 46% more code written 75% more fulfilled now this last one is just so interesting like what causes somebody to be fulfilled typically for me whenever i'm writing code a fulfillment or maybe satisfaction might be a better word comes from when i complete something do you think that this number that they're measuring because we're got to remember who uses co-pilot there's a large percentage of people that use co-pilot okay not large but a certain percentage of people that use co-pilot because they get it for free because they have a popular open source repo there's another percentage of people that use it because they're students and they get it for free okay these are woke stats hold on just hold on just walk with me okay walk with me just walk with me on this one and so imagine you're a student you're going to struggle completing you're you're not good at building projects so now you have a magic tool that comes by and boom you can start writing code even though you don't really understand it like i think that people you know and then if they survey their their users it would look like people are more happy because people who don't know how to code well cuz they just simply haven't spent the you know the year required to to learn how to code effectively or at least to some level effectively instead they're spending three months and they're getting that same fulfillment that maybe we get after a couple years of programming they're now getting within 3 months and so they're feeling more fulfilled and i bet you that co-pilot highly over indexes into students which by the way i'm also super worried about students using co-pilot that's my that's my thesis okay that's that's or that's my hypothesis that's that's that's my hypothesis why what this means and i i do do i think it's dangerous absolutely completely unearned sense of fulfillment i mean is it unearned they still have to build the thing they still have to build it is it wrong or is it right like nice hair loser hey you shut up you know like how i think about it is that in the next five years our however we're programming is going to completely change and so to think that this will not be the only way people start to learn how to program is kind of wild right within five years nobody is going to learn how to program by like reading a book it's just not going to happen right and you know what pretty much everybody's going to learn how to program by starting a nextjs application installing typescript starting an account on github starting an account on versel launching a versel hello world application like that's going to be everybody's first programming experience you know they they don't even build they don't even build the aster house using a while loop okay which i think is a very important first task absolutely i no i think it is that's too much for a beginner and way too much abstraction i know it i i mean this beats raid shadow legends absolutely this beats raid shadow legends anyways all right interesting okay let's keep on going the same post dkey asserts that more than 20,000 organizations are already using github co-pilot for business this follows github's announcement from february 2023 that more than 1 million people were already using co-pilot on personal license when co-pilot for business was released github has been making commendable progress on both advancing ai quality and on being transparent about the results of their effort okay okay okay what is the let's see what is the total percentage of developers using ai to author code in a separate study that github undertook with waker field research in june 2023 they assert that 92% of us-based developers working in large companies report using an ai coding tool okay i mean that's pretty flaky because that could be chat gpt like i i use chat gpt for all the stupid typescript errors that i get not i'm not talking about like the the the the types issue i'm not talking about those ones i'm talking about when i'm trying to when i'm trying to edit a build pipeline that's not some simple one-dimensional build pipeline where you need to have a doctorate in cmake to be able to do anything and all a sudden it's just like i don't know i don't know why these things aren't i don't know i don't know why i dude dude once once you're in like webpack config that's spread around like 25 files like when your when your webpack config gets so big that it requires its own team to maintain you just don't even know you you don't you don't you don't know the hell that exists out there you don't even know cuz y'all think that it's just create vite app and that's what it's used at large production companies that's not what's used at large production companies okay that's not how it works i hate to break this to you but you live in a bubble of zero user applications just use rsc just use stow pack bro deprecated they go on to claim that 70% of developers say that they see significant benefits to using ai still august 2023 survey by o'reilly publishers found that 67% of surveyors surveyed developers claimed that they weren't yet using chat gpt or co-pilot this suggests that github still has potential for sign ific market capture which makes sense i would assume that's that's that's true the problem with ai generated code all right let's get into it this is where the meats at developers won't be adopting co-pilot if they don't believe that it accelerates their ability to produce code fair github's research finding on this point says developers are 75% more fulfilled when using co-pilot to a first approximation developers embrace the product this doesn't reveal whether their near-term satisfaction will be shared by those who go on and maintain their code that is such that is one of the most incredible skill issue insults i have ever seen in my entire lifetime they may feel more fulfilled and satisfied but the people with whom maintain their code are not sharing same sentiment fulfilled what's their definition we don't we don't get a definition for what it means to be fulfilled initial impressions from longtime co code researcher adam torill author of your code as a crime scene are skeptical nice a nice image could you use ai to upscale this maybe the main challenge with ai assisted programming is that it becomes so easy to generate a lot of code which shouldn't have been written in the first place nice job retweeting this and not liking it just trying to ratio the man are you trying to ratio him what is this yes i actually agree with the statement completely this is actually a really great statement right here github claims that code is written 55% faster with co-pilot i really okay so honestly i i'm going to give you another i'm going to give you another heater okay we're g we're we're we're cooking okay so i'm just going to tell you how i feel about this statement when i hear that github co-pilot makes you write 55% faster code i have to believe that most people don't know how to type like get up co-pilot does make me a bit faster maybe like 10% but 55% yo dog do you just like look at your cursor blink waiting for co-pilot results to come in like 55 is fast 55% is fast boomer what's boomer you got to go on for that what go on explain yourself all right sanos bring it on you're on the big board now let's go let's go explain yourself what is boomer about that does it make one a boomer because one believes you should be good at using tools that you use for 40 hours a week ai is future that that's that's that's what you're going to go with ai is future like that's it like no no i i don't think anyone's disagreeing with you on this point but learning how to type is a very valuable skill considering the fact that you couldn't type out your own sentence maybe just for a moment consider learning how to type yourself so that you're not 55% faster what is this what is this anyways all right the problem here is that code spends 10x more time being read than being written according to robert martin author of clean code i also i really just don't believe that do you really only write code 10% of the time and read code or write code 9 % of the time and read code 90% of the time i know that's 99% but close to that like that's not me i write a lot of code i probably write i mean it depends on the season right like some seasons i'm looking at someone else's stuff and that takes it's it's a very slow process then it is really like a a 1 to 10 ratio but whenever i'm building any feature like i'm just doing the building thing and i just i just write code all day you're in the 1% of devs writing code is 1% of devs when you write a feature you're doing you read for 10x and write for 1x really for netflix yeah for netflix people mostly read it damn okay i mean hey you know i can take the l on this one you only read i mean i i tend to only read code when i'm in the process of learning the environment i'm trying to code in right so i'm in a i'm in a learn phase and then i'm in a write phase and that depends on the complexity of the project too some some some projects are exceptionally complex and so the the reading takes like a month to really get up to speed and the writing could take like two weeks and so then i'm at like a 6633 i'm factoring the yeah i i literally am factoring the y'all learn by reading i tech typically i try to read get a basic idea and then i usually try to debug my way through i find that just simply walking through code and watching it go is is much easier for me to kind of learn learn a project faster than it is for me just to look at code i find looking at code one of the hardest ways to learn whereas executing code is just like it's just much much easier for me to learn because then i can actually see the state because there's a lot of there's a lot of state that's in your head that's hard to represent in code that you have to walk through to see it don't you mostly write new tools i do write a lot of new tools but i also write tools for programs like right now i'm in a process of i'm in a i'm in a reading phase right now and i'll probably be in a reading phase for a little bit all right one being inundated with suggestions for added code but never suggestions for updating moving and deleting code this is i mean that's cool also super dangerous i'd be so worried if co-pilot's like go ahead delete this code i got you update it with this code which is more concise and easier to read you're just like is it what why am i deleting code i don't even know what happens this is a user interface limitation of text-based environments where code authoring occurs time required to evaluate code suggestions can become costly especially when a developer works in an environment with multiple competing auto suggestion mechanisms including popular jet brains ids what what i do agree with this i think evaluating code suggestions is one of the you know what honestly i feel the least fulfilled when i'm evaluating crappy code suggestions just saying code suggestions is not optimized by the same incentives as code maintainers this is a very interesting point here ai is future code suggestion algorithms are incentivized to propose suggestions most likely to be accepted code maintainers are incentivized to minimize the amount of code that needs to be read i.e understand how to adapt an existing system fair these drawbacks may explain the difference between between the greater tendency of a junior developers to accept code suggestions compared to the more experienced counterparts according to github researchers oh this is this is so good this is so good remember that fulfilled matrix the fulfilled percentage we are looking at you want to guess who's probably voting their super fulfilled using co-pilot you want to guess who's probably not feeling as fulfilled using co-pilot this is actually this is an incredible graph by the way i know i know this i know this is but still like i mean how many times do you get co-pilot suggestions per day a 100 a th000 500 and so 5% starts to make a big difference take that over take that over take that over a month right like a month is a lot a month there's i i get a lot of suggestions over the month level 100 boss versus f level five intern yeah how do they define experienced they probably just use honestly the duration of the github profile is my guess is that co what they do is they probably take the duration that you've had an account for how many commits and various things you've worked with on github and then translate that to experience so it's not true experience it's just partial experience you know what i mean get co-pilot replacing imposter syndrome experienced developers have most informed understanding of how costly code will be to maintain over time if they are more averse to using ai suggestions it raises questions about extra code that junior developers now contributing faster than ever i love i i i absolutely love this i think this is a really great thought right there all right code definitions we're going to do a quick i'm just going to kind of we're just going to do a quick perusing adding code newly committed lines that are distinct excluding lines that are incrementally changed okay those are updates deleted code lines that are removed moved code lines of code that are cut and pasted to a new file updated code committed line let's see a committed line of code based off an existing line of code that modifies okay find and replace code a pattern of code changed where the same string is removed from plus three locations and substituted with a consistent replacement content okay copy paste a code identical line contents including programming language keywords that are committed to multiple files or functions within a a commit oh interesting no no op code trivial code changes such as changes to white space or changes to the line numbers within the same code block no op code is excluded from research okay okay let's see along with evolution of code changes we explore the change in churned code this is not treated as code operations because a churned line can be paired with many operations including added deleted or updated code for a line to be qualified as churned it must have been authored pushed to the git repo then reverted or substantially revised within the subsequent two weeks interesting okay so this is actually this is a great definition by the way i actually really like this definition churn is best understood as changes that were either incomplete or erroneous when the author initially wrote committed and pushed them to the company get repo i don't think that natural language is going to ever be a very great place for programming natural language is too loosey goosey i just don't believe this statement just in general i don't think i i think coding is going to change slowly and some other thing is going to kind of come out of all of this that is going to be something that's not i i i do think that there's going to be a higher level language than we've ever seen before that will exist but it's not going to be english i think that that is going to happen js+ plus will happen all right anyways trends and commits line operations to understand how co-pilot has changed code quality we analyze the number of different line operations that git clear has observed say segmented by the year which code was authored okay the raw numbers for this analysis include up in the appendix here's the percentage by year okay added so added has gone up look at that look at that going up upness now that could be because between the the years of 2020 to 2024 there's also a huge huge influx because remember covid happened at this time and covid effectively made an entire slew of people re-evaluate their life and want to get into programming so are added lines more likely are people putting more are people just putting up more projects potentially right deleted lines also going up as far as percentages go updated it's fairly stable that's a fairly stable amount moved gone way down that's interesting moved code do you think with the speed of these tools we just rewrite more often this is it's very interesting interesting right this is a very interesting trend because it's already started to kind of go down like right 2022 i don't think llm stuff was really that popular maybe like late what in november 2022 was co-pilot announced copy pasted code i i i think this is a a greater sign that there's more junior people around maybe i guess you could argue that it is co-pilot co-pilot is allowing you to create more of the same boiler playay code fast therefore you just don't use a oodles final replace doesn't look like it's changed churn is this i i think this is probably one of the most interesting ones right here is churn because that is a pretty large leap these two years it wasn't like even these three years it wasn't high and then this has gone up like because that's like a doubling and churn meaning that lines created are lines changed within two weeks how let's see here are how these look in graph form where the left axis illustrates the pre prevalence of code change operations which is a percentage sum to one the right axis and light blue line track the corresponding changes to turn code all right so added is kind of going upwards deleted is going upwards copy pasted is going upwards moved is going downward so moved is the one that's really getting hurt here and churn is going upwards if i am learning i i am turn that into fine butter wait what what i'm turnning i'm turning so hard you don't move but delete stuff i don't know well that's what it looks like is that moving is going down and deleting is going up anyways the projections for 2024 utilize open ai gpt 41 1106 preview assistant to run quadratic regressions on existing data the full method used to interrogate the open ai assistant is provided in the appenx okay given the exponential growth of co-pilot reported by github the ai assistance in general it seems likely that 2024 numbers will continue to the trend that began to take form in 2022 and accelerated in 2023 all right so they're saying that move is going to go down even further added deleted and up and o churns going to go way up they're they're i mean they're they're thinking that churn is going to go what up to 7 and a half% wait no 30 that's dude i'm way off on that one i'm way off on that one there 39% increase would be what that'd be practically dang near 10% or what 9% n and a half percent n and a half percent yeah because 9 would be 28% that's like 9 and a half% damn that's a this is going way up this is going way up this is going way down the move is really curious i wonder why moved is going so far down i can't really understand why that one's going down i guess refactoring is just not a thing anymore obliterate and create new interpreting code operation changes the most significant changes observed in 2023 are to churn moved and copy pasted code the implications for each change are reviewed in this section okay good the burgeoning churn recall that churn is the percentage of code that was pushed to the repo then subsequently reverted removed or updated within 2 weeks this was a relatively infrequent outcome when developers authored all the own code only 3 to 4% of code was churned prior to 2023 although there is a hint of the coming uptick in 2022 when the churn jumped 9% 2022 was the first year co-pilot was available in beta and that happened later in the year too and the year that chad gpt became available 2022 to 2023 the rise of ai assistance are strongly correlated with mistake code being pushed to the repo if we assume that co-pilot prevalence was 0% in 2021 5 to 10 in 2022 and 30% in 2023 the corresponding citations let's see the pearson correlation coefficient between these variables is 0.98 yo i'm happy for you or or i'm sorry but i ain't reading all that the turn the turn becomes more commonplace the greater risk of mistake being deployed to production the current pattern continues in 2024 more than 7% of all code changes will be reverted within 2 weeks that's you know i guess i never really thought about churn in that way but 7% of all code changes will be reverted within two weeks it's pretty it's pretty wild and then it'll be one in 10 lines one in 10 lines will be reverted soon based on this data we expect to see an increase in google's dora ch change failure rate when 2024 state of devops report is released later this in the year contingent on the research using data from a assisted developers in 2023 interesting so they're actually even calling in the future dora dora dora the explorer changes the failure rate going up interesting less moved code implies less refactoring less reuse moved code is typically observed when refactoring an existing code system refactoring systems in general moved code in particular underpin code reuse as a product gros in scope developers traditionally rearrange existing code into new modules and files that can be reused by new features the benefit of code reuse are familiar to exper developers compared to newly added code reus code has already been tested and proven stable in production yeah it's it's less risky often reused code has been touched by multiple developers and is more likely to include documentation that that okay that second line right here i don't believe that at all this accelerates the interpretation of the module by developers who are new to it combined with the growth i'd say that the benefit you get with code reuse is that there's multiple authors that are familiar with the code and questions can be disseminated among many people and experience can be disseminated among more people as opposed to the other way around it could be that more people are willing to rewrite what was written by the bot instead of by them or ai rewriting faster say not saying the bot doesn't write awful code sometimes but it might have the impact okay fair fair this is a hairy situation shut up about my hair okay i lost a bet and i want you guys to understand that this accelerates the interpretation of the module by developers who are new to it combined with the growth in code labeled copy pasta there is little room to doubt that the current implementation of ai assistants discourage code reuse instead refactoring and working to dry code these assistants offer one keystroke temptation to repeat existing code one problem but i mean the inverse i do have with this one which may be a part of the this so-called ai revolution that we i think is really valuable to think about is that dry often leads to people abstracting code early right the pursuit of dry is just like this weird earworm of i must make all my code reuse and there's some functions that are really close and they could almost be the same thing but then you create this like really abstracted function that has you know that's just not good that's more brittle than just the two individual functions that are super close and perhaps it is fine that there is more quote unquote cop pasted code if it's close enough in structure like i'm not necessarily opposed to it abstract as early as possible that is the craziest statement i've ever read people are asking for the the link yeah here here here's the link abstraction dude stop abstracting start writing stop abstracting yeah dry has done more damage to software than i think a lot of things have more copy pasted code implies future headaches there is there is perhaps no greater scourge to long-term code maintainability than copy pasted code twitter is terrible boom putting that out there all right i didn't really even think about it all right to an extent when a non-keyword line of code is repeated the author is admitting i didn't have the time to evaluate the previous implementation by reading code versus reusing it the chore is left to the future maintainers to figure out how a typo unfortunately is there typo oh no is terrible boom got it all right we got it we got it sorry i didn't even look at it the dra is left to the future maintainers to figure out how to cons consolidate parallel code paths that implement repeatedly needed function functionality yeah i mean it's still hard it's not easy i don't know i'm not sure if it's bad or good since most developers derive greater satisfaction from implementing new features than they do interpreting potential reusable code fair that's i mean that's fair i i'd say that this is one of the most fairest statements i've ever read my lifetime it is much nicer to create new than it is to to like try to like reuse code very fair theyy thanks for all the the subs copy pasta code often persists along past its expiration date especially on less experienced teams there may be no code maintainer with the moral authority to remove duplic duplicative code even when there are senior engineers possessing such authority the willpower cost of understanding the code well enough to delete is hard to overstate if there isn't a cto or vp of engineering who actively schedules time to reduce tech debt you can't add executive driven time pressures to the list of reasons why newly added sl copy pasted code will never be consolidated into the component libraries that underpin long-term development velocity you know something i guess i never really thought about here in all of this that we're talking about right now have we ever thought about the fact that 2020 2021 had one of the greatest influxes ever into the internet with people right a huge amount of people all flooded onto the internet amazon's greatest quarters were during this time right it was wild everything just piled in and then zero interest phenomenon zero interest rate phenomenon got lifted in all aspects of society not only are we paying less in interest people are just less using the internet and people are struggling a lot of these companies are struggling to turn a profit now and so maybe this desire for new features and push from above could also potentially be causing some of these these this type of movement in code so you got kind of like the ultimate influx of crazy which is you have pressure from above that hasn't been happen that hasn't happened in this kind of situation for a long time you have an unusual influx of new talent that just hasn't happened again it just hasn't happened this amount of new talent flooding into the market and you have ai so it's like there's a lot of confounding factors here that i think is really hard to just say the reason why these things are happening is because of co-pilot though i don't i don't disagree with it and you got a second problem that's going to happen ai these llms are really great at training off of human ingenuity they are not great on training off what they produce and so in what amount of time will we see some potential oopsy daisies kind of coming from this where where code quality is going down like at a faster rate i don't know could be interesting i think we're right on the precipice of chat bought that blue hair yes they did i i think i think we're right on the precipice of like the jippy getting high on its own supply move you know what i mean it is just as boeing i don't i don't get the i don't get the reference on unfortunately since g clear operations only include code that is duplicated within a single commit it is likely that 11% copy pasted measured in 2023 is only a fraction of the total paste pasting being quietly seated into repos oh absolutely a lot of people still practice pretty atomic commits or regular updating so yeah all right trends in revised in revised code age a second independent means to access how code quality has changed in 2023 versus before is to analyze the data from get clear's code providence derivation yeah a code pro provenance assessment evaluates the length of time that passes between when code is authored and when it's subsequently updated or deleted okay okay okay interesting interesting i mean this is a very cool graph this is a very cool graph right here less than twoe turn rate has gone up less than one month appears to be flat less than one year has gone down less than one to two years has gone down code is just not used as long you can see it right here this is pretty much flat this is going up these are going down that's i mean that's that's a that's a super cool observation interpreting code age trends code providence data corroborates the pattern observed in the code operation analysis the age of co of the code when it is replaced has shifted much younger from 2022 to 2023 specifically code replaced in less than 2 weeks has jumped 10% meanwhile code older than 1 month has changed 24% less frequently in 2023 versus 2022 all right i'm going to throw out one more thing there's also a huge amount of open source projects and everything pushing for bleeding edge type of uh projects to showcase people's talent again with a large influx and i just think of the last two years of forell they've made a lot of big changes to their application and a lot of people have rewritten and rechanged their code and so does it make sense that longlived code is becoming more difficult in the age of ever prog progress on web technologies i think that that damn there could be four confounding factors here people i don't know it's just interesting that that technology is also moving the fastest it has ever moved like ever iteration speed and time to market feel absolutely key to surviving yeah the trend implies that prior to ai assistance developers may have been more likely to find a recently authored code in their repo to target for refinement in use around 70% of products built in the early 2020s use the agile methodology per a tech report survey pour one out for them pour one out in agile features are typically planned and executed per sprint typical sprint lasts two to three weeks it aligns with the data surmised that the team circa 2020 were more likely to convene post sprint to discuss what recently implemented and how to reuse it ah in a proximal sprint ah dude i love dude nothing better than just meeting with my meetings about my meetings about my code changes questions for follow-up research yeah can incentives be created to contradict the add and forget tab based invocation that pervades code suggestions engines of 2024 so i'm again i'm not actually 100% convinced just based on the things we've kind of talked about and just some of my unfounded okay they're not they're not guaranteed projections here but i don't know if it's purely a co-pilot problem because tonight will be the night that i will fall for you over again thank you for whatever that meant while ai could be trained to identify code consolidation opportunities it would be would it be invoked dude it'd be so dangerous i could totally understand the fear of that can we all agree that that would be terrifying like that would be terrifying if co-pilot's like just delete these five functions and put this new function here you might be like what what i don't know if i trust this right and then people are really shitty at unit testing real talk people are very bad at unit testing and so they often unit test like things too much and so then any of these deletions would also cause many unit test to have to be rethought of i think i think there'd be a lot of interestingness to it all co-pilot refactoring i know brave it's brave that's 2024 brave is letting co-pilot refactor that is such a tweet that is a tweet right there 20 24 brave is letting co-pilot refactor your code boom feel like that's pretty good another salient question in light of this data at what rate does development progress become inhibited by additional code especially when it becomes copy and pasted code i find that as a project goes on the time to feature goes down right i think that's extremely natural unless if you're extremely militant about how code is added in the first place i think linux has been one of the most successful code repos of all time ever i have never seen a repo last as long as it does while continuing to add new features yes i understand my hair is a little is is is it contains some green in the blue okay especially when it comes to copy pasted code there is almost certainly an inverse correlation between the number of lines in a repo and the velocity in which developers can modify those lines yeah i mean i think that's that that natural the current uncertainty is when the accumulated copy pasta debt too great to ignore knowing the rate at which slowdown takes hold would allow future tools to highlight when a manager should consider cutting back time on new features i just don't know if you could i just i don't know that is such a i don't know if ai can make these kind of calls i don't know i think it should just be obvious i think what really should be obvious is when you bring on a new person and you have a new person look at the code that is written and if the wtfs per per hour exceeds a certain level then i think that is probably time for you to cut things back if it could would anyone believe it yeah maybe i don't know final question worthy of exploration what is the total percentage of copy pasted code that is now occurring compared to 2020 to 2022 since get clear currently measures the copy pasted code within the context of an individual commit it seems likely that the total copy paste volume all non-keyword non comment lines of code repeated within a file might be doubled what get clear currently measures you know would be really like an interesting project would be to validate this idea use something like tree sitter which can valid which can like look at the shape of the code you're using and not just like the names right it's not confounded by the names and all that you can actually just look at the tree and try to find identical trees within a code how often are there identical trees within a code and how big are the average identical trees found i think that could be a really cool research it'd be a lot of fun that's a billion dollar startup right there i don't think it is because it's it's it's it it doesn't really give you much the classic tree measuring yeah classic tree measuring tj you know all codes a tree when you really think about it i always thought that would be a really cool potential get minify attempt you know how there's like these min ifications it would have a it would certainly have a a runtime issue but to be able to take your minified code look for duplicate tree structures and refactor out duplicate tree structures into even further minified code i think it'd be a really fun project it's something i like i i i want to do so well it's drive up on the machine machine level but it also has a huge implication on performance right if you just start if you just start refactoring like that you could cause significant more it's like a compression it's like a compression but it's it's on the it's on javascript right so it' be on ja it wouldn't work for compile you wouldn't do this on compiled obviously it's like a compiler yeah it's like a compiler i don't know it's it's just a really interesting project i've always wanted to explore i've been thinking about it for like way too long anyways super cool super cool paper honestly conclusion deaths wary for a reason by both data points we evaluated negative pressures on code quality were present in 20123 this correlates to a pro proliferation of llms in general in ai code assistant in particular developer assessments like a g github's 2023 survey with wakefield research hints that developers already receive the decrease or perceive the decrease in code quality i definitely can see it in a chat gpt getting chat gpt to produce code is so hard these days you like have to you have to emotionally ab abuse it to get it to get code you start off all super nice asking for it and just like skips swaths of code you're like yo yeah but how is that how is that implemented hey how about you actually do the implementation bro their top response was collaboration and communication followed by code quality in second place when the question switched to what metric should be evaluated when actively using an ai their response shifted with code quality now the top concerns and number of production instances is rising to number three interesting production instances production incidents are less important than time to complete task to me this just might be right here this might be the thing we're looking at when individual developers lack the data to substantiate why code quality and production incidents become more pressing concerns with ai our data suggest a possible backstory when developers are inundated with quick and easy suggestions that will work in the short term it becomes a constant temptation to add more lines of code without really checking whether an existing system could be refined for reuse the to the extent that inexperienced developers continue to offer implicit copy paste suggestions via the key tab key to the fix for the situation won't be easy it is beholden on the engineer leaders to monitor incoming data and consider its implications for future product maintenance developer analytics tools including g clear can help detect the rate in which problematic code is being seated specific questions to evaluate is the percentage of code reuse fall are there changes to how much codee is being moved and copi and pasted is it easy for developers to discover and reuse discover code reuse opportunities this last one's really hard because i really think this only works in smaller code bases like if you've ever been in a multi-million line codebase it's extremely hard there there there just comes a point where it becomes really difficult to reuse code very interesting though great article great articles i think that whatever the problem is is more than just co-pilot and i think the downward pressure on code quality is going to continue to grow significant over the next couple years and that is i think because of the significant increase in speed of moving or the the speed at which technology is changing so the technical depth is just shrinking on a lot of people like a lot of people are no longer as technically savvy as they once were when you used something like jquery you were pretty technically savvy because you were predominantly just using dom nodes with some jquery to be able to like kind of take care of all the sucky of listening and all that kind of stuff and so like your ability to be pretty deep was pretty quick and you could actually keep on becoming deeper and more experienced in it whereas with like just say react react in general your ability to become an expert in reac doesn't really exist because it's just how much you want to be able to build and which way you want to be be able to build and there's like 19 different ways you can build something with it and i just don't know if it it it really exists other than your familiarity with react but then react changes every two years which makes it again really hard to develop a deep expertise unless if you've had this deep expertise growing for so many years and you're able to kind of follow it and move it with it all i loved jquery until i hated it plain js is great i love j jquery is great jquery is terrible jquery is such a success story dude it's so good is it an ocdc ocd thing no i just think it looks pretty i highlight from here to here because i think it looks nice the name is i use co-pilot i think co- pilot's nice but i use it for boilerplate i don't ever i don't like to let it right cat for me i like i like to let it like fill in strs and and that stuff for me it's it's much much nicer a
