thank you hey what's up i'm kim bfc here okay i'm gonna make myself sound really old here just for a second but about 10 years ago there was a vibrant ecosystem of a ton of different tablets there's all kinds of tablets there is like ipads versus android tablets all these fights going on there were small screen tablets big screen tablets and all the android tablets were sort of anchored by google's family of nexus tablets so we had the smash hit nexus 7 and the cult classic nexus 10 but then google kind of got a little bit lost with android tablets and chrome os tablets a little bit in there for a bit and they made a few bad ones in a row and then they just gave up like they literally just gave up stopped making tablets but something else that's picked up a whole bunch of steam since then is a new product category smart home displays so google bought nest and we've seen this nest hub and the nest hub max came out and this is a growing category every single month so at some point during all of this google probably thought wait a second we're making all these smart home displays and what is a smart home display it's basically just a cheap tablet so what if we just made a cheap tablet that could turn into a smart home display and so that's how we got this this is the pixel tablet so i've been using this tablet for a few weeks now and look it's not amazing or super premium or high-end or exciting and neither are any of the other smart home displays but i do want to talk about it it's also a little bit interesting and underrated and how important this tablet could be to other tablets so let's talk about it so as a tablet this thing is pretty simple i really like the soft touch finish on the back this is the porcelain color and it hides fingerprints really really well feels solid in the hand it's actually made of metal but you honestly could never tell just holding it thanks to this coating but it's very basic single camera on the back corner volume buttons with the inset fingerprint reader that doubles as a power button up at the top there's a set of speakers on the left and right that sounds okay but really doesn't have much bass at all and the usbc port is on the left hand side it's not too big it's not too heavy and on the front is an 11 inch 2560 by 1600 60hz lcd display with bezels just thin enough to hold it and not be a problem and the display does not get particularly bright and it's not the fastest thing in the world but it is running the same tensor g2 chip as the pixel 7s but i just i i cannot call this tablet fast not sure if it's under clocked or what's happening here but it behaves very much like a basic mid-range android tablet and that's because that's basically what it is this is a 499 dollar tablet and it comes with the dock in the box that you can buy separately if you want to if you want an additional one for 130 so i would say tame your expectations here like it's it works and it's it does what it's supposed to but i would just i would say tame your expectations so this speaker dock comes on the box which i think is super cool and it's actually the only way to charge the tablet that comes in the box there is no usbc cable in here it's just the dock which has a barrel connector that connects to the wall and the dock is basically it's just a speaker in a box really with some pins super simple the pins kind of retract a little bit when you touch them which is cool but basically the premise is there's some magnets in the dock as you can see here with this magnet paper and there's some magnets in the tablet which you can also see here with this magnet paper and so when you line those up and connect the dock to the tablet it just pops right onto those pins and the pins carry both power and data so now it's charging and the audio quality should be improved because it's now using the speaker in the dock it works pretty darn quickly too thankfully it's not bluetooth pairing or anything it's just literally a physical connection for the the data so it's just like connecting like an ipad to a keyboard it just works right away it holds it at a pretty good angle too it's basically straight up and down it looks just like a nest home hub when you put it on the dock like that magnets are pretty strong you can pop it off with one hand if you want to i'm just i'm just glad that this comes in the box and isn't an additional hundred thirty dollars first of all the charging speed is up to 15 watts which is not that fast it's a tablet battery so it's pretty big takes a while to charge and then the the speaker in here is not that great i would say it feels on par with like the nest hub mini at best so the speakers in the tablet are like i said they're fine but they really lack a lot of bass and then when you add it to the speaker dock you're getting like 20 to 30 more volume but it's mostly just adding the bass back but it's not super loud here i'll give you a little sample not a ton of bass right [music] all low end and it's quick too it's immediate as soon as i pop it off back to the speakers but it's not the it's not the loudest thing in the world honestly it's i guess it's fine this dock cannot be used as a bluetooth speaker or anything else when a tablet isn't attached but honestly i don't think you'd want to it's basically just sits there and is waiting for the tablet to be attached to it what's funny though is it does help with the battery so the battery life on this tablet was decent for me but it did have particularly weak standby life for some reason it would drop like 10 overnight sometimes which could be a bug either way the idea is when you're done using it you can pop it onto the dock and it is literally just a smart speaker now if you really wanted to you could buy another one and put it in a different room and then when it's in the kitchen per se it'll show you certain things when it's in the bedroom it'll show you other things but it is a hundred and thirty dollars per dock and i'm now starting to think that that's the more overpriced thing among this bundle so just know what you're getting into that but i think really what i realized is this docking feature is cool but it's not the most interesting part of this tablet for me it's the headlining feature because it's the cool thing that it does but as i was talking about there was this whole tablet ecosystem like 10 years ago and seeing what google does with the software for this tablet could give us a window into how google can anchor android tablets again going forward so i was really curious about the software so here's what i found number one i really like the new dock the software dock so the home button at the bottom you can swipe up at any time and all the same gestures work like normal but there's a new gesture where you just grab the bottom bar and swipe up just a little bit and that brings up a dock which is the exact same order of whatever apps you had in your home screen dock it also shows up in multitasking and then from there you can switch to a recent app or initiate multitasking by dragging something to half the screen to get two things going at once it works great it simple i use it all the time for going back and forth between two things quickly so i really like that then number two multi-user support is so sick and the ipad should seriously be taking notes on this so anytime you want either from the notification tray or from the lock screen or anywhere that you see that profile picture for your account you can switch users when you set up a new user at first you basically go through the whole setup process as if you're setting up a brand new tablet and then that second person can sign into their apps and set up their home screen and their widgets and everything and you can switch back and forth by logging into each one literally just with your fingerprint it's exactly as simple as it should be it could also totally be like one person's personal profile and business profile so you never get the two confused or i don't know just a profile for your burner accounts whatever you want to make it the point is tablets are often used at home and by families that have more than one person so the ability to just like log into your kids account and not have them worry about accidentally buying thirty thousand dollars of i don't know minecraft credits or something it's a pretty obviously great feature and then number three of course hub mode this is the mode that sort of pops up when you get it onto the dock that they had to build of course because they turned this into a smart hub i kind of end up just using it like a smart hub a lot of the time that it's on this dock i don't touch it as much i just use voice controls which all work and then i have a clock here you can do like a photo gallery type thing or rotating pieces of art and of course the smart home display controls are available at the bottom corner but it just kind of lives like that i have it in the kitchen most of the time nice oh this is also fun fact the the first tablet that has chromecast built in as a target so you can use it as a target to chromecast things to it i would never do that but you can do that so the number four last but not least is the app situation this is something we talk a lot about with android tablets and there was a lot of promise with this version and with this tablet that there would be a whole bunch of new tablet optimized apps and that that experience would be meaningfully different and it's not well i guess you could say it's a little bit true so google can say that their own apps are now all optimized and take full advantage of the larger display so you know you can be confident anytime you open a google app on this google tablet it's going to look great and that's awesome but for all of the rest of the apps that make the world go round all the third-party apps all the stuff that you probably are thinking about when getting a tablet that you're going to use there is no meaningful difference in that situation right now so a lot of them are still big phone apps i would say instagram is still a giant phone app twitter is still a giant phone app tesla is still a giant phone app expedia stole a giant phone app cash app is still not optimized neither is tick tock it still kind of looks weird soundcloud is like half optimized i guess pocket casts is also halfway there looking like a giant phone app overdrop weather is still a blown up phone app and the list goes on and on they have this thing where you can double tap the space to the left or to the right to move it over to the side to make it more one-handable but i mean yeah that's it it's just a big phone app the app ecosystem for android tablets is still to this day even now that this has arrived it's still the biggest weakness of an android tablet and the incentive it's got to be on developers of course but most of their incentive is to be as simple and streamlined as possible and if you can just make one ipad app that covers all ipads you'll do it but if you can make one tablet app it won't necessarily work on all android tablets so the incentive is still kind of tough well actually there is one app that google can say that they got optimized before the ipad and that's the calculator they did do a full scientific not scientific but a full-on calculator there's a history over here to the side there's the readout which you can change the size of a light and dark theme all this stuff it's pretty good your move apple some other little random things that didn't quite fit into the full review when it's docked on the charger it default charges up to 90 not 100 but i do think that's smart it preserves the battery life overall there's also no headphone jack on this tablet just so you know and then in case you're wondering the camera quality is very much in line with the rest of this tablet's hardware pretty mid it's good enough for basic video calls and document scanning but nobody's shooting any movies on this thing at the end of the day though my conclusion is this two in one devices are typically they're funny because they're they're always like slightly worse at one of the things that they're trying to be this is a two in one device it's a tablet and it's a smart home hub so i was wondering as i got it like what is it going to be compromised at is it worse at one or worse at the other turns out it's a decent cheap android tablet and it's a slightly below average speaker dock home hub but that's fine i think those two things are close enough together and are simple enough that it makes sense at least i would personally love a super high-end version of this i'd be so down for like a 120 hertz super fast nice premium tablet that also could dock whenever i want on a nice speaker and become like this high-end like boombox thing but i also know that that would be super expensive and would have a much much smaller target demographic and probably wouldn't sell enough to exist well so this is the thing that makes sense and i think it may actually sell a decent amount and we'll see how it does until the next one thanks for watching catch in the next one peace foreign [music]
