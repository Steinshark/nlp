so this machine here is the tandy radio shack why should i say radio shack really not us we had tandy america had radio shack so this is a radio shack trs-80 or some very rude people say the trash 80. where's the 80 come from is that the processor i'm not entirely sure it might be just 80 characters across the screen actually probably not sure where the 80 comes from but but yeah it was a good machine it was an early machine as well the machine itself was available from 1977 i think it was available to buy from radio shack stores over in the states over here it was the tandy shop was it branded as a tunde machine over here was it still a radio show i think it was still a radio show machine trs is tandy radio shack so it's it was just the same machine on both sides of the pond i have to confess that i not really know much about this machine over here i remember sinclair obviously when we had commodore machines and we had acorn machines was it not as big over here was it big in the states it did okay over here but yeah it's fair to say it wasn't as big as the acorn and sinclair that kind of stuff it was only sold by tandy so you had to go into one of their stores to to go and buy one but nevertheless i think they did sell pretty well and lots of people had them and we get donated them you know fairly regularly and they were a capable machine i think probably they had a little bit more of a lean towards business or home business people that wanted to balance their checkbook and that kind of stuff but there were you know some good games written for him as well it does feature in the ready player one of we're doing one or two videos about ready player one what do we know about this machine itself what's the processor what you know is it running basic what's its operating system all that sort yeah so when you turn the machine on just like any other sort of 80s computer or late 70s computer it run basic there's the way of programming it this one we've just turned on first thing it does is ask you the memory size so that was pretty standard in early basics they didn't sort of automatically detect the memory to use they asked you how much however if you press enter it would then just go and use all available memory and now we are ready to type code so standard stuff don't want to disappoint anybody let's do ready player 1 20. you know what's coming next go to 10. absolutely bog standard sort of basic in the machine a lot of the time you would have bought one of these not with a monitor you would have bought just the machine itself monitors were quite a lot of money extra so a lot of people couldn't afford that so you bought the machine you'd plug it into a tv we're lucky enough to have had a monitor donated so it goes complete with that just a mono display though no colors but yeah i mean it was a good machine but i think probably slightly more leaning towards the more serious side of computing at that time so by which we obviously mean not very many games for it they're not that many games i mean that that is the literal definition of leaning towards business is there aren't many games for this machine move along kids you you can read that however you want i'm just saying it was it was more of a serious machine but but i mean in all seriousness there were different versions of this so this is a model one the most basic version of it but you could then buy another one where it had a monitor built into it so it's a nice curvy front to it this was all in one and it had two disk drives there you were paying a lot more money for it but then you had a business machine really and lots of packages were out there that helped you run your business and that kind of stuff were processing cpm based on z80 you could run cpm on it among those packages the machine does feature in ready player one but i haven't seen it yet so i don't know what way yet i suspect that ernest cline who wrote ready player one perhaps had one of these himself because it's shown some fondness in the book yeah you can pretty much guarantee that yeah yeah absolutely i think he was playing adventure games on it and things like that and he he does talk about in the book having the the shoe box full of games that he brings out for it so so apparently there were some games but maybe only written by him i don't know let's go through the power-up sequence so there's the beginning of adventure just a purple border with a number one in it so to start any atari game you press the reset button 20 you know what's coming next go to 10. so you toggle in the data into the machine so you've got the address bus there you can set the address and then you've got your data
