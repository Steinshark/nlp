i tend to take a chef gusto approach to pc building but popular streamer xqc is challenging my beliefs i've tried everything from responding to him via video to popping into his stream of tech tips to coaching him over the phone at this point anyone else would give up but not me which is why i am at the airport after his latest build attempt resulted in a pc that was crashing during his stream i sprang into action that's right when i land the first thing i'm gonna do is get in a car drive to his house and give him some tech tips in person so that hopefully no one will ever have to watch him do this it's gonna [ __ ] break or this dude it can't mount it's too big or this it literally just doesn't fit ever again and it's brought to you by our sponsor micro center because we are going to need some hardware february is build your own month at microcenter with great deals all month long stay tuned to learn more at the end of this video it's been an hour since we landed we've got our car and we've arrived at micro center but we haven't heard back from xqc so at this point we don't have enough time to go to him figure out what's wrong come here and shop and then go back they're going to be closed so our only option is to kind of just get one of everything that he had in case something was broken and then bring it there they have changed the layout of this place a lot i am standing in what used to be like ssds and ram and gpus land he's probably got a working cooler right i would think so this seems to be all more valuable oh my god how am i supposed to get that as a short person i feel personally attacked right now i usually keep my gpus in the freezer too this is the cold aisle realistically the guy's got no budget so i assume we're just going 40 90 here i wonder whose money i'm spending right now really hope it isn't mine he had to unlock two locks to get the gpu there's no way lock picking lawyer could defeat this 179 50x please and then a kid of ram does he need more than 32 gigs of ram like i guess 128 yeah am5 can hardly handle two sticks of ram let alone four micro center is like covering this right you hope so we've got a new power supply ram gpu motherboard cpu probably not the ssd let's grab one just to get we can't come back so we're gonna get an ssd too so tell me something razer if i work at razer and i like stop gaming do i get fired do you guys need anything else here i don't know do you carry our screwdriver yet i have one in my car that doesn't count and we're good we've got everything we could possibly need he couldn't possibly have screwed it up worse than what we can fix is there any wood i can knock on in and out of only half an hour but we haven't heard from xqc so the good news is i got his address ahead of time which means i guess we're just gonna show up you know andy it occurs to me he's probably not answering because he's probably freaking live right now bench model will crash a stream no no chat benchmark is dangerous it already crashes in touch statement okay well that explains why he doesn't answer my messages so i guess we're just gonna show up in the middle of the stream hopefully that was the plan okay well we tried dropping a message in the chat we'll see if they managed to get his attention let him know we're on our way but well at least those were coming now i love your networking setup by the way this is tremendous it's good the truth is i'd rather see a crappy cable than good wireless welcome to the office stop all right where's the broken computer at this one right here okay can you explain to me what's broken about it because all i saw was you tweeting oh my god my computer's broken again basically i think that the motherboard is fried you think the motherboard is fried how about you make a bet okay how about about 100 bucks motherboards friday how about a hundred bucks it's not just snot on all of those tissue papers that's unfair so you're pretty sure it's a motherboard yeah okay that's good because i brought a spare motherboard just in case so i built this computer yes the software was all intel stuff i swapped to a amd system yes okay and i was gonna lazy i just said i'm just gonna plug it straight in all the software and just use ssd just plug it plug and play so then i launched the computer and it starts jamming the booty is janky finding windows everything is not working properly what happens then is every time i boots it's really slow but i i get it to work but then i'm like those are four sets by reset you mean like new windows install everything okay so i full reset the computer but then and with the pc we see like it sounds like error 9e 46 98 46 98 56 shoot five i just keep cycling okay tell me something i say it's the ram yeah what do you want to bet i'll give you a benji i'll give you 100. the shake on that yeah yeah okay the reason that i say it's the ram is that right now am5 is a very new platform and this is amd's first generation ddr5 memory controller and i think i think you have 128 gigs of ram yes then okay i didn't oh he didn't give me all the information it was bad from the get-go i took i had the six outs because that was my theory and even afterwards when it was installed and then it was running properly either computer crashed or or i restarted it long time to boot it's cycling 98 45 46 98 one yeah okay and then the next day i used the the capture card i know i capture audience yeah yeah the computer just goes and it's just dead and then it says usb over current i remember you mentioned that before okay it says over current i don't know what it means i checked bad usbs top ones i unplugged all the usbs directly from the mobile and the case itself and nothing was working i didn't get a singular good boot ever even if i didn't have all the information i'm still gonna honor the bet because i'd love to have something on the line and i guess the next order of this is for us is to get this thing set up so i can actually observe some of this behavior i'm gonna use my magic tech tips fingers and i'm just gonna go to turn it on and it's just gonna turn on and work perfectly and then i'm gonna have come down here for nothing sorry i'm just talking to your chat i love that there's a drought here right there's always a drought here oh yes i just assume there's a drought here yeah is this is this hdmi only oh yeah that's very unusual i got both okay since you have a platform i can use it to ramble okay what is it with new gpus and no hdmi ports yeah it's still kind of lame to buy like a three thousand dollar or two thousand dollar a piece of hardware and like the most normal hdmi port doesn't work on it you got an ethernet cable by any chance what was that ethernet cable because i'm gonna have to steal some network are you bringing another monitor yeah because it's the slipboards oh here's a dp cable hello all right i'm gonna need a power cable as well i think i have one it's under the mud desk somewhere okay oh i know what you're talking about yeah i forget it's a jumbo bumble one okay heck yeah let's okay let's see if it fires up for me here buddy yeah well it helps to plug this into the walls yeah i might need to lose a little bit less festivity but more power i mean it's not really holiday season anymore so i guess that's probably okay so we had a little flicker there yeah all right if you want to take a look at the error code 15 orange okay it's always orange i do want to open this up just so we can now this is zero zero yeah let's change your numbers so zero zero could be a bad mount on the cpu by the way this is the screwdriver you refuse to let me send you oh okay it's something it's not cheap at all it's actually a good product well look at that and i remember it runs the valorant spike if you've seen batman spike before and then this is our new line of sized one that's coming this one's 3d printable it's more my size but if you're into like a like a little space or something like that yeah pc building instead of going like this yeah go sideways i've done a lot of that so we're just going to use the onboard gpu this could still be bad ram but this could be as simple as i just need to pop that cpu out put it back in and we're ready to roll okay you make sense yeah if what's wrong with it is like kind of a loose connection then that would explain kind of the flakiness that you're describing or eventually it boots we had an amd server and this is wild it wouldn't work every time yeah and then you'd just like leave it there like trying to boot for 15-20 minutes and it would turn on because the thermal expansion as it heated up made the pins make contact the xbox ring of death remember that yeah right you would put towels on the xbox and boot it up and you would wait till the thrill face melted a little bit right and reapplied so it would actually boot properly so there we go we were sitting at 15 for a while we're still getting this usb device over current status detected now when he told me about this i went well the troubleshooting step for this is quite straightforward what you need to do is you need to start unplugging wait what that wasn't that oh wait what the hell that was very loose well it was loose because it's unplugged i unplugged all them one by one and plugged everything into the over currently that was and i was thinking the only motherboard is in and it's saying that it might be busted okay now it can be a busted controller and then he's right or at least partially right because it could be more than one thing those are the nightmare troubleshooting scenarios when you've got two problems that can kind of mask each other or stack on top of each other wait what the hell you see this usb header yes it just has like a daisy chain running off it does this should have a cover on it if this was just sitting grounded on something it could be shorting i didn't plug it in at all mind you if that was ever plugged into something else yeah then it could very well be that that might have fried the usb controller make sense come on side panel you know what every time that i build a pc i try to go like since i'm a streamer and i don't want to deal with problems i get a little bit overkill right but every time i get overkill it's there's a competitive problem there's there's something with some of the hardware you know what they say about the bleeding edge no i know what that means well it cuts you oh okay we're gonna start with a motherboard swap you've got some time go chill with your chat do you think you do whatever you got to do because this is going to be a little while man i'm back to like my floor days this is how i used to work on computers back before i owned a table okay we've got a lot of stickers in here you did a good job with the stickers the stickers you like them yeah it's good it's good i love stickers you did eventually end up getting this radiator well there it goes you did get this radiator installed eventually so that's good the problem with the the actual mount itself for the but we figured out with a with a diy one or something yeah yeah you're good you're good i mean even the cable management actually not that bad you know really yeah not that bad there's actually one more thing that i want to try really quick i want to do what's called a clear cmos so what you do is you pull your battery or some boards will actually have a button for it this is really high-end board i bet it does so if there's a button you can just hold down then that's so convenient but maybe this layer this one foreign of light in here is this kind of your your mood oh the lighting yeah i think this house was built in the 1700s in the 1700s okay they came with the lights i never changed them yeah it's good what do you think it's good the lighting is terrible i think this is going to do exactly the same thing that it did before you might actually be right i think i'm gonna end up owing you 100 bucks it's not too hard how about you walk us through all the things that can short or burn your motherboard so this over current error is generally caused by some kind of short that causes the controller to malfunction it can be that you just have usb devices like like if you've got too much usb on one thing it'll kind of go it's not really a fuse but it behaves like a fuse it'll say like hey you're drawing too much here bruh but what's more likely here is actually that there was some kind of short if the positive voltage and ground or really anything else i guess something metal at the same time with that thing that was hanging off there it's possible that it would short out which would cause current to just race through it and then it might detect an over current event every time i can look at it a bit closer once i've got it out and we can see if we can find somewhere on the board yeah with a burn mark but modern boards they make them out of black pcbs now it's it's in here something else i have noticed and motherboards have become like just kind of like finicky to work with it they just keep changing everything making things weird meaning with like stickers and and sticky and then the screws not screws like weird grace what's up with that it's half innovation and half marketing [ __ ] but it looks cool i mean yeah kind of sure i'm gonna get some socks because i think i'm getting a you know i'm gonna have my feet up there yeah you do do what you got to do i mean i don't mind it you heard it here first now one of the things that can cause this usb over current nonsense is if your i o shield has one of those little prongs for rounding just sticking in and touching the pins but this board has a built-in i o shield and i did have a look at it and there doesn't appear to be any kind of defect all of the theories that i've had so far about what might be going on here have not panned out said are you speaking could there be a possible short that isn't like visual it just gonna happen like a miniature skill yeah it could just be i mean happens right like seems to happen to you a lot though you know all right let me just grab my replacement board so did you pull your boot drive out of here look at you are you having fun with this oh yeah all sticky and it leaves it's like one of those things that leads to residue if this wasn't there putting this heat shield over top of it would actually make it run hotter they made a problem but at least they fixed the problem with this correct you know you're much smarter than the character you play on tv well i mean one of the first things we're going to do is even though we are going full xqc style and building on the carpet here we're gonna avoid putting the actual motherboard on the carpet and i'm also just going to make sure that i'm touching the chassis which is connected to the power supply which is connected to the wall okay now one of the things we want to do is want to make sure the cpu is super clean which it is and i didn't see anything obvious in the socket on the old board that would lead me to believe that it wasn't contacting properly if i run into any trouble with the liquid cooler i'm just going to go straight to this because i know for sure we have the right mounts and in terms of reliability air cooling man yeah unless there's like a chicken piece incident sometimes i've been like in the past i've had chicken pc so i had chipotle i jumped the chicken on the pc and i was doing something at the time i was busy and i forgot the chicken was there and it over time it cooked and then you promised me you won't spill chicken squid or coke in my computer no chicken man i really hope we don't like ruin this board or anything because that would be super awkward i do not have a way to get another one tonight playing with this goo like the the thing that they put in and you know you know i it just kind of dissipated i thought i thought they would be able to play with it but yeah and i'm i'm a grizzy chat look at this the main thing here is we're just gonna go slow and steady wins the race this is a simple operation board swap i'm just going to put this motherboard in we're going to run off the onboard audio that's it two screws in just a little bit of light might be nice but i got these these lights like like tom raider oh like tomb raider oh yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean tom raider is like the male version with tom tom all right we're at the stage now where we can run a quick test and just see if we get the same error if the hardware is possessed if it makes no sense at all yep it's the power supply oh okay 15. our old friend is back it will probably use power cycle once it's probably memory training anytime you have a new board it'll do that memory training oh okay new cpu installed oh is this an hour you recognized yeah oh yeah oh yeah this is normal this just means we have a new cpu in the system no problem it wouldn't yes this is farther than the computer's been since the problem happened all right that's good that's that's progress okay progress then i love this repping the red dragon man these guys have freaking taken over but if they were in micro center today really yeah not that long ago these were like a weird online only brand right these guys yeah these guys are freaking everywhere they have some good stuff they have some that's just absolute garbage it's kind of all over the place yeah it's fine okay no touch it's about david files right now then i'm gonna connect something to the keyboard and then you're gonna touch that you're gonna [ __ ] up the whole thing don't [ __ ] up my motherboard i will not we don't have a usb over current error anymore so it does seem like you you were right but joke's on you because i don't carry american money so you're getting a hundred canadian dollars oh utterly worthless good luck spending it i was half right but i'll take the money yeah well okay also it smells good i can still be right too oh well i mean i don't carry cash of any kind even if you want i would i would probably be like you know you got venmo paypal like that or i can stab you or one of the other before i've never had a boot under five minutes they had never happened before that's weird that's not right oh there you go hey all right okay we're gonna kick things up a notch and we're gonna plug a mouse yes sir we're all the way down andy that's as much as you can oh what is that did it reset yeah nothing's perfect just like microsoft windows it's not perfect but it's darn it they're doing their best yeah they can build some pretty crap stuff if they really set their mind to it teams okay are you heading on teams oh i love teams you like teams okay how many people you got on teams zero use bing no oh bing is about to get amazing oh and this i will bet you a thousand dollars oh man you know how i know you know chat gpt microsoft has invested over a billion dollars in open ai bing is going to be the [ __ ] i only needed one piece of hardware that's amazing your bottle why did you buy gpu for i didn't buy nothing micro center was just like oh okay you're doing a video sure whatever and they they loaded me up man this should be a fast restart i'm banking on it when you're streaming you have 90 seconds to come back stream crashes yeah and i could never meet it with this computer it's why it was important that i get the fast boot well so we should time it let's let it finish yeah and then we'll time it and we gotta beat 90 seconds we can do that stream crashed now i am going to shut her down oh my god this does not track on the carpet i am hurting my chances here i would be still i'll be nervous if this happened to me so it's still we're still on base okay sure so this is this is a fair test we're at 11 seconds 12. oh my oh 40 seconds 40 seconds then i be logged in the next thing i want to do is i want to shut it down and then i want to get everything hooked back up did you ever have the front usbc working you know what no okay well that makes sense oh oh no i think it was facing the wrong way so if you went hard and tried to put that in there okay can you see how all the little ends you can see all the little pins sticking out of the little ends there they're either crunched or they're burned oh my god i see them yeah oh wow you think that's it that's it so i think what happened was you pushed on it and then those wires are probably shorted and that's why i couldn't find it because i only looked at these ones down here because i was trying to chase down that red herring there oh okay yeah one that had the the leads coming off because i thought maybe that's what shorted but it was the usb type-c connector so we don't get to blame asus for your problems because you can see i had to bend it back the other way in order to put this in here we got it like mysteries i don't like mystery problems because then if it's solved but you don't know what you did you don't you don't know how to reproduce it and it could come back there's not a lot of other wires i feel like that are that are similar to that one is that one you is there a new thing it's pretty new yeah now you do you not hook up your reset switch is that a conscious decision because you don't want to bump it the reset switch is this one right here it just hard reset the system so in terms of the the little connectors is it bing bing bang i only did one square one square one rectangle you had your power switch and your power led plug do so would you like your reset switch and your drive activity led because i'm here and i can do it really easily no you do not want them no even the driving activity no i was really worried that we were just gonna like come all the way out here and i'm gonna go yes and show them the clip oh okay you wanna see something oh no my brother in christ what are you doing did everyone go in and it worked out if you don't have a dremel yep yeah it's called percussive maintenance oh there's a word for that yeah i found an extra thumb screw in the bottom of your case that's what was rattling around before oh yeah yeah good we've liberated that no i found it already i found it yeah i'm not serious they're using an old phone okay so what gpu do you want to put in here i'm not i'm not i'm not gonna i'm not gonna you know suck you guys dry don't worry about it okay well wait he wouldn't even let me send him a screwdriver okay fair enough well you open the box already micro center said goodbye to everything that i left the store okay uh micro center for the the gpu we're very very thankful that we could have a a test pc then well i mean we'll end up using it but yeah these gpus though right they are massive is this ridiculous or what like you could kill a man no no i don't die i would die i'm impressed you were able to fit those in and as you plug them in without losing your mind it took me about an hour and my hands were bleeding i had i was bleeding if you build a computer and you don't bleed a little it has i don't know did you really build a computer okay where's my back panel at you know what no that's bad gbs especially when you're tucking all the water and you're pushing them in yeah yeah everything's one of these videos with like like the trains whatever and the table in we're not gonna do that we're gonna peel this spicy card love it hey thanks micro center do you keep your start menu in the center or do you move it over to the left i'm more of a left eye but now i'm learning to use this new thing i guess middle because you can move it oh if you want it on the left yeah okay sometimes you don't you don't you don't want to have like live leaks whenever you're streaming right and there has been some incidents recently that have not gone over very well with that sort of thing about that i didn't i've not heard about anything like that though yeah i don't even i don't even know what you know anyone's talking about what yeah what what sorry what okay so this is it this is your one free one next time it's gonna cost you if i have to fly down here again no chicken no no driving on the ground then i think i think i'm good to leave it like that just plug it in and never touch it just don't touch it should we run at least one game just to make sure it like doesn't you know whatever you know what i'm gonna grab a quick application that's just gonna test a little bit of our temperatures and all that hardware info 64. it's called torture test cpu 100 no thermal throttling this is what i like to see what does that do like applications that just do nothing it's calculating prime prime numbers yeah so it's got there's other stuff like that like you can calculate pi to like you know hundreds and thousands or millions in decimals and it'll just it'll just flood your cp you with like calculations and help cause it to heat up i'm busy mining but nothing i guess so yeah that's one way of looking at it this is a good looking game it is a good looking game what it's actually stable 60 it's not really going down from 60 and it's like super harder quality and don't forget i cranked the render resolution yeah man the the physics of these like ladders falling apart okay that's not how wood works i mean they look more like you know styrofoam or whatever but still it's kind of cool the way they fall apart yep it gets warm in here it does i really like your acoustic treatment by the way in here you've got oh yeah three pillows on that wall and then you got some mattresses over here with skelly this is not just one though and there's there's a mattress behind the dock which is which is great it's your body pillow our cpu capped out at 85 during that test i'm not worried about the cpu though i want to see your gpu hit 56. okay we're good then we're good yeah come down like best to hug me yeah it's embarrassing it's emasculating thank you very much thanks andy and filming everything and thanks to our sponsor thanks micro center for sponsoring today's video february is
