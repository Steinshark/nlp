hello everyone and welcome hello everyone and welcome hello everyone and welcome hello everyone and welcome hello everyone and welcome hello everyone and welcome hello everyone and welcome hello everyone and welcome hello everyone and welcome hey everyone now in this video i'll be explaining the purpose of a turbo and how it creates more power 10 years as of june 24th 2021 the youtube channel engineering explained it's officially 10 years old really excited about this so this started out as something to do in my free time during a college internship the summer before my senior year of college i then went on to work for an engineering company for two years and i kept making videos throughout those three years and eventually quit my engineering job and started this full-time in 2014 and here we are in 2021 10 years after starting still creating content and all kinds of crazy things have happened to me as a result of creating this channel it's been really exciting i've been really fortunate and what i've been able to do because of this channel and it's just it's just super exciting to be celebrating this milestone of 10 years 869 videos over half a billion views 3 million subscribers you know if you take the total number of video views you divide that by the total number of videos the average video doing over 600 000 views over half a million views on average per video and one of the things i think that gets overlooked with youtube is that if it's a platform where you're posting every week and for the first seven to eight years i was posting two videos a week and then for the last two years i've been doing a video every week and i'm pretty confident i've never missed a single week in doing so i think people don't think about all the things that happen in a normal life that you try not to present on camera like getting sunburned for example it's like well you know obviously skin cancer is bad but i also don't want to be this like blood red face on camera so you have to you know keep up with that sort of thing i always get the flu like i always get the flu so you know just having to know that hey at some point i'm going to get the flu and yet i'm still going to try and put out a video that week i had surgery i have a terrible right shoulder i had surgery on my right shoulder and i was in a sling for four weeks it was supposed to be six weeks but i was in a sling for four weeks and it's like i still put out a video every single one of those weeks because i thought ahead of time okay i've got to plan out these videos and i don't think ever watching you'd be like oh like that dude can't use his right arm so it's it's cool to you know behind the scenes there's a lot going on but on the outside it looks like oh like this guy's just putting out a video every week and you don't even think twice about it but i'm proud of the fact that i've actually been able to do it over these past 10 years now i thought about listing like all the different topics that i've covered on this channel but that's a bit silly to do but it has been really cool i mean i've done everything starting from the tires the wheels the brakes working your way through the suspension all different types of suspension variants out there looking at differentials drivetrains all-wheel drive four-wheel drive two-wheel drive front-wheel drive rear-wheel drive mid-engine placement you know talking about all kinds of different engine topics transmission topics electric cars electric car batteries electric car motors and then also driving all kinds of really cool cars experiencing all kinds of different things talking about unique topics within this world of automotive engineering getting to talk with all kinds of professional engineers within this world it's been absolutely wild and all just kind of a result of this youtube channel which is just amazing and one of the common questions i get you know when i'm speaking with people face to face was like oh like what's the coolest thing you've gotten to experience or drive or that kind of thing and i usually always go back to the same experience which was flying in a red bull air race plane with kirby chambliss it was absolutely insane in competition these planes are doing like 12 g's in the plane we were flying in we were maxing around you know seven g's which is still insane and definitely close enough to get me to almost pass out and then kirby chambliss would level the plane and be like jason you're all right and i'd be like and then he'd go right back into something insane so flying in that plane was just absolutely nuts and one of the funny things about that story is that when i showed up to ride in the plane there was a journalist laying on the ground and i was like oh like what's up with this guy why is this guy laying on the ground is he okay and they're like oh he just did his ride along and i was like oh like like when was his ride along and they were like an hour ago this guy had been laying on the ground for an hour after this experience that's how kind of wild and intense it is and then you know in the real world when this guy's actually flying this plane kirby chambliss like he's experiencing 12 g's in competition it's absolutely insane so not even car related but that's probably my wildest experience as a result of engineering explained yeah right now immediately after getting out of i just feel a little nauseous now over the years of running this channel i've got to own what i think are some really cool cars my first car was an acura integra 1999 acura integra i did a bunch of videos on it a lot of project videos learned a bunch and also had the car stolen which wasn't that cool next i moved on to my first new car purchase which was a 2014 subaru wrx sdi hatch absolutely love the way that thing looks i love the way that it sounds on paper and i love its all-wheel drive system and aside from that i don't have super strong feelings about the subaru sti hatch do love the way it looks so from that i moved on i got a subaru crosstrek which is the greatest vehicle of all time still have that it's the longest i've owned any brand new car from buying it new though i owned the integra for maybe nine or ten years after buying the crosstrack i bought a 2002 honda s2000 revs to 9000 rpm i did about 40 videos on this car learned a time did all kinds of really cool testing with it brakes engine modifications like a supercharger really cool vehicle and then i added to the fleet a 2018 tesla model 3 mid-range which i did not own for very long about two weeks and then i sold it back to tesla and instead got a 2018 tesla model 3 performance which i still have absolutely love i think it's one of the best daily drivers you can get it's absolutely phenomenal and then i ended up selling my s2000 and then i bought another s2000 that's what we're sitting in right now so a yellow supercharged s2000 this time a root supercharger instead of a centrifugal supercharger which i like quite a bit more it's got a nice mid-range to it really fun absolutely love this 2016 mazda miata and i think truthfully like as far as value-based garages go because i'm an engineer at heart and so i take value into consideration value-based garage i think this is one of the perfect garages perfect three-car garages with the tesla model 3 performance the 2016 mazda mx-5 and the subaru crosstrek i can pretty much cover all of my needs with this three-core fleet and more than just needs it's it's a lot of just having fun really with the mazda and with the tesla now one thing i do want to talk about which i feel there's just this connection between as my channel engineering explained and the movie franchise my favorite movie franchise fast and furious so i don't actually have any real connections to fast and furious but i feel like there has been a link and that started you know i always loved these movies i kind of grew up you know going to theaters and seeing these movies i've been at most of them on opening night i love the fast and furious movies and actually on november 30th 2013 my channel hit 100 000 subscribers it's on november 30th 2013 i threw a party and i had a projector in my apartment that was going to be showing one of the fast and furious movies i was really excited about it of course you gotta have fast and furious in the background during a party and unfortunately if you if you remember your history you remember people and dates and things like that november 30th 2013 was the day that paul walker died and that really tore me up i didn't end up showing the movie you know it was it really hurt me and and you know it's it's kind of silly because like i don't actually know this person but but i really enjoyed these movies and so you know having that linked with like the day that i hit 100 000 which is a major milestone on youtube it's the first reward they give you a silver play button when you hit a hundred thousand and then having that happen on that day was like it was tough i you know i feel for that family and for the people involved that knew him personally it just it sucks you know but actually as a result of this channel i've gotten to meet some really cool people including some of the people involved in the fast and furious world including even cody walker paul walker's brother so i've gotten to know him he invited me to fuel fest down in los angeles it was really cool to experience and hang out with him i've also gotten to meet sung kang who played han in tokyo drift incredible guy both of these guys just incredible warm people you feel like you're their friend the second you meet them just really great guys that i've been able to meet because of this channel which is really cool and tying this all back to fast and furious june 24th 2021 the day my channel turns ten years old is the debut of fast and furious nine now ten and nine okay slightly different numbers but technically this is the tenth installment of the fast and furious franchise if you include the hobs and shaw movies so i'm very excited that i get to celebrate my 10-year anniversary by going to the midnight premiere of fast and furious 9. i also want to touch on the youtube algorithm because youtube of course in the past 10 years has changed quite a bit and so if i go back to my original videos the title would be something very simple like carburetors explained that was it and the thumbnail was a photo of me sitting in front of a white board like a dork still doing that today but youtube used to be this very subscriber friendly very search friendly platform where most views came from subscribers and came from youtube as a search platform so you were looking up topics and then those topics will pop up and you would watch them that changed quite a bit and for me i would say i noticed it the most around 2016 but basically now the way that youtube works is it's very home page friendly rather than search based so most views the vast majority of views come from the home page not from people searching at least this is true for my own content even though i feel like my content is kind of this evergreen stuff where you know it's explaining how stuff works like it's always relevant but most views actually come from the home page so you click youtube.com it shows you a bunch of pictures of fun videos you select which one you want to watch that's how people watch videos now and unfortunately it means my old method of you know use this dorky photo of me in a simple title like carburetors explain it just isn't competitive anymore because when that little crappy photo is put up next to all the flashy images that everybody likes to make and the fun titles that people like to make it's not competitive people don't click it and so because people don't click it youtube doesn't recommend it and then it doesn't get any views right so you have to go into this new modern era of youtube where the title is extremely important the thumbnail is extremely important the content obviously is important but you really have to focus on those previous two more than you did previously because that's how you remain relevant because that's how youtube is you know getting views now it's all through the home page so you know i used to not even edit my videos i would literally chop the beginning chop the end i wouldn't even watch them i just put them up after you know trimming the beginning event everything done in one take and now it's a much more you know curated process because it's a much more competitive platform so you gotta up your game and i'm okay with that but definitely you have to change in order to remain relevant and speaking of this relevancy like around 2009 i was kind of getting burnt out on the platform i'd been doing two videos a week for about eight years and it's tough it's tough to make two videos a week i'm not saying like i have the hardest job in the world or anything like that i'm very grateful for what i get to do but after you do it for eight years straight two videos a week you know it can take a little bit of a toll on you and so i was like all right i'm going to cut back and i'm going to switch to one video a week so i did that in 2019 but i had a huge fear of irrelevancy of becoming irrelevant because youtube rewards quantity youtube rewards you know if you have a high output youtube likes that youtube likes to see you putting out content all the time so i was very scared to go down to that one a week and i was doing it for you know work-life balance reasons but in reality what i ended up doing is you know just working more making longer videos including more information so my actual amount of work didn't really change all that much my output went down but not really based on time the videos were longer and they included more information but i was fearful of that change and actually it turned out people still watch my videos so i'm very thankful that even though i dropped my output people stuck around they still watch the content youtube still recommended it because you're kind of at the mercy of this youtube algorithm i mean if they decide they don't like you like that's it goodbye you know people say like click the bell smash the like button all that nonsense of subscribe it's like you're all adults i'm not gonna tell you what to do you figure out what to do you're capable of clicking the buttons that you want to click so i don't like telling people that kind of stuff at the same time it's like i'm completely at youtube's mercy right and so those things are genuinely helpful if people do them so yeah it's this like battle of like do you tell people this nonsense got something in my mouth all of this is to say is that there was this fear of irrelevancy of changing the content output and actually i'm going to change that again and it's with the original goal of maintaining a good work-life balance which i don't feel like i do great at now and so i'm going to test around with changing my output and probably going down to a video every other week so one video per two weeks and probably changing from wednesday to friday i like the idea of like if i start working on a monday i need to have the video out by friday i like that mentality so i'm thinking about going to every other week and doing fridays and then there's probably going to be some random videos thrown in in between when there's like embargoed content test drives that sort of thing or just random things that i want to get out in a timely fashion but that's what i'm looking at going towards now i have to say i absolutely love learning i'm a very curious individual and i love teaching things that i learn and i think this is kind of a whole community of like-minded people that are very curious and they like learning and i'm so thankful for this community and i'm thankful for all of you i hate saying things like my fans it sounds like the most pretentious thing in the world to claim ownership over a bunch of independent people that watch all kinds of stuff not just this channel but to the audience out there that is curious and that they have found you know things they've learned things from these videos and they've enjoyed watching these videos a tremendous thank you for allowing me to have this very cool job do very cool things learn about very interesting stuff all because you all are willing to watch it and share it and learn and discuss with me in the comments and correct me when i'm wrong you know it's kind of like this hive mind where i actually get to learn a lot from you guys as well in return because if i ever say anything inaccurate it's like very quickly it can be pointed out in the comments because if i post a video about you know a certain subject and 200 000 people watch that video well someone's going to know that subject way better than i am within that group of 200 000 and so it's very it's cool that you have this community that like keeps you honest right it's like you have to be correct otherwise you get called out immediately i like that i think that's a really neat system and admittedly it does start to feel really weird when you get to these big numbers like you know the average video getting six hundred thousand views or you know three million subscribers or half a billion total channel views it's like these numbers don't really mean anything to me anymore and it kind of starts to feel robotic you're like is it real like especially you know during this past pandemic where you're just sitting at home and it's like are these numbers actually real but when you go out into the real world and i see people they come up to me and they say like hey like you've got that white board engineering explain like really love the channel like the the videos that you put out it's like there are real people watching this and it's a nice little reminder of like people actually do enjoy this and it's it's cool it's very cool and i'm grateful for this platform to be able to do it it's it's a fun really neat thing that i get to call a job so i'm gonna close this in the same robotic fashion that i close all of my videos if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching
