so i've just had a conversation with someone who is known around the world for leaking smartphones early and from it i've got some really interesting exclusive information about the samsung galaxy note 10 and we're gonna get to all of it but first of all what is already common knowledge is that the note 10 will be in a lot of ways based on the s 10 but better and at this point we're also pretty sure that this means multiple models you might remember last year samsung released two primary flagship phones the s9 and the s9 plus and then at the end of the year they released one phone their finale the galaxy note 9 but this year they've gone from two to four primary flagship smartphones and it's looking like they're going from one to at least three phones in their note lineup take a look at this tweet is from renowned leaker ice universe he mentions the product code name but more interestingly the words note 10 pro 4g which tells us two things that there's probably gonna be a bass version of the note 10 followed by a pro model with 4g like we saw with the s 10 plus but then an even more souped-up version with 5g well some leaks are even suggesting there's going to be another smaller note 10 phone alongside these three which would make four devices in total ice universe also mentions a massive 4,500 milliamp hour battery and 25 watt fast charging which you know seems reasonable considering that something has other devices already that can do this but here's where it gets interesting after posting this tweet nice universe then follows up saying that the 25 watt fast charging is probably the wrong message which is disappointing because of course samsung could probably do with a bit of a boost when it comes to charging speed so i sent him a message i asked if he knew any more about the note 10 then he'd shared already and it turns out he does the first thing he said was that he retracted his original statement not because the pros charging power is going to be less than 25 watts but because it's going to be more so from there we can be pretty sure that the note emperor is going to be the fastest charging samsung phone ever it could be 30 watt charging it could be 50 watt charging the final number just kind of depends on how many resources samsung puts towards it the second thing is that in addition the note 10 has only one hole which is smaller than the s hen and this kind of lines up perfectly with something he publicly mentioned earlier so on april 25th he tweeted that da vinci is symmetrical completely cryptic and pretty meaningless until you realize that da vinci is the code name of this phone and so he's told us that there's going to be a punch hole he's told us that the design is going to be symmetrical and so assuming this is true you're gonna see a small cutout in the middle which is not my preferred position but depending on how small they can make it it might just blend into your status bar the final detail i got from ice universe is the fact that there's going to be a large change on the back and the way i see it this could mean a few different things number one a new type of finish some sort of new texture or new gradient that we've not seen before number two it could be a big change to the cameras maybe the addition of a time-of-flight sensor on all models of phone or maybe a more powerful camera zoom or number three is a potential rearrangement of the camera module if you compare the galaxy s 8 plus to the note 8 then the galaxy s 9 plus to the note 9 you can see that each time the note has adopted a new shape to the camera module so that's completely possible again here it would help to visually differentiate these new phones from their s10 lineup now there are also a couple of wacky theories about the note 10 that it might ditch physical buttons altogether in place of virtual buttons that still give you haptic feedback which to be fair could be quite interesting it might mean that you're able to adjust the position of buttons and decide which ones you want to keep and which ones you don't there's also been talk about having the front camera instead built into the s-pen which is one of those crazy ideas which grows on you the more you think about it it could mean no punch hole at all on the front of the phone but yeah i don't buy it apart from the fact that the processing power needed to take these photos is housed in the smartphone itself and not the pen could you imagine how fiddly it would be to try and fiddle around with a stylus to take a photo anyways the general specs of the note temp pro are shaping up to be as you can probably imagine beastly aside from what we've already mentioned it's gonna have eight gigs of ram on the base model going up to 12 a six point seven five inch quad hd plus amoled display and the sinagra can 855 if you're in the us or x in asik evelynn in other regions and there is actually talk of samsung using an upgraded exynos chip compared to the one we saw on the s10 which wouldn't be like a complete next-generation makeover but would be at least enough to put the two versions on par because when it comes to the s10 the exynos version was noticeably less good than that snapdragon 1 anyways as soon as i get some more information i will try and get you guys another exclusive update so if you could subscribe for that that'd be amazing also just bear in mind that whilst the stuff in this video is looking quite likely right now based on the sources you can never be sure we're still very much in the leaks and rumors phase as always my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss i don't catch you in the next one [music] you
