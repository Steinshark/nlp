this idea of of disk i distributed idea suppression complex yeah is that what's bringing the e laws of the world down you know so funny it's like he's asking joe rogan like is that a joint you know it's like well what will happen if i smoke it what will happen to the stock price what will happen if i scratch myself in public what will happen if i say what i think about thailand or kovat or who knows what and everybody's like don't say that say this go do this go do that well it's crazy-making it's absolutely crazy making and if you think about what we put through people through we need to get people who can use fu money the fu money they need to insulate themselves from all of the people who know better because the my nightmare is is that why did we only get one ilan what if we were supposed to have thousands and thousands of yuan and the weird thing is like this is all that remains you're looking at like obi-wan and yoda and it's like this is the only this is all that's left after x order 66 has been executed and that's the thing that's really upsetting to me is we used we used to have ilan's five deep and then we could talk about elon in the context of his cohort but this is like if you were to see a giraffe in the arctic with no trees around you'd think why the long neck what a strange sight you know how do we get more lawns how do we change things so i think the useful so we know mit yeah and harvard so can maybe returning to our previous conversation my sense is that the laws of the world are supposed to come from mit in harvard right and how do you change let's think of one that mit sort of killed have any names in mind aaron schwartz leaps to my mind yeah okay are we mit supposed to shield the aaron schwartz's from i don't know journal publishers or are we supposed to help the journal publishers so that we can throw 35-year sentences in his face or whatever it is that we did that depressed him okay so here's my point yeah i want mit to go back to being the home of aaron schwartz and if you want to send aaron schwartz to a state where he's looking at 35 years in prison or something like that you are my sworn enemy you are not mit yeah you are the traitorous irresponsible middlebrow pencil-pushing green eyeshade fool that needs to not be in the seat at the presidency of mit period the end get the  out of there and let one of our people sit in that chair and think that you've articulated is that the people in those chairs are not the way they are because they're evil or somehow morally compromised is that it's just that that's the distributed nature is that there's some kind of aspect of the system there's people who width em selves to the system they adapt every instinct and the fact is is that they're not going to be on joe rogan smoking a blunt let me ask a silly question do you think institutions generally just tend to become that no we get some of the institution's we get caltech here's what we're supposed to have we're supposed to have caltech we're supposed to have a reed we're supposed to have deep springs we're supposed to have mit we're supposed to have a part of harvard and when the sharp elbow crowd comes after the scheldt sharp mind crowd we're supposed to break those sharp elbows and say don't come around here again so what are the weapons that the sharp minds are supposed to use in our modern day so to reclaim mit what is the what's the future are you kidding me first of all assume that this is being seen at mit hey everybody is ok hey everybody try to remember who you are you're the guys who put the police car on top of the great dump you you guys came up with the great breasts of knowledge you created a tetris game in the green building now what is your problem they killed one of your own you should make their life a living hell you should be the ones who keep the mayor memory of aaron schwartz alive and all of those hackers and all of those mutants you know it's like it's either our place or it isn't and if we have to throw 12 more pianos off of the roof right if harold edgerton is taking those photographs you know with slow mo back in the 40s if noam chomsky's on your faculty what the hell is wrong with you kids you are the most creative and insightful people and you can't figure out how to defend aaron schwartz that's on you guys so some of that is giving more power to the young like you said you know it's a training towel drop taking power from the feeble and the middle brow yeah but how do you what is the mechanism to me i don't know you you have some 9-volt batteries no i copper wire i attend to you have a capacitor i tend to believe you have to create an alternative and make the alternative so much better that it makes mit absolutely unless they change and that's what forces change so as opposed to somehow okay so use projection mapping what's projection mapping where you take some complicated edifice and you map all of its planes and then you actually project some unbelievable graphics re skinning a building let's say at night say okay so you want to do some graffiti art with you basically want to hack the system know what i say look listen to me lee yeah we're smarter than they are and they you know what they say they say things like i think we need some geeks get me to phd's right you treat phd's like that that's a bad move because hd's are capable and we act like our job is to peel grapes for our betters yeah that that's a strange thing and i you speak about it very eloquently is how we treat basically the greatest minds in the world which is like at at their prime which is phd students like that we pay them nothing we i'm done with it yeah right we gotta take what's ours so it's oh yeah take back mit become uncover nerble become uncover noble and by the way when you become uncover nerble don't do it by throwing food don't do it by pouring salt on the lawn like a jerk do it through brilliance because what you caltech and mit can do and maybe rensselaer polytechnic or worcester politic i don't know lehigh goddamnit what's wrong with you technical people you act like you're a servant class it's unclear to me how you reclaim it except with brilliance like you said but to me that the way you were claiming was brilliance the goron system aaron schwartz came from the elon musk class what you guys gonna do about it right there super capable people need to flex need to be individual they need to stop giving away all their power to you know is like geist or a community or this or that you're not you're not indoor cats you're outdoor cats go be outdoor cat do you think we're gonna see this this kind of asking me you know before like what about the world war two generation what i'm trying to say is that there's a technical revolt coming here's you want to talk about that i'm trying to lead it yeah i'm trying to see no you're not trying i'm trying to get a blueprint here alright lex yeah how angry are you about our country pretending that you and i can't actually do technical subjects so that they need an army of kids coming in from four countries in asia it's not about the four countries in asia it's not about those kids it's about lying about us that we're don't care enough about science and technology that we're incapable of it as if we don't have chinese and russians and koreans and croatians like we've got everybody here the only reason you're looking outside is is that you want to hire cheap people from the family business because you don't want to pass the family business on and you know what you didn't really build the family business it's not yours to decide you the boomers and you the silent generation you did your bit but you also followed a lot of stuff up and your custodians you are caretakers you were supposed to hand something what you did instead was to gorge yourself on cheap foreign labor but you then held up as being much more brilliant than your own children which was never true but i'm trying to understand how we create a better system without anger without revolution no not not by kissing and hugs and and but by i mean i don't understand within mit what the mechanism of building a better on my tee is we're not gonna pay elsevier aaron schwartz was right jstor is an abomination but why who would then mit who within institutions is going to do that when just like you said the people who are running the show are more senior and if frank will check to speak out so your is basically individuals that step up i mean one of the surprising things about elon is that one person can inspire so much he's got academic freedom it just comes from money i don't agree with that do you think money okay so yes certainly sorry an testicle yuva yes but those are more important than money right or guts i i think i do agree with you you speak about this a lot that because the money in the academic institutions has been so constrained that people are misbehaving in in in horrible yes but i don't think that if we reverse that and give a huge amount of money people will also behave well i think it also takes guts so you need to get people security security yeah like you need to know there you have a job yeah on monday when on friday you say i'm not so sure i really love diversity and inclusion and somebody's looking weak what you didn't love diverse we had a statement diversity and you wouldn't sign are you against the inclusion part or are you against diverse do you just not like people like you like actually that has nothing to do with anything you're making this into something that it isn't i don't want to sign your goddamn stupid statement and get out of my lab right get out of my lab it all begins from the middle finger get out of my lab the administrators need to find other work yeah listen i agree with you and i i hope to seek your advice and and wisdom as we change this because i'd love to see i will visit you in prison if that's what you're asking i have no i think prison is great you get a lot of reading done and then when good working out well let me ask the something i brought up before is the nietzsche quote of beware that when fighting monsters you yourself do not become a monster for when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss gazes into you are you worried that your focus on the flaws in the system that we've just been talking about has damaged your mind or the part of the mind of your mind that's able to see the beauty in the world in the system that because you have so sharply been able to see the flaws in the system you can no longer step back and appreciate it speeding look i'm the one who's trying to get the institutions to save themselves by getting rid of their inhabitants believing the institution like a neutron bomb that removes the unworkable leadership class but leaves the structures so i emo so the leadership classes really the problem the leadership class is that the individual like the professors the individual scholar the professors are gonna have to go back into training to remember how to be professors like people are cowards at the moment because if they're not cowards they're unemployed yeah that's one of the disappointing things i've encountered is to me tenure they don't nobody has tenure now well whether they do or not they certainly don't have character not the kind of character and and fortitude that i was hoping to see to me but they'd be gone but see you're dreaming about the people who used to live at mit you're dreaming about the previous inhabitants of your university and if you looked at somebody like you know isadora singer is very old i don't know what state he's in but that guy was absolutely the real deal and if you look at noam chomsky tell me that noam chomsky has been muzzled right yeah now what i'm trying to get at is you're talking about younger energetic people but those people like when i say something like i'm against i'm for word inclusion and i'm for diversity but i'm against diversity and inclusion tm like the movement well i couldn't say that if i was a professor oh my god he's against our sacred document okay well in that kind of a world do you want to know how many things i don't agree with you want it like we could go on for days and days and days all of the nonsense that you've parroted inside of the institution any sane person like has no need for it they have no want or desire do you think you have to have some patience for nonsense when many people work together in a system how long a string theory going on for and how long have i been patient okay so you're talking about limit to patience i'm talking about like 36 years of modern nonsense and string theory say you can do like eight to ten years but not more i can do 40 minutes this is 30 so now over two hours or no but i appreciate it but it's been 36 years of nonsense since the anomaly cancellation in string theory it's like what are you talking about about patience i mean lex you're not even acting like yourself now at what you're trying to stay in the system and i'm not sure i'm not i'm trying to see it perhaps so so my hope is that the system just has a few in it which you highlight and the fundamentals of the system are broken because if the fundamentals of the systems are broken then i just don't see a way for my teachers to succeed like i don't see how young people take over mit i don't see how by inspiring us you know the great part about being at mit like when you saw that the genius in these pranks the heart the irreverence yeah it's like don't do it then we were talking about tom lehrer the last time tom lehrer was as naughty as the day is long agreed agreed was he also a genius was he well-spoken was he highly cultured he was so talented so intellectual that he could just make fart jokes morning noon and night yeah okay well in part the right to make fart jokes the right to for example put a functioning phone booth that was ringing on top of the great dome at mit has to do with we are such badasses that we can actually do this stuff well don't tell me about it anymore go break the law go break the law in a way that inspires us and makes us not want to prosecute you may break the law in a way that lets us know that you're calling us out on our that you're filled with love and that our technical talent has not gone to sleep it's not incapable you know and if the idea is is that you're gonna dig a moat around the university and fill it with tiger sharks that's awesome because i don't know how you're gonna do it but if you actually managed to do that i'm not going to prosecute prosecute you under a reckless endangerment man that's beautifully put i hope those first of all i listen i hope young people and mighty will take over in this in this kind of way in the introduction to your podcast episode on jeffrey epstein you give to me a really moving story but unfortunately for me to brief about your experience with a therapist and the lasting terror that permeated your mind can you can you go there can you tell i don't think so i mean i appreciate what you're saying i said it obliquely i said enough there are bad people who cross our paths and the current vogue is to say oh i'm a survivor i'm a victim i can do anything i want this is a broken person and i don't know why i was sent to a broken person as a kid and to be honest with you i also felt like in that story i say that i was able to say no you know and this was like the entire weight of authority and he was misusing his position and i was also able to say no what i couldn't say no to was having him reinf lichte din my life i see you were sent back yeah second time i tried to complain about what had happened i tried to do it in a way that did not immediately cause horrific consequences to both this person and myself because i didn't we don't have the tools to deal with sexual misbehavior we have nuclear weapons we don't have any way of saying this is probably not a good place or a role for you at this moment as an authority figure and something needs to be worked on so in general when we see somebody who is misbehaving in that way our immediate instinct is to treat the person as you know satan and we understand why we don't want our children to be at risk now i personally believe that i fell down on the job and did not call out the jeffrey epstein thing early enough because i was terrified of what jeffrey epstein represents and this recapitulated the old terror trying to tell the world this therapist is out of control and when i said that the world responded by saying well you have two appointments booked and you have to go for the second one so i got reinfected into this office on this person who was now convinced that i was about to tear down his career and his reputation it might have been on the verge of suicide for all i know i don't know but he was very very angry and he was furious with me that i had breached a sacred confidence of his office what kind of ripple effects does that have has that head to the rest of your life the absurdity and the cruelty of that i mean there's no sense to it well see this is the thing people don't really grasp i think there's an academic who i got to know many years ago named jennifer fried who has a theory of betrayal which she calls institutional betrayal and her gambit is is that when you were betrayed by an institution that is sort of like a fiduciary or a parental obligation to take care of you that you find yourself in a far different situation with respect to trauma than if you were betrayed by somebody who's a peer and so i think that my in my situation i kind of repeat a particular dynamic with authority i come in not following all the rules trying to do some things not trying to do others blah blah blah and then i get into a weird relationship with authority and so i have more experience with what i would call institutional betrayal now the funny part about it is that when you don't have masks or ppe in a influenza-like pandemic and you're missing icu beds and ventilators that is ubiquitous you institutional betrayal so i believe that in a weird way i was very early the idea of and this is like tough the really hard concept pervasive or otherwise universal institutional betrayal or all of the institution's you can count on any hospital to not charge you properly for where their services are you can count on no pharmaceutical company to produce the drug that will be maximally beneficial to the people who take it you know that your financial professionals are not simply working in your best interest and that issue had to do with the way in which growth left of our system so i think that the weird thing is is that this first institutional betrayal by a therapist left me very open to the idea of okay well maybe the schools are bad maybe the hospitals are bad maybe the drug companies are bad maybe our food is off maybe our journalists are not serving journalistic ends and that was what allowed me to sort of go all the distance and say huh i wonder if our problem is that something is causing all of our sense making institutions to be off that was the big insight and that tying that to a single ideology what if it's just about growth they were all built on growth and now we've promoted people who are capable of keeping quiet that their institutions aren't working so we've the privileged silent aristocracy the people who can be counted upon not to mention a fire when a raging fire is tearing through a building but nevertheless it's how big of a psychological burden is that it's huge it's terrible i mean rushing it's it's very it's very comforting to be the parental i mean i don't know i i treasure i mean we were just talking about mit we can until i can intellectualize and agree with everything you're saying but there's a comfort a warm blanket of being within the institution and up until him aaron schwartz let's say in other words now if i look at the provost and the president as mommy and daddy you did what to my big brother you did what to our family you sold us out in which way what secrets left for china you hired which workforce you did what to my wages you took this portion of my grant for what purpose you just stole my retirement were fringy what did you do but can you still i mean the thing is about this view you have is it often turns out to be sadly correct well this is the thing and but that let me just in this silly hopeful thing do you still have hope and institution see you can you win your cycle psychologically yes i'm referring not intellectually because you've had to carry this burden can you still have a hope like within you jake that when you sit a home alone and as opposed to seeing the darkness within these institutions seeing a hope well but this is the thing i want to confront not for the purpose of a dust-up i believe for example if you've heard episode 19 that the best outcome is for carol greider to come forward as we discussed in episode 19 would your brother brett weinstein and say you know what so i screwed up he did call he did suggest the experiment i didn't understand that it was his theory that was producing it maybe i was slow to grasp it but my bad and i don't want to pay for this bad choice on my part let's say for the rest of my career i want to own up and i want to help make sure that we do what's right with what's left and that's one little case within an institution they would like to see me i would like to see mit very clearly come out and say you know margo o'toole was right when she said david baltimore's lab here produced some stuff that was not reproducible with teresa and minnie shakarez research i want to see the courageous people i would like to see aaron schwartz wing of the computer science department yeah wouldn't know let's think about it yeah wouldn't that be great if they said you know an injustice was done and we're gonna we're gonna write that wrong just as if this was alan turing which i don't think they've righted that wrong well then let's have the turing schwartz way to ensure they're starting a new college of computing it wouldn't be wonderful to call it the the toyish well i would like to have the madame wooing of the physics department and i'd love to have the emmy nerd er statue in front of the math department i mean like you want to get excited about actual diversity and inclusion yeah well let's go with our absolute best people who never got theirs because there is structural bigotry you know but if we don't actually start celebrating the beautiful stuff that we're capable of when we're handed heroes and we fumble them into the trash what the hell i mean lex this is such nonsense we just pulling our head out you know the on everyone's cecum should be tattooed if you can read this you're too close beautifully put and i'm a dreamer just like you so i don't see as much of the darkness genetically or due to my life experience but i do share the hope from my teeth institution that we care a lot about you both do yeah and harvard institution i don't give a damn about but you do so i love harvard i'm just kidding i love harvard but rude and i have a very difficult relationship and part of what you know when you love a family that isn't working i don't want to trash i i didn't bring up the name of the president of mit during the aaron schwartz period it's not vengeance i want the rot cleared out i don't need to go after human beings yeah just like you said with a disc formulation the individual human beings aren't don't necessarily carry them it's those chairs that are so powerful that in which they sit it's the chairs not the human it's not the humans you
