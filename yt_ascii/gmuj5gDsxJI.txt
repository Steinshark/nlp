the ethos of managerialism has supplanted the rule of law as the basic idea instead of the rule of law we have rule by law now which means that the law is nothing more than a tool that's i agile government it means the legislature is not taking on its role of making the rules and the the executive branch has taken over making the rules applying the rules and enforcing the rules all on its own and that that is not the way the western legal system used to [music] work hello everybody i have the opportunity today to speak with two guests constantine kizen who is co-host of the podast trigonometry in the uk popular podcast he is a speaker and a thinker who deals with cultureal war issues mostly political in so far as the cultural war issues are political my other guest is bruce party bruce is a professor at queens university professor of law at queens university in canada recently the trudeau woke mob has managed to extend themselves even further into the legal netherlands with a new bill called c63 which isn't law in canada yet but is soon likely to be and it is the most totalitarian western bill i've ever seen by quite a large margin and in multiple dimensions and that was my conclusion upon reading it and then my conclusion upon rereading it and rereading it again because i like to make sure i have these things right and i i thought i'd talk to bruce about it today along with constantine to see if my understanding of the bill is actually correct with regard to constantine how he sees what's happening in canada reflected in say scotland and in ireland in particular in the uk but also in in england and well that's the terrain we exploring so join us it'll be quite a ride so dr party i think we got in touch with each other again most recently because i was obsessing neurotically about a new canadian bill c63 which seemed to me to be a real masterpiece of right-thinking utopian resentful foolishness and i thought it would be real useful to talk to you about that to make sure that i understood it and but i thought i'd start our discussion or we could start a discussion today by going back into the past eight years into the legal domain in canada to discuss bill c16 because that's now eight years ago and and in in in some ways the bill that was at the origin of the current rat current rat's nest of pathological ic legislation in canada and so do you want to bring everybody up to date just to begin with or remind them or educate them about what bill c16 was and what the fears were at the time and whether or not those have been realized yes sure thanks jordan well c16 is when you and i met and you were concerned as i was and as others were not very many others mind you but a few others concerned that these proposed amendments to the canadian human rights act the inclusion of gender identity and gender expression would have an effect upon speech essentially to require people to use the preferred pronouns of other people and frankly the establishment types poo pooed the idea and called us fear fearmongers and of course that's turned out to be entirely untrue you were exactly right in your concerns that kind of amendment had been made before in provincial human rights codes but this was the the federal version but that's in there now and we have all kinds of pronoun trouble but the present bill that you're referred to c63 is c16 on steroids it's got three categories of bad in it one's an administrative bad one is a criminal code bad criminal law bad and the other one is again like c16 a canadian human rights act amendment so let me do the last one first and so what's the purported purpose purported well the purported purpose it it starts with the cover of protecting children right from online harm that's the first administrative bl who could possibly oppose that this is this is part of the beauty of the way they go about these things it's got great cover and nobody in their right mind would want to come out and say well that's not a bad that's that's not a good idea m but what that kind of cover enables is basically a a crackdown on the very idea of free speech so let's just take the the human rights aspect first they are returning to the canadian human rights act an old an old section that got thrown out got got repealed during the era of steven harper when harper was the prime minister and it was causing all kinds of nuisance it was the kind of section and other these kinds of sections also appear in the provincial codes every province and the federal government has their own human rights code and these codes not all of them but but typically include this kind of of restriction on speech you're not allowed to discriminate in your speech is what some of them say and this this section basically says that if you are if you use hateful speech that can be taken to vilify an individual or group then you will be acting discriminatorily and therefore in breach of the code and therefore potentially liable to any of the perceived victims and also potentially to the government itself and the one of the problems with the human rights regime is that complaints can be made very very easily without a lawyer without any cost so and because the canadian federal government has jurisdiction over the internet this section is going to authorize complaints of all kinds to be made against people who are speaking their minds online about any and everything so it's going to have a a chilling effect upon speech no question about it you put that together with the criminal code amendments those criminal code amendments make it well they do several things here's one extraordinary thing that it does it makes the sentence the maximum sentence for any violation of an offense like any offense any offense in the criminal code or under federal legislation any offense that is motivated by hatred will carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment right now the defenders of the bill say well don't worry the the judge isn't actually going to give you life that's not likely to happen and that may be true but that's not the point if you don't mean it in legislation then don't give the judge the power if it's in the law it's likely to happen if it's in the law it is going to happen sooner or later and it it is a signal about what is lawful and what is not and what the proper punishment should be and what is not so c63 is is a reflection of how just just one more reflection of how we have we are losing the law we are losing in c63 the idea of free speech itself you know that old quote that people always refer to from volt's biographer the one that goes i disagree with what you say but i'll defend to the death you're right to say i think the reason that that quote is trotted out so often is that when you come write down to it most people don't agree with that every everybody says they believe in free speech everybody justin trudeau has said he believes in free speech there's a guarantee of free speech in the chinese constitution right right okay it's very easy to say and what they really mean is yes i believe in free speech but yeah and it's within the butt whether you can find out whether or not they really do believe in free speech so for my money we shouldn't have a law that prohibits hate speech yeah hate speech is ugly but but people hate each other and if they're not allowed to say that they do well then their speech is not free so it's also a very difficult and challenging thing to make an emotion illegal so no doubt and of course the definition of what they mean by hate speech we get is i mean it's it's impossible to tell and it's going to be under the preview of the judge to decide in any particular case whether or not you've cross that threshold okay so let let's let's talk about the devil in the detail because the angel lurking over all of this is fundamentally we're protecting children from being exploited online okay so well there are children and they are exploited online and they deserve protection so that's all and and good what steps are taken in the bill to actually protect children who being exploited online and then how do we segue from that to hate like cuz those aren't the same universe these there there as i say there are three bits in the bill and they're they're in the same bill but they're they're distinct so there's the human rights aspect there's the criminal code aspect and then this third aspect which is primarily one that a that's aimed at the protecting kids is an administrative regime that gives an an agency the power essentially to supervise the online platforms but it also gives them the power to make the rules so we don't even know what the rules are going to be basically it just gives the whole control of the thing to to a government agency to the bureaucrats to do as they think best in the name establishing an entirely new bureaucracy exactly yes with an unspecified range of power with an non-specific purview that purports to protect children from online exploitation but but has the possibility of turning into a policing policing state for the for for the internet per se and this is often how the administrative work administrative state works right so this agency will not be policing citizens themselves directly but they'll be policing the online platforms and the platforms will will thereby censor the people who are using them so it's a it's a we're we're not doing it we're a hands off we're we're two steps removed situation but in in effect it is the government pulling the strings of the okay so to what degree do you think that even the setup of that new administrative bureaucracy which has very extensive powers and very poorly defined powers as far as i could tell when i read the bill yes how much of that do you think is actually devoted genuinely i know this is a judgment call obviously but you have to infer that from the legislation right if the legislation was honest and well written it would very specifically target the target of it purported reason for existence yes right if it if if it was designed for example to produce a more general regime for online policing is to me that's what it looks like and if so is that a consequence of poor legislative design is it a consequence of intent like what do you think's going on there well it's what's going on there is what's been going on inside our law with respect to empowering the administrative state for a long long time right so standard legislation now at either the federal or provincial level is authorizing legislation meaning you pass a bill about a certain subject and it might contain some rules in it but it also contains the authority the delegation of authority to the bureaucrats to an agency of some kind to the minister or to whoever to a to a human rights commission to make policies or guidelines or regulations about certain things and you can't tell by reading the statute what the rulle are and and so you've you've transferred legislative authority essentially from the legislature to the to the bureaucracy and and this is not this is not the this is not the bureaucracy stealing it this is the legislature giving it because they don't want the responsibility of doing it and they don't and they don't want to have to go through the minutia of figuring out what the right rules are so they just they just shove it off into the back rooms and this is the way the administrator state works now it's a it's if i can stay it's a kind of collusion between the legislature and the courts so the courts okay we have these three branches of the government yes we have the legislature we have the courts and we have the administrative state and you know the division between them is cleanest in the american version of things but we in canada and the uk we have them as well and the legislature and the courts are together supposed to be supervising with the executive branch the administrative state is doing because the general rule is supposed to be the administration which used to be the king after all can't do anything that's not authorized by the legislature okay so these three things are checks and balances on each other yeah but now they're all on the same page and the courts and the legislature are convinced about the need for this expansive overwhelming administrative state and so instead of supervising the administrative branch and the courts instead of making sure that they stick within their powers the legislator is delegating to it and the courts are deferring to it and so what we end up with and the legislators don't have to take responsibil exactly in any in either way because we don't and we we can't find who's responsible anymore yeah right it's it's all sort of a mystery it's a it's a moving ball it's it's and this is this is the way administrative agencies and government departments and ministries can be quote agile they want to be agile they want to be able to respond to societal problems quickly right well if you're able to respond quickly that means you have the legislative power in your hands and that nobody else knows exactly what's going on until it happens and sometimes not until after the fact even right so that principle of the rule of law that said the rule applies to everybody both the ruled and the ruler if you have an agile government making rules up as they go along well that means by definition the rules can't apply to them because they have the power to change them whenever they want to and and so we have agile governments who are managing us managing society solving social problems we are in a managerial era in the law management i i would put it this way management the the ethos of managerialism has supplanted the rule of of law as the basic idea instead of the rule of law we have rule by law now which means that the law is nothing more than a tool for the government to use to create at at on a whim whenever they need it to make you do this and there was no better example of all of this than during co you had people standing behind microphones on a tuesday afternoon saying well the rule tomorrow is going to be this that it's iile government it means the legislature is not taking on its role of making the rules and the the executive branch has taken over making the rules applying the rules and enforcing the rules all on its own and that that is not the way the western legal system used to work we have managerialism instead of the rule of law constantine is there anything so far in in bruce's discuss that triggered any echoes about similar situations in the uk well there's a couple of pieces that i i would pick up on that i think are relevant and the first one is what you mentioned about the fact that the bill is quite expansive yet only a small part of it appears to be dealing with the core issue which is the protection of children we had the online harms bill which was ostensibly about the same thing but in its original drafting included all sorts of other things completely unrelated to any of that and it's not a surprise because what we have seen over and over in the uk is that quite often the attempt to protect people from hate or whatever has actually nothing to do with the trigger the causes so give you an example sir david ames was an mp who was murdered by a terrorist and the next day all his colleagues went into parliament and started talking in parliament about how this shows that we need to tackle online hate david ases wasn't killed by online hate he was killed by an islamist likewise more recently parliament actually to to cut a very long story short suspended its own rules of procedure because labor party mps feared what would happen to them if they did not vote the correct way on the israel palestine conversation and again following the ferrari that broke out from that the argument was well mps need to be nicer to each other in of dealing with the fact that there was a mob outside parliament who was intimidating the parliamentarians so very often the it seems to me that a lot of the time the mind has been made up that we need to deal with online hay whatever that means and then whatever happens is then used as an excuse to do that secondly that's got to be kind of in the nature of of i think how tyranny unfolds in the real world it's it's something like there's a pre-commitment to a set of ideological axioms and then whatever crisis comes along is just assimilated to that and used as a shoehorn to move it forward and so has there ever been a tyranny that's emerged spontaneously that didn't present itself to begin with as fostering security and improving civic health or public health for that matter the nazis were you improving public health like mad throughout the 1930s i mean some of that public health improvement was genuine there's a fair bit of it that wasn't but but the cover story was really solid right and it was often compassion even with their the whole nazi the catastrophic nazi nazi policies of youth in asia that culminated in the holocaust began with the language of compassion right so well quite and actually the the thing that really revealed to me how much of this is ideological was i was on a british program called question time which you've been on and what they do is they have a panel of guests and before the main show starts they do one question for discussion that is a warm-up that's not recorded so people are a little bit more loose in that part of it and the question at the time was donald trump has just been unbanned from facebook you know was this the right thing to do whatever and you know they came to me i made the deeply controversial point that i think the president of the most powerful country in the world should be allowed to speak in public this didn't go down well but what happened afterwards they went to the leftwing politician on the panel the labor politician on the panel you know and she she without missing a beat when they went to her she went we must have the safest internet in the world and to a round of applause and what that signaled to me i think gentlemen is that we have completely lost the battle over the way the conversation is being in being able and willing to say some harm is a consequence of freedom and that's a price that we're willing to pay and i believe that until we get the conversation onto that footing we're never going to win this argument because if the argument is about well we must make people safe then that will always necessitate more tyranny by default of course and so it's i i see certainly in the uk i wouldn't speak for canada or the united states a complete failure of quote unquote our side to make make that argument that we are willing to sacrifice some whatever safety means in the context of words and that's a whole bunch of bs in my opinion anyway whatever that means that has a price and there comes a point where too much safety means too much giving up or freedom and we're not prepared to do that we haven't been able to make that argument i i agree with you and i think i think one of the problems is that we approach that argument from the wrong end and what i mean by that is you i think we should start with the presumption that any you're allowed to say anything you want like anything you want now what might the exceptions to that be well here's one if i go up to somebody on the sidewalk and say give me your wallet or i'll stab you okay well that crosses a line because now i'm threatening imminent violence that's a that's a that's an assault and it's okay for us to say no that's not allowed because it's violence but if you start from that end then you can saywell what are are there any other exceptions and maybe yes and maybe no if you start at the harm end i mean there's all kinds of harm you do just by speaking that's in ways that are clearly anything anything serious anything serious serious if you if you're campaigning to be elected to something then you are trying you are trying to do harm to your opponent you want to make them lose or if you are if you are running a commercial enterprise and you want to outsell your your neighboring competitor you're trying to do them harm and if you succeed you will do them harm maybe they go out a business that's legit you are allowed to cause people harm by your speech harm is not is not something that's prohibited we have to we have to get back to the idea that we live in the world and people succeed and they fail and sometimes they fail because of what other people do and too bad because they're free it's it's a free world in a free world you are going to be hurt by other people too bad having a vpn you trust is extremely important i can confidently say that expressvpn is the best vpn on the market and here's why expressvpn doesn't log your online activity many cheap or free vpns make money by selling your data to advertisers but expressvpn doesn't do this they even develop the technology

let's go back here now to why how we get from protecting children against online exploitation which apparently necessitates as you pointed out the construction of a very il defined expensive and highly autonomous new administrative system not bound if i remember correctly by normal rules of evidence well so yeah so well number one that's absolutely true in the administrative realm but it's also true in the human rights realm right so these commissions and tribunals i sat on a tribunal for a while yeah they they there they look like sort of courts yeah if you go into the room it looks like it's set up like a courtroom you got a bend and somebody making a decision and witnesses and so on but they're not courts because well for various reasons they're created by governments first of all they're basically are part of the executive branch of government even though they look like a court but they don't adhere to normal rules of evidence right and to what extent they do on any particular occasion might vary it depends upon the rules of that particular tribunal so you know people have called them kangaroo courts sometimes that's that's deserved but it's it's part of the trend of taking decisions away from courts and giving them to the executive branch of government but mind you the courts haven't been all that good in recent years either you know as i've been saying we are losing the law let me put it this way we we've been talking you've been talking especially for a long time about how institutions in society have been compromised been taken over by wokeism by social justice by critical theory so on well the law is an institution it's one of these social institutions one of these public institutions there's no reason why the law should be immune from all those all those factors as any other institution like government like universities like public schools like media it's happening to the law too it's happening now don't get me wrong in canada we have some terrific judges and we have cases that go the way they're supposed to and they're they're heard the way they're supposed to with the proper rules of evidence and the proper analysis and so this is not a black and white thing but more and more you are seeing from the courts evidence that the paradigm has changed or is changing from what a lot of people think in their heads is the way the laws should work to what actually is the case now and and what's the case now so let me give you an example yeah so we have a section in our charter that says that everybody is equal under the law they're entitled to equal protection under the law which is what the us constitution says as well but over the past 40 years of charter jurist prudence by the supreme court of canada that section now means that people are not entitled to equal protection that is equal treatment by by the law they're entitled to equal or equivalent outcomes between groups right so let me give you an example of the perhaps the most recent important supreme court of canada case on this idea many years ago the rcmp created a job sharing plan wherein full-time members could combine with two or three other members to decide to work part-time was voluntary people who worked part-time if you want to work part-time and you're working full-time then we're going to allow you to do that and we're going to give you a pension as well and the pension if your part-time will be calculated in the same way that the pension is calculated for the full-time people which is proportionate to the hours that you work okay voluntary over time what happens more women than men voluntarily sign up yeah for the part-time work right of course and then at the end of the day that means that more women than men have lower pensions than the men who are working full-time yeah the program is challenged under section 151 of the charter supreme court of canada says unconstitutional by definition by definition you can't have a voluntary equal program that results in different results for women than men it's a little hard on the whole notion of voluntary there isn't it exactly equal rules voluntary program open to everybody treats everybody the same way not constitutional oh boy when was that ruling 2019 i believe oh yeah that's a rough one okay so how did we get from protecting vulnerable children from online sexual exploitation with a gigantic unnamed bureaucracy with indefinite rights and virtually no responsibility to whatever the hell hateful speech is i mean first of all we might ask ourselves constantine you can weigh in here too is like the whole notion of hateful speech that's troublesome one for me because there's a obvious element of subjective judgment in it like a clearly obvious one and the problem for me is always as soon as someone talks about hateful speech isn't so much whether or not there are forms of speech they're detestable because you haven't lived if you haven't listened to somebody say something detestable perhaps sometimes in justest which is a very interesting you know variation of that possibility but like who decides that it's hateful on what grounds like and why do you decide the people who are making that judgment and then that problem is very much amplified like very much amplified if you open the door as this bill does to anon anonymous denunciations sure right now everybody including every school child who's like older than three and maybe even at three understands that there's almost nothing worse than a snitch and all children are wise enough to know that even if you are being bullied at school let's say it has to get pretty damn brutal and bad before going to report it to the authorities is acceptable or justifiable now you know you can debate about the conditions under which that should or shouldn't occur my point is that even kids know that even under dire circumstances there's almost nothing worse than a snitch and yet these bills and we certainly know from places like the soviet union just exactly what happens or east germany what happens when onethird of the citizens which was the case in east germany become government informers it's like trusts gone the worst people have the upper hand it's complete bloody catastrophe now in bill c63 you have a conant of these problems like okay now you now hate speech is going to be constrained and it can be identified by anonymous informants okay so let's delve into that a little bit if i got that right first well yes but let's just back up to your your children point right so so part of the problem is the premise and and and the premise is widely accepted because we accept this prem premise generally now in society because this is where we're at but the premise is that the government is responsible for keeping people safe including the children and that's ignoring the best mechanism we already have to keep children safe which is their parents right it's assuming that this is what this state is for if you went up to somebody on the street anybody at random and you said you know do you think we should have an expansive administrative state and by that i mean you know all these government people who do all these things they probably look at you like i don't know what you're talking about that's what government is that's what government's for what what do you mean what what does government do other than solve problems for society by making these rules and and and and and doing policy and so on and we've lost the the proposition that we've made a choice to have this large overwhelming government tell us what to do in place of all of the other things we used to have individual decisions families communities churches all of the nonpublic institutions and i mean government institutions government just rules the day now and we're debating about whether or not the government has done this job properly or not well well the problem is the government's doing the job the government for my money shouldn't be in this business business they shouldn't be in the business of regulating speech for hateful impact why not be be well because if we think we live in a free country if the government's in this business then we're wrong so so your point is something like that the the cost of the cost of having the government offer all potential services say in relationship to desire and safety is that you lose all your autonomy and your freedom well let's let's let's back up what what rights should we have is where we should start what rights do you have if you're a free person what does that mean i think it means that other people can't coers you can't interfere with you you know can't take your stuff can't use force against you that means you're free that means other people can't do it it means the state can't do it that's the the sphere of freedom that you have that means that the government needs to do one job which is to make sure other people don't coerce you and use force against you and take your stuff job done if somebody says something you don't like and causes you psychological angst too bad the person is free and so are you put up with it as part of the world as soon as you get governments oversteep thing that zone that i just described you you you start to move away from that conception of freedom into a different kind of society altogether and we are so far along that path that that i don't i don't know how we can call ourselves a free country a free people with a straight face it's just 63 c certainly is one of the pieces of legislation that make you question that oh absolutely but but bill 6 bill c63 is is just one step along the way and and we so let's go back to the courts because part of the fault of c63 it's a government bill so it's legislative problem but but the courts the supreme court of canada already said essentially that this kind of restriction on speech is constitutional and in fact in c63 they've used some of the language the supreme court of canada said was okay so the supreme court of canada took this charter we have which says everybody has the right to free speech and said well sure everyone has the right to free speech but not this well they used that against me of course they did yeah yeah a direct beneficiary of that line of reasoning i have freedom of speech but it's subject to reasonable limitations and and what are those well there whatever any reasonably constituted bureaucracy deem they might be that's basically what me but that makes that makes a mockery of the whole idea of having a constitutional yeah of course yeah i think that was kind of the point this is the point the point is that our charter people think of our charter of rights as the beginning of as the foundation of our legal system and it's not it's a mere gloss on legislative supremacy and now judicial supremacy because the court can decide what those rights mean however it wants yeah and more and more they are less robust individual rights and more and more justifications for the administrative state to do things in the public good so people are putting much too much faith weight on the fact that we have a charter they think it works in the same way as the american bill of rights which has fared much better over time than ours has it's much older as well of course but but and and much more foundational well yes but even in the so even in the us though i think we've all made a mistake in the anglo world we've made a mistake and it's a a very very old mistake to go back even to the time of the magnar so the original problem was the king and the king depending upon the king of course but kings were tyrants their their word was the law and then over time with great difficulty magna carta and then the civil rights act of 1688 and and the american declaration of independence and so on over time what we did was take power away from the king and give it to the legislature and that's good right because the the the monarch is hereditary and the legislature is elected so power to the people great except that over time legislator showed that they can be tyrants to c63 and all kinds of other things that have happened through the ages and so the american first came along and said we're going to try and fix that too so they created a bill of rights which limits what legislatur can do but to do that they had to give power to the courts so from the king to legislature from legislature to courts and now the courts are screwing it up and the courts are giving power back to the administrative state which is the king so here's the mistake we made we've been just moving power around from king to legislator legislature to courts to administrative state we've moving it around from place to place instead of taking power away and if you take power how about how about instead of adopting responsibility for the problem is that in order for that to work and in order for the rule of law to work the people in power have to adhere to the idea so the rule of law works for for quite a while like there are some periods when it was great yeah right so the rule of law is a restraint on people with power on legislators on executive branch and even on courts and as long as the people who who who who occupy those positions believe in the idea it works but our people in those positions do not believe in the idea anymore they just they they have thrown the idea out because it prevents them from doing what they think their job now is which is to manage stuff mh because management requires requires agility it requires responsiveness it requires you to get in there and muck about with your hands and that is not the way the rule of law works the rule of law is this idea that the legislature makes these grand rules based upon important principles that defines the relationship between state and individual and we can all tell what it is we can all go read what they are it's in the book the law is there for everybody to know that is not the way it works now now the law is just for the people in power to control and understand and and issue by edict whenever it suits them to make sure that the little people are doing what they're supposed to do so the rule of law is in direct conflict with what all our rulers think their job now is well there's no glory and virtue to be obtained in applying the law that someone else passed right exactly sir but coming back to your point jordan as well about who decides what hate speech is i mean we have this in the uk where for certain offenses the the evidence that a i the language is are well but a non-crime hate incident which is when you haven't committed any crime but nonetheless this will be recorded by the police on your record and potentially used against you in employment interviews and so on is based on your self-perception of what motivated your offender who afflicted you in some way to do what they did so if i if you were to make some sort of joke at my expense and i concluded that it was to do with my immigration status or ethnicity or whatever i could then say well this is clearly a hate incident that you've right and and the rationale for that would be well who would know better than the person who was directly affected and who's to question that then the victim we might say well and the answer to that if you have any sense is well what if the purported victim is a manipulative psychopath and the general response to that is well those all those people are just victims too right and so well so this this this will get us back into the hate discussion how do you define hate well you just said you allow the purported target of the hate to define it and what they do is they say that they feel hated so it's a second order form of evidence the primary evidence in principle is their subjective emotion but you don't have access to that so you have to accept their record of their subjective emotion and you accept that in a manner that isn't questionable there's no higher authority than than their say so and the problem with that it's this it's a variant of the problem with the informants is that only works well it would never work let's get that clear yeah but that only works in the ideal situation where people have perfect understanding of the motivation of others which they don't and also they're not lying the problem with that definition of subjective harm is it lays the gates wide open to the melians and the psychopaths yes yes and and and you're also touching on two other important things right so number one unlike most criminal offenses which require intent some kind the intent is not on whether the speaker meant to be hateful yeah it's not relevant intent is not relevant right that's terrifying and also the other thing that's not relevant is truth if you speak a true fact that is interpreted as a hateful fact and has its effect on somebody well that's not going to be a defense either right right so you are essentially one of the the effects of this kind of legislation is to say you are not allowed to speak the truth right because that truth regardless of intent regardless of intent regardless of intent and regardless of historical fact yeah we we are we are outlawing an effect yeah right right right absolutely okay and to expand that even even further with comedy it's interesting because of course scotland where some of the most ridiculous legislation is being passed is the place which hosts the biggest arts and comedy festival in the world the edra fringe right and to your point about truth well you don't even have to be saying something true at this point now they've passed a bill which means that comedians could be investigated for jokes they make now that is a level of detachment from context and reality that is even a level above simply or someone made a true comment what if i said something sarcastically on stage as a comedian and what's interes is comedy seems to be being very particularly targeted but nobody goes to mcbeth at the theater and says oh i went to the theater and then this guy went crazy and stabbed his friend no no one says that but with comedy for some reason the character on stage is increasingly being perceived as having the opinions that he's jokingly saying and so that that's another level so what that's right there's no distinction between the role and the actor quiet and and what what's interesting if you abstract even further from that if you've watched game of thrones the the scene where you really truly discover the king joffrey's gone mad is when he cuts off the tongue of the jester and his c yeah and this is this symbolism is yeah it's perfect it's been used throughout history to portray the final conversion into tyranny of of a of a ruler because that's how that's why there was gestures court is like that was one of the ways everybody could tell he was that the the king wasn't a tyrant right is that he could tolerate his own gesture his own fool or welcome him or find him amusing that would be best and this is something that happened when vladimir putin first came to power in russia under boris yelson there was a kind of liberalization there was an opening up of because in the soviet union you didn't make fun of the political leaders nothing was funny in the that was true well the jokes that people told that the kitchen table were funny but not in public of course but under boris hson there was an opening up and we had the this amazing tv show which was the equivalent of the british spitting image i don't know if you had a similar thing did you have spit no no no i know of it though yeah and it was basically puppets portraying the different political characters and and the first thing vladimir putin did when he came to power was to shut that down so historically throughout literature and other things if you if you're looking for symptoms of tyranny the shutting down of jokes and hum comans canaries in the coine comedians and automobiles as far as i'm concerned yeah yeah well they're they're so emblematic of personal autonomy every tyrant hates the automobile so even though they all want to have one okay so let's delve into the hate issue a bit more too because in canada we have protected categories of hate right so you it's a hate crime if it's i want to make sure i've got this definition right it's a hate crime if it can be shown if your utterance be shown to be discriminate discriminate against a protected class well yes so so so it's not merely that you hurt people's feelings right it's it's corre they have to hurt them for a particular reason well it's a discriminatory ter so so we have these two realms we have the the human rights realm and we have the criminal realm and we we've had hate speech restrictions in our criminal law for a good while and they're rarely used the the the human rights provisions are much more frequently used because because they're much less serious and much easier to trigger much easier to complain about and and they don't go to a court they go to one of these tribunals right but we one of the problems is the dovetailing of this hate speech discriminatory practice idea along with the the equality problem that i was just describing before right so as with any rule this rule is going to be applied and interpreted in one direction and not the other what i mean by that is if you go around saying that white people are are are hateful or privileged or colonists or whatever the case may be that that's pretty hateful if you say that're all that you know if you're white you are ex you're being stereotypical and you're making a blanket statement about all these people who are white that's not going to be entertained as hate speech because of the way that our equality law has been interpreted which is and this is one thing that the ontario human rights tribunal said fairly recently they said people who are white cannot be discriminated against yeah yeah i really but you're not a protected group they are not a protected group some some people some animals are more equal than others exactly so so so this this kind of law the hate speech law is likely to be interpreted in that way which is oh you can only utter hate speech against protected groups if you if you utter hate speech against those other people who are not in one of those group there's no hate speech against the oppressor classes it doesn't qualify and by the way this isn't theory this is so in in scotland for example they passed this bill on the 1 of april of course they did recently and in the first week of it being passed there were more reports of hate speech than there had been in the previous several years and the reason was that many many people reported a speech given by hamza yussef the first minister of scotland in which he was being openly racist against white people right and of course this is this isn't considered a hate crime and you know it was the bbc interviewed hamf where the the interviewer and the he himself laughed sort of you know almost gratuitously at oh how how silly you know people would s of course this is complete nonsense and frankly he said i'm not aware of anyone who's not on the far right who would report this as hate speech it's an absolute case of some animals are more equal than others and the law is i'm sure you would agree written specifically to create that situation absolutely yeah well not originally written but now interpreted and and now this idea has taken well look once you create the idea of protected groups and some animals are inevitably more equal than others your whether you're feeling

dimension it could be sex could be race could be ethnicity could be gender expression could be gender identity because those were added then you have a a situation where the oppressed end of that distribution can accuse the oppressor end of that distribution of hate speech but not the reverse right so that's basically the game that's being played here okay so how does bill c16 tie into bill c63 then well one way is is this as far as i'm concerned so one of the things i was very concerned about back in 2016 was that i looked into gender expression because that became a new category of group hood essentially in canada in so far as that was a protected class so a protected class is a reality that's now got legal protections that's pretty damn real as far as the law goes but i couldn't distinguish find any distinction whatsoever between gender expression and fashion in fact most of the definitions that i found mostly from the ontario human rights commission yes because a lot of this mess came out of out of them was the explicit insistence that gender expression was fashion because well because gender is and because gender is nothing but fashion it's a social construct anyways it's a role that you play it's a disguise that you put on it doesn't reflect any deeper underlying reality well okay what that's complete nonsense but that's okay why is that a problem in this case well if fashion criticism be there's no limit to what constitutes a hate crime if fashion criticism is one of its valid manifestations right clearly there's almost nothing i could do to you that would be less harmful than you know having a good laugh about your trousers sure but you but one thing that you're referring to there alluding to is the weaponization of human rights yes so so if you if you go to an earlier conception of human rights you could have described them as the right not to be abused us by your government you know not to be thrown in jail without due process not to be censored for this and that not to be tortured those are human rights but today human rights consist of the rights of some people in groups to insist that other people in groups in groups embrace their own decisions yes right or else so if you if so if i decide that i'm a man and you don't call me by my pronouns then you are guilty of a violation of my human rights that is a that's a very new idea that is not the where we started with this that's a weaponization because it means that human rights are a zero sum game if i have human rights that means you have less because i can insist that you behave in a certain way this this is about individuals now being able to determine how other individuals will will behave it's incredible so now we have we have another conjunction of of pathological enabling here that i'd like to dwell on for a moment so one of the things we alluded to earlier was the fact that bill c63 also opens opens up the door it facilitates enables and outrate encourages anonymous anonymous denunciations now the good thinkers would say well you want to put as few barriers in the way of the oppressed seeking redress for their victimization as possible but that that omits one very important detail which is that if you can denounce for zero cost then you weaponize denunciation and you put an immense you put immense you put the entire power of the state in the hands of anyone who wants it yeah right and it's anonymous and so to what degree in bill c63 do you get to face your accuser right you don't even know who it is so they can you can be accused regardless of your intent regardless of the factual reality of your utterance by people who you who do not have to identify themselves or take any responsibility whatsoever if their denunciation turns out to be false who are rewarded for doing so who you do not get to confront well at that point i don't see you have a loss system at all you have rule you don't even have rule by mop you have rule by the worst elements of the mop and the worst elements are going to be those who will come crawling out of the woodwork like mad to weaponize their resentment by using the the state's power they now have at their disposal right and rub their hands and glee at ever opportunity to do that there will be specialists in denunciation in no time flat okay so so that goes along with that well the the the the anonymity of the informant and the pathology of the when you divide the world into oppressed and oppressor you fail to notice that in the hypothetically oppressed class there are going to be those who use that narrative as a way of justifying their vengeance they're not good people who are victims they are people who are using that story to get exactly what the hell they want from you right now or else and certainly the human rights commissions and canada have been weaponized to that degree i mean in my situation since we'll make it personal i suppose for a moment anybody in the world can bring out a complaint against me for any reason right and it's at the the complaint doesn't have to proceed that's at the decision judgment it's the judgment of the ontario college of psychologists the regulatory board that determines whether or not that complaint can proceed right but that's like it's an entirely political decision but this is part and partial though of the of those trends i was describing earlier which is to give these administrative bodies the professional regular being one the human rights tribunal being another the the difference to do as the they think best and yes you can take as you know you can you can take them to for review in front of a court but the court tends to defer to them and just and and and they have the juris prudence of the supreme court about the charter anyway and so you put those two things together and it basically means that these administrative bodies have have a great deal of latitude to do basically whatever they think is right and the public good yeah right and so that means you don't have a rule of law that means well you certainly don't have any if you're a think if you're a professional in canidate and you think your charter rights to free speech mean anything you're sadly deluded because they certainly don't so right okay so let's go to next to the next most fun thing about bill c63 this is the part where it moves from sort of jaw-droppingly jaw-droppingly incomprehensible to absolute theater of the absurd i had to reread this section like three times yeah before i could believe it was true i thought i must be misunderstanding this i had the same experience with bill c16 i guess when i read about gender expression yeah i thought surely this can't mean fashion because it certainly looks like it means fashion there's there's no way it means fashion it's like nope definitely means fashion and purposefully so it's like okay fair enough okay so what have we got on the pr on the absolutely absurd side of things okay so this is my understanding and i'm not a lawyer so maybe you can help me weed out any inaccuracies in my representation so my understanding is that i can go to a provincial magistrate and i can say that i have i fear that someone i know may commit a hate crime let's say this year i have i have good reason the good reason would be my fear so that would be my proclamation that my emotional reaction to this person's possible misbehavior is real not even that the threat is real but that i'm afraid that it might be real and that magistrate can act on that y by well the the penalty laid out in the bill as far as i can tell was well if you're the person who is eliciting the fear then you get to have an ankle bracelet on for a year and you can be essentially confined to your house and the court can determine who you can talk to and who you can't talk to and they can also require you to have your bodily fluids monitored this is one of the elements of the bill i didn't understand at all it's like where the hell did that come from so they put restrictions on your right to consume mol for example i suppose marijuana will probably still be okay as long as the liberals are in power but all right but anything that would in principle heighten the probability that you might commit the hate speech and so and the the penalties well that's basically that that's basically that part of the bill now that doesn't seem that's a pre-crime it's a pre- crime it's pre- crime now right now it's not like this is a brand new idea so there there are already provisions in the code that that allow for pre crime solutions before a crime happens in some circumstances for some crimes if a court is satisfied that there is a threat but what's happening here is they taken that idea and they've combined it with this speech idea to create the scenario you're describing which is right you've got to be kidding me it it is now possible for a magistrate to put me under house arrest because of something that he thinks i might say that's where we're at right right so so the other circumstances you're referring to i presume would be something like someone has made repeated threats of domestic violence that appear credible correct right that's right right cr a credible a credible threat of actual violence right example which which in itself though constitutes a crime doesn't it if well if if if you committed it if you but what if i threaten you directly with a crime if you if you make the threat that's a crime yes correct right okay okay so that's right so so in that situation the threat itself is also a crime well it could be so you you you could have an actual prosecution for the threat but if there are circumstances where for some reason that there hasn't been a threat but there's still a danger that that the evidence shows exists maybe because there have been previous crimes committed by that individual against that individual and and the the the the victim of those crimes is concerned because it looks like it's going to happen again there are circumstances under which the court can can do this kind of thing but but the combination of that power with this kind of of of bastard child of those two laws exactly yeah very well put yeah okay so i've got that right that is how this oh yes yeah and these can also be brought forward anonymously well well see that so the the the the anonymous power is most noticeable in the bill under the human rights part so the criminal code aspect is is is the way it's always done and sometimes in that situation i'm not a criminal lawyer but as i understand it there are circumstances in which complainants can be can be protected from exposure to the alleged perpetrator but the real anonymity problem lies within the the criminal the the human rights tribunal part of the of the of the of the statute okay okay okay okay but but so if i can we can step back for a moment part of the lesson in this i think is that the people who have put this together and are supporting it have an entirely different vision of what they think the law is for and how it's supposed to work like this seems outrageous to us because we still have an idea about the old parad like how this this supposed to how is this supposed to work and they don't have that idea anymore this this is a project to make certain kinds of behavior illegitimate like actually illegitimate and the fact that it happens to be speech it's no concern of theirs because it's illegitimate speaking a true fact if it's going to have an effect on people is illegitimate they are changing the paradigm they are changing the they're reframing the whole enterprise my understanding of the law yeah this is a very fundamental transformation something surface not surface it is it it goes to the root of the way the law works and and and those of us who are clinging to the old idea and thinking well this is an aberration it's an outrageous aberration but it's an aberration it's not an aberration anymore it this is becoming the the the disease that the law is is now subject to everything is the law is shifting beneath our feet claudine gay wasn't an aberration universities she's emblematic of the universities that's right and in the same way why she was president of har in the same way that she was emblematic of the universities this is becoming emblematic of the law okay so you speak about this where's the rest of the lawyers well i'm not alone yeah i'm not alone right our good friend jared brown has been has been speaking out on this ever since that's two i know and i have i i i i have i have handfuls of friends that do the same but it's only a handful and it's it's pretty small if you compare bad handful and the numbers of people who are on this page to the numbers of lawyers overall i mean it's a it's a tiny we slice okay so the i've the same problem obtains on the psychological end of things except maybe there are fewer of us even yeah there are there are there ar there ar nearly as many as there ought to be right and there's almost none whove stood up against so-called gender affirming care even though i know perfectly well that all of them who are even remotely educated know that every single bit of that is a lie yes okay so but the logical qu the logical suspicion that might arise in the mind of anybody watching this is well if it's like you and two other people on the legal side and it's dr peterson on the on the clinical side and maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration but not much why do you think you're not the aberration i mean the problem i've always had with you fundamentally so i met bruce in under very interesting circumstances he so i went i offered to go to queens university right and debate anyone at the law school about bill c6 which i thought was a pretty good offer on my part because i'm not a lawyer and i thought there must be some lawyer at the law school jump chance to give me a good savaging because what the hell do i know and the only one who stepped forward was bruce and i don't think i knew at the beginning of that maybe i knew i leaned over to you before we started and introduced myself because we hadn't met before yeah and i said i just want you to know i agree with you yeah right that's how it happened i'm playing the devil so then so there was one new step forward and he was playing devil and i only stepped forward because nobody else would do right right right and i wanted to i wanted to give you a platform to say what you wanted to say yeah and so i more indication of your unreliability so i played i played the part and it was good fun but but that that's where we're at okay so so let's go back to the same issue so why the hell aren't the aren't the more people in the legal community cognizant of this danger and willing to speak about it if it's so fundamental which it seems fundamental so like what hell what's going on here it it so there's lots of reasons but let me just talk about a couple the problem is fundamental and it's been around for a long time much longer than it seems i mean still 63 is not a long time c16 is not a long time but in the big scheme of things these trends have been going on for a long time so for one example so we have a huge access to justice problem meaning that if you are involved in a dispute of some kind that the cost involved in getting a lawyer and then getting access to a court within a certain period of time numbered in years almost impossible unless you're very rich or very poor access to the courts is very unlikely now why is that well partly because that in order to get a resolved you have to go to a court and what i mean by that is if we had laws that were clear right then you wouldn't need to go to a court because everybody would know what the law was and you would know what would happen when you went to a court every time you go to a court it's a crapshoot you don't know what's going to happen so you have to go to the court to find out what's going to happen which means we need more courts and more judges and more time and more lawyers and it's not clear because of all of the things i alluded to earlier which is we don't just have broad principles in our law we don't have statutes with rules in them we don't have cases that are consistent from case to case to case to case we have one-offs we have regulations we have guidelines we have we have we have lots and lots of rules about everything and you still don't know what this what the story is because the laws move over time and they won't tell you what the law is right now and you don't know where the law is and who who's making it the whole things yes and and so and and this state of things has existed for quite a while quite a while it's the it's the ocean in which lawyers swim they're the fish in the water they don't they don't see the water it's just the life that they are used to they think their job is to make their way through that ocean for their okay so that's sort of the run of the mill lawyers well it's it's not just the r of the m lawyers it's it's even i mean the i look we have a lot of good lawyers who are very skilled at what they do but they're skilled within a certain system the system that we have and questioning that system is not part of the job of being a lawyer in the normal sense yeah fair enough right yeah so so it's not about competence it's about having the time and energy and perception and and caring how many experts in constitutional law the history of constitutional law are there in canada oh oh dozens hundreds so what's up with them well they lear largely embrace the the the going story the the the the nar how did that happen well it has partly to do with legal education the law schools for the most part have become yeah captured like all other institutions by a certain kind of ideology critical theory social justice and so on that we know very well right and so really once that's got the universities that's pretty much game over a lot of this trouble can be traced back to the universities that's where the social justice critical theory stuff began when it came over from germany you know where it started between the two world wars and then you can trace that back to marxism i mean it's a whole long story and i'm not a sociologist but you know the story better than i do but yeah the universities are a main source of all the trouble and they've been they've been graduating generations of students who have these ideas in their heads and not not just lawyers but people of all kinds yeah right who now occupy the professions and the and the governments and the public schools and they certainly pick up the managerial class exactly so and the managerial class is our elite people think that our elite are the widely successful entrepreneurs and there are a few of those but our our actual elite is the managerial class the ones who to to like getting honked out in ottawa exactly the ones who decide decide how society is going to run and and those people are and their interests though the the interest of those individual people are in having this system carry on and that includes a lot of i was talking i mentioned you know the problem i had problem i had with you and problem i had with you is that you don't make a very convincing right-wing crackpot well i mean that like you know you don't fit the mold cuz the logical thing to do to assume if someone is standing up against the consensus yeah generally speaking is that they're wrong now sometimes they're right right that's that's that's the problem right and you know you you've always struck me as let's say suspiciously reasonable right in the way that the demagogue types just aren't and so and you've already explained why your view on such things which you did make evident and in a really minority fashion i'm trying to think of other lawyers that i knew certainly university lawyers there was no university lawyers no members of faculties of law at universities had anything to do with me in canada it was you and that was it you know and you played devil advocate which i thought was very funny once i figured out what was going on but okay so why do you think you can see this why are you willing to see this and yeah yeah what distinguishes you in your training your outlook from the other lawyers who apparently aren't or won't oh i don't know i can't i can't tell you that i don't i'm not inside their heads i don't i don't really no i've always been suspicious of government i i was so i i was suspicious of government authority ever since i can remember i think when i was in public school i thought how awful to have this person at the front of the class who's not that smart and yet has power over me so some some underlying suspicion of authority as such sure right right but you still went off through university to i want see i wanted to go to law school not first and foremost to be a lawyer i wanted to go to law school to find out what the rules were so that i could tell people who wanted to interfere with me what the rules are i had to back off ah right i see and what i a different motivation what i discovered was there are no such rules there are no such rules as it turns out that prevents government authorities from backing off because the whole system is designed to give them authority to do that so how did you manage with that attitude to have a successful career in academia in faculty of law i mean you've had a very successful career are you have a very you're you're actually not cancelled even that's true yeah so how do you survive at queens or even thrive and how did you manage to have this attitude and also manage a career in that environment you have to i think you have to enjoy the exercise of trying to figure things out and then point it out even if the people you're pointing it out to aren't listening and know that doesn't sound like very much well yeah but that usually just gets people cancelled well not if you do it in a certain way that's yeah that's what i'm asking what's the way you can never make it personal it's not about that person over there who thinks x they can think whatever they want see i'm an actual libertarian i think it's fine if people believe what they believe and they want to do what they want to do i'm totally fine with that if okay i want to talk you about that if if their opinion is diametrically opposed to mine i'm totally fine with that the only moments when i have trouble with it is when they start to step on my toes but as long as they're not doing that i'm cool i'm cool right and this is one of the things i think that distinguishes and you know what libertarian has become a bad label because the libertarians did very very badly during co very bad yeah they they dro the ball horribly and it turns out they have a lot of strange ideas so i tend not to use that label anymore but you understand what i mean but there's a huge divide between the libertarian minded people or the liberals i can use that word liberals the original classical liberals and the conservatives and in a sense you're standing as stride the chasm between these two groups right because the conservatives have a very a lot of them have a very clear idea about what they think is right fair enough people should have an idea about what they think is right and the classical liberals know what they think about the law and the mistake for my money that the conservatives make is that they fail to distinguish between two different questions the first question which is entirely legitimate which is what should people do how should people behave okay let's hear how you think people should behave totally fine with that the next question is not the same question which is how must people behave there's a conservative inclination to want to take their philosophy and make it into law and to make people do what they think is right now right and that's often what made the conservatives what would you say yeah yes un undesirable to the more classic liberal types that was the place that put those two camps at odds yes and it's one reason why i think the progressives today the ones who are now in power why they carry such an animous against conservatives because there is some kind of a memory there about force of force when the conservatives were ascendant here's the kinds of things that you did you know you you outlawed gay sex you centered us about pornography and obscenity and and heresy and sedition and you did and you prohibited alcohol and the conservative record on freedom is not very good and so from a libertarian or a classical liberal point of view they're missing the boat and yet the conservatives and the liberals the original liberals are the two forces trying to work together to push back on the w yeah trying to figure out how to do that but their but their analysis of what's wrong is completely different right so if i can put it this way and and i'm sure you've heard conservatives say this too so from a classical liberal point of view the problem that the woke has created is too little freedom you know they have us under their thumb they want us to do this and do that use pronouns not not to say this hate speech y y y okay not enough freedom i've heard lot the conservatives say no no no the problem under the woke is too much freedom mh you have the freedom to change your gender you have the freedom to say you're this and not that you're the freedom to do this that freedom should not exist so we agree about that the fact that the woke is a problem but we disagree about what the problem is and our solution is diametrically well that's going to make us weak too as absolutely okay so let let me offer two contradictory responses to that conundrum yeah so for a long time i by temperament have this libertarian twist which is you can go to hell in a hand basket your particular way if you so desire and that's right you know that's within your baileywick right have add her yeah but i've rethought that to some degree in the aftermath of the gender affirming debacle ah yes right so for a while i was thinking with regards to so-called gender affirming care i'm not exactly sure even what terminology to use it's it's it's what it's surgical mutilation essentially yeah hormonal manipulation and surgical mutilation y okay should you have the right to do that to yourself is an adult yes i thought sure why not knock yourself out yep but you know i'm starting to wonder about that there there's two ways you can approach that one would be well you might be able to request it but that doesn't mean the surgeons should be allowed to provide it oh sure right and i think they've actually showed their absolute inability and unwillingness to police themselves in that regard that's just clear and then it's also the case that you don't know the limits to what people are willing to do to themselves to stand out and the answer to that is there are no limits you saw the recent case in canada i presume where we have a diaper fetishist because that's a fun class of people who's just pursuing his own thing after all who wants to have a neo vagina created somewhere down below well maintaining his penis intact and he couldn't find anyone skillful enough to perform that particular act of butchery on him in canada found someone in texas and then sued the canadian government right for paying for it right and that's the key and they're going to that's the key that's right so all right so at some point i'm sort of thinking no we're done with all this we're just not doing sex reassignment i don't care if you're 90 right it's it there's no surgeons that have the right to do that to another person mhm so now and is it a slippery slope argument well for me it's sort of for me it's more like i i've just had enough of this argument i saw where this went we started with this in 1960 something or rather with the first sex change operation which i think was a dubious enterprise back then and the cascading consequence of this has been like the worst medical m practice in maybe ever mh probably not you know because ever is a long time and there's been some dark things done but in terms of mass assault on children it's certainly in the top two but children are different right right but the but that's the thing is that you know at what point does your the perversity of your desire to go to hell in a hand basket your own particular way start to actually become in and of itself a social threat okay well well yeah but let but let's put the kids aside because the kids are a special case right and you got then you got the problem of you know who gets to decide the parents or the state the easiest case to resolve and find agreement on are with adults so let's ask this question is there anything that a of an of ag adult full adult competent should not be allowed to do to themselves if they're not imposing upon other people not coercing them not interfering with them not taking their stuff and my answer is nothing i i can't think of anything now that does not mean that i think the state should be involved as in running the health care system i don't think they should be funding it i don't think they should be providing services i mean i we shouldn't have for my mind we shouldn't have a public healthare system but so if you take that away it's like in other words you should be allowed to go if you can find a doctor to do this strange thing that you want done to yourself and the doctor agrees of his own free will and you agree of your own free will and you're willing to pay the doctor as far as i'm concerned the fact that i think it's weird and strange and wrong and harmful i'm not the king so i don't i don't think my opinion about it has any relevance to it and that applies to gender surgery it applies to assisted suicide it applies to prostitution it applies to drugs it applies to anything because it's not my it's not my life it's their life and i don't want to impose my there's also the danger there of deciding who's going to make the judgment it's not like it's a risk-free prohib there's no prohibition that's risk free right it's just the see the problem i've h having with that more and more bruce is that there's kind of no end to the number of monsters who are going to crawl out from underneath the woodwork as we've seen that's going to get worse and so you know you you say if you can find a doctor who will do that i mean i i could i would respond if i was making the contrary cases that there are things that if they were actually doctors they wouldn't do right right and so we already saw in canada i think the removal of two fingers that was a month ago could be right because the person had a form of body dysmorphia and right claimed to be at suicide risk unless the fingers were removed well let's take it let's take an easier one then how about how about assisted suicide now now there are three there are three models of assisted suicide the conservative one is no can't do that it's not not moral can't outlawed no assistant suicide the the progressive version is the one we have in canada which is it's publicly funded the government provides it directs it supports it promotes it pays for it and it comes with a free rainbow unicorn kill yourself we'll help you they encourage it by by by not giving you timely service on other things that you really need so that your life becomes miserable and so the best way out is to kill yourself that that's untenable okay i am not advocating that at all the third version is the government has nothing to do with it if you want to kill yourself with the help of a doctor that is your business and i might not approve but it's got nothing to do with me well that's kind of where we were before the assisted suicide la practically that's kind of where it land but the conservatives will not put up with that yeah yeah right so if if i'm in my old age and i have some kind of difficulty and i'm not having any fun anymore i want to be able to kill myself and i do not want to be under the thumb of conservatives anymore than i want to be under the thumb of the woke and this is the problem that we have between these two philosophies the the the the conservatives portray themselves sometimes as virtue people i' i've called them that virtue people in the sense that they put virtue before freedom and there's something to be said for that so here's here's the way the argument goes in order to be truly free in your own heart or your own mind you have to be virtuous in your own heart you have to understand things you have to have discipline you have to understand the good or some notion of it you have to have faith in something in order to even the purpose of freedom exactly you have to have meaning so that you don't give into based desires and your animal instincts okay but that's not about the law and the conservatives a lot of them anyway say no the law should make you behave virtuously yeah virtue enforced virtue and my answer to that is enforced virtue is not virtuous it's obedience in order to be virtuous you have to decide you have to have free will to decide between dark and light and if you don't have the choice then the fact that you are made to behave in this way right so part of part of the like part of the reading of your more libertarian argument there would be i i guess part of the reason that i've often always believed that people should be allowed to go to hell in a hand basket in their own particular manner is because you're going to learn you are going to learn that's right and that's then you'll know absolutely and that's the libertarian version of responsibility yes right right right well the state's not going to come in rescue you this is really your choice you actually have the knowledge absolutely there is perhaps and by the way i come i think as closely from the as much from the classical liberal position as possible on this but i think there is a test case that's currently happening on the streets of every major city in that certainly feels like the united states right where i don't know if this is necessarily accurate exactly but it sort of feels like the libertarian argument has been taken to its logical conclusion ignoring elements of reality so that's why you have mentally ill people on the streets of los angeles and san francisco and new york and elsewhere because well they they've got to be free right we can't put them in a mental health hospital because that and those hospitals used to be terrible objectively right so getting people out of the tyranny of that institution i guess was a good thing but now they're on the street taking drugs i and the question is is that freedom because i don't know that you are fre when you hooked define freedom for us though well i i it feels to me like part of the conversation around freedom has to involve an element of agency and then the question is do you have agency if you're so let's say traumatized or so addicted or whatever that is that's causing you to effectively be unable to live a human life right if you're living in skid r yeah i don't think that's what freedom looks like i'm not sure that's true what are they learning exactly see that's that's what sparked my thought what are they learning well i would suppose that they are learning that the choices that they made didn't work very well well and some people do hit bottom and bounce up yes they do you know i mean many pe even though we don't know how to help people recover from alcoholism really many people do and they often do after having their after rubbing their face along a very rough sidewalk for a very long period of time it's certainly not a pleasant form of freedom i mean i'm i'm also not suggesting that you know there's a simple solution to the problem of having deinstitutionalized well see this is my point is i think that there may just not there may not be any that the thing is the question is whether there's a better solution if you have an iq of 50 do you have freedom yes sure you do if if you're if if you are not being opposed upon by other people or the state then by definition you have freedom the fact that you are not able to exercise it in the same way as the next guy doesn't mean you're not free it means you're free to make mistakes listen free freedom is has good and bad yes it it enables you to sometimes be successful and sometimes to fail and that's part of the package you can't make it just one way and not other way cu that's not what it is well there's another dimension to the conversation about homelessness and drug addiction and so on which is i think it's very difficult to argue that that is consequence free for the rest of society so there are we recognize that there are limits to our freedom when we start to impact on others and that's a very good example i think where that trade-off seems to me to be to be being got wrong but there is a progressive idea that has become mainstream and mainstream especially amongst conservatives and that is this that the state is the savior that is if you want to solve a problem it has to be the state to come in to fix it i mean this is an idea a professor at hillstate college put it this way when he was talking about woodro wilson who was the first progressive american president woodro wilson he says changed the idea from the government as as servant mh to government as savior as in if we're going to fix our problems it's got to be the government who does it well yeah with the with the corresponding assumption that if there's a problem yes that's evidence of government inadequacy right right right right exactly so and part of the reason we think that so thoroughly now is that all those other institutions that used to exist are gone because the government came in and pushed them all out right so when you have people on the streets the only place to turn to is the state m and and that doesn't mean it's a good it's a good call i i think it's a terrible idea because everything the government touches goes to rot even stuff is already rotting i mean part of the reason those people are there to start with is because we have an overwhelming expansive administrative state and so to suggest that that more of will more of that is going to fix it no it's not going to happen no i certainly wasn't suggesting that i i but i do think it's an interesting case for the libertarian argument where it starts to break down i i used to be pro decriminalizing all drugs i think increasingly that conversation about how certain things impact your agency is is important try that with alcohol though because alcohol alcohol so part of the rationale claimed for prohibition was that alcohol is you know can lead to very bad societal effects which it can which it can for sure for some people it can be devastating and yet for a lot of people not so so are we going to ban alcohol so as to to avoid the catastrophic effects on some people no no no no same with same with prostitution right now sometimes people who are in favor again tend to be conservatives say we know we should ban prostitution make it illegal because sometimes prostitution happens without consent and people get into dangerous situations and there's sexual assault and that's true but that is also true with just plain old sex where there's no transaction going on financially it's just an encounter you get sexual assault in that situation too are we going to extrapolate and say well because that happens just in ordinary sex we're going to outlaw that too so as to avoid the downside scenarios no no if you have two people who have agency and consent to a transaction who is going to come in and say sor you can't do that not me so so one of the things that i've been trying to do my lecture to her that's germaine to the point that you raised about you know if there's a problem it's indicative of the insufficiency of the state yeah right sort of as an aaic presumption is well if that's not the case then what's the proper replacement presumption if there's a problem who should be doing something about it i'd like you to tell me what what you think about this okay because this isn't exactly a libertarian freedom from argument it's it's it's more of a responsibility argument i'm never sure where the libertarians sit on that side okay if you can see a problem that's your problem like and you might say well how do you know that and the answer is something like well it bothers you mhm so there's a new a cardinal cardinal new mh who is famous for his his defense of the idea of god mh and he there's a long line of theological speculation that one of the ways that the spirit of the cosmos makes itself manifest is in the voice of conscience y it's a very old idea goes back to the prophet elijah in the old testament who was the prophet who defeated the nature gods which is very interesting he replaced the god of nature which is back at full you know force now right with the notion that the spirit the ancestral god of the israelites was the still small voice within right it was conscience right and if if you see a problem in the world and it bothers you that's a direct indication that you have something to do it's part of i would say it's part of the landscape of meaning that itself to you it's part of your responsibility you might say well what can i do about it which is a perfectly reasonable objection but the right response to that is that's your problem and you might say well why should it be my problem and one answer to that is well you need something to do so you well seriously like because there but but i think but i think this has a very simple answer my my simple answer would be this you know you ask me is that my responsibility and my answer would be morally maybe so legally no no no i wouldn't and i'm not saying that at all i and that's all i'm saying all i'm saying is all i'm saying is legally i am not making a moral argument here at all about the drugs or anything else i don't think it could legally be made your responsibility it could be made your obligation well you could be you could be well if you're talking illegal obligation that's your responsibility right fine fine but but this is the conservative argument about the prostitution yeah right it's that if you see a problem that not only should you do something about it you should make a law that does something about it yeah if you see prostitution going on we can't have that this is a finger wagon stuff yeah right yeah and it's not effective it's not effective it's also it's not even the most it does push people away from conservatism especially if they're young and it's actually not the most but it's also arrogant it's it's arrogant in this sense it assumes it's a top- down thing it's like well there's a there's a few of us the religious hypocrite there's a few of us up here who understand what's best for everybody so we're going to make the rules for which sounds a lot like the progressives exactly my point exactly my point the the progressives and the conservatives of the silk anyway yeah have a common idea i mean now the particular virtues they believe in are completely different yeah but the but the idea is talk it's the same yeah yeah if you give me enough power i'll fix it exactly yeah yeah it's just that the right people have to have the power right right whereas your argument i think one i'm very sympathetic to is we should have laws that protect our basic rights and and let let's get on with it yeah well and then what i've been attempting to suggest to people is that it's in taking up that mantle of problem personally that you find the meaning of your life genuinely that's actually where it lurks but that's also what protects you against tyranny because if everyone did in their local environments what they're called upon to do there wouldn't be a lot of unsolved problems lying around for the tyrants to point to freak out about and mop up right right so you there's a there's a real in the in the old testament story in the exodus story there's a dynamism between slave and tyrant right yeah one needs the other one produces the other the slaves call for the tyrant to emerge the tyrant becomes contemptuous of the slaves and ever more tyrannical it's a dance and the way that's technically solved in the exodus story is it's solved by moses brother father-in-law who sees the israelites trying to make moses into a new pharaoh because they're all slaves and whining about and being victims and you know pining for the tyranny and he basically tells them that he tells moses to make a hierarchy of distributed responsibility right to break his people up into tens and hundreds thousands and and so forth all the way up to the top to allocate responsible decision-making down as far down that hierarchy as possible right and and to only adjudicate speaking to moses those disputes that can't be adjudicated lower well why well jethro says there's two reasons for that is the first is well you'll you'll stress yourself out because no one can take the responsibility for governing an entire people so it's it's just not bearable and you'll turn into a tyrant and that's not good either but worse and this is the more subtle point is that if you alleviate the people of responsibility yes they'll just stay slaves yes yeah yes absolutely well i think that's exactly right is that and so and that that's a that's a more responsible libertarian argument it's like well you need to be able to learn from your mistakes which is why you should be able to make them right you still have that problem of well how big a mistake till you start taking other people out you know and that's that's something i think that's subject to continual negotiation but i don't think there is a substitute for a distributed hierarchy of responsibility and so what that seems to imply is well as marriage decays so people abdicate responsibility for that as the nuclear family decays because people abdicate responsibility for that and local community organizations and the church all of that abdicated responsibility is is vacuumed up by the state yes right yes yeah exactly right and in fact it's i would say that the state is largely responsible for the disintegration of those things in the first place yeah right so you cause the problem and then you vacuum up what's left of it afterwards yeah yeah well there's a i wrote a paper with jonathan paso for the arkc on on the symbolism of the whr of babylon and the scarlet state scarlet beast in in revelation uhuh and so it's an image of the end times right and the end times has two archetypal elements so the scarlet beast is a blood colored beast it's the blood colored beast of the state basically multiple heads so it's a degenerate state because a unified state has one head like seven heads all male right pointing in different directions right so it's a it's a degenerate patriarchy all right and on the back of the scarlet beast which is the degenerate masculine spirit is the of babylon which is the degenerate feminine spirit because you know no one sex doesn't go wrong without the other sex going wrong what happens well in in the degenerate state female sexuality is commodified right right right and so you get that dance now right right right yeah it's but it's worse you see cuz the story has a particular ending the beast kills the prostitute so what the implication there is that the state will as it disintegrates it offers more and more hedonistic gratification as enticement but it ends up destroying all gratification whatsoever because it can't sustain the promises the promises that it offers which brings us all the way back to there's no bread that's right exactly and it brings us all the way back to the beginning because as all of these institutions that traditionally used to regulate relationships between human beings crumble we need more and more laws whereas in the past if barry said something offensive well barry's a bit of a dick you know what what's for dinner now it's well barry's a bit of a dick we got to legislate cuz we can't have phone the hate crime unit that's right because we are not self-regulating all of those relationships and now we need st to come in we need we need departments of social work to come and be the worst possible foster parents inable that's right all right gentlemen we should probably draw this to a halt for those of you watching and listening most of you know that i generally continue these interviews for another half an hour on the daily wi plus side of things and i think what we might turn to in this particular occasion is solutions potential solutions which we didn't have an opportunity to discuss concentrating more on laying out the apocalyptic landscape so to speak particularly in canada but in a manner that's like illustrative of what's happening i would say generally in the west so thank you dr party very much pleasure participating in that constantine all those of you who are watching and listening be your time and attention is much appreciated to the daily wire plus people for making this possible that's also much appreciated film crew here in dallas thank you for your help guys that went very well and drop over to the daily r plus side if you want to see this continue bye-bye [music]
