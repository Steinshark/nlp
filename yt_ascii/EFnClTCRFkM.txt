yesterday i compared samsung's new galaxy s 20 ultra with the iphone 11 pro max the absolute best devices of both companies offer however they're both massive and incredibly expensive so almost a more important comparison is how good their main screen flagships are so welcome to galaxy s 20 vs. iphone 11 and the conclusion here is no.1 i expected to make to hold the new galaxy s 20 fuels a lot like any other samsung flagship it's mostly glassware the curved back and a slightly narrower body than we're used to so it's actually relatively compact feeling in the hand i will say this though it is in stark contrast with the way the iphone feels apart from height that phone is bulkier in every dimension it is thicker it is wider and far heavier we're talking 194 grams which makes the 163 gram s20 feel featherweight both phones are well-constructed the casings are sturdy with gorilla glass on the front in the back but i'm just not a fan of the way either looks they don't look like they mean business as much as their higher-end siblings do samsung's s20 is visually a little bland in my eyes and on first glance looks almost identical to the company's own mid-range phones like the galaxy a 51 and a 71 we're talking $400 devices here and then as for the iphone 11 it uses that slick matte finish that i loved about the iphone 11 pro and i never quite got used to how it has a square camera module but cameras that don't actually fill it both have ip68 water and dust resistance ratings and neither has a headphone jack so on balance in terms of design and materials i'm half way down the middle neither is offensive looking but neither is the prettiest bit of tech i've seen either by the way i've just launched a pretty massive giveaway of one galaxy s 20 ultra and for galaxy s 20s it is free and international and all rules are in the description turning both devices over the narrative changes i don't think i've ever seen this much of a one-sided battle between two similarly priced devices the s20 display is so far ahead of the iphone xi that it feels like these two devices are from different decades which i guess they kind of are for starters the galaxy s 20 s is larger and brighter with a consistent brightness level of close to 800 nits there will be times when this phone is clearly visible but when the iphone are 625 ish is actually difficult to read plus the fat that i uses oled technology compared to lcd just means that it can reach deeper contrast levels we're talking a smartphone that can natively support hdr 10 plus content versus a phone that can't even support hdr 10 and there's so much more here i almost feel sorry for the iphone resolution for example this is a quad hd plus panel whereas this is actually below 1080p that gives the samsung over three times the number of pixels leather sink in to apple's credit that doesn't make something screen three times better and the iphone 11 is still reasonably crisp but there's no shaking the sheer size of that gap and to add insult to injury the galaxy s 20 uses the same 120 hertz refresh rate that we saw on the ultra that is twice the refresh rate to the iphone and twice the touch response rate making it by far the smoother and more responsive smartphone you almost don't expect it we're used to seeing the compact smartphones from companies just kind of suck compared to their larger siblings but that's not the case here the s 20 is just as nippy as its ultra cousin so flying between apps on its dynamic amoled display is actually quite a surreal experience the nail in the coffin for the iphones display is that it's screen is surrounded by some of the thickest borders we've seen this side of 2018 and a forehead that would make jimmy neutron proud its resulting screen to body ratio at about 79% makes the s20 88% look very impressive one thing samsung has done is toned down the curvature of all the screens on the s20 phones so you could argue they've lost a little bit of that display melting into the sides aesthetic that they had going on before but considering that it wasn't really a functional benefit and i think too many people are going to care it's good to see though with the iphone 11 yes the display is compromised but the internal performance is not at all it's got the exact same a 13 bionic chip and four gigs of ram as the top-tier iphone 11 pro macs and if anything the lowest screen resolution here means that games and apps should perform even better on this the galaxy s 20 is incredibly spect 2 we're talking eight or 12 gigs of literally the fastest rama vailable on a smartphone combined with the fastest chip seen on an android device that said the optimization of ios combined with the fact that the iphone has far fewer pixels to push means that more often than not i would expect it to get higher gaming frame rates now the camera situation here is much simpler than when we were comparing the thousand dollar-plus smartphones there's no 108 megapixel camera there's no 100 times zoom to talk about but the important thing to remember is that when it comes to camera hardware improvements generally speaking with each successive upgrade the upgrades become harder to notice and the end image becomes more about the quality of the software as opposed to the equipment so from everything i've seen the camera on the galaxy s 20 is 90% as good as the one on the s20 ultras and the iphone elevens camera is 95% as good as the one seen on the pro but between them let's take a look both phones have a 12 megapixel main camera but the s 20 is fitted with a brand new sensor almost 1.7 times larger than that of the iphone which should mean less noise and more detail both when there's a lot of light around and also when there isn't this is actually quite an important point for samsung one of the key areas their cameras have fallen behind in has been low-light video but the s20 should be turning this weakness into a relative strength on top of that it can do 8k video which is war times the resolution of the iphones 4k video that's not quite as impressive or useful as it sounds i mean the 8k video is a little bit junky and i don't think many people have an 8k monitor to watch it back on but it's still a seriously impressive feat for a phone of this size both have all troy'd cameras - which are pretty evenly matched they both have a wide 120 degree field of view and very little distortion i was impressed that samsung has also made the transitions when switching between the lenses much smoother that said this is something the iphone has done well right from the very start and the iphone switching occurs like twice the speed but finally though something has a zoom camera the only specs given to me other it can do hybrid optical zoom at three times and super resolution zoom up to 30 times really though samsung is talking in riddles here these are marketing terms and all we can really tell from this is that the actual magnification the optical magnification of the s20 is less than three times my best guess is that the zoom on this phone is a combination of actual real optical magnification but also cropping into the sensor because the telephoto camera is a sixty-four megapixel camera so there is room to do this they call it space zoom which is a bit of a push for what it really is but it's still ahead of the iphone and it's fairly safe to say that for the cameras in general in most scenarios samsung will offer both more versatility and a better quality final output something now has a pro video mode and a few genuinely thoughtful bits of software like better super steady video with more advanced ai and improved hardware and a single take feature that lets you just press one button and capture both photos and videos using both white and ultra wide cameras it's a really clever feature it's something i never really thought about doing but the second i heard them talk about it it makes total sense because there's so many times i find myself in where what i really want to do is enjoy the moment but i've got to capture it too and so this lets you do that you can capture everything without needing to think and worry about which lens you're capturing width or whether you want a photo or a video it just gets everything speaking of software it is android versus ios and there's a good chance you've already made your mind up over which one of those you prefer but i will say this samsung skin on top of android has never been slicker i'm not personally a fan of the new s20 wallpapers but it has never been more satisfying to fly between home screens and open applications as it is on this phone right here and part of that is just because of how nice the haptics are on the phone samsung has taken the high quality vibration motors seen on the e note 10 plus last year and further tuned them to deliver a new level of tactility and something else i noticed this time round is that it feels like samsung is trying to counter apple's key software differentiators they've built quick share their answer to apples incredibly good airdrop and they've worked with google to seamlessly integrate 1080p video calling into the phone's ui as an equivalent to apple's facetime i still prefer google's pixel skin in terms of raw visuals but some songs 1ui isn't far behind the iphone 11 software looks identical to every other iphones so there's not much to say about it apart from the fact that you can expect the iphone 11 to get major updates for four to five more years but the samsung i give it no more than to the s 20 spatter ii life is promising but it's also a bit of a wild card its capacity is high at 4000 milliamp hours that's 20% more than that off the iphone but battery is one of those things that i'm gonna have to reserve judgment for when i do my in-depth battery test so do you subscribe for that you've got to remember the s20 display is brighter it's larger it's higher resolution and it refreshes twice as fast so it is going to chomp through battery not to mention the difference between ios and android optimization yeah and both phones have fantastic audio with dual speaker setups and reasonably good bass now a couple of final things that i would say are going for samsung before i bring this to it's quite interesting conclusion charging the s20 charges are 25 watts of power and actually ships with a 25 watt charger i realize that sounds like an obvious point to make but it's not the case with the iphone which can charge with' watts of power but bernie ships with a 5 watt power brick the s20 starts with 128 gigs of expandable storage which seems pretty generous next to the 64 gig non expandable iphone 11 if you're the kind of user who wanted to keep files stored locally that's a risky option to go for and in connectivity wise the s20 is a 4 by 4 my mo phone meaning it's got 4 and 10 i for better signal and better data bandwidth versus the 2 by 2 iphone plus of course the s20 has a 5 g option something no iphone to date offers that's a big deal in 2020 if you are buying a phone now you're gonna use it till 2022 or 2023 probably and there's a good chance that at least by then you'll probably want the option there's more though while both phones support wireless charging the s20 has fast wireless charging 2.0 and can use this same charging coil to reverse charge your friends phone and the final main consideration is just that both phones have a different approach to security but technically speaking samsung has the more flexible option with both face scanning and a secure ultrasonic fingerprint scanner but i'd argue that the face id on the iphone is as good if not better than both of those put together in most cases having your face scanned is just a simpler more seamless solution than scanning your finger and a face idea itself is something like 20 times more secure than samsung's fingerprint scanner so who is the winner in the end it all comes down to both companies unusual pricing structures for the s20 in the uk and some other regions the base model is really reasonably priced but what they've done is for other regions only to 5g version that pushes the price up so in the uk the s20 is not hugely more expensive than the iphone 11 and that makes it a complete no-brainer in my opinion a better value phone for ninety five ninety seven percent of users no matter what ecosystem you're in but in the u.s. that's a bigger price gap one for which there is a case for either phone depending on what your specific needs are
