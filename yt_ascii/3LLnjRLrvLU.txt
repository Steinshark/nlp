- how are you? - so we talked over the phone. the paperwork took forever. so these are the 12 cars, i just bought them. and now that i've spend
over $100,000 on cars, i need to reprice them, because they were way too expensive. - this car is $3, $7, $2. this car, we pay you $1,000 to buy. and this car is $4.20,
do not get it confused. - that's a great price. - this car is $69. this car is going to my stepdad. $10, 99 cents, not $99. this car is $9. - [chris] that's expensive. - this car is free. and this is one of the most
expensive bad boys on the lot, it is $12. - [chris] this is a nice car. - [mrbeast] so yeah,
we own all these cars, and now we're giving them away. (chris yells) - 100% credit approved. - so we now have a car lot full of cars. i want them all gone

on the job, very important. - hey, welcome to the dealership. which car are you interested in? we only have a few left on the lot. - if you get this car, we give you $1,000. - oh wow. - do you feel like that's a fair deal? - that's an awesome deal. - okay. - do you want to haggle
a little bit, chris? - all right, we'll give you
the car for free and $1,100. - wait a minute! y'all going the wrong way. - i think we pull the
double whammy, all right? we hit her with 1,150, and then when she shuts it
down, we go with the 1,500 and seal the deal. after discussing, we got a new offer. - okay, okay, okay. - we give you 1,150 and a car. - 1,500, take it or leave it. - there it is.

whammy always works. - i'm about to pass
out, i can't, oh my god, you're going the wrong way. - [marcus] congratulations. - oh my god. - does that car have a full tank of gas? add another $50 just in case. (customer groans) 1,550. - this is so unbelievable. - [marcus] how does it feel? - it feels like it's mine. (laughs) - you got a new car for free, girl! free with $1,500 and a full tank of gas. - [mrbeast] do you remember
we bought a car with pennies? - i do, that was a long time ago. - man, i wish i had a new car. i got a new car! - [mrbeast] do you still like that car? - i do.

- mm-hmm. - just forget about it. does this fit your budget? - yeah, that- - [mrbeast] okay, you
wanna sign some paperwork? - yeah. - zero dollars, free. - [mrbeast] it's been a long day, i don't wanna get ripped off. i think we hit her with the $300. - i look forward to our
business burning together. - okay, $300, take it or leave it. - you're giving me $300 and that- - yeah, to drive it off the lot. - we wouldn't make you pay $300, that'd just be silly. - can i hug one of y'all? oh my god! oh my goodness! i want to hug you too, because this is crazy.
- not an aggressive hug. - sign it right here, but
it has to be in arial font. - can you give me an
example of arial font? - i'm not exactly sure myself. good, good. congratulations, you got a free car.
- thank you. - it's really unreal, i'm still kind of trying
to get out of the shock of getting something like that for free. - [mrbeast] well, congratulations. - thank you. oh my god. - [mrbeast] all right, sorry for that. - i got a new truck! and i got my own bed, for when i get kicked out for snoring! - this is true. oh god, my mom is gonna
kill me if you get hurt. we didn't even talk about the price. that's okay, you can just drive it away. so here's the deal, we
put them in the car, and told them last to leave keeps it. - we didn't say which car. - so what we did was we
pulled two cars up beside the middle car. ba da boom, ba da bang, dang. technically, they get in another car and they'll be the last
to leave that other car, so everyone wins a car. we don't want to have any losers here, so we're just gonna give you all a car. your new car is that one. you can have it. - really? - yeah, go ahead. - no, i can't get out of the car. - no, you can get out of the car, that one's your car. also your car is right there. you can go get in it too. let me have a word with my people. - [chris] why can't people
just take our good fortune? - [man] please do it! she's getting out, thank god. - yes, yes. - why are you watching my feet? - [mrbeast] because we want
you to get this car, please. - [chris] oh, she stepped out! - [mrbeast] all right,
now get in your car, yay! (group cheering) you won it. all right, congratulations. you can drive off with your brand new car. enjoy. this is your car. i mean, i don't care how you get in it. i just want you to know this is your car. that means you lost, so we keep this one. - you keep my car? - [mrbeast] oh, the
confidence, she said my car. all right, well, yep you're right, this is actually yours. so enjoy it. - but you really thought
you were gonna lose the car. but y'all got a car, how
does that make y'all feel? - still can't believe it. - you can't believe it? congratulations, y'all. - and there you have it, we sold all the cars on the lot. - i need paid, i worked all day. - [mrbeast] here's a
little bit of pocket lent. - sweet. - this video is very special to me and we impacted a lot of lives today. and i really wanna continue
doing stuff like this, which is why i need you guys to buy merch from shopmrbeast.com. literally, every dollar
we make off this merch goes right back into the videos. i wanna open a homeless shelter, plant a lot of trees, just
do a lot of good things, but it's very expensive. basically, i can't make an
impact without your help. - we need you to buy merch. - yeah! - and to make it easier on you, we dropped a lot of new
designs, like this one, look at that sleeve. oof, i love this one. and come here, chandler. oh, this one's just simple,
it goes with anything. and obviously, this hoodie, i love it. and this isn't just cheap crap, it's actually very high
quality, wouldn't you say? - yeah. - my nips are soft. - i really want to make an
impact and i can't without you. it's comfortable and all the
money goes to doing good. shopmrbeast.com, it'd mean the world to me if you bought something, thank you. [music] mrbeast6000 [music] [music] mrbeast6000, yeah, you know his name [music] [music] he changed it once or twice [music] [music] but i think it's here to stay [music]
