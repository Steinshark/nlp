with the passing of queen elizabeth ii i would like to look a little bit about the legacy that she has left behind to look a little bit at the symbolism of monarchy itself and maybe have a few thoughts on the new king our new king as a canadian prince charles iii some things that the people in the symbolic world us a few thoughts that hopefully will will be things that we need to pay attention to in the next few years this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] so whether or not you agree with the notion of monarchy or constitutional monarchy i think that most people agree that the queen elizabeth ii was a very impressive person she had a very impressive demeanor the way that she was able to engage with people all through her life the manner in which you know different from her own children was capable to of avoiding scandal and in her own life as well and i think that for many people she will be missed and so right now we a lot of people are talking about the transition whether or not this will be an opportunity here in canada especially you hear people saying whether or not this is an opportunity to to question the monarchy to question the institution if it would be a good time for canadians to get rid of the constitutional monarchy as the source of our government and i want to talk a little bit about some of the symbolism of monarchy let's say some of the negative aspects and some of the positive aspects that you find in scripture but also in the history in scripture monarchy is presented actually in a double way on the one hand in the book of samuel it is presented as something which at the outset would be negative that the people are clamoring for a king instead of worshiping god or instead of depending on god so it's as if they want to put a king in place of god and because of that samuel warns them that the king will take their children you know will will take the best of them to fight in their wars and as and and their daughters as wives and so there's ascension in that that the king can become place of attention which could take away from the attention that we need to put on god because it's a kind of it's a place where all the attention meets at the top but there is also another testimony in scripture about the king which is that in the book of judges you have all these prophets that come but the prophets come and go and there are these cycles of prophets and the prophets come and then something happens the prophets go and then things turn into chaos or sometimes the prophets bring about a kind of chaos or a kind of of confusion because of both because of people making promises that they can't keep and so there's a sense in which the in the book of judges the stories that you have they're very much related to the difficulty of heaven and earth connecting together and how they they tend to disconnect especially in the idea of making a promise which is untenable you know you have that story that is really similar to the story of beauty and the beast where you know a father promises to sacrifice his daughter and then it's like this crazy thing that that he does that this crazy promise that he that he makes and so there's a many images of that of course the story of samson is also about the difficulty of joining heaven and earth represented in many extreme images and so and then it says in the book of judges constantly like there was not yet a king in israel as if now the king can also be seen as a hook or an anchor which can join heaven and earth together properly if this is the if it's done right and so in so you could see say that you could also see in in general as something like how god transforms the fallen institutions and the fallen structures into something which can also function for his glory so although samuel says like you you know the reasons why you want a king are the wrong ones and that a king will be dangerous to you nonetheless the king king david and king solomon are the ones who build the temple and the temple becomes an image you know of a further image going moving towards the new jerusalem the heavenly jerusalem which which comes to the end of scripture and in christianity we also have a sense in which the king is a possibility a place where heaven and earth can hook together if the king is submitted to god if the king receives his crown from the bishop if the crow if the king submits his worldly authority to a higher spiritual power but even in even in christianity there's always a danger which is that by giving so much power and authority to one person there is of course the danger that that can be misused and that they can take it for themselves become prideful and then act in their own name rather than acting under the will of god the crown that they've received from above you could say that they have to receive the crown from above there's a tendency to want to take that crown for ourselves but the image of the king is nonetheless an image which is used without any apology in scripture to speak about a way to understand the role that god has in the world and also a way to understand christ one of the aspects of christ is to understand him as a king as an emperor and there are many images in the tradition which use that that image and so the king just like any worldly manifestation is a is a position is an image that is can be ambiguous or they can have two sides if those sides if if the position is not oriented properly is probably the best way to understand it but one of the things that the king and the royalty can do is act as a visible point above multiplicity which is able to gather attention and is able to make us recognize that we participate that we are one that we are together that we share an identity and so we could see that the for example the the crown in the uk has acted that way very much and you see it also not just in the uk but in other countries that still have that still have royalty that when there's multiplicity within the people so if in the the uk you know you have ireland you have you have scotland and then you have the the you have england but you also have whales and so you have all these cultures that that exist and have a very long and fraught history together but they are all able to recognize in the in the royal family something which is not bound in all these small provincial conflicts often that happens through the royalty actually being adjoining of the different tribes right so when we talk about you know the idea of marriage alliances as joining people together we sometimes think that it's strange and superstitious and that this is like why is it that you know some king marrying some princess from some land is going to join people together like why is that happening well it is because their children will not have only one identity their children will have an identity that is joined together and contains more more identity together and so that will reflect itself not just in their their biological you know dna or whatever but will manifest itself in also their allegiance and their attention that is their attention will be something like a joining of two possible allegiances into one and so the children of the union will transcend the multiplicity that is down below and so that is of course the ideal it doesn't always happen that way they're obviously like in every human system there are times where it goes goes astray and that doesn't that it doesn't do that but you can understand at least the principle of why something like that would be useful to have so you could imagine like the difference between mixture so all these royal families in europe were all non-national to a certain extent because they were all marrying amongst each other and they were like they were like a transnational place transnational people but that also had allegiance to their nation that is the king is is beyond the squabbles that can happen between the the between the between england and wales let's say between the different the different cultures but that he is responsible for those squabbles and so therefore is engaged let's say from above to trying to reconcile them and trying to bring those those differences together so that is obviously a role that the that the king has played in history and that still plays i think i think that the british crown still actually plays that role today and joins together in a kind of allegiance all the english-speaking nations you know that that have their history in their connection to the crown so that is something that can help us understand it and also it can help us understand why often these royal in the modern world especially a lot of these royal characters have played more ritual roles that they have ritual a function rather than a direct state function and we tend to think that sometimes that's useless what's the point why do we have put all this money into having this these people or this person at the top that actually isn't making the laws that isn't involved in the in the laws but it is it becomes ritual because it is in a way a manner to bind our attention and to bind our allegiance and to bind all these things together towards a person and that happens like in church it happens in processions it happens in parades it happens in in you know in the the ceremonial person at the top giving honor to other people knighting people doing all this kind of stuff which which seems like a it seems can seem to some people at least like just superstitious nonsense but is a manner in which they bind the the nation together and give a direction and give quality to what it means to be you'd say in the british commonwealth something like that and this is something which for example the the ceremonial aspect of a ruler is something which has happened many times in history before in the in the byzantine empire in the byzantine state let's say it was customary or it's something that happened quite a few times where there was a separation between the ritual aspect of the emperor and the legislative or more state-related aspect of the emperor sometimes that would be separated into two people so there would be kind of co there would be co-emperors one who would be in constantinople and would would participate in the church services the liturgies the processions all these all that what we could call pageantry but which was there to to participate in the identity of byzantium and to to gather people into that identity and then there was someone else who was more kind of the practical emperor who was involved in deciding where to go to war and you know to deal with all that that kind of stuff and so it's not something so when we see that the british crown has become almost only ceremonial i think that we have to think that we don't necessarily have to think that that is only bad that it that it actually has a function which is not just purely economic or purely it is a function that has to do with identity itself now as we come to this transition and we move towards prince king charles iii you know there's a lot of people a lot of people have many criticisms to offer to the royal family and to the children of the the queen but there are a few things to think about in terms of this king charles who is who is attaining the throne right now of course he does have scandals in his life you know he the whole story with princess deanna and then his is cheating on her and his other relationship all this stuff there is of course that there is there are some people also that find that he lacks the kind of backbone and the kind of presence that would be needed to replace someone like queen elizabeth ii but there are also other things to think about now in terms of this symbolic world people there is it's interesting to remember for example that prince philip his father was born greek orthodox and became anglican later in order to marry the queen but also kept a relationship with the orthodox world and that relationship seems to have been passed down to his son and so king charles has a has a very profound relationships with a profound relationship with some of the elders on mount athos and and gets advice and travels there maybe he won't do it so more but used to travel there quite a bit in order to engage with the monks at mount athos and so he has a deep sympathy for that that is that is also where he met for example the iconographer aidan hart when they were both in athos and at the same time king charles has a sympathy for traditionalists or perennialist authors he there's a video going around that people have been passing around and being surprised you know this is something that i've known for a very long time but i but i understand why some people are surprised to realize that he that he has been a supporter financial and just in terms of of giving his approval to many of the perennialist efforts the journals the conferences and also he started a school in london called the prince's school of traditional arts which is trying to restore the traditional vision of art aiden hart is a professor there and the school is run though is run by sufis and so this is also where on the one hand there is a positive aspect to his relationship to perennialism that is that he does seem to at least care about the notion that there are principles manifest that are manifesting in the world that there are eternal patterns and eternal let's say realities that infuse the the world of manifestation and that hold it together that traditional religions are part of that all of that seems to be to be the case but at the same time there is a danger in perennialism which i've mentioned and i think that we can actually see the danger of perennialism in this case which is that there's a danger in that perennialism actually does the opposite of what the the first authors of that group wanted which is that the first authors of the group wanted something like to show the transcendental transcendent principles behind the different religions but that you also should embody one particular path and that you should be engaged in one one particular path but when you talk like that in public and when you you have put those ideas out like that in writing there's a manner in which people will start to act as if they are beyond the the traditions they'll start to compare religions and they'll have all these journals and things of comparative religion that will take up more and more space and at some point they will start to act as if they themselves are above religion and that they can look at all these religions and kind of compare them and judge them and see what's good in all of them and so that leads to something like globalism and a kind of relativism and i think that that seems at the same time although it's very fascinating to see how it seems like that the king charles's perennialism seems to at least to a certain extent have led him into the arms of the world economic forum and to these kind of global agendas and this kind of global soup that seems to be manifesting itself like this this this kind of global moving towards something like a world government or something like that he seems to have been on board now i don't know to what extent he is to what extent he is just superficial in his allegiance to these things this is something that we will see in the next few years but i think it is definitely something that we should be paying attention to and watching and and seeing being able to recognize whatever good comes out of his of his kingship and also be attentive and be able to recognize what is what is dangerous and what moves towards the kind of post-modern slosh you know whatever that is setting itself up and so and so at the end of this all i can say is indeed the queen is dead god saved the king and maybe he were may he be worthy of that title
