hello and welcome back today we are talking about the most exciting topic in the world resumes just me in all seriousness whether you like it or not having a great resume is a necessary part about getting a job as a software engineer there's so many questions that you are probably asking yourself when you're making your resume what should i include in my resume how many pages should my resume be how do i communicate all the most important things while also being very brief how important is the resume anyway if you have been confused about any of these questions at any point you're lucky because you're in the right place i have spent the past four years literally analyzing and scrutinizing the process of creating and crafting the perfect resume and it has eventually led to some success so today we'll talk about specifically how to build the perfect resume that is specifically tailored toward getting a job as a software engineer or in the tech industry in general and we'll do this by going through my current resume and i'll be taking you through step by step through each section to explain to you exactly why i've made the decisions i have i will go through bullet point by bullet point why i have worded everything exactly the way that it is worded if you've heard my story you'll know that i was going in to banking and consulting for most of my universities until eventually i realized that actually i want to go into tech so pretty much everything i have in my tech resume now has been gathered over like the past year and so my resume is not even the most impressive resume out there which would give you hope that if you really want it it can be done because the great thing about this interesting and the great thing about coding is that there are many different ways for you to communicate your skills and your passion to your employers to get a job all you have to do is number one learn to code whether it's through the degree or celto or buga but whatever and showcase your skills or do something that allows you to prove that you've actually learned to code then showcase all of these in a resume send resume to recruiters convince recruited to give you an interview past interview then get a job really that is the process and where the resume comes in is specifically in the part about getting the interview the only purpose of your resume is to convince the recruiter or the hiring manager whoever's looking at your resume to give you an interview past that point the only thing that matters is your performance in the interview if you get the interview and you pass the coding interview and i've got a whole bunch of other videos coming on how to do that you will get the job so the only purpose of the resume is to communicate your experience and your skills enough to convince the recruiter to give you the chance to just give you the opportunity to interview for the company and so now let's just look at my current resume so here it is in all its glory and first of all just some general advice the most important thing about the resume is that it needs to be readable put yourself in the shoes of the recruiter because what these recruiters go through is they literally go through like 8 000 resumes a day or something like that first impressions are crucial and if you are sending them a resume poorly formatted that doesn't have proper grammar where you can literally see that the person has put absolutely no effort into it it immediately sends a very unprofessional image of you and probably they're just gonna bend the resume after two seconds because the purpose of the resume is not just affiliate with as much tax as possible is to communicate all the relevant details and the relevant skills that have an experience as succinctly as possible while having an overall nice looking resume template and if you want to use this exact template i use i will put this down in the description less is more don't go to two pages as a junior as a new grad you don't have enough experience to justify a two-based resume maybe if you have 10 years of experience you can justify that but as a junior you simply don't have enough important stuff to justify two pages when you're thinking about communicating anything you've done with your projects or your past experience it's specifically focus on what you did not what the company or the team did this resume is about you you don't spend any time describe driving like oh this is the cool project we worked on because then they're gonna go well the project was cool but where were you cool where you were you important what did you do this is literally it's a sales document you're trying to sell yourself so this is my template you want to order them in order of importance and everything has to be relevant they don't care if you worked as a sales assistant in some random company if you don't have anything relevant to add then you first need to find relevant skills or relevant experience somehow the great thing about software engineering is that technical projects or personal projects that you can build are relevant those are considered by recruiters as random experience sure it's not as good as an official internship but for me i don't have a computer science degree i do have a degree but it's in economics it's not relevant so that's why it's at the bottom and i have an internship but it's not a software engineering internship but it's sort of relevant so i still have it there but my personal projects are probably the most important thing that's communicating my coding skills in this resume for most people if you have a computer science degree i would have the education part much higher than what i have instead i just put some computer science online courses that i've done just to showcase that i have actually put in time of my own to actually learn computer science concepts now let's start going through this in a bit more detail so the first thing you need to have is your name obviously you may optionally have your role like i do check with what sort of the convention in your specific country but i know that at least in the us and the uk including a picture is a no-no they don't need to know what you look like you're gonna have your contact details or your email and your phone linkedin your github absolutely crucial to have them and on top of that especially if you don't have any formal experience it's crucial that you have a personal website a portfolio website to showcase what you have built an additional benefit of having a personal website is that you can then link your resume inside your portfolio website so that if a recruiter finds your website online they can also look at your resume and maybe you will get a callback via that way so if you just look at my personal website as an example having these and making sure that it looks really good it has a really impressive looking project here is automatically just going to give a very first impression of you because if you open up your website and it looks really bad they are going to assume that you're not very professional so the way i made my portfolio website is using hosting i pay only 2.99 a month and i get access to a wordpress website builder hosting as well as a free domain all for this single 299 subscription and they offer you a whole range of other stuff like security free email and very conveniently they have offered to sponsor this video it's literally the perfect sponsor for this channel because i actually use it for my own website basically once you sign up you're gonna land on this very intuitive dashboard then all you have to do is click setup and it will basically ask you a couple of questions about the type of website you're building for example we'll be building it for myself in this case we'll be making a portfolio website this we're just gonna go for wordpress because in my opinion it's the easiest way to build a website you're going to end up on this page where you have all these templates that you can just choose from and if you use this plugin called elementor you get even more templates and an even nicer sort of builder environment you can also easily grab your free domain by clicking claim domain on your main dashboard when recruiters or employers look at my website they are going to just have a very good first impression of me because the website looks nice even though i literally just use the templates but there don't need to know that do they i highly recommend you go to this link right now and on checkout make sure to apply my code internet make coder to get an additional seven percent of the description with that let's move on to the next section of the resume optionally you can write a short description of yourself like this don't ramble don't make it worthy to do the point who you are just in my case a junior software engineer deloitte and maybe like a brief summary of your core skills just keep it professional keep it brief so if you then go into what type of information you want to include in your bullet points first of all please ignore this xxx here as you can see i've only just started this role in september of 2022 and i'm recording this literally one week after i started my job in your bullet points you want to store everything with a power verb what does that mean it means something that's positive and active something that communicates something that you have done so like delivered designed built and let like i'll put like a whole list on the screen now that is how you want to think about every single bullet point that you're putting on your resume sorry to interrupt today's program but if you are enjoying this video so far i would absolutely love you if you could go down below in the description and hit the like button on this video it's completely free to do takes less than a second and by doing that you could also help other people because the more people like this video the more people the youtube algorithm will in turn show this video to and as a thank you and as a show of my appreciation here's a picture of a very cute kitten this time for you to enjoy now back to the video so think about what you've done in your experience anything about what is the most impressive way that i could put this without lying and this can actually be very hard you might think that you didn't even do anything impressive and seriously during this internship with like four weeks long i didn't do that much impressive stuff but i just spent some time figuring out how could i communicate what i did in the most impressive way possible everyone else is doing it you might as well do it as well and whenever in any way possible try to include numbers 10 000 plus users or if you can in any way think about like something that you did that maybe improved the team efficiency you can like just estimate your number let's go like delivered x which improved team efficiency by 30 any numbers that you include are going to sort of stand out and they're going to quantify the impact that you had even if it's sort of a stretch just try to include numbers whenever possible in terms of what kinds of projects to include when you're building projects focus on two or three very impressive and sort of more complex projects rather than having like 10 very small ones if your portfolio project you want to think about building projects that showcase is a range of different skills the second criteria you want to think about is something that the interviewer can easily understand when you look at these sorting algorithms visualizer and if you've seen the resume video by clement mihalescu i think his idea of building a visualizer program to be an excellent project it's probably probably one of the best portfolio projects i've seen so i decided to build my own version of the same thing so if you want to build something like this i suggest you go watch his tutorial video which we'll have in the description down below if you look at these bullet points built javascript blah blah implemented powerful verbs to start off the sentences and here you want to describe which technologies you use so you use javascript and react essentially just what the application does very briefly and here you want to make sure you have a link to these projects if there's no proof it doesn't exist my second one a programming language compiler again this is something that sounds very complicated but at the same time especially if you are a software engineer you understand what a compiler is and for here i've just put stuff about essentially this youtube channel entrepreneur oriole experience the purpose of this really is to hopefully make my resume stand out a bit it's sort of questionable whether i should even include this i've included it because it is relevant because i mean coding videos right and there's some impressive numbers here which again might stand out but on the other hand some employers might feel like well if he has this side hustle he might not be as engaged in a job so it's sort of questionable whether i should have it these in my resume and at the bottom i have my degree and again you have a relevant degree if you have a computer science degree this should be much higher than what i have it computer science courses as we discussed what many people do is they just include like a laundry list of skills they bought leadership communication teamwork and all those are obviously very important but i think it's important to include some justification so i mean the substance of like where you use two skills even when it comes to programming languages what maybe we'll do is they just have like a list of like oh i know this language this language this language anyone can do that anyone can just write a list so that's why i actually haven't included a list of of the languages and frameworks i'm comfortable because it's a lot more powerful but to actually integrate them into this project to show where you've used java where you've used python where you've used javascript and in what context in general when it comes to what sort of template to use don't try to go for some very fancy like colors like all of these rainbows kind of resume just keep it simple right keep it professional this is a very similar resume template to what i've used for a very long time and it seems to work very well so i'm seeing the need to change it if i was to actually apply with this resume i was in first i would like that i don't have to buy xxx here but i would also think about tailoring my cv specifically to the company that i'm applying for let's say i'm applying for google what i would do is go to google's job description look at specifically the skills they ask for this the experience they're looking for and look to include those points in my resume somewhere for example if i was applying for a python developer position i would make sure that all of my projects showcase my python skills from my job i would include any time when i worked in python on like a python project for example in terms of what other stuff not to have definitely don't have any of your like hobbies or like your personal social media they don't need to see your drunk pictures from your instagram please don't include that but in general just from whatever you've done to think about what is the way that i can put this across in my resume that makes it seem as impressive as possible you need to learn to sort of sell yourself it might not sound exciting it might even sound intimidating it was very intimidating for me but over time just through iteration and like learning about how to make a resume you should sort of just learn how to sell whatever skills and experience you have as effectively as possible so that in all its glory is how i would build a software engineer resume right now i was just updating this the other day once you have your resume the only thing that's now standing between you and the job is their dreaded coding interview and for many people this part is actually the most challenging part it's not very easy it took me a very long time that is why i made this video where i explain in the dumbest easiest way possible what data structures actually are why tech companies care about them so much and i have a second part coming on algorithms right here so after building your resume you absolutely must watch these two videos right here to actually start learning to pass those interviews thank you
