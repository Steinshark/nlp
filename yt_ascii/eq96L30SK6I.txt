actually it's it's remarkable just how much energy is involved in in doing these calculations associated with bitcoin mining the way that it's approached right across the internet is for a number of years has been well let's look at well how many hash attempts are being taken how many you know what's the what's the the rate of actually attempting to crack this code if we're going to put it in that context versus what's the sort of energy cost in terms of the efficiency of the hardware that's being used to solve this that's one aspect of the puzzle a better way of doing it and which is described in this rather good paper which i'm sure sean will link to below is to look at the economics but for me from a physicist's perspective it's really quite neat in many ways from many perspectives it's what's called a fermi problem so fermi problem the physicist fermi was really adept at working out reasonable estimates for quantities a really good example is just here's a raw question how many and this was the first sort of or the archetypal fermi problem how many piano tuners are there in chicago or we could do that how many piano tuners are there in nottingham so you got to think about well first of all you get hit by them i don't know how am i ever going to answer that let's look at estimates so let's think about right what's the population how many people do you have per house you know let's see probably listen or nothing let's do it for nothing say three hundred thousand how many do you have per house say two or three somewhere like that maybe two and a half kids but let's go with two just as an example so many what fraction of households would have a piano don't know five percent then we'd have to think about how often does our piano need to be tuned i don't know once a year maybe let's say once a year you take up all these and you stack them up and you it's just piled upon estimate but what's remarkable is that you can get a pretty good estimate in many cases obviously each one of those estimates has got its own error value and its own certainty but sometimes what we want to do is get you know calculate to the nth decimal place other times we just want those estimates and when you're coming back to the bitcoin issue and the energy consumption issue so when you look across the web you'll find many many different estimates and it's effectively affirming probably because nobody really knows nobody really knows no unless you can take each piece of equipment or each piece of hardware and say you know somebody could be running the absolute state-of-the-art kit and then somebody could have a farmer playstations we're not going to get a very you know an estimate that's accurate to the nth decimal place but we can at least think about well could we put a lower limit on this well let's think about you know absolute state of the art and let's think about the energy efficiency of the absolute state of the art this paper is quite useful because we turn to table one we find right at the top and i'm sure many in the audience will be much more familiar with this than i am this this equipment antminer s9 hash rate of 14 tera hashes per second so terror 10 to the 12. we find that the power efficiency so the joules per giga hash so the amount of energy that's chewed up a giga hash which means a total of 10 to the nine hash calculations per second is of the order of .098 joules per gigahertz it's a very recent paper but what you can see is the the power efficiency so we need to think about well how many actual operations how many attempts hash attempts are happening per second and it is an absolute astronomical number literally astronomical it's 2.6 by 10 to the' per second that's what's have you know that that's the number of hash attempts that are happening across the entire sort of bitcoin ecosystem if you want to put it which is a remarkable but it is truly astronomical because the number of galaxies in the observable universe is only of order 10 to the 9 so this is 10 to the 9 by 10 to the 9 that number that's a just a mind-bogglingly astronomical number so it's 10 to the'. so that's 10 to the 9 gigahash let's put it that way so that means what we have to do is to is we need to take this number this point zero nine eight and multiply it by the two point six by ten to the nine we work that out it turns out that we are talking about two point 2.6 gigawatts of power so i've just translated there from power to energy remember power is the rate of doing work which is the rate of energy expenditure effectively which is different from energy we'll come back and think of energy in a second so it's the difference between for example kilowatts power and kilowatt hours energy but you work it out and it turns out to be two point off the order 2.6 gigawatts adding on lots of other decimal places pointless because of the estimates that we've used in there in fact you could make an argument that even having one decimal place under this circumstance is probably pushing it because we have sown this this is just really we're thinking about a lower limit we do not know actually obviously all machines involved in bitcoin mining are not of this specification we also haven't bundled in for example the costs associated with cooling we haven't bought in and this is this is purely the efficiency we haven't bundled in costs to sorted actually with making the devices as well so there are capital costs and there are usage costs etc so it really is it's a physics problem but it's also a coupled physics and economic problem one of the first papers that got a lot of attention that looked into this was from some researchers in ireland back in 2014 2.6 gigawatts is not that far removed from the 3.1 gigawatts of that ireland uses which is given my accent is fairly close to home close to my heart and it's now there's a website called digi-economist where you can look up the the current energy consumption and all the values associated with with bitcoin mining and we're now we've gone beyond ireland and we're now up i think it exceeds the czech republic's consumption so and it's it's going up it's steadily going up so if you go to that digi economist website which i thoroughly recommend there are many items associated but one of those items is the the the cost per transaction basically in terms of the energy cost in terms of kilowatts per hour and it turns out that it's off the order of per transaction of a thousand kilowatts per hour it's difficult to put that in sort of context sometimes but that's an awful lot of energy when you you total it up in terms of cost per kilowatt hour in the uk that's something like it fluctuates obviously but it's something like 14 pence per kilowatt hour in the u.s something like 12. in fact this paper produces much smaller estimates in terms of its averages talking about maybe five cents per kilowatt hour anyway we're talking about orders of magnitude it's fermi problem again and you add that up and you compare 14 pence per kilowatt hour times a thousand kilowatt hours there's a question then a cooling if you've got massive farms you've obviously got out in the financial cost of keeping them cool you've got i guess that you know the bar goes up and up and up and up and up in terms of the computational power you need to processes and it's built into the system to have this sort of arms race in terms of building up the complexity so you got to build that in you got to keep your kit up to date but you add that all in still at the moment the pure economics of this or is that we haven't hit the ceiling that 2.6 gigawatts is definitely not the ceiling there's an awful lot more in terms of where the the energy is going to upscale i just got to stress though remember these are all estimates that's that would we're coming back to that fermi problem idea that's what we're doing you might say we're plucking values out of the thin air we're not you know they're obviously informed values but it makes me smile when i see you know people quoting these values to three and four decimal places when the error bar is like that and they're quoting with a precision like that the interesting thing of course is this is considering the whole system on aggregate for the individual perspective as it were for the individual minor is there's a hell of a lot of risk or there can be a hell of a lot of risk involved and you've got to you know depends on how brave you are i guess financially whether you want to take that risk so this is how bitcoin mining works right in brief so we have a block and at the top of the block is the hash of the previous block and a number right which we're going to call our nonce it's the number we're making up let's
