hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by mobil1 we're going to see who can change the oil in their car faster a mechanic or an engineer i already started the timer you better get to it hey let's get going here we are we're going to pop the hood step numero uno now i could do that later but i don't want to touch the inside of my car with oil on my hands so what do you think about that i like it that is a giant breaker bar jason what's with that giant breaker bar well i'm not very strong charles so i use things like giant breaker bars to compensate i forgot my tub i think the pressure's getting to him step one don't drink the oil onto the floor okay charles so the time to beat is minutes and seconds and what do you know it's already ticking he started it early that could be the difference right there let's see if my choice in vehicle comes back to haunt me which i think it will i actually do have to lift the car up too so i don't think this should take too much time now i'm noticing that you didn't do what most people would probably do when they change their oil and that's actually lift your car up yeah so the reason why we're not doing the miata and we are instead doing this subaru is that i don't have to lift it up and because of that i can save some time in this battle against you so i think most people would probably rather be good at something than win i think engineers would rather win than be good at something so that's what we are doing while these lifts really do save you some time huh well most cars i think you have to actually get off the ground and i also have this giant belly pan we gotta take off all right i do like this guy yeah this is a pretty great little friend here to have [music] all right next step is to get this phil do you have one of these tools i don't have that filter this is what only the pros use so i wouldn't expect you to have they're really expensive okay i can i'm gonna have to add that to my tool list top of the line oh gosh it's not doing it i see why you use it there you go oh it's good it's good still need to keep using it you can tell you can tell the pressure's getting to him you're doing great jason charles is this what flat rate feels like this is always erased very much what flat i've never had this much pressure you get paid as an engineer for eight hours to work for i don't know a couple hours i guess so i noticed you're starting with the filter instead of the drain plug why is that yeah so [music] the oil is going to take a little longer to drain from the pan than right here so i'm trying to overlap a little on this also there's a little thing in the center of the filter housing you're supposed to take out so to drain the oil but a lot of them are all stripped out so you just got to go a little slower but not too bad that wasn't terrible nah okay next step is put the new filter on so before we do that we're gonna get a little fresh oil otherwise i know people will yell at me for not putting fresh oil on the gasket yeah you want to make sure that seals well you're gonna get this nice and lubricated nice work look at him go he's doing a great job i'm not i'm not even fooling okay so i need to do a 7 8 turn on that that is let's see 0.875 rotation all right perfect i can do that i'm noticing you did have to do some calculations is that an engineer thing yeah it's a ti-83 plus i mean only the best engineers are using those but i want to get it down to the decimal the nearest thousandth in this rotation right here okay did it did it buzz do you have a calibrated torque arm there too yeah i got a baby was yeah charles how many oil changes do you think you've done oh in my career like all together yeah so you were a technician for how many years yeah like 13 13 years okay so let's say in a given week how many oil changes would you do i don't know maybe i would say probably average like four a day for a day that's probably pretty close so like 20 in a week or like 16 a week like four days a week yeah four days a week most most of my career okay just like jason did lube in the seals oh perfect you want to make sure those are lubricated okay so 50 weeks in a year yeah yeah okay so 16 a week 50 weeks a year 13 years so like 10 000 oil changes you did that math very great yeah right off the top of my head just brilliant honestly these i have a calculator in my pocket yeah you have one on top of your shoulders too that's your head also this one is actually a pretty straightforward volkswagen oil change and what's this step here that you're doing so well i'm not actually sure charles how many washers are you supposed to use when you oh i think it's one per cylinder one for each cylinder okay and that'll be four yep just why don't you start with one though and then if it leaks you just add another you can add one later okay that's probably best all right so we're gonna get our torque wrench you know you leave those on the ground that's that's what the proof that's what the pro engineers do when they change oil they leave their tools all over the floor we're gonna take this with us as we get under there because it's probably not completely done draining but we're gonna call it good we'll just go ahead and clog that up if i can get it threaded correctly all right are we going to get any on the ground it would look close to me but you did good all right now i i'm gonna put a new drain plug on oh new drain plug because i have the old one huh [music] speaking of time where are we oh you're doing great it's like it's only been like a minute or two at this point you know what though i'm gonna i'm gonna overlap a little here there you go open up my yeah get that thing open oil i'm also not going to butcher this top part like you did that was pretty pretty terrible i feel like i got the oil in the car that's all that matters [music] i will say what will you say if you're going to be doing your oil change you're probably rushing rushing to do your oil changes you know it might be frowned upon you don't really want to skip any car maintenance like you don't really want to you want to make sure you do everything correctly right did you turn that torque wrench on yeah i could turn it on oh it turned off on its own well let's see let's see how close we are we're like 900 pound-feet [music] oh there we go i heard that beep all right we've done it don't forget your bucket you don't want to leave it under there don't leave your bucket all right buckets out from underneath [music] rushing through an oil change is a very bad choice and you shouldn't do it because even though this is a very simple basic you know six or seven steps depending on your car yeah you get one so what do you think the cost what do you think the fastest you've changed the oil in a car is so i don't know about changing but the fastest i've drained the oil is with a hundred shot of nitrous on a gli on the dyno and it blew a hole in the front of the block and the back of the block so is that like a that's like a professional technique that i wouldn't be familiar yeah yeah it's definitely like pros only not for amateur you know oil changes are one of those things where like yes you can do them fast and you know like you said i've done 10 000 of them which is maybe a little optimistic but i just for such kind of a mundane job on most cars i've seen oil changes messed up more than any other job and it can usually result in catastrophic things like costing an engine costing a turbocharger leaving a customer stranded that kind of stuff we're doing great what's our next step next step is fill in this oil oh gosh see this is where that they don't make breaker bars for these things do they what if this was really where there you go oh man he is strong nice work wow all right so you got your funnel [music] so an oil change at the dealer i worked at paid four tenths four tenths which is 24 minutes that's start to finish okay 24 minutes is how long you have to start finish grabbing the car including it in the shop getting in the car getting it from that's pretty quick that's not much time it's not enough time but that's what it paid so you had to hustle now it's time oh mobile one extended performance 0w 20. let's get in there guys look at that poor baby oh yes that is phenomenal how much oil does this thing take 5.1 but you know what i usually find even with five it goes just a touch over that top dot so hold on i'm also noticing this is w20 yeah i just chose the thinnest one because i thought it would pour faster to help me win this competition pretty sure my car takes 540. yeah you would put something thick and slow it'll take you a good while to get that oil in okay what if i help you out here and pull this yeah i think that'll help do you think i pulled the dipstick for a faster you could i think you're trying to add stuff it's definitely it definitely poured faster i don't know about it definitely did all right that is empty well we're just gonna stick this back over here mine the oil that i left on the ground yep we're gonna get this closed up you're going fast i'm impressed and get that closed up what about checking the oil level well we are going to do that so we're going to check oil level and we're going to check for leaks after running the engine and just make sure there's no problems if there are i guess it's like a disqualification or we'll add time but i think we're going to be all right can i add a quick tip yes make sure that you open your garage door before starting your car good tip and got my funnel on wow perfect for charles i do like that your funnel actually directly attaches again with the tools here you your tools have definitely been superior yeah but i guess that's expected for someone who's done ten thousand thousand wow look how much is in there and you're just confidently charles you want me to help you out like like you helped me out no i know no oh that just caught went faster did you see it that is a myth a myth and an illusion now for this one which way do i gotta pour it yeah you always want to pour it down which one people make so much fun of you if you pour these things yeah i mean technically that's the right should get fancy with it does it actually matter if all the oil makes it in your car no [music] oh i like that you can just leave that in there yeah [music] let's see if we got close wait did you check your oil before i checked after so you don't have to okay you can just just close it off right here and it was hood down right hood down is the rule well there you have it i think that's proof like definitive proof yeah no variables are in there a highly optimized car for changing oil an engineer will change the oil faster on their car yup than a mechanic who's done 10 000 of these that's pretty impressive i think it's pretty obvious though where the true advantage lies for you yeah i didn't have a calculator to use during okay okay well hold on i had a calculator in my pocket the whole time for you to use at any moment if you needed it and you didn't ask jason short of not rushing oil changes what do you think your biggest takeaway from our sweet competition would be i would say my number one takeaway from this was that using a superior synthetic motor oil like mobil one provides better protection against wear better protection at high temperatures and critically better flow at cold temperatures it was the cold flow it was that 0w versus your 5w it gave me the edge to pour in that oil just a touch quicker so thank you as always charles for joining in on a collaboration a big thank you to mobile one for sponsoring this video and thank all of you for watching if you have any questions or
