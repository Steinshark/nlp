i jumped on the 8k gaming hype train as hard as anyone especially with that early look at nvidia's rtx 3090 the world's first 8k gpu but have you ever realized you're riding a bandwagon that just doesn't make any sense i mean even now the second oh i saw this liquid cooled rtx 4090 from msi who sponsored this video i thought wow with up to two times the performance maybe we could do it even better this time except i couldn't help noticing that while 8k gaming is still a highlighted feature on nvidia's product page it's all all them down at the bottom here that the 4090 is somehow worse for 8k than the last gen is it that they simply couldn't find an 8k monitor to validate it on or is it that 8k gaming is just really really pointless no matter how powerful your gpu is the only way to know is to try it [music] to get our 8k groove on the first thing we're going to need is a tricked out gaming pc and this one courtesy of msi is an absolute doozy at its gooby center is their rtx 4090 supreme liquid x it is an absolute beast with integrated liquid cooling 24 gigs of dddr6x memory over 16 000 cuda cores and much much more expensive yes but you've got an 8k display you're not exactly hurting for cash are you for our testing we'll be using the exact same unit that lg provided for our last 8k gaming video their signature zx 88 inch oled that lives here in our employee lounge for after hours smash bros tournaments we're going to start by recreating our 8k gaming experience from last time man look at all those k's there's eight of them got our hd there's eight got a ray tracing dlss pretty much everything set to ultra nightmare and we're running on our rtx 3090 so we can get a baseline you'll just wait it'll hang like this but it'll go it will yep oh here it goes here it goes hey look at that oh yes pretty smooth eh i actually yeah we're only getting like 55 fps but it's ultra nightmare for the most part yeah okay this was not smooth it hitches oh yeah when i when i do like a quick'0 that is yeah not a lot of frames in between there can i change all this nope you should be able to well oh okay whatever i died see you later cool so that's pretty close to the experience you guys were getting last time yeah we wanted to retest the 3090 because since then we've gotten new cpus new drivers and we wanted to see well hey is the 3090 an even more viable 8k gaming card than it was before turns out not really about the same as before yeah it's pretty pretty close across the board actually time to upgrade all right and see you later 30 90 supreme nice knowing you hello 490 supreme i gotta say when it comes to these like 250 350 400 watt cards liquid cooling just kind of starts to make sense done it like that is a much more reasonable sized gpu well this is big but that's not the point the point is it doesn't look quite as ridiculous here 40 90 air cooled version of the supreme is even bigger than the old 3090. can't build a ratchet 4090 gaming system without a ratcheting screwdriver ltt storage hey buddy hey there we go check out settings make sure nothing changed blah blah blah yep exact same settings cool oh it says connecting this time it's still frozen yeah it's still frozen okay hold on but we're getting 300 fps right now in the loading screen wow it feels a lot more responsive right is that a solid 90 fps yeah size 97 but our lows are one percent lows down to like 80 85. is it 50 so i think it's it might stutter still but like it's a much more rare like you started like three times with the 390 right oh stutter wait i need ammo that wasn't a bad stutter though no it wasn't as bad but like it would bug me oh this is totally playable though yeah 100 100 playable yeah man if we were willing to settle for what we had last time which is more like 60 fps you think we could render it 8k native maybe yeah try it we had a lot of criticism last time like yeah you're gaming at 8k but you're using dlss which is essentially just gaming at a lower resolution and then upscaling it but maybe we don't need to upscale dlss isn't actually doing as much as i thought it would so you're getting a solid like 60 65 yeah holy crap you can actually game natively at what you could do with dlss before that's pretty wild it's gorgeous this is what sucking rage racing you guys cannot emphasize that enough all right let's try some other games at this point you're probably wondering why we're using a 12 900k cpu rather than the latest ryzen 7000 or intel 13th gen and the answer is that we actually wanted to use the latest cpus but the ryzen 7950x ended up being so unstable that we wasted an entire day trying to get it to work and the lab still has all of our 13th gen core chips so about 900k oh shoot i didn't check the settings are they probably right i can check them from any games probably right 200 fps i'm like kind of excited now last time around we got 27 fps average with ray tracing and dlss which is like console playable but not exactly a pc gaming experience well holy crap is this right i don't change anything settings 97 fps check the settings i can't be right okay quality rtx on set to high instead of very high go to preset very high i think that's the big difference highest yeah my 99 lows are still 75 fps this is 100 playable dude it's like a five-year-old game now yeah but it's still a pretty game i know like people ask why we test it because it's a super pretty game and it's still demanding i mean that's not what it meant to do oh my god the water girl squiggly greg doll was just like nope i want more 10k no no i mean i want i want to run it natively okay sure i don't want a dlss so maybe you don't have to it's already dropped okay oh yeah this is way harder 50's not bad hold on i wonder if hdr isn't done i wonder if that's changed things oh no it's off yeah yeah yeah so okay so that much so that's probably part of some of our performance why we're getting like 100. let's try it we're gonna try it it looks like between game runs our windows hdr got disabled so it is running in hdr now and rendering natively at 8k with hdr it feels a little sloppier on the inputs that did yeah it's a little blurry however it's still like 45 50 average you're being a hater it's a pretty damn good looking game it looks very good to see you develop a better game i saw in the game you developed and it sucked actually gears five looks amazing i'm not talking about gear tonight okay in fairness though these are older games that we've looked at so far what if we were to look at something a little bit newer what were you getting with the 3090 in this game well i wasn't in multiplayer i was in campaign but we're getting about 30 fps really because i've got 60 fps right now and i'm just getting all these kills i'm rendering natively in a current demanding game this is sick it turns those kills tears a little too much though it does hey yeah is that stopping me from getting a killing spree ladies and gentlemen what's my halo kill ratio infinite killing friendly does this game even have deal stuff i thought it did i don't care whatever okay that was clear it's clearly playable i think we made our point ak gaming totally a thing so we were sucking back 430 watts with this bad boy but never saw higher than about 63 degrees freaking impressive not to mention that compared to an air-cooled card this thing is actually reasonable when it comes to size and weight in the slot in cs go on the highest presets with no anti-aliasing no dlss we were getting 160 fps average with a 30 90. with our 4090 wait this doesn't seem right we're only getting a hundred oh a times msaa eight times we're still getting 100 fps yeah and the game it'll crash for that yeah holy crap we are running at 8k native with dual berettas and over 200 frames per second hitting 330 sometimes what and it feels like it that's that's super responsive like this is not a problem wow berettas are a problem though well yeah for sure but hey hey 21 bullets left a little while to reload got him whoa one percent lows are like'0 200 fps totally totally no this is not just playable like this is competitive playable which raises the question with 8k gaming then seemingly alive and well why would i call it a stupid bandwagon because math let's turn our game down to 4k and see if we can tell the difference okay i'm checking like these power lines for stair stepping and stuff because we're not we're not rolling anti-aliasing if there's anywhere we're gonna notice it it's here yeah this really does not look very different this looks not bad at all this looks totally fine maybe it's just me though why don't we gather up some rubes i mean test subjects sorry i mean colleagues and see if we can have a bit of fun with them we're gonna tell them they're gaming at 8k and watch them marvel at the clarity and sharpness and then we'll reveal that actually it's just running at 4k on an 8k display so we're using a 40 90 uh-huh and we're gaming at 8k and it's on an 88 inch tv how do you think it looks i feel really far away even though the screen is big yes what do you think about the clarity and stuff oh it is very clear i'm gonna tell you a secret it's set to 4k right now really something i'd really be able to notice especially like for these assets i don't think they're even in 4k themselves so if you walk up to it it's not like you're gonna notice anyways right so i think it's really a question of whether or not a lot of these things are intended to be played at 4k or even more so 8k right okay i'm gonna restart it put in 8k okay see if you can even notice the difference at all so now we're definitely an 8k it looks the exact same right yeah okay sure this is amazing the texture details incredible looks pretty good see how my team yeah he is okay okay i got a secret for you yeah you're playing in 4k right now on an 8k display that's diminishing returns my friend right yeah i could not tell i also have not played this game in a very long time that's fine take take some time to like take a really close look at some stuff yeah we'll swap to 8k okay and we'll see if you can even tell the difference once it's in proper 8k you're getting a lower fps we went from like 350 like you know 256 270. no it looks like oh man i can't tell the difference maybe the blood no but even that texture just doesn't look it doesn't make give you any benefit there's nothing nice shot thank you it's pretty sharp looking yeah the halo guys look pretty good yeah those effects looked pretty sick yeah so here's the trick it's 4k right now okay and it's upscaling the ak hey look i got an achievement do you notice at all no it's pretty sharp and this tv has a nice upscaler in it anyway so okay so now let's change it to 8k feels about the same it certainly doesn't feel as fluid but that's just feeling how does it look does it look sharper no at all not really it looks about the same textures look just as sharp should i be noticing a difference mr blue no you shouldn't be would you pay more for an 8k tv no but there are lunatics out there who do ak is a higher number than 4k so it's better wow you heard it here first folks this just did how much would it cost me to get this experience at home oh my god everything the card alone is like'00 us dollars the tv was about 30 000 when lg sent it over i think so either i could send my kid to college or i could buy this setup yeah obviously you should buy the setup it looks really good i don't have anything to compare it to obviously sitting from here sure i don't have like a 4k thing to look at but solid it is 4k what it's an ak tv with a 4090 and we've set halo to 4k right now you were messing with me yeah was that on purpose yeah oh okay i thought i just wasn't paying attention now you get the true 8k experience obviously it's gonna sound bias now but it looks clear you think so i think so no i'm so bad with something looks good this looks great looks amazing i don't know like i i can tell when things are stuttery yeah but i'm i'm not great at telling like the texture is on here are so crisp like i i just want fluidity in my game yeah this looks in many ways completely identical to what i would expect it to be on a 4k television right if you told me that this was 4k i would say yes it is that's exactly what it is you guessed it there you go change it to 8k now though and let's see if we can notice like much of a difference i was really surprised at the fps i was like there's no way it's getting that many fps's this is exactly the same experience you got some dlss going on here for sure there's no way i'm getting 200 fps right now it's a 40 90. water cooled with dlss right maybe maybe is that the channel how does ak look how forget about the frames per second far away what do you mean it's nice and sharp but i'm really far away so i don't know we're in 4k that's why we're getting like 200 frames per second so i knew i was being bamboozled some way yeah hit cancel no hit cancel you gotta change it to 8k now because now you got to really try 8k wow the detail in those look at the trees man that's a lot of pixels brother okay i'm gonna switch it to 4k i'm not gonna lie doesn't look as different as i was expecting can we can we go back one more time okay there's definitely a lot more detail sure but man it's 8k is stupid you can really see the pores in this concrete i feel like my series x looks like this dang like it doesn't look that that good this could be four i guess it is oh wow see i'm a gamer i know my halo i when i saw my master chief i knew this ain't no way my master chief now let's change it to 4k or 28k and see if you can even like see any kind of improvement okay look at those bullets those look awful but do you think this looks like better than the 4k image you were just looking at absolutely not i feel like i'm being pranked and it's still 4k like it does not look it's it's a little more terry i guess because we're lower fps yeah but no the issue is that from a natural comfortable viewing distance 8k is not necessarily going to increase the perceived clarity or resolution of the image there's actually a pretty simple formula for when the individual pixels on a display become indiscernible from each other and at 88 diagonal inches here we would have to be closer than 69 inches in order to make out the individual pixels and that assumes that we have perfect vision but lioness you might say it's a little more complicated than that and 8k is a forward-looking technology it's intended for much larger tvs and projectors and those are good points there are times when we can see a little bit of texture shimmer or a little bit of stair stepping in something like a a power line traveling across the blue sky but that could easily be solved with a little bit of multi-sample anti-aliasing for a much smaller performance hit and as far as larger displays go the thing is is that as they get larger you're going to want to sit even farther away from them we did a full video on this a while back but thx actually publishes guidelines for how much of your field of view should be optimally occupied by an image before you begin to experience eye fatigue or motion sickness and it's about 40 degrees maximum meaning that no matter what screen size you plug into their calculator 4k and 8k are going to spit out the exact same recommended viewing distance which is well outside of retina so the good news is that 8k gaming is four reels here with the 4090 and who knows may even be affordable in another generation or two but the other good news is that you don't need to care about that at all which might explain why msi actually sent over their optics mpg 321 ur-qd 144 hertz 4k monitor when we pitched them doing an 8k demo video to show off their rtx 4090. that particular monitor is designed for gaming and content creation it's quantum dot to enhance color accuracy color saturation and contrast and of course is 144 hertz with a one millisecond response time and nvidia g-sync for faster smoother frames it works for both pc and console gaming and to learn more about msi's monitors and of course gpus you can follow the link in the video description now one use case for this kind of gaming horsepower at higher than 4k resolutions is vr but whatever the zuck might think those headsets aren't going mainstream anytime soon so it's not something that we have to worry about thanks for watching if you like this video or maybe if you hated it take a look at the last time we did this with an rtx 3090 to see just how far we've come
