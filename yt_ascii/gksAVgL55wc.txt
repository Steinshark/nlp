it's time for a makeover and i'm not talking this although this needs it too i'm talking what's behind me look at how messy my office space is not only how messy it is but it's very not practical for working from home it's just a disaster and let's get to it foreign [music] do i look more put together like a human at least more importantly look what we got i feel like vanna white right now okay and then we'll come closer closer yes this is right i recently just got the new mac mini 2 and i am so so excited about this one of the main reasons i think i'm excited well let's take away all the technical aspects one thing i'm really excited about this is i get so many questions from you around what computer to get i don't have a ton of money to spend right now i'm a student you know i want to get into programming i want to get into content creation but i don't have the income to support buying these computers that might be thousands and thousands of dollars this literally starts at 5.99 it is such an affordable and accessible place to start if you are looking for a computer to program on to content create on to edit on and we're going to dive into it today okay as i mentioned i got the mac mini with m2 and of course it has the m2 chip which allows for the mac mini to get a boost in cpu graphics and ml performance also too unified memory and super fast ssd m2 features an advanced storage controller with fast inline rate encryption and also too i'm using the studio display which i absolutely love this studio display it has it is 27 inch 5k retina screen has advanced camera and audio which is great when i am in meetings way too often and also to the seamless connectivity okay we have our beautiful new mac mini 2 setup beautiful setup it looks i mean like can we place i'm just sitting down here can we place an image here or a video just to remind you what it looked like prior try and blur me out though because what i look like prior we don't want to get i'm so excited about this and i want to take you through though as well some other things on my desk that i really love for programming for creating videos for just working from home i love working from home but it can get kind of stagnant or if you don't have the right work environment especially from home it can get kind of depressing so one of the things i get asked about a lot from all of you is my standing desk rides are here let me back you up a sec okay standing desk riser i got on amazon just search literally standing desk riser and it's one of those things where i don't really like what a lot of standing desks look like i think it's because they all kind of look cheap in my opinion i haven't found one that looks expensive or i don't know i like things that are grand and this table here is from restoration hardware that's terrible and it has like a really nice vintage feel to it so when i got it i wasn't working from home all the time otherwise i probably wouldn't have got it but i still really love it and i wanted to stand though some of the time so i got this standing mount desk here and it has like a lever on the side here and you literally just lift it up it's that easy and then i can just work from here and it just makes such a difference i get asked all the time i don't know why but i guess asked all the time can you code standing up yes i don't understand why that's even a thing yes i quote standing up yes i code sitting down laying down two probably too much another thing i absolutely love is my herman miller chair let me pull you down again okay look at this chair it's beautiful it is called the i'm forgetting what it's called now i'm going to insert it here what it's called but this chair is is expensive it was i think around i think it was around a thousand dollars ish and honestly it was custom as far as the color goes the measurements all of that i love the back of it if it's so cool now i got this when i was working from home and it was one of those pieces that was an investment i knew i was going to be working from home i wanted to have proper posture or an ergonomic setup and i purchased it gotta be honest with you i love the chair do ice it cross-lated gate legged hunched over like this all the time still yeah i do is it worth it that's up for you to decide but i'm just being totally candid here i love it though i think it looks really interesting and yeah all right let's get jumping into the the tech stuff again all right 24 hours later we are back let me show you what the office looks like so far i actually ended up setting up my new workspace my new mac mini 2 and then i was like you know what why not just tidy up the whole house so i got sidetracked and now here we are back at it i was using it this morning so i want to share with you some kind of productivity tools i was using for it also get into talking about coding on it but first let me show you what it looks like all right we are not gonna go this half you can see bugsy's bed there we're just gonna stick here i'll show you my whole office one day but this section here i am so happy with how it turned out it looks beautiful it's so sleek sleek chic and clean i need to do something about cord management but it's just like it looks lovely all right let's get into it also too i'm using the magic trackpad and the magic keyboard with touch id okay first thing i want to do is dive into the stage manager this is honestly if you're like me you have probably too many tabs open too many applications open and it gets very frustrating to keep track of so this is what i've been using a lot and you can see here i'm already using it but before i show you that let me share with you how to get started on that go up to the control pane here and ensure a stage manager is turned on in this case it is so let's dive into a little bit the apps i'm using right now right now you can see i have google chrome open essentially i'm working on a tutorial for you around python you know i love making python automating things actually on that note comment down below what you want me to automate next because i feel like we're automating our lives at this point i also am doing a talk on modern web architecture as you know for my day job my nine to five is working in developer relations one of the things i've really been focusing on a lot is the architecture around building different websites and different platforms all right also too i have opened my emails which we are not going to get into we are not that personal here but but my emails here so i can easily just be flipping between each of them also too with the release of mac os ventura comes free form and this is an app i'm actually going to dive into in a separate video because there is this it could be a whole video on its own essentially and i think there are so many interesting ways that we can use it for specking out applications our code our talks working collaboratively so in the meantime i'm just going to insert a screenshot here of it and stay tuned for another video where we will dive all into that app okay let's talk about coding a little bit we are going to be building a lot on this mac mini 2 and you'll see a ton of tutorials coming up with it so i'm not going to dive into a specific tutorial for this video because this is more around my office setup and just setting up the mac mini 2 and getting into the specs around it but a lot will be coming and in the meantime i'll link my github down below so you can clone any of the repositories play around with them tinker i'm actually installing xcode as we speak right now i have spec's hero insert of code compiling so it's 3.2 times faster project build performance in xcode which is kind of insane and it's especially considering going back to the start of this video when we talk about the price point for this and how it really is one of those things whether you're a student breaking into the industry or maybe you've been in it for a long time and you are just looking for a very reliable productive super high performance computer at a really great price and i don't know i get really excited about this because i think tech should be accessible for anyone and this is definitely in the right direction and the last thing i want to highlight is we are always using different pieces of hardware now we live in a tech centric world and i love that apple actually keeps the environment in mind i just think it's another area that shows how far ahead they are and what how forward thinking they are actually some of the materials that they use are 100 recycled some of them and it's really interesting if you are interested in green software green hardware there's so many articles to read on about that and how it affects not only today but our future i kind of get geeky about this because i worked with someone a few years ago who's a software developer and she was all for green coding and i learned so much from her so anyways i'll actually link her blog post down below because there's a lot of interesting articles on not only green software and coding but also the hardware and environment side of that too all right i hope you enjoyed going through my current coding content creation just like all around workstation this is pretty much where i live i feel like 90 of the time wait one second here paul how much time do i spend in my office 25 percent of your time see i'm not lying a week at least yeah a lot of times also too if i'm filming these videos in the morning there's i paul has to endure listening to me talk yeah okay if he was just on the phone i'm like you gotta be quiet for these anyways i hope you enjoyed it i'm linking everything down below again if you have any questions leave for me in the comments as i always say to you i answer every single one of your questions feel free to test me on that leave questions down below and if you haven't
