from the minute you wake up the decisions 
you make really affect your entire day   deciding on how you really want to start your 
morning what time you are going to get up at   really will trickle down to affect your entire 
day this is something i have learned the hard   way today i want to share with you how i 
really set myself up for a productive day   and this is through a lot of trial and error as 
someone who i would say is pretty busy between   running my tiffin tech business to working 
full-time as a software developer to continuing to   learn about new technologies as you know i spend 
a lot of my free time learning about blockchain   development it can be kind of overwhelming to 
where to put your energy where to put your time   on top of that of course trying to have a personal 
life and hang out with my friends my dogs my   boyfriend it's a lot and honestly i don't think i 
could do it all if i didn't have really a routine   or process set up to ensure that my days are as 
productive as possible now don't get me wrong some   days are not productive at all and that's okay too 
it's all about balance and being kind to yourself   today i'm going to share with you some of my 
tips and tricks on how i ensure to have the   most productive day possible before we get into it 
though make sure to hit that subscribe button for   more tech and coding related content leave in the 
comments other video topics you want me to cover   and if you haven't already make sure to give 
this video a like okay let's dive into it   okay there's no secret in today's society a lot of 
us have a lot on the go and ensuring that we are   able to get different parts of our life completed 
or different things in our life completed on time   means that you have to have a productive day 
and i understand that i'm really not about the   hustle culture or work 24 7 culture so when i say 
productive what i really mean is efficient and   effective i want to when i think about the life 
that i want to lead i want to lead a life where i   can start work at eight or nine in the morning and 
be done by five or six and this includes you know   between my day job obviously that's eight hours a 
day and then trying to balance my tiffin tech job   our business as well now obviously because i have 
two very big things on my plate running a business   and then also to working for a business it can be 
a little tricky and i definitely don't use my work   hours for software development to do tiffin tech 
but what i do do is before work or after work i   very strategically make content ahead of time i 
also have a team of people who help me on tiffin   tech so they can continue working throughout the 
day while i'm doing my day job okay i wanted to   give you a little synopsis of where i'm currently 
at for balancing everything out to really show   you how i ensure my day can be as effective as 
possible as i mentioned in the intro the number   one tip i have is you need to start your morning 
off right your day will start the minute you   wake up and i think it really sets the tone for 
the day for myself once i wake up i always take   the dogs out even though paul's here to take them 
out as well it's something that i've asked him to   always say for me to do because i am not a morning 
person i hate getting up in the morning i'm not a   morning person but i'm also not a night person is 
there such thing as like a midday person because   that's that's where i fit in that's who i am but 
i need to be a morning person because i need to   get things done so by starting my day by taking 
the dogs out for a walk it really wakes me up   by getting outside seeing the sunshine and just 
starting my day off on that note when i come back   inside the next thing i typically do is go for 
a workout now if you are located in toronto you   will know that everything right now is shut down 
because of the virus so i'm typically currently   working from home or working out from home so what 
i will do is either a peloton ride or i will also   do a class a peloton class and just get in a body 
workout i try and work out between five to six   days a week and what i do and i know that sounds 
like a lot but my secret is i just keep it short   i do 20 minutes every day and that makes it feel 
more maintainable or that i can actually do it   even if i don't feel like working out i just 
think about how good i will feel afterwards and   just kind of it's such a huge thing for me to set 
the tone for my day next up i always love to have   a smoothie i really love having a protein smoothie 
in the morning because i feel like it's a good way   to no matter how my day goes with eating at least 
i have some nutrients first thing in the morning   my next big tip i have that i always follow 
is after i've done my morning workout and had   my morning smoothie the next thing i will do 
is check out what's on my schedule for today   how is my day structured i absolutely maybe 
this is just my type of personality i love   structuring out my days ahead of time because 
it makes me feel a sense of relief knowing that   i know what i need to get done as you know i'm 
a huge fan of time blocking also so i definitely   incorporate that and for organizing my day i 
always use sun sama i've been using them for quite   a while now and i absolutely love it because they 
organize my to-do list they organize my meetings   by day by day so i can kind of reflect on the past 
day and also to what is coming up for today i'm   going to pull them up on screen here so you can 
kind of get an idea of how i usually use it for   my workflow so as you can see on my screen here i 
have what do you want to work on today and this is   a great way to kind of reflect on okay what are 
my main priorities that i need to do today for   me one of my main priorities at work is i really 
need to finish a coding ticket so i'm going to put   finish coding feature ensure you finish the back end for the 
code feature and then i usually put in   what the future number is but in this case 
just for example i'm going to use 1-1-1   and then task description i am 
going to do oops one second here and then the second description for it i'm 
going to say i'm sure you finish testing before making sure i test the code before i do a pr 
for it okay let's go next so i really like this   part of it too because you can actually time 
block so as i mentioned i'm a huge time block   person so for finished coding feature this 
is going to take me about one hour of my day   and you can see underneath these are the two areas 
that i need to do so then at this point i can   add another task as well which is really nice so 
for example another thing that i will need to do   later today is go pick up some of the dog treats 
so i'm going to actually do that on my lunch   break so i'll say it will take about 30 minutes 
so go get dog food and i know this isn't a work   related task but i like to add in every single 
thing i need to do throughout the day otherwise   you don't take into account some of the small 
things you need to do and in turn they add up   as well and you never get anything done i've 
linked some sama down in the description so if   you are looking for ways to really increase your 
productivity and make the most out of your days   go check them out i've been using them for quite a 
while and i'm kind of obsessed with them so i was   really excited to share about it with you my next 
tip is to have a clean office space as i'm working   from home it can be very easy to allow myself to 
kind of get messy with my office and as i'm in the   office every day just kind of let things pile up 
and trust me they do at times but i find taking   i usually do it on sundays a few minutes every 
week to just really tidy up my office and ensure   it is clean and organized really will set the 
tone for the week and the day to ensure i can   have a really productive day i think if you are in 
a clean space your mind is less cluttered as well   i don't know if that's already a saying but if 
it is if it is not a saying let's make it one   it's a good one so for me i'll take a few minutes 
and ensure that the office is ready to go it's   clean and tidy because then i just feel like i can 
totally focus on work for the day versus wandering   or getting upset with myself oh this is so messy 
or i need to clean this up after work but rather   just focus on the task at hand my number four tip 
to having the most productive and effective day   is get rid of your phone it's so hard to do trust 
me i have been there but if i actually put my   phone away i'll put it in a drawer it really helps 
me not be able to look at it to go on social media   or see if someone's calling or texting me so i 
will literally put it out of sight out of sight   out of mind and i'll also turn it on airplane 
mode for a while so no matter what no one can get   a hold of me which maybe isn't a good thing but 
it's a really great way so i find when i get into   a zone for coding especially or writing an email 
or anything work related i really need to be in   the zone and i can't just get midway interrupted 
it really takes me out of my flow so i will put my   phone away put it on airplane mode so i can fully 
focus at the task at the task on the task at hand   okay my last tip and one of my biggest tips to 
live by is using the pomodoro method and i'm sure   many of you have heard about this it's essentially 
where you work for a specific period of time and   then you give yourself a short break now usually 
people work in increments of 20 or 30 minutes   i do increments of up to an hour right now 
and then i'll take five minutes off to just   stretch my legs or go walk to the kitchen and get 
a coffee or tea and why i work in hour increments   is once again because of coding it can be once 
i'm in my zone i don't want to get out of my zone   and 20 minutes or 30 minutes is just not enough 
time now this does two things one it means that   i'm already in the mindset of i know in an hour's 
time i will get a break i'll get a reward but it   also does that for this specific hour i am kind of 
telling myself put my phone away no distractions   because after this hour i can do all of that 
for five minutes and it's a great way to really   reward yourself for working hard and focusing okay 
those are my main tips on how i stay productive   and really have an effective or efficient day i 
think the biggest thing though is none of these   tips are new and i'm sure you've all heard these 
tips before from various people in various degrees   but what the biggest takeaway of this is is you 
need to be consistent you need to do your same   kind of routine your same kind of pattern every 
single day to really start seeing it come into   action and work for you it's easy to say oh i'm 
going to work out in the morning or oh i'm going   to put my phone away those are easy to say but to 
actually do it that's a whole other ball game to   actually put what you are saying into action it's 
tough and it's a whole other thing and for that   it comes the piece the missing piece we 
haven't spoke of yet which is discipline   it's not motivation it's not hustle it's not 
work as hard as possible it's discipline it's   recognizing that these eight hours or nine hours 
that i'm working i'm going to be as efficient   as possible so once it's done i can completely 
enjoy my night and for me discipline comes from   many different areas but one of the biggest things 
for me is thinking about my future self so for   example when i am doing some work or solving some 
coding problems at work i'll think okay i really   want to work as hard as possible today or be as 
focused as possible today because i don't want   my future tiff like tomorrow tip to have to worry 
about this and if i get this done today tomorrow i   will feel so good and so relieved that i actually 
did it versus if you push it off and just continue   to push it off then the next day you wake up and 
you feel like crap because you know you need to   get it done and you didn't get it done and then 
the work just piles up so that's my biggest tip   is think about your future self and how you can 
help that person out okay i hope you enjoyed all   of these tips and they will help you have the 
most productive and efficient days possible   also make sure to check out some sama who i
