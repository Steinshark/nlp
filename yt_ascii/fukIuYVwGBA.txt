of malware or something all right what happens when we plug our pet rock in absolutely nothing absolutely nothing happens god ah you know what this can wait i'm going to enjoy myself a toilet don't like that glad to report does not taste like why does this thing look so stupid i'm going to take a guess and say this was not cheap ken did you or did you not spend over $120 on this it was $100 so a

please subscribe to the channel and ringling the dingling button because quite literally we're going to go out of business if you don't watch our videos from now on subscribe please please hey wait that's my item wait this is my item you you taking it from mystery tech typical in non mystery tech fashion i know exactly what is inside this box because gigabyte recently emailed me and like hey we got this new monitor we want you to check out so i'm like you know what well yes i would like to check it out i'm just i feel like i should help you cuz you're going to drop that thanks [music] matt oh oh and you still dropped it you know what gigabyte said hey we'll send you your our super cool new monitor i don't think this is what they had in mind you literally dropped it so let me attempt to show you how this monitor is intended to be used so i will turn it on and theoretically i will be able to switch not only my inputs between something like an ipad and something like a windows laptop but i will also be able to move move my mouse and keyboard along with it so if you have multiple devices plugged into the setup everything will be able to be used without having to plug and unplug things oh my god you did not i told you you dropped it did not oh you i would like to formally apologize to gigabyte oh no i didn't think i dropped it that hard i thought it was fun dr from like two you did drop it pretty i couldn't see i was blind that's why i told you to stop it was elmo's fault it was elmo's fault also while a lot of your answers were correct for what the global sensation is for this year and last year yeah you missed one what's that have you ever played the game among us i've actually never played among us how i told you you are literally the only person on this planet has not played among us is this an among us like cosplay or something okay this looks like something from black mirror get up there butd oh oh look at that oh smooth wait no no no no oh okay that was

greetings friends you know 2021 not so bad greetings can i order an earth drink please i can't no you're supposed to keep 6 ft of distance from people i feel like people are keeping like 20 ft of distance from me right [music] now this is very warm this probably should have been [music] iced ow ow what are you doing wouldn't have killed you to give me a straw no you look ridiculous it's really g isn't it it's time for an intervention why what did i do whoa whoa whoa you want to try to get this video like removed this bikini man i'm not i'm not doing that no no no no it well what what are you doing well this is the best one we could find oh no no no it's time are you really wanting me to shave right now yes with a bikini trimmer yes no but like real talk we all want this is this how i have to find out paybacks a b every single comment i've read is incredibly positive about the mustache i challenge you to find a single person who does not like this facial hair he also doesn't read the comments every comment every comment is positive every video everyone's like oh austin you look so attractive with your mustache oh austin you're so cool oh austin i wish i could be like you cuz you have a mustache they all in the playground it's so much worse you're wearing moono hey kids am i done yep you're done [music] there we're good right no you got something on your li boy really y am i really doing this [music] [applause] [music] mhm you guys suck all right that's a w go ahead take a photo of my shame it's fine all right we're going to keep you like the w for the video no i'm i got to finish it now no no no you're good no you're good i look ridiculous i have half of a mustach this is worse than having a whole mustache what she just broke the table ken did you really just get a giant shark a fusion of technology and personality oh it's not a shark it's a roboraptor we've done some weird stuff on mystery tech this is up there after 20 minutes of unboxing let's actually see what this thing does batteries not [music] included okay bad dinosur no [applause] stop it's like it's fighting even more the more to put it on [music] wait no don't no stop little buddy come on this is not the way to end things what is the aqua true it is a gigantic water purifier okay what's the gimmick that is insane dude why is that thing water give it a shot here what you're supposed to do is you're supposed to i'm annoy watching this video i'm not going pre-carbon what kind of filter how much was this filter ken $450 it better turn coke into water for $450 this thing is massive dude you know we are going to completely ruin this thing right if you're just filtering tap water this seems maybe a touch excessive but if you're trying to filter coke through it let's give it a try now it does say we're supposed to run four tanks of water before first use so we have run a couple of tanks of fresh water to get the filters up and running so now let's just pour some coke in and ruin this very expensive water filtration machine wait hang on let me let me taste test first to make sure yeah it's real coke all right let's do it a wait we're going to me a lot of coke for this thing i just realized how big this thing is you should have got 2 l yeah 2 l would have been a better idea okay so we have six cans of coke inside the water filtration machine so let's see what happens if we try to filter it i don't think this is going to go well do you think it'll actually work like real talk around the room is it going to work so i think it's going to work i just don't think it's going to give you crystal clear water i think it's going to taste essence of coke okay let's find out coke flavored lacroy yes is someone whispered the word coke into a glass of water dude there's water coming out although to be fair there's already water in the filter so that's probably like initially but if we start to see you know a significant amount of this coke come across we know it's going to work i'll really believe it halfway through how much water do you think could be in one of those filters or i guess technically all three filters probably have some water in them there's filters are not that big though there's no way the filters can handle that much coke no way it doesn't look like it's pulling very fast from this like i'm seeing like bop blop bop blop feel like this might take a while do you think it's just broken do you think we just broke it i feel like it's been at the same level for a while i've been staring at it for so long okay so you want me to try that sure okay let's try some of our supposed coke water wait it actually kind of actually kind of smells like coke oh oh oh oh that doesn't actually tastes like coke that tastes like like minerals or like filter or something i don't think this is actually going to work let's let this run overnight i'm really curious to see oh what ew that this is it after sitting here for over 12 hours the coke has lost all of its carbonation and the filtered water is just i don't know how much you can see but that is not clear at all oh oh that's kind of sad oh no wait wait wait wait wait wait no no no it did a little work wow wait a minute no that did a lot of work that's way more than what cuz this remember this was empty yeah but now we have cokey water it's definitely not smell it smell it this definitely is lroy flavored coke but flat oh oh no k give me the taste test the cup's not entirely clean but it's okay the water is neither it's it tastes like like months old coke okay what is this ah damn it passed off austin why would you do this to me it's electric oh my god do you want to know what the power consumption of this thing is 20 ws 50 watts wa you could charge your macbook off that that's cool 50 watts to my nipples man i don't know who's saying put them on your nipples yeah you're just adding that well where else you going to put them pikachu you [laughter] thunderbolt take it off boy are you happy matt no not since about 1998 this is a dead dead ass meme but i'm so happy i get to do it i like you cut g so wait we're doing the abs wait yeah it specifically says abs but i see but since you wanted to no no wait could we test this before i put it on no no oh okay okay okay okay okay okay yep yep okay that is the lowest possible wa wait wait leave it there for a second let me talk okay so okay baby let's stop let's heart attack oh god wait wait wait wait okay maybe we should stop it now i haven't heard a safe austin what level am i on right now matt yeah 50% all right all i'm good i'm good st oh god today was a good day i'd like to welcome a very special guest for the segment of mystery tech the man the myth the board legend king would you like to come onto the set please hey guys oh you said the thing you said the thing i stole that intro from him i finally admit it now i stole it from him this is just a little gift welcome to mystery tech my friend would you like to open it up and and experience i wonder what it could be oh wait does it say on the side wow a red dino no no no no no not just the dinosaur could you read what it's called the charizard dinosaur that's a lawsuit it doesn't look like charizard in any way they just called it the charizard dinosaur i thought that was hilarious as you can see i left the receipt in here you going read this $42.6 cuz i knew i was going to forget how much over priced apparently you they overcharged you cuz the price tag on is $38 it's probably tax but on mystery tech we have a mascot and his name is robo t raptor would you like to have a cage match with roboraptor versus charizard would you like to experience the real mystery tech lifestyle oh look at that see everyone we can't wash him now see he's all excited he's excited to see you all right here you go a very sharp knife i know that i don't need that all right you know what live your best life man would you like me to show you how to actually unbox something

again get him get him hit him get him yes go go go go go get him get him get him get him get him go i'm just curious what do you do when a piece of tech is thoroughly disappointing what should robo raptor do to the the vanquished enemy h wait wait wait wait wait wait i have a better idea careful carefully pick up this cube oh wow it's actually 3 2 1 get the slow already oh i forgot about this so
