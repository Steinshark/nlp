safe moon responded and they want to sue well at least their holders do i'm going to sue coffeezilla for defaming safe moon without any factual evidence and hurting the thousands of investors time to sue coffeezilla for defamation of safe moon wow clearly i struck a nerf i really angered people like mr b here who describes himself as easy going and open-minded now this open-minded man after my video said he wanted to sue me 20 different times and that's what i knew i screwed up i kicked the beehive not only that the ceo john carrone finally came out to defend his company from all these serious allegations and posted this in response [music] oh wait sorry that's not it the actual response was this i continue to make the conscious choice to not take the bait of halting work to address the reams of false information being posted so he basically dodged the allegations like he's neo in the matrix and now just so we're clear he he did post that meme of the guy pounding his chest from wolf of wall street it just wasn't in response to me although it could have been because that whole scene is basically about stealing money from investors which is what i accused him of name of the game move the money from your client's pocket into your pocket but despite john's dodge i still wanted to understand the safe moon army the good people who were down 90 on a bad investment how could they still be so positive about safe moon so i hosted a couple of spaces for them to explain their position to me i wanted to know how you can still hold a coin that appears to be so obviously a fraud and i think that was kind of my mindset in many other people's mindsets there was bad actors on board and it seems like now there's kind of been an entire shift and they are trying to move forward with what is looking like a legitimate project what's truly the fraud here is it john caroni himself could you separate john caroni from safewood would it still truly be a fraud could it not be a fraud no no i completely agree like i'm 100 there with you on ben phillips and anybody that's proven i was but that's no i 100 agree on that yeah i 100 agree i was specifically i'm sorry i should have clarified talking on the last point about john's wallet because that's where the that's what everybody's last pillar of hope is in right now and there it is it seems like the common belief is that the old team was bad yes safe moon used to be a fraud but karoni saved it and all the evidence that i found about caroni taking money was just fud and at this point i realized maybe no amount of evidence would ever satisfy these people i mean what would i really do double down and look for even more evidence of john committing fraud let's start with what we know john caroni lived in a van or trailer before safe moon in other words he was not rich suddenly safe mode happens and corona is in charge of a multi-billion dollar market cap and there's a pool of money that is supposed to be locked up but isn't now in the last video i showed you how safe moon lp was being siphoned from bitmark for millions of dollars in profit for safe mode and some of those millions appeared to have ended up in a wallet caronie controlled called the gabe wallet this was the first known wallet of caronies and according to papa aka thomas smith that's a tana wallet tano is a company that john controlled and it has nearly four million dollars in it most of it from bitmart which as we know safe moon was making millions from misappropriating funds that should have been for the liquidity pool as promised so any proceeds of that should have gone back in the liquidity pool but never was okay i know we're catching up on a lot but the question is how are these funds being used if it's not for the lp there's two narratives you can believe either a this tano thing was mostly a cover story because jon owns tanos so it's just really his personal wallet or b tano has a fiduciary duty to safe moon and this wallet is being responsibly used it's just a development fund so how do we find out which is which our first clue comes on april 23rd 2022 i got an anonymous tip saying that caroni had used his so-called company wallet the gabe wallet to buy a shin called stonks on the recommendation of none other than ben phillips quote been tipped while the team was in the gambia john bought enough to make him a top whale and for those of you who don't remember by the way ben phillips is a known pump and dump artist who made 12 million dollars from safeman okay he then linked a photo of ben phillips in a group chat saying this guys one of my super powerful social media buddies is dropping a coin or has dropped sorry called stonks they are in with jeff bezos etc then he says easy money for the gang looking after the boys and links the twitter account now if we cross-reference this with caronie's gabe wallet it shows that he took bin's advice and bought in multiple times that same day for up to a hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of stonks tokens that immediately made him the fourth largest holder of stonks token trailed only by ben phillips now this blockchain evidence confirms our anonymous tip and it suggests that the gabe wallet is not merely a company wallet because what company recklessly gambles 150k on a meme coin on the recommendation of a pump and dumper like ben phillips now just for the record after bin phillips and caroni bought in ben would notify his followers of this tip two days late he says okay i'm taking an absolute gamble on this new coin called stonks token let's go it's got meme coin energy with a plan this disaster not only showed that karoni was listening to ben phillips for tips but also that he seems to be willing to spend money from this so-called company wallet on random meme coins he also bought a bunch of other coins like beefy dot finance he spent a hundred fifty thousand dollars on and he also bought twelve thousand worth of phantom and this leads us to the conclusion that a the four million dollars in that wallet is john's personal money or b he's co-mingling personal and company funds which would be even more alarming but we actually have more than this our second piece of evidence that caronia's misappropriating funds comes from nfts because i've long suspected several wallets being caronies besides the gabe wallet but i struggled to prove it a hundred percent so i just never mention them until one day i'm scrolling through twitter and i see this post this guy says fonz any thoughts on what who the devil wallet by that they're pointing to a wallet that starts ox-666 there's four million dollars usdc sitting in it and a couple of nfts the reply comes from fonzie aka real fudd who says no idea the only thing i noticed was the moon dog nfts in the wallet which jack haynes and ben phillips were shilling a while back now honestly this took me off guard because this is a wallet i long suspected of being coronies but i didn't know that ben phillips had shield moon dogs before i didn't even know caroni had any moon dogs but from this last case we know caroni would listen to ben phillips so it made me look back through ben phillips archives is it true he was shilling moon dogs well it turns out yes on august 14 2021 ben phillips says this it's safe to say i'm obsessed with moon dogs nft view my collection here now moon dogs is not affiliated with safemen which makes this response under it strange john caroni 20 minutes later responding with his own nft saying i named him captain hoddle now this is perfect because we can trace this nft back to the buyer and sure enough on august 14th we find that this moon dog number 162 was bought by none other than the so-called devil wallet ox-666 and this means this is cronie's wallet because it was purchased the same day he tweets publicly about owning it and this is where it gets really interesting because this wallet after buying twenty thousand dollars worth of nfts you know what it has in it another four million dollars usdc and where did it get all that money well it started as 12 million dollars of tether coming in from places such as bitmart which gave them eight million dollars and then another four million came in from ox d51 also known as the infamous gabe wallet this wallet then exchanges that usdt for usdc but this is a double confirmation that this is caroni and the implications here are massive because not only is carony making millions and putting it into so-called company wallets which are buying a hundred fifty thousand dollars worth of meme coins he's also pumping millions from that account and from bitmart into what only can be described as personal wallets because once again what company wallet would buy twenty thousand dollars worth of nfts such as moon dogs but here's the deal it doesn't even stop there because two of caronie's quote moon dogs were transferred on february 15th to another one of carone's wallets giving us more evidence and how do we know that it's caronie's wallet and not a new buyer of this coveted moon dog well because it was a transfer not a cell and to add to the evidence look who it's getting funded from this wallet ox35a is getting half a million dollars from the gabe wallet and it gets 100k from the so-called devil wallet as we speak this wallet which i'm going to call the moon dog wallet has an estimated value of 1 million dollars on ether scan and another half a million on bsc scan we can actually calculate how much coroni controls here with a service called eight board dot finance which calculates wallet holdings across multiple chains and with the three wallets we know of we so far have a net worth across caronie's wallets of roughly nine million dollars but that's not even all because as i said earlier this so-called devil wallet got 12 million usdt there's only four million left what happened to the rest well a lot of it was eventually sent to a kraken deposit wallet which looks to be also controlled by you guessed it caroni because' million dollars came from wallets such as bitmart our devil wallet and the gabe wallet and one other wallet which we don't even recognize and the point here is not that we have all the answers by any means questions certainly remain like for example what is that' million dollars being used for if caronie's using these wallets personally what are the implications is it reasonable for a ceo to go from a trailer to being paid nine million dollars in one year while investors are down 90 especially when that money appears to be coming from the lp so i want to be clear i'm the first to admit we need more answers like why caroni is cashing out a million dollars at this coinbase wallet or why he's cashing out another million dollars at this coinbase wallet or yet another kraken wallet another million dollars but even with the questions remaining don't forget about the facts we do have like these three accounts which hold over nine million dollars all of them linked to caroni and many of the transactions appearing to be very personal in nature buying meme coins buying nfts bragging about those nfts listening to what ben phillips says of all people it all paints a very dark picture that caroni is not the savior of safe moon like many believed but rather perhaps is just another hustler that's basically it for this investigation pump the stock and thanks for watching
