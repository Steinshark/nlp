so you want to break into the tech industry but you're having a hard time because you don't have any professional development experience you heard about open source but you don't really know where to start today i've got some really exciting news javid and i created this application called leap party which i'm going to show you a little bit about it's basically an application it's a chrome extension that you can use to compete against your friends on leak code you make a room select a problem a bunch of your friends join and you guys compete to discover who can come up with the best leap code solution and that includes like correctness and runtime and all of that kind of stuff it's a really cool app that javin who's at uber and i created all by ourselves but we've been so busy lately we've been thinking we haven't had time to dedicate to make this app even better so we decided finally that we're going to open source the project i'm so excited about this because i've been telling people for a long time that they're going to be able to write code for this really soon really soon but it hasn't been open source so i finally just open sourced the project i really want you guys to help make some features for it so go to the description there's going to be a link to the github and there's going to be descriptions in the readme on how to set it up i'm also going to make a video here on how to get your development your local development server set up and i cannot wait to see what you guys make now why do you want to work on this application as opposed to other applications i'm going to tell you about some of the technologies you're going to use so on the back end our database is a postgresql db we're running node.js with express of course and on the front end plain old javascript and jquery so it's actually quite difficult to use a framework with the chrome extension so we decided not to use any framework it's actually just bare bones javascript all of the components we wrote ourselves and how do these two things talk well it's not over regular http connection calls it's actually over socket i o so we're using websockets which is a way that we can pass data from the server and the client on the same connection if you don't understand what that means don't worry i can explain it in the setup video but yeah there's a lot of really cool technologies here we're deploying it with aws and for anyone that adds features to it and wants to see them deployed in real time i'd be happy to jump on a call because i'm going to be in charge of the deployment process i really really want to see this thing get big right now you can only do one game in one room so once you create a room you can play one game and once that game is over you have to create a new room the next thing we want to do the very next project we want to work on is making sure you can retain one room across multiple games so you and your friends can play not just once but twice three times four times as long as you guys want to play then we want to get into the space where you're not necessarily competing against your friends you can compete against anyone we want to add video and audio so you can talk and see the people you're competing against we want to go so many places with this application but we are so busy we can't do it all ourselves we need your help now i'd be happy to answer any questions you guys have about how to get it set up if you have questions about how to implement things i'd also be open to offering you suggestions and you can create a pr and i will gladly review it and you can get your code running for 200 people please go ahead find that link get set up and i cannot wait to see your pull requests thank you guys so much for watching this episode of tech in turn
