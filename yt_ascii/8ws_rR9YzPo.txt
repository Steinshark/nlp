ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the women's world chess championship match in 2023 being not only contested but also played in china both players hail from china jew and june the incumbent lei ting jie the challenger and latexia actually leads the match three to two after five games in this recap i'm going to show you game six seven eight and nine as she looks to become the future of women's chess and a perennial 26 hopefully 2700 rated contender as well also friendly reminder in yesterday's video i already showed you but this is the first ever printed copy of my book i'm so excited about this and did you know this book is available for purchase and pre-order not just in english but also in spanish there is a link in the description and it's coming out in german and it's coming out in check and it's coming out in a few other languages a lot of you reached out trying to translate the book i really appreciate it but i don't think you realize that you don't actually translate the book a foreign publisher buys the book they do the so i really appreciate it but i need a foreign publisher so italians french speaking audience arabic chinese hindi hopefully they all reach out and they buy the book and they translate it i don't a lot of you reached out you're all talented very interesting and the smart people but that's i'm looking for a foreign publisher anyway game number six jew and june trails the incumbent is trailing in the match the champion is trailing in the match as late has struck and juan jun goes back to the yield trusty pawn to d4 and right away right away takes the pawn that's rare just taking on d5 is very very rare it's less rare to take on d5 from this side of things this is just the karo khan defense taking you know you put some pressure but it's very rare to take without actually making a night move first so she does this in this fashion late engine captures with the pawn knight to c3 and now black plays c5 so it's very clear that later is trying to play kind of a reverse karo khan panoff or like a tarash defense is what this is right this is known as the tarash defense and the idea is if pawn takes black will go d4 so normally this transposition is seen like this this is how this happens so black plays c5 cd ed we have the exact same position as in the game but a slightly different move was played technically black is playing a karo khan just black is playing white but black is a tempo down so it's like e4 c6 d4 d5 take take here here and then white gets an extra move right so knight f3 knight c6 dc5 and now before you take you play d4 knight a4 and later just takes this pawn the knight guards the pawn she takes it this according to her time usage and queen a5 check is coming of course she gets the night back this is a this is a really like playing this is playing with fire because you're giving white to two bishops so according to most schools of thought white has a pretty good advantage here and she plays e3 and she's gonna finish her development she's gonna play rokier she's gonna play b4 she's gonna get her queen out hit the center this is what happens in the game though later captures and plays queen before check that's a fork so white has to go here and black just says okay we have no queens now clearly from the time usage spent by both players they're both happy with this position they get a position where cd and e pawns don't exist which is very interesting and very rare white is going to go here and just try to have a long-term advantage and black is going to try to defend so knight e7 bishop c4 natural developing move white black castles white castles long though white doesn't castle short spent a few minutes she castles long which according to the computer is the best move and the best way to put pressure on black's position opposite side castling put the bishops on very active diagonals put the rook out life is good hide the king in the corner or play b3 king b2 so the king is off the c file and this is going to be a game played with the the pieces mostly there's going to be a little bit of pawn play but the pawns are sort of irrelevant a6 played and i know you're saying well they just made pawn moves levy you idiot yeah but again i told you the king is going to b2 to stand on a dark square for two reasons off the center line and off off the light squares so bishop f5 and yeah you kick out the bishop and latentia is actually playing extremely quickly you'll notice that actually both of them are playing extremely quickly maximizing their peace efficiency the rooks are going to the d and c files and that's exactly what happens white's rooks are going to the d and e files because why it's trying to play on the e file while black is trying to play over here and visually speaking the position is still very pleasant so now we have bishop g5 and you will notice that over the last two moves jew and june spends over 40 minutes of clock time so she played all her prep but so did black late india has been the dominant player of the first six games this is the sixth game her opening has been really good really good she's spending almost no time in the opening bishop g5 looked down to 50 minutes black is finally thinking on her own but she has absolutely no problems you know rookie one was a natural move bishop g5 wasn't i mean white can choose from putting the rook back putting h3 knight to h4 she does this which is very forcing trying to induce this and she goes for a rook trade and the rook just comes and the bishop just comes back i am not sure inducing the move f6 was a positive for black for white i'm not sure it was a positive you know i'm i just i don't know maybe you want to go here maybe you want to go here put a rook in the c file maybe you want to play for a4 let's see bishop d3 and now the king comes so late ting jay is just blocking everything that white wants g6 just rock solid position there is absolutely nothing white can do bishop to e4 the bishop goes into b6 the rook just moves she's not gonna hang a rook rook takes e4 rook takes d1 just keeping pace absolutely nothing she takes and it's it's just a completely equal position a4 a b g5 is coming and it's actually black who might be taking over the initiative but that never happens we have a night end game and this might be a bit boring to you but this is actually a big message sent by late india she is not to be messed with she plays an absolutely perfect game of chess like the game review for this game is probably literally 99 for both of them she just comes 99.1 99.3 was the game review of this game a literal perfect game of chess by both players they they played a perfect game of chess the one of the most perfect games of chess probably ever played in the world shows championship match and what it showed is that right now jew and june does not have a strong answer for the terrace defense which is huge so we go to game number seven latings yet maintains a one-game lead and zhu and june pulls out the karo khan defense in a world chess championship match you'll love to see it white plays knight to d2 the classical variation and now bishop f5 which is the real classical not the tartic hour h4 h6 knight f3 and historically many players have been playing knight d7 here i've played it my whole life to stop knight e5 but recently the edge lords of the chess world have discovered that you can actually allow the knight to go to e5 and hit this bishop that's actually it looks really unpleasant and it looks like it forces you backwards but there's actually no easy way that black can capitalize white can capitalize on that and you're just gonna trade the knight anyway so you can still play this move you're inducing this to send the game in a different direction bishop d3 now this knight d7 and now this move queen e2 so setting up for very nasty intentions on the king bishop have four possibilities long castle or short castle whichever your heart desires black plays knight f6 you will notice she spent 17 minutes on that move that means that she was not ready for queen to e2 she had to remember her notes again which happens so knight f6 and now castles the second that the queen takes its eye off this pawn white doesn't actually go long which is which is a which is rare i mean i gotta tell you this looks really really really natural but she plays short castle and rook d1 and she's still at 132 and my friends for the seventh time in this match late is not thinking in the opening she's just not thinking i'm not saying she's doing anything badly her opponent is forced to think on her own and she is once again down over 30 minutes on the clock this is utter insanity i don't think later has been out prepared in any game she has shown up and she has come to fight now queen a5 is one of the approaches in this position queen c7 and queen b6 are both more prudent against queen a5 there is a very sharp variation knight takes d7 knight takes d7 and now pawn to d5 just trying to again justify the queen's position you can't take right a while ago white played queen e2 to have nasty intentions so you would think that this is the follow-up there is one ridiculous line here which is rookie 8 takes and knight f6 and essentially black is saying that i'm down upon but i have i'm gonna avalanche down this way and it does look pretty scary that's what the computer says there is a very very long line here modern day analysis shows like queen b6 or one of these two moves but latex doesn't play that she has to think on her own for the first time and she plays a good move but she doesn't play the best move and i really just wonder what was what what what she had in mind here and what she didn't like because this looks really natural and this looks very powerful i mean the bishop like all this looks obviously she didn't like something i don't think it was that line in particular but who knows maybe it was exactly that line in particular so bishop to f4 rook to d3 and take take knight h7 we have a trade and lighting yeah that's lost her age pawn not only that she has also lost her entire time advantage so clearly something in the opening went astray she was trying to load up the cannon she thought for some time and played rook d3 but it's the karo khan okay it's not just going to sit there and get steamrolled and even though black has to play this relatively ugly knight h7 if you go up the knight gets back into the game at any moment and if you play queen chief like if you take and play queen g4 trying to check my black it's just not gonna work rook to d4 knight h5 does threaten the checkmate but i just go knight g3 and i'll keep going got four knight h5 move my king take the bishop i mean this is really bad so she goes for an attack she she gets all up in there but black's just to pawn up and she has to she she she's attacking but she's getting booted out of the position she comes back she has an incredible night make no mistake this is a god night if black tries to get rid of this knight it is over i can take with this or this i don't even know which one is better probably this one but this looks awful for black you're just gonna get very slowly or steamrolled well my bishop man's the the dark squares okay b6 she's a b4 that night's not going anywhere she has a sensational bind she brings another pawn i mean late india plays chess in this ridiculous steamroller fashion she's just utilizing everybody she hasn't moved her a pawn but that's fine and she keeps playing for the attack black infiltrates the knight comes back the queen slides over rook b2 the bishop is blocking but a couple moves later she sacrifices a second pawn and she just plays at five she's a full steam ahead just attacking two minutes on the clock doesn't give a damn just advancing forward in the position pawn takes pawn takes and now here there is no need to take jew and june should play knight g5 take take you could keep trying to rip it open bishop h4 pawn takes f7 you can't take with the queen because i'm gonna take back king f8 so jew and june is on the verge of of winning the first game her first game of the world chess championship she goes here and and brings the queen back which is a very very natural move but believe it or not going into the end game up a pawn is wrong in this position it was actually better for her to just stubbornly rotate the knight back into the position allow all this pressure and continue to attack a little bit later try to trade the rooks try to keep a little bit of imbalance on the board but when you try to trade one of your very powerful attacking pieces now the momentum is back with white and even though she's she's not there on one pawn she's down two pawns she is down an a and h pawn which are the worst pawns to be done in an end game especially at the same time because they're so damn far apart how are you gonna defend how are you gonna cover your house in new york and your house in la you know at least if there's a house in l.a and somewhere in california it's a little bit easier but a h opposite sides of the board very difficult to defend all of this so bishop h4 king f1 and one of the pawns gonna have to go she plays a5 but now we're k7 i'm chasing you down rook b5 knight d3 holding both pawns you see you see how white just controls both the pawns rook a6 how do you grab the pawns you can't one pawn down the pawn is sneaking into a4 but i stop it and i got news for you i got my own pawn and all of a sudden before it's all said and done one pawn down two verse one is a draw rook at night versus rook is a draw but we don't even have to go that far because knight f4 i'm gonna win one of the pawns back for sure black is just too passive here there's just nothing to do there it is knight f7 check and late india survives it was very very dangerous for her for a moment in this game and she went all in she went f4 she went g4 rook f1 she tried to absolutely eviscerate you in june with this with this double pawn sacrifice she was just cleanly down six pawns to four but because she had enough of a headache to cause and black did not play knight f8 did not bring the knight back into the game instead opting for a queen trade i think she just didn't realize that even though she's up two pawns she's in trouble here like white is very active so after seven games maintains a one-game lead and she has been strong in the opening so you know what happens in game number eight jew and june plays e3 benji hi i don't think they can see you but you're aggressively licking yourself and it's very loud so can you please stop thank you very much you're adorable c5 b3 when it when in doubt and the openings with white are not going your way knight f3 e3 b3 boom boom boom boom joo and june is trying to play offbeat will she mess up will lighting gear take a commanding two-game lead in a best of 12 match knight c6 bishop b2 june june plays g3 that's wild stuff a double fianchetto this is what we call i'm out of i i'm not happy with how it's gone it's not that i'm out of ideas i'm just unhappy queen c7 look at that later just spent five minutes in the opening that hasn't happened the whole match she now needs to play on her own she's trying to play e5 d4 pawn takes pawn takes the bishop pins the knight the players are on their own look at white she took' minutes to play the move t4 because she was probably calculating bishop g2 e5 she was probably calculating c4 and all these lines so she plays d4 and the players are on their own in a brand new position no prep this is what they have to do e6 knight f6 knight d2 she plays c4 she plays a3 she has done everything that she needs to do in the opening stage of this game black plays a5 a5 is a good move preventing b4 and all of this expansion it's a big commitment though i mean maybe black could have went for b5 maybe black could have went for a knight e4 bringing a rook to the center b5 a little dangerous c5 maybe but a5 kick out the bishop and now white is going to try to put a rooks over here this is exactly what you want in a closed game you want a close maneuvering position many pieces on the board rook d1 and black takes now a very difficult decision for white you take with the pawn leaving yourself in isolated pawn but teaming up here do you take with the knight to pressure the bishop do you take with the queen to try to lead the queen side charge i don't know she takes with a pun took her eight minutes to decide bishop slides back queen slides forward out of the way of the pin what's next rook c8 rookie one everyone's trying to make progress now the queen rotates over there was a tactic here with d5 potentially and after edie you could have taken the knight and then if bishop takes you could have taken this and then if rook d5 you actually have mate you sacked the queen for a mate the board opens up you sack the queen for mate black would have probably taken but in this position probably can take with a pawn but it was still there it was a big chance cd rook d5 double pawns kind of an ugly structure also rook c6 and queen e7 as possible i mean it's yeah there was a lot of like tactical opportunity but queen b3 c5 she does it this way jew and june is a very positional and practical player she plays queen b3 she advances to win control of the light squares and then she's gonna win control of the dark squares knight c4 and now latex sacrifices a pawn to play b5 forking inducing this move getting another game where she is down upon she is down upon all the time all the time she hates pawns bishop 2a1 queen a5 and this a trade and yet again jew and june is sending us to an end game she is comfortable in the end game she is happy in the end game d5 board is opening up knight b3 we take on e6 take on e6 bishop e5 bishop a3 and now knight d4 and the following end game knight d4 rook a3 three pawns each knight goes back to c6 and jew and june here does something massive she takes the knight that is a massive decision because she's taking the knight with the intention of winning the pawn on g7 which she will win but opposite colored bishop end games are a death sentence to a draw so all her winning chances are gone the second she takes this night according to traditional chess knowledge rook c3 doesn't work by the way because black can play bishop a4 or 97 defending the rook so she could go here and just try to apply pressure but she does this she gives a check the king comes up she gives a check and she wins the pawn and she is claiming she's gonna try to win this end game three on two opposite colored bishops if the rooks are gone this is a dead draw dead with a capital d both d's are capital but there is a chance the chance rests in the fact that the bishop is better than this bishop the rook is better than this rook the king has absolutely no forward mobility and the pawns are split black has four negative criteria out of four the bishop is worse the rook is worse the king is worse the pawns are worse literally everything about this position's worse but the only way to win this with white is to win one of these pawns or advance these pawns in some way and make a queen because rook and bishop versus rook is a draw so you could win their bishop it's probably still a draw rook c5 bishop f6 bishop b4 king h2 here comes the king rookie 7 dancing on the back rank h4 and in this position sensing that all of this was about to happen that she was just going to get slowly overwhelmed and white was going to try to win this game in the following way g6 let's say f3 first to deflect the bishop let's say the bishop stays on f5 g6 pawn takes and h7 like this this is the way that white is going to win by keeping a pawn on the board so late things yet sacrifices per e6 pawn to do this and this and this and this and this is she insane gives up one of her remaining two pawns in the end game what is she doing was she nuts she's two pawns left but this is brilliant because she forces white to put her pawns on dark squares opposite colored bishop end games are often a draw because of the wrong color complex now white cannot easily walk in on the light squares check back to f5 should she have played bishop g4 no because she would hang her pawn so white is still trying and now white does this this is probably a dream defensive setup for black rook d3 rook h3 rook t3 f3 f4 but there's nothing here rookie seven right well as it turns out this is the moment where black could have made her draw she fought this long and she could have made a draw by playing rook d2 king e3 rook d3 king e2 and then rook d4 this is a draw because after bishop takes king takes white cannot get through this blockade this is exactly what latexia worked for opposite color blockade there is no way to advance there's no way to advance i just go bishop g6 and bishop f5 for the rest of the game but she misses that and she goes here and allows white to make some progress she misses the key defensive idea and it's probably still equal but all of a sudden this jew and june sacrifices the rook and she has made it through it took her eight games but she gets her first win in the world chess championship and it's four to four with four games to go this is nuts game number nine pressure at an all-time high 4-4-4 games to go june june on the board she plays black and she goes for a sicilian you know what it means when you go for sicilian defense it means you're going for the kill she plays the most aggressive sicilian right now the four nights she senses weakness she senses weakness she plays a very sharp and complicated and convoluted system she's going for the throat she was down one she just won a really nice game she's now trying to completely bury the challenger a3 rook c8 a3 is a novelty by the way in this position according to the computer at like many castles games have been played in c4 a3 is a little bit of a novelty same idea though and now black plays knight e3 very flashy move hits the queen sacrifices the night for an exchange bishop e7 and this is the middle game that the players are playing lighting jay is very happy here she has very good pressure b4 queen b7 attacking possibilities when she wants them rotation f4 f5 jew and june's not afraid f6 just getting rid of that central blockade white plays queen g3 take take what are you doing about this move -leting j is going to be down another pawn isn't she no she gets this pawn back and there's a very nasty trap in this position and it actually occurs throughout it looks like at various moments rook c6 is possible in this particular case there is queen takes f8 we're going to see a different type of trap later rook f7 and bishop e5 the bishop gets taken rook f5 rook c5 and four like i don't know how many games in this match already lighting jazz down upon again she just hates pawns hate them and made a threatened now the good thing is after g3 black is just not doing anything here black's position is kind of like a younger sibling getting restricted like by you know a younger sibling that's trying to like punch you in the face and you're just like holding them you're like you can't get any closer black can't do anything with these pawns white is just way too active best case scenario probably for black is that this game ends in a draw the players advance their pawns for a little bit here trying to take a bit of space white takes a lot of space away from black but there's only so much you can do rook b5 queen f6 and now black has to lose a pawn black goes for activity white doesn't allow the activity and we go into a rook end game where only white can win because this pawn is extremely weak but the king arrives the rook arrives and white is trying to take the e-pawn for the a pawn like this still decent chances here for white if black doesn't know what they're doing but black is the reigning defending women's world champion ponto g6 check and that's it this is a very well-known drawn position because even though you can advance with your king rook is coming from the side and this is just the filler position a2 very well known draw and the players repeat moves a convincing hold for black here and again later was playing white so she had to strike she doesn't do it successfully after nine games the women's world championship matches tied four and a half four and a half nothing to choose between them it'll all come down to the last three games and june june has white twice and the last time that she had white she played a really imbalanced game and she won a super complicated middle game so super interesting to see what happens in the next three games and in the next three games we might have a new women's world champion in fact in the next two games if somebody wins twice but unlikely folks get the book get it would mean a lot to me i am offering signed copies but in a limited capacity the first time that we did them they sold out if you'd like to wait until the book is out to try to get a copy that's signed more than welcome but i will see you all for the next video get out of here
