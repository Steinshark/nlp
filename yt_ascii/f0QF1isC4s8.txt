hi everyone bit of a unique video for you today this was a really fun collaboration video i'm not going to do any explaining because we talk about it as we get into it so i hope you enjoyed the video let's go if you want to introduce yourself so sort of say who you are what you do and then a couple of projects you've worked on and stuff okay well i'm eric blakeney i'm a veteran hollywood screenwriter showrunner and director got my big start on a a very cool kind of pre-sopranos show called wiseguy after that i was the showrunner on 21 jump street that introduced johnny depp to the world i've also worked on you know script assignments like mad max fury road wrote and directed a feature called gun shy with liam neeson oliver platt and sandra bullock so this leads us to when i was directing my own film i still knew nothing about visual effects all i knew was liam neeson was constantly showing people pictures of this perfect beach house dream house that he wants to retire to first you'd see the photo i wanted to first see the photo and think you were in the environment and then see the thumbs come in and you're looking at a photo i don't think we ever came close to really achieving that the line producer was saying no well that can't be done you know that would cost 10 million more in the budget not i could only go by what i was being told so then that's where i come in so you sent me this dvd very kindly thank you very much so i watched the whole film it was fantastic i really really enjoyed it and so what i've done is i've taken some screen recordings and if i try and share my screen with you now this shot so this is the the one with the thumbs that we mentioned so i didn't really say this because i thought it'd be fun to tell you on the call but i've actually done the shots i know originally we just talked about just doing it you know just like discussing it but i thought it'd be really fun for the youtube video to show it visually i will i will caveat that to work on these i had to screen record a standard definition dvd on a macbook pro so this isn't like really high-end obviously the footage i had to work on was pretty rough once it came out the screen recording but i think it looks pretty cool so i'm gonna open nuke and then we can sort of go through what i've done i think my seagull friend just flew in behind me it's funny you should mention a seagull because i put one in this shot so this is the original shot like we just saw what i did is like you mentioned i did a couple of things like i isolated some of the trees just with a bit of keying and roto so i sort of cut out some of the leaves and then did some warping on them to make them actually blow in the breeze so it kind of just looks like this just a little bit it's just a little bit of movement it's pretty subtle but it just gives you that sense that you know it's not still and that was just a case of kind of painting off the tops of them and then putting them back on later which is pretty simple so i did it to this one and this one here and then i also like you mentioned i made the water ripple a little bit here so if i play this you might be able to see it's not perfect movement but i just i just made a little bit of distortion so that the waves feel like they're kind of you know on the move and then i also just for the fun of it i put a seagull flying through because what are they like for matte paintings and visual effects they're like matte painting 101 on the first day and someone always says if you want to make a map painting feel more alive put a bird in the shot and it always take you know takes it away from feeling like a stiller there's something sort of flying across the frame so i've got a seagull here that i made in blender this is just a cgi seagull i've actually got it here i just kind of made this really rudimentary cg bird and just rendered sort of 30 frames and made it loop and then just transformed it across the screen in nuke so this is that flying through and then obviously when the thumb comes in it kind of freezes exactly like you described and i think that kind of helps it just you know it gives it a bit more of an organic feel this stuff moving brings some life to it so yeah what do you think that's kind of what i've done to this one it's fantastic i'm curious if you know what what you did how available was it in you know not late 90s you know we released the film in 2000s it's pretty simple stuff so the it's all 2d well it could have been done in 2d the only cgi shot or the cgi element was the bird but you could have very easily done this with you know like a plate of a bird that had been filmed and you could just key it so yeah this could have all been done very easily and for reference this probably took me 45 minutes this morning so simple stuff very simple stuff it's been awesome i'm glad you like it and then the second one this was a little bit more challenging but i think this also turned out pretty cool so this is the one you were saying you wanted it to feel like a photo and then they actually walk into the shot right so if i just played this through originally was this actually a visual effect shot in the film or did this end up just being in camera and they just put that backdrop there yeah so we had we built that that set where we're on we're in a big warehouse right where we which we converted into our sound stage so up on top of the turrets is where you see the crowd that's a green a blue screen right and what we did was somebody went to an actual home show and shot a perspective that we had to create of of of the live animated you know the actual home show and in the background so this is obviously again because i was working on the dvd footage it's not like the world's greatest composite but essentially what i did is i took the element of them walking into the show home and i completely isolated it so all we have is this and then i basically rebuilt the entire background from a the the still of liam holding the photo and then also i did a i grabbed a couple of like elements of some sky and sort of painted it up to be like an ascetic engine essentially so we've got a little bit of the original so that i kind of used like the beach and then part of the home and then i extended the sky upwards and did a little bit of painting and sort of removed the palm trees and stuff this is pretty rough because i just did it in like half an hour this morning and then i put some palm trees in these are some cg palm trees which i made and then you see the show home yeah at the end so yeah that's what i did essentially so i took that whole element to the background with the trees and everything and i tracked it into the original shot and put it so it kind of moves with it now like this and then what i did is put this element back on top and then as you can see this is the this is the end result and then obviously at the end you have the sky cuts off and you see the background like it was in the original film very cool very cool now now so blender didn't exist 20 years ago what do you think you would have done 20 years ago what if would you have been able to do something as cool as this and it would have just taken you longer well actually the only thing i did in blender was the trees and again if you wanted to put some trees in i'm sure you could find an element of them on a you know shot on a blue screen or something but all of all of the background of the photo and stuff was just done in nuke which is a 2d compositing software which i guess probably would have been flame or something at the time very similar so yeah this is again sort of really really sort of bread and butter visual effects stuff it's just a bit of tracking a bit of painting a bit of sort of combining a couple of plates this one took me a little bit longer maybe an hour or an hour and a half this morning yeah i just wanted to whip these up because i thought it would be nice to actually have some visual examples instead of basically doing a podcast and just sort of talking about it so yeah i hope you like what i've done i hope that it's kind of more in the direction of what you're after absolutely brilliant i want to call disney and ask if we can re redo it that's fantastic man i love it i'm glad i'm glad i think this is a nice a way of kind of showcasing basically what it would have done and then if you spend a bit more time on it take it that last 10 and it would look really really good essentially fantastic i'm thrilled that you like it i was a bit worried that it was i want to bring you back in a time machine and stick you in our editing bay yeah i think it's a real testament to the progression of technology as well that something that was too much for the production you know at the time of this film can now be done by you know a 22 year old in his bedroom on a saturday morning now i guess at the point would you like to do like a little kind of tagline of the whole project and sort of plug it as much as you as you like and you know share it with not that i have a massive audience but you know kind of get it out there sure the people's republic of movies is a virtual film studio we're trying to create a new film ecosystem that will give more people access to more tools and and assets so what we do is we've we're setting up alliances with not only other film organizations like film festivals and we're also doing it with with ethical organizations we're giving ownership of the project to the all the people who work on the film we were able to create which we're launching in a couple of weeks a new a new crowdfunding platform using these tools for filmmakers getting out to wider audiences who kind of believe what we're doing so we're we're you know you can go to thepromhq.com and you can see a little bit of you know a taste of everything we're up to look at that crowdfunding platform we've got some amazing consultants on this who are part of this to create you know a hybrid for filmmakers only so please check it out thanks for letting me spiel on it a little bit no problem that's fantastic i think it's such a cool project it sounds amazing well thank you very much for joining me for this call and everything obviously it was really fun to work on these shots thank you so much [music] [applause] [music] december [music]
