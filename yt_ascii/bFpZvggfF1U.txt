what were you talking about so we were basically just talking about you know what let me click record on this this thing too in case one of us loses our video or audio so we're kind of just talking about like the the value that each of our channels provides and i was saying that what i really like about your channel besides your magnificent hair is is basically like i can relate to it a lot having been someone that was like in waterloo that that felt like they were constantly at the bottom of the barrel you know i watch your videos and it's it's like you're basically saying all the things that i thought you're like hey man like we all have this like crazy imposter syndrome where we think that we're not like good enough to be where we are and especially it's such a massive thing for people at waterloo because they're already like cream of the crop that when they come to waterloo they expect that that will just stay the same and it doesn't so it's a really hard thing to digest for a lot of people which was like definitely happened to me yeah it was like i kind of did this weird thing where like i got my first test back and it wasn't what i expected it to be and i like i pretty quickly got used to i was like sweet i don't have to get 90s anymore like i'm already here in waterloo this is chill yeah but then i think when i really started feeling it the most is like during internships and stuff because as you know there's some crazy first-years that are signing like google for their first internship and i'm not getting any interviews and that's as hard like when you're comparing yourself to people that are like that all the time oh definitely man that's that's 100 true and i don't know what you're i saw a video that you posted the other day about like how you got into programming so it seems like you had some programming experience before you went to waterloo but for me i was like i had literally like well it's not literally zero but i had like practically zero so i basically like didn't even apply two programming positions on my first internship and i think it was a way of me like i wasn't confident i wasn't comfortable i thought if i was in a real office environment i would panic and i wouldn't even know where to start in terms of coding learning new languages and stuff so i didn't even bother applying to those jobs looking back i think that was definitely the wrong choice because when you go to an internship you're supposed to learn you're supposed to not really know what you're doing but for me i was like i saw those people that were doing well that had programming experience and i kind of just thought like why even bother yeah it's funny that you mentioned that i think i had the the opposite experience when i first applied to internships which was like i saw all these people applying to google so i was like yo if i apply to the company center like right below google i'll get in for sure man like i know how to code people are gonna look at my resume and think i'm sick and that didn't work out that was not a good strategy definitely definitely it's a it's funny like i always tell people we we kind of have this idea that like as humans our brains are kind of so limited that we have this a tendency to put ourselves on a one-dimensional scale and that would be like in terms of one number between one to ten so we do it with everything intelligence like attractiveness everything we we think of on a scale of one to ten so you think of yourself as like hey i'm probably first year i'm probably like an eight in terms of first years or i'm a nine and so if i apply to companies they will put me above the sevens the sixes the fives and so and and so on so forth so when you don't get that job you're like oh my god maybe i'm a four but the truth is there's so many variables that go into any single job the person that looks at it maybe the person that's reviewing resumes isn't even technical maybe they just like know a few keywords maybe it doesn't pass the ats system there's so many things that are at play what about the mood of the person that's that's like looking at their resumes maybe they're just in a bad mood and they'd like i don't know one one sentence on your resume rub them the wrong way there's so many variables that you can't put yourself on this one-dimensional scale and you do it really like it's detrimental to your mental health i think oh 100 and i think like there's a few companies out there that try to look at more than just like the standard like leak code what you've done stuff on the resume and i that's when i like i really appreciate it when they try to hire the person rather than the resume which is right it's kind of rare but it happens sometimes yeah i remember one of my internships my boss was doing like you know interviews for the next intern to replace me and he had a bunch of different applicants and some of them were like they had all 80s and one of them in particular had like failed a course and or maybe had only pulled off like a 55 in a course or something and he really excuse me he really liked her resume he just thought that she would be a fun person to work with he he kind of from her resume kind of inferred that she was kind of a fighter you know she was she was putting up a fight she was doing her best and she just didn't come out of that course with a win you know and that happens to all of us and so he really wanted to interview her but his boss was like hadn't looked at any of the resumes was really surface level and was kind of just like no you're not allowed look at that person like they don't have good enough grades so even if people do like you and do like your resume it's not always up to them that's true that's that's just another factor i guess that complicates getting hired definitely definitely let me see what we got here so i want to ask you about your story like because i know that you you know are still in school right now i believe you're you're doing an internship right now so can you kind of like fill me in of everything adam wong up until now yeah i can try my best like starting from like high school or like university wherever you think like the story begins oh okay yeah starting in like i guess grade school i kind of developed an interest in programming you can learn more about that on my channel but yeah it was like to start making minecraft mods originally but i didn't think that i would be doing that as a career and slowly i kind of discovered i didn't like memorization and that i preferred to think through problems which is kind of what coding is so i joined the robotics team i started writing competitions and eventually i got into waterloo it was like probably in grade 11 when i started trying to do that so i wasn't like someone that had targeted waterloo from the time they were in grade school which i know exists now which is absolutely nuts then once i was in university i like didn't really perform that well in my grades and i managed to get an internship through a connection that i had which was like nepotism but a job as a job and it was like it was it was a great experience it was a super small company i i'm like kind of i'm still very grateful for the opportunity that i had and like when i came around to my second round of applications in second year i did a little bit better because i was a little bit smarter about the jobs that i chose to apply to like first year i applied to like fang obviously got rejected and then went with like a connection second year i think i maybe undersold myself a bit and just applied to like everything where i met the requirements and right if you know about applying to internships the requirements are kind of [ __ ] like sometimes they'll be like you need three years of like phd experience to be able to apply to this junior job it doesn't make any sense and i was going alphabetically too so i ran out of jobs by the time i got to like the letter e or something yeah my grades still weren't really that good and in third year i think i started to get my act together a bit more focusing more on grades i started to realize that they were more important than i had thought not because of like recruiters necessarily looking at them but just because like in a symbolic way like if you're not committed to like you know doing well in one area you can't expect to do well in other areas where for sure and if i had just been getting those grades and not trying or and was trying difficult i can't speak if i had been getting those grades and was trying really hard then i think yeah that's when grades don't matter it's like if you could be doing better and deep down you know that you could be doing better but you're just not giving it like 80 90 100 then you can't expect to be doing well in like other areas then definitely yeah yeah i applied to shopify and i got pretty lucky i attached a clip of my band playing onto the header of like my cover letter and oh cool yeah someone liked it they thought like oh that's unique we'll give him an interview and once i got the interview like it was all kind of good from there you know what's funny i feel like you said you said two things there that are like massively conflicting you said that you got a job at sp shopify and you were lucky and then you said i did this really unique thing that made me stand out so i don't think you were lucky i think that that was like that was you man thanks man i haven't looked at it that way i always looked at it as like i was lucky because they'd decided to click the youtube link or whatever and it was like a weird thing but actually you're probably right like i think if people did stuff like that or attached their art or something i think that is a good way to show them that you're like you stand out as well as that you're a more well-rounded person than just a programmer not that there's anything wrong with being a programmer but like there's like definitely a certain type of person that is super prevalent in silicon valley and i think a lot of tech companies are trying to like diversify their workforce a little bit and look for people with like broad interests definitely yeah i mean you have to work with these people and a lot of the time it's like you're not just working with other programmers you might be working with like designers and product managers and all that kind of stuff they want to like enjoy working with you yeah yeah and i think like it creates a great culture as well for instance with music at shopify there was like the band room and i made tons of friends just going there and jamming with other interns or with full-timers and like it helps create like the company culture that tech companies before the pandemic were really striving to create yeah then when i was so i so i cut you off yeah so continue yeah when i was at shopify i got pretty lucky again this time i do think it was like luck but one of my intern friends had just previously interned at square and was like hey would you be interested in a referral so i said yes it was like at the very last minute they were looking for someone to fill like an a term that i think some people might have dropped out or they had more positions than they thought they would so because it was like two months before the term started and usually like internships are you're already interviewing by that point but right they decided to interview me apparently my youtube channel did help because of that and i did pretty well in the interviews and worked for square and then yeah after that went back to school and now i'm back at shopify and that is like present so that's the backstory so this is your fifth fifth co-op yes i had to count there in my head yes it's like we're in the math faculty and we're like wait yeah one three two three cool cool yeah that's that's that's really interesting man i feel like i for my last co-op because you can you can finish and graduate on five co-ops right at least in the math faculty i know you can so i almost did that like i was in your position i was like coming up to the end of my degree and i was like you know what screw it why don't i just graduate early start making money early start my career early and i reached out to somebody i previously worked with at a startup called toast in boston when i was there in boston they were opening a new office in dublin and i was like i'm actually from ireland like i have an irish passport and everything so i was like how cool would it be if i got to like go to the dublin office i could like live there i could live with my cousin and i would just have a blast in dublin for like four months so i reached out to him and luckily things worked out and i was working at the time in silicon valley at yahoo and my my income was cut in like in half like i made so much less money in dublin but i was like this would be a really cool experience this to me seems like a a reasonable reason to postpone my graduation like this you know international experience even if it is from my home country so then i did that and i was really happy about that i thought that was a really cool experience so if you have the opportunity to live in like a different country i would say definitely take it that's that's good to hear man like i was actually wanting to do something like that and i was just not sure what entails i know the rest of the world does not pay close to the us salary wise but if if everything is like that there then it all kind of balances out i guess yeah i think the thing is is that like i was really worried about income too because you know i didn't i didn't have parents that just paid for my degree so i had like a a line of credit and well not a lot of credit i had like a bunch of debt so i was like well you know if i go here i won't be able to pay off as much debt and i did it anyway and then with like my first job at microsoft like my signing bonus paid my entire debt so when it comes to canada if you're going to be like you know if you're going to be going to a big company or something like that if you live in canada you go to waterloo your your fees aren't really that much in comparison to like in america and your co-op like maybe your co-op doesn't completely pay for everything but when you get that signing bonus if you go to like a company you kind of you know pull the signing bonus out of them you'll probably be fine you'll pay off your degree within a year at least if you're if you're really like on it that's good to hear man that's like that quests some doubts what did you think of living in a different country well like working in tech it was much different so what i've what i've noticed in america is kind of like at least the teams i've worked on even at microsoft even at toast the team was generally a little bit older so maybe like they were early 30s or you know early 40s they have families they they want to go home to their kids every night but when i worked in dublin every single like friday even sometimes throughout the week people would be like hey do you want to go get a pint after work i'd be like sure that sounds like a lot of fun so sometimes i'd even go to the gym and i would be walking to the bus from the gym and they would be on a patio and they would spot me and they'd be like jason come over here right now and then i'd be out to like two o'clock in the morning with my gym bag so it was a lot more fun because the the people in general just wanted to like have more fun and i don't know if that was a product of it being in ireland which i think played some role or if it was just a product of the team being a bit younger that's a that's really cool actually that sounds like a culture that a lot of tech companies could benefit from there's a yeah i'm not sure if it's as much like that there it sounds like it's not but as you know there's a kind of a workaholic culture it's not like people look at tech and they think it's a bunch of people just chilling all the time because of the way like it looks surface level but the corollary of that is that people are at the office for like like they go in and they leave super late because there's so much stuff at the office they might have like have some beers together but it'll be at the office if they're doing it like during town hall or something so it's kind of nice to see that there was an out of work culture in europe that people it's funny it was it was actually the opposite so a good thing like good point to bring that up for for ireland it was like they forced people to work nine to six if you came in before nine or if you came in after nine you you wouldn't get in trouble but there would be like a few eyes and it would be nine to six so the minute six o'clock struck people are like walking out the door it's like in the office you remember the office it was like if you ever watch the show it's like everyone gets up at exactly five o'clock and leaves it's like that there but it was at six o'clock oh that's kind of cool it's weird like hearing that tech is different around the world would you ever consider going full time in europe i would consider it but honestly like the pay is just so different that i think it's better as a short-term thing like maybe if if trump doesn't concede the election in america like descends into civil war maybe i'll move there that passport will come in handy but for now i think i'm pretty comfortable here so one of the things i noticed in your videos was you're talking about your sleep schedule and i did a video where i was like tips to survive at waterloo or to thrive at waterloo and one of the things i missed that i think was really important was the sleep schedule which i think you talked about one of your videos can you tell me like how that kind of impacted your life when when you started taking that seriously yeah that was actually like super life changing your brain just doesn't work when it's not getting enough sleep and i bought this thing called an hour ring which like measures your sleep i'm not sure how accurate it is but it's like accurate enough and one thing i notice is that i actually get an hour less of sleep than i actually spend in bed so if i'm gonna be asleep from like 11 till seven then i'm actually sleeping from like i guess the equivalent of like 11 till six or something so i'm getting one less hour which seems like it wouldn't make a huge difference but eight hours of sleep to seven hours of sleep actually is a big difference so in first year i like i was a classic first year like up till 3am like doing assignments had like the red bull and everything to try to get through stuff and in second year i think i started taking my sleep more seriously because i realized it was just really difficult to get up in the morning which i was thinking that it probably just shouldn't be that painful to get up whether you're a morning person or not it was it was like impossible and i also wasn't getting started on work till the afternoon because i was just asleep for the entire morning once i started like focusing on my sleep more i'd say like a lot of that cleared up i could wake up easily make it to classes easier and i was more efficient in my work i could do things the first time without just sitting there letting the gears turn so it's definitely an underrated like performance enhancer and one that i think culture doesn't appreciate because there's a really big grind mentality or like oh i got less sleep than you i only sleep four hours a night exactly dude it's funny it there really is that like kind of pissing competition where it's like people are bragging about how little sleep they got and it's funny people i like that you kind of called it a performance booster because people will actually physically take adderall but they won't sleep it's like come on man like you're you're doing one thing that's completely unnatural for your body and another thing that is natural for your body but you won't do it which is also probably gonna perfor like enhance your performance enough that you wouldn't need the drug in the first place i noticed a big change in my life too because i was in first year everyone was kind of the same everybody wanted to be like the most macho i did i don't sleep kind of person and in second year i was kind of like man this is stupid i'm tired i just want to sleep and i started like waking up early and having like a very consistent alarm and after that my grades like started to go up like i was low 70s in in first year and i don't even know how i pulled off low 70s i thought i was going to fail for sure probably my electives that were really easy pulled my grade up and then by by the last year i had like over an 80 average and the biggest change was my sleep schedule for one and for two was my starting assignments much earlier you know i think i don't know if you had the same experience in first year but i was like racing up to the very end of of the deadline every single assignment and i was like how is this like going to work this isn't like a sustainable model for me to keep doing like me and my friends are like pounding away at our computers it's like 5 58 and we're just testing our code on on marmoset like this isn't gonna continue to work so i shifted the whole model started it the day it came out and then had like a few buffer days at the end and that like dramatically changed my grades yeah that was a big thing for me as well deadlines like there's a weird cycle you get in where once you once you get to that for the point where you're like up to a deadline with one assignment i feel like every assignment after that is gonna be the same you can you can change it you just have to like work really hard but because because you're like focusing all your attention on one class up until that first deadline you completely forget about every other assignment and then you have to do the same thing for the next one in order to get that done for the deadline and it's just like yeah a i feel like grades are lower because you have less time but also it's just way more stressful than it has to be it takes off so much stress and life becomes like way more enjoyable when you just do things earlier definitely man there's really that cascading effect where it's like you you find yourself in this routine that you're like this is not sustainable i'm i'm so stressed all the time but i feel like i don't even know how to get out of it because i'm i put myself in it so i think one of the the pieces of advice my dad gave me when i started university is he said like hit the ground running start studying on day one and i remember doing that i was like reading over math 135 notes day one people were like making fun of me and i didn't understand them at the time like you know the first time i studied math 135 i was still like bro this doesn't make sense for the longest time but the extra bit of like of reminding myself what's going on in math 135 throughout the course was the only reason i passed it so i think a lot of people get excited to go into university and they like focus on the friendships and they which is really important but they focus on maybe drinking if that's a thing for them and they they leave the the study behind but like day one i hit the ground running studying and i was even struggling to keep up you know yeah i mean when i first went in i had a plan to do a little bit every day but it ended up not working out because the difficulty of everything was like ramped up from high school so oh yeah i didn't end up doing a little bit every day because you kind of it's not a little bit every day that you should be doing it's it's more than a little bit but my expectations for how much a little bit was was i think not completely in line with what waterloo thought doing a little bit of work was yeah waterloo was like a massive wake-up call like i used to think i worked hard at water at in high school and then i went to waterloo and i was like oh my god high school was easy like this is hard man yeah it's it's kind of like there's a lot of strategies that i feel like if i went back to first year now i would just kick so much ass yeah like even if i forgot everything i know so like wipe my knowledge of the actual classes but let me keep my like life knowledge when i go back into first year and i feel like i could like just kick his ass like be not be stressed actually enjoy first year a little bit more man i feel the exact same way and yeah i i couldn't agree more i think about that all the time i have a question i want to ask you about the dreaded cali or bust so did you or do you have your friends ever done the cali or bust i guess i kind of did it in my first year when i applied to like all those companies it's like not a great idea no and it's kind of a toxic culture that waterloo has i don't want to say people shouldn't do it if they really really want to go to california for some reason but you shouldn't like put your self-worth on cali or busting and you should recognize that it's like a huge risk if you decide to do it yeah i agree i feel like for for my group of friends we didn't really care about cali or bust it was more of like america or bust we all kind of wanted to get into an american company and i have mixed feelings about cali or bust because on one hand i'm like yeah it's toxic people are like putting their self-worth on something that's not really that important and it's more vain than anything because it's like they just want like the gloat or the the money from america but like what really is important is the skills you learn and the technologies you learn and stuff like that but on the other hand i do see if you like have a bunch of companies in america in mind that you want to go to you know there's this ancient story about i can't remember exactly which civilizations maybe it was like the romans and the greeks but one of them like shows up on the other shores with a bunch of ships and then they burn the ships so it's basically like they can't get back and it's kind of like supposed to be a motivating factor to make sure that they win and i i kind of understand that mentality so if you're gonna be like you're gonna be doing that and you're like you know what because i'm taking such a big risk here and i'm like showing up on the shores and gonna burn my ship i better like have a bunch of people critique my resume better make sure it passes ats systems i better make sure that like i'm applying to specific jobs i know i'll get and i'll be putting so many hours into crafting like cover letters and stuff like that then it's like okay this guy's taking it really seriously he's he probably will get a job and he's like he's aware that he's burned his ship right or she's burnt her ship and i don't think that's how people do it i think they're at a party like drinking a beer like yeah man i'm just not gonna apply it to toronto jobs i'm better than that that's the the big difference or the big like mixed feelings i have about cali or bust yeah that's a good point like i guess it's just like your mentality about it one is a like you said motivating factor and it's putting yourself in a position where you have to win there's no like other alternative besides just like completely losing i guess busting but yeah the other one i think is just like waterloo's like weird obsession with it with i guess it's not weird it makes sense to me but i saw a lot of people come into like first year classes or second year classes and just like put their entire self worth on getting into like cali for google or something and they would walk in and in the class be like oh i just had my interview with google yeah it went really well and everyone else like well i think a lot of people that also are going to cali look at them they're like yeah nice man i'm going to cali too but for me i was seeing that and it just it was a big blow to my own like self-image i guess yeah so so what was i saying do you remember what i was saying you worked with the dude from yahoo yeah yeah so he got he got a full-time job at microsoft and i hadn't even considered myself smart enough to work there and then i applied and i got the job too to my surprise and it's like i was worried i was more so like i had determined that all of those jobs weren't for me because i wasn't smart enough to do them but then i was like i worked with this guy he's not like any smart guy but he's not significantly smarter than me like surely if he got the job i could get the job right i was more worried about like my path to not even necessarily like a fang company but just to like a successful business like my path to being a successful developer and i feel like i worked in a lot of different industries and i worked in a lot of companies that were not very glamorous but they ended up at my full-time job in something that i think a lot of people would consider glamorous so it's more about the journey it doesn't matter if you don't get google today or you don't get microsoft today this is one of the things i mentioned in one of my videos it's like what are your career goals because if your career goal is going to be getting a job at google and you can get that in your internship like your career your career is all downhill from here like where where do you go from there see you have to like think like where do i want my career to be which companies do i think will actually help me attain that and maybe like google just having the name on your resume will help you attain that maybe it will i don't know but it's all about the end goal and having a journey of doing like six co-ops where you try different things and and you kind of figure out where you want to be and then you try going for one of those companies maybe when you're looking for full times maybe two years when you're like after school like that's that's just as valuable of a career journey than getting google on your first internship and going back for six that's one thing i noticed actually is i felt like different people had different progressions as i was like explaining it to someone some people like skipped to google on the first internship and for myself i feel like it was a more i guess natural progression where it was a small company and then a slightly bigger company and then a slightly bigger company and there was no like jumping like huge jump between any level each one was like a slightly better company than the last company and the truth is is that you can always work for fang after you've done your internships as well like people switch companies all the time in tech it's a it's very common to career hop and and one thing is that like i was 17 when i went to university so people forget how young they were when they started and to expect yourself like think about that now when you're older or even if you're 17 think about the fact that you're only 17. you're not 20 you're not 21. you're not really worrying about any of the rest of your life yet and you're trying to get into google like that's a huge thing to try to achieve when you're 17 or' so go easy on yourself go easy on yourself for sure and it's more about the natural progression as long as you're as you're doing better every time then why does it matter what that other person is doing you know like if that's your goal to also do what they're doing then you'll get there but i think you really need to like like really consider what your goal is because those people i think are going for the clout or the money which is fine they can do that if they want but like what are they going to be doing in five to ten years are they still gonna be working there do they have a career goal path in mind probably not hedonistic treadmill doesn't like whatever you achieve you'll always want something else right so yeah yeah that's true i guess kind of on this like train of thought one thing that i've heard too from some people is they seem to believe that like if you go to waterloo you should work at these companies or like if that they don't go to waterloo then they can't work at these companies which yeah is totally untrue people can there's like a lot more ways to achieve things than people believe there to be i have a friend that went to like university of windsor which is from my hometown and oh wait bro i'm from windsor no [ __ ] are you serious yeah so i have a friend from windsor that went to the university here and like in his own words not many people are like trying to get into these companies the mentality is not one of like applying to internships at all even or if they are it's definitely not applying to fang but he's worked for like google and shopify and github and like tons of big companies and it was all like from totally from his own hard work it had nothing to do with like there was the biggest challenge i think was getting the first company on to the resume but like if people don't get into waterloo or even if they do there's other ways to achieve things than just having good grades or getting good companies and grinding leak code all day yeah dude i agree i always like i kind of err on the side of caution in terms of like what you're doing to prepare yourself for inter for internships probably is it's less important to be doing lead code until you have the interview more important to be working on side projects and when i talk to people about side project projects i'm like actually solve a real world problem like if you're if you're like a first year and you're like man i only really know how to do sudoku solvers or like print print things to the console then yeah that's fine man you do you but when you're getting to these upper grades maybe you're in second year you have to start building products that actually solve real world problems and they don't have to solve every single person's problem in the world maybe it's just your own problem maybe you have a unique problem where you're like you know what i want to get this data every single day push i push notification to my phone i really care about this data no nobody else really cares about it for example i had a friend who actually goes to windsor who did this for like goalies he calls it goalie watch which basically like he does fantasy hockey and he needs to know like if his goalie is starting or not so he built like this system that actually would just send him a notification to let him know if his goalie is on and if if he's not going to be starting that day he'll just go ahead and swap out the goalie or something like that i'm not big into fantasy but and i was like that's that's perfect man you've solved a problem that you actually have and you've like done it with a unique solution that's better that's going to look better than like sudoku solver or like the 50th weather app that somebody else puts on their resume you know oh yeah yeah that's great advice and it kind of ties into to you mentioned the upside of cali or bust which is the like burning the ships kind of mentality and i mentioned that cali or bus was toxic and like two i think it is definitely a mix of what we both said with the universities that you end up going to the biggest difference i think is the mentality of the people you'll be around if you're at waterloo everyone is going to be like trying to call your buster to get into these big companies and you're by like osmosis going to want to do the same because you're going to feel like you're being left behind and your standards are going to be somewhere that is like maybe a bit higher if you're at a different university and no one is thinking of that and they're just like hanging out on the weekends then it's going to be way more difficult to spend your weekends applying to companies or building a side project yeah that's a really good point i think they say that you're you're the combination or you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with so if you spend time with five people that are really like go-getters they want to work at the companies they want to work at google facebook whatever it is even if it's like a specific company for a specific reason like i have a friend that works at duolingo because she loves the design of duolingo great you know like they're they're very driven they're very motivated you're gonna be the average of those people but if you work around those exactly what you said if you're if you're around people that just wanna hang out then you're just gonna wanna hang out so i wanna ask what your favorite classes are like or what have your favorite classes been so far at waterloo and also what is online school like because i'm very skeptical cool so my overall time favorite class was actually a music class it was history of pop music which was just basically like a dude telling a story for an entire lecture it was great but on a more like serious less elective what was my favorite class operating systems with leslie eisted oh yeah that was really good because she's just an amazing professor so leslie is the best man i had leslie too fantastic fantastic yeah it's amazing how that class could go either way with a different professor it might not be that enjoyable because there's a lot of grinding and like a lot of actual workload and a lot of the concepts are weird yeah with her it's like she lays things out in such a way or explains things in such a way that it's interesting and you want to keep coming back so yeah and she cares a lot about the students you can tell from the the way she conducts herself and i should you know i'll give a few shout outs to some of my favorite professors too leslie leslie is like definitely top three in no particular order though gotta give a shout out to like dave tompkins do you have dave yeah dave peter burr for com for compilers i don't know i haven't had him yet but i've heard that he's really good oh compilers is fantastic wait not compilers what am i talking about concurrency yeah parallelism and yeah concurrency yeah there's one other professor that i think is like fantastic oh you know who it is troy vasiga oh i haven't had troy no not yet yeah i had them for 241 which is like the the mandatory compilers course is it it's one of those ones i think 241 is is it the logic class that's 245 oh okay yeah i'm getting i think my memory is not what it used to be a cs241 foundation's sequential programming and then there was i remember there was another professor that was that did 246 when i was there and i thought he was fantastic but i can't remember his name i think he was indian no mayor [laughter] man all of those professors i hope they watch this and i hope it brings a smile to their face that they like they were fantastic professors and i would recommend anybody go to the those classes yes if if they do shout out to carmen bruni as well you made second year great what what does carmen teach he taught 245 and he also taught the i guess it was 241 yeah the one that you're talking about where you kind of learned about assembly and yeah yeah he taught that as well nice well i i don't know if he probably was teaching something else when i was there but yeah man a lot of good professors there few few bad ones but i'm not going to mention the bad ones yeah but they know who they are yeah seriously though the bad ones are the ones that like bro check out your rate my professors you know who you are yeah and then online school you said you're skeptical about it i actually really enjoyed it really i think that it's really dependent on what kind of person you are and what your learning style is i thought i would hate it because i wouldn't be able to like see anyone and i would just be isolated but i felt like i was able to kind of create a separation like i'm going to start school at this time and i'm going to end it at this time and i'm going to just work for that entire time and maybe what some people would say is like unhealthy six hours of sitting but yeah for myself i like being able to do that and also have complete control over my schedule so nice because you can't really miss a lecture because they're all recorded yeah i could watch one at like i could watch them all at like 3 p.m or i could watch them all at 10 a.m like first thing in the morning or something so for myself it worked better but i know a lot of people had trouble motivating themselves to keep up with the content yeah well you know that's a good point you you probably actually are in a great position for online school because you've kind of already learned your like responsibility lesson you know a lot of these people that haven't learned that lesson yet they're like oh great a free pass to to not study or to do whatever i want and then like probably don't take the courses that seriously i would love the ability though to to put a professor in double speed so you can kind of just get on to the next thing yeah that would be fantastic i did do a lot of that that was people thought by all my professors were on crack or something when they would walk by all right do you have any other topics oh i have one other thing i want to ask you about but before that i would just mention that i'm doing a resume critique giveaway on my channel i for like the 500 sub mark i was like doing a giveaway doing like two people i think there's only like 20 applicants right now so if you go apply you have like a one in 10 chance of getting a resume critique so if any of your viewers like want a resume critique send them to that video for the description or something like that but on top of that i wanted to ask i started this series called i've only done one episode called resume or co-op horror stories just because i wanted to like destigmatize the fact that some people don't have like fang internships that are all like puppies and rainbows and have like free food and all that kind of stuff i wondered if you had any like bad co-op experiences yeah let me think about how to tell this without calling anyone out in particular that's that's the trick man that's the trick they're probably not gonna see it whatever so at one of my unnamed internships we had a like sre i guess you would say that i'm sure he was like a great sre but he didn't really like it when the interns were asking him questions about things and since this was like an earlier internship i didn't know as much about like the stacks or technologies that go into building applications so at one point we had an issue with i believe a certificate or something where we had launched like this web page and no matter how many times we pushed or redeployed our changes weren't live in the browser and so we went up to him and said hey there's an issue here we're not sure what's going on and he's basically said oh just keep like checking it out i don't have time for this and it's probably like a mistake that you made so we spent like two weeks trying to figure out what had gone wrong and why our changes weren't like showing and then at the end of the whole thing it turns out that i think he either forgot to issue the certificate or point something at something else so because he wasn't willing to listen to the interns it created like two weeks of confusion and like self-doubt and also thinking that i was like screwing up this internship because yeah a man like oh i must be terrible if i can't even ship anything for two weeks so yeah did here's a an important question did he acknowledge that it was his fault and apologize no see that's what yeah but if you if you're busy i'm like yeah i get it like i'm busy too sometimes for two weeks not being able to have any time for you is pretty extreme i would say but like man if it's your fault like own up yeah that that was probably the big thing it was just that it we just discovered oh it's working now oh he changed this thing and it was like never like mentioned he never came up and was like oh you should try that thing again it probably works now like my bad if he did that like the whole thing would have been fine it happens but no he never i'm sure he knew that he fixed it but he just didn't feel like telling us so the worst kind of boss is the one that won't that blames things on the constituents is constituents the right word there on on their employees and doesn't accept the fault when it's theirs so yeah i feel that i've had that yeah i'm sure it's probably a fairly common thing this isn't like a super crazy horror story i'm not sure what the other one that that someone told on the channel was but oh the first episode was just me i was just excited i have i have two two interns two internships in particular that were like back to back pretty bad and i was like considering leaving computer science because i'm like i don't want a job like this but then my next one was like fantastic so i you know i just i just got unlucky with two bad ones in a row yeah well it's a good thing you didn't decide to leave and you stuck it out eh yeah i'm definitely thanking my earlier self right now okay man thank you for like all this information i feel like if i was to watch this exact podcast interview when i was you know in first year i would have gotten so much value out of it so like i think you you have some fantastic content on your channel and the content you shared here was just as good so thank you for that thank you man and i really like your channel and i like what you're doing like there's a lot of people that are in positions where they just don't know things that i feel like so many other people know like one it's like life experiences that people could learn a lot from so it's good that you're doing that and i really enjoyed this it was kind of fun talking about the stuff so yeah man we should we should do another collab sometime i had a lot of fun for sure cool yeah
