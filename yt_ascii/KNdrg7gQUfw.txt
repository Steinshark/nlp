okay guys what if i told you that there is a literal step-by-step way for you to go from completely zero to learning to code and landing and developer job in as little as for months i did it myself so many other people have done it as well and i have spent the past two years studying literally studying all the people who have successfully learned the code and compared them to people who don't successfully learn to code and through that combined with my own experience i have come up with the four month dev framework no more getting demotivated no more starting courses and then or finishing them no more not knowing how to build projects what sort of projects to build this video is the only thing that you need so here is my four dev framework step number one choose a roadmap that actually works and this is probably the most important step given how many resources there are out there it's easy to fall into the trap of just doing a random course after random course without any kind of proper strategy to actually teach you the skills that you actually need to get hired as a junior developer because a developer is much more than someone who just knows how to write some basic functions in like five different languages a developer is someone who can take fundamental programming logic and combine it with practical software engineering concepts and tools to create software that actually works don't take a 60 hour course on some language pick one that teaches what you need to know in as little time as possible and yes i am going to very shamelessly plug my own python course whose focus is to teach you programming logic in a way that you actually know how code works so you actually understand what programs are how the computer's memory works all these fundamental things that literally form the foundation that allows you to then start stacking all of these skills i have now expanded the course with a full notion based playbook that includes exercises extra materials summaries of the core content at the price of the course for now is 79 but it will keep in increasing as i add more modules to it right but if you buy it today you get access to all the future modules as they get released after you have learned programming fundamentals you have three options option number one learner web development framework like django for this i recommend the course django for everybody on coursera although in step one you could also just start with javascript fundamentals which will allow you to simply use javascript for the front end and the back end which ones like node.js option number two if you want to get into big tech the next step for you is to learn data structures and algorithms i'm currently developing my own data structures and algorithms course but for now i recommend these three options that i will link below option number three if you want to learn data science or machine learning on top of programming fundamentals you need to learn the skills of data science and machine learning concepts as well as python tools to actually use these concepts again i'll leave course recommendations down below and the fourth option is to simply start with one full stack web development online bootcamp for a free option i recommend the odin project i completed around half of this myself it's pretty good text space so it wasn't like the right one for me but for paid but more engaging option i recommend zero to masteries web development boot camp so right there are literally four road maps for you that you can just pick one of and then follow it blindly and if you just do that it's going to naturally teach you the stack of skills that you need to learn to get hired step two is to ignore the fluff and focus on the 10 that matters look i know that the world of tech and coding is amazing and there's all these shiny courses that you could be doing but if you're looking to get hired as fast as possible you need to learn what you need to know and not waste time people often get confused like when i was talking about my free online computer science degree template which by the way you can get by signing up to my newsletter down below because they're like oh there's all these courses and like now you're telling me that you shouldn't do this like i had different goals when i was teaching myself computer science online i was simply teaching myself for the joy of learning first just learn the things to get your job and then if you wanna keep learning about all these amazing things because they are like so ridiculously interesting you should learn about them but you can then keep learning these as you're already getting paid as a software developer the only course that i recommend almost everyone do even if you're just looking to get a job is harvard university cs50 it will give you just what you need in terms of computer science fundamental to have a strong foundation without going too deep into topics that really don't matter so spend two months in steps one and two and then we can move on to step three this is the most important step and i know that i said this about the other steps as well but it's because they are also important i recommend making two to three great portfolio projects the purpose of this is you might have learned to code but unless you've actually made something to actually show to the world that you know how to code no one is going to believe you you have a computer science degree or you have some actual internship experience or something like that this is not as necessary but for most of you like when i was learning the code i had none of those things so the only way the literal only way for you to convince a recruiter that you know how to go is through projects so think about what kind of jobs you want to apply for and then look at their job descriptions and understand what kind of skills that they look for and then build projects using those skills spend one month on this step and then let's move on which is to build a rock solid portfolio website when i recruiter sees your portfolio website they should go like wow and i hear you asking i'm not a designer i don't know how to make great looking websites precisely because how important the way your portfolio website looks you don't want to just go and try to hack it together yourself using html css and javascript because you probably don't know how to make iguna you need to make it responsive there's all these technical details that you would need to know through your portfolio website i actually recommend literally just using a template that's already professionally made it's automatically responsive that automatically looks great and the last thing you need is that you need your website to be hosted using your own domain that little detail alone again just makes it seem so much more professional and to do all of these things in one place i recommend you use hostinger literally just do exactly what i did you go to hostingit.com and they have a deal going on right now so you can just claiming for like 2.99 a month then you click on new website you answer a few questions and then you can use their all-in-one website builder and choose from this list of designer made templates for your website so we are solving that problem and i want you to make three sections at least and about me projects and a contact and maybe some experience if you do have some impress passive experience hosting is only one website builder you can build your dream ports for your website using their drag and drop build with no code required you can use their free library of royalty-free images change and add sections with a click of a button and several other tools like the ai logo maker to showcase your coding projects to recruiters in a way that actually gets noticed with your subscription you get one free domain that can be anything as long as it's available you can just claim it from the home page and all of this will cost you literally less than the price of a cup of coffee per month i use it myself for like many of my different websites and yes in case you didn't realize this video is sponsored by hostinger and because they're sponsoring this video you can use my code down below to get an even further discount on their plans spend one day on this step and then let's move on to step five the only thing you need to still do before you apply is to build an absolute rock solid cv first again use a ready-made template just find one online look at the kinds of templates that people have used in successful resumes and then stick to that don't try to hack one together for yourself from scratch because there's just no reason for you to waste your time doing that you want a really easy option there's this website called resumemaker.io i believe i'll leave that down below as well all you have to go do is fill out the details and then download it and you will have a resume for yourself and then after that just try before you think you're ready apply through linkedin don't just apply online go and find recruiters contact them go and meet some other developers talk to them show that you're passionate so that you have potential show that you're the type of person who's willing to go above and beyond because that's at the end of the day all that they really look for in a junior candidate you just need to stick to the steps you need to just keep putting one foot in front of the other every single day the one thing that i want you to understand is that you can do this if i did it if all these other people did it too following some version of these exact same steps there's no reason there is absolutely no reason to believe that you cannot do it too you just need to stick to the principles of success keep doing it every single day keep putting one to food in front of the other maybe it takes two months maybe it takes six months it doesn't matter but if you just keep sticking to it you will eventually get there before you go go follow me on instagram i post that pretty much daily about my new life here as a startup engineer as an entrepreneur it's like living my dream life in dubai what's it all like if you're interested in that go follow me there if you still genuinely don't believe in your abilities to get through this in this video i describe exactly how i literally brainwashed myself to get through my self-doubt and to push myself to learn the code i think you'll find it really really valuable so before you start i still recommend you go watch this video next remember that you can do a lot more than you think i will see you in the next video [music] thank you
