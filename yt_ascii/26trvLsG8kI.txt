guys the scam we're investigating today took in over 20 million dollars and their ceo the whole time was an actor guys everyone knows if it sounds too good to be true it probably is and yet every year people keep falling for it why well we know desperation plays a large role covet does as well people are out of work looking for a new way to make their make money and one popular new method is something called a hype have you guys heard of this it's called the high yield investment program not spelled like hype like spell like hype like this this is always a ponzi scheme do not believe it if somebody's claiming these crazy returns it's probably a scam the specific scam we're talking about today and investigating is barack's but these are a dime a dozen in fact i interviewed someone who is addicted to these things and let me tell you people who fall for them are not who you'd expect okay it's not it's a lot of these people say i never could have imagined myself getting involved in this i don't know what i was thinking we're talking to bernard and perry today and we'll be hearing from them a lot of the people who invest in this stuff they never saw themselves investing with these things but they're clever techniques used to trick you into investing with these idiots so first of all what is the burex scam well burax was a website that popped up that wanted to imitate financial institutions offering let's just say very speculative returns 1.4 percent a day and you could even get more than that if you invested more money now if you're a long-time coffeezilla fan you know that 1.4 a day doesn't exist but if you're not if you're an average joe who maybe doesn't spend all your days laughing at scams maybe you don't so let's take a deeper dive and figure out who borax claimed to be before it all came falling apart but before it collapsed let's take a look at some of their promotional materials shall we and how dynamically technologies are developing in the modern world it would not be wise not to apply them in the field of automation of financial analysis processes in march 2018 our team for the first time allowed themselves to put their management of multiple accounts in the hands of a trading board developed by our specialist inspirational music check sketchy russian accent check what do we got buzzwords oops that's also a check this looks credible right it's well shot it's a documentary this guy looks like a ceo doesn't he he looks like someone who would run a big organization but the problem is the claims are just too high 1.4 percent a day could not exist if it did you'd quickly become the richest man in the world there's no such thing as a guaranteed return this was actually the hallmark of one of the greatest scammers ever bernie madoff and the hallmark of all ponzi schemes is these steady guaranteed returns that are super attractive they don't really exist and deep down you know it doesn't really exist even the people that i talked to the people who got scammed they even told me you know i kind of maybe felt that something was maybe off but you know it just it just seemed like you know a good chance for me to make some money if you have even the twinge of maybe this is it i don't know maybe this isn't really real get the hell out and after a few days of successful operation of this boat we were convinced that we need to completely change the concept of our walk and after three months of break even trading operations we realized that we had made a huge break for in the field of exchange this is another thing they say besides the buzzwords they always talk about their journey how they found a great bot after years of work it was failing then all of a sudden it just worked it just works like magic guys and it's never failed since honestly they're not looking for your average joe's money they're looking for big boys they want to talk to people with billions of dollars or millions of dollars not your five thousand dollars so the first big red flag of any kind of investing portal is if they're gonna give you high returns and you don't need much starter cash if they're guaranteeing returns and they're saying hey just invest ten dollars twenty fifty dollars hundred dollars look real investors no offense don't want tiny fishes money they don't care about you they want like the big dogs and it makes sense right why would you want to deal with twenty thousand clients with five thousand dollars instead of one client with like 20 million dollars it doesn't make yeah it's just the numbers don't work out why would you deal with that headache now before you move on and talk about how the ceo is a paid actor let's first hear from our victims from this scam this is bernard and perry i initially made two deposits the first one was one ethereum i believe one ethereum at that time was if i'm not mistaken around the 1500 range in total at that time that i made those two deposits it totaled out to 2.3 there but that's not that's like four thousand dollars that's that's a lot exactly exactly the part of understanding why that happened to me is worth a lot more because i'm not gonna make that same mistake going forward ladies and gentlemen this is bernard he also lost money with the burrex scheme how much did you lose bernard i lost around 23 at that time that's a lot that's that's a serious amount of money yeah i mean i feel bad because some of my buddies like i put in about 13 people in this thing so it was it was a pretty sad day man when i had to tell each individual their money is gone because everybody trusted my word you know your word is your bond and when i had to tell them like wait a minute wait a minute you're telling me our money's gone and and there's 70 ethereum across all the people 70 ethereum yeah across my across my people it was around 73 ethereum how much how much is that 73 ethereum i want to say 140 150 000 one ethereum now is two thousand dollars when we come across these type of platforms unless they're like legitimate i wouldn't just go the other way i'm not i know for back i'm not getting myself into that same situation again but yeah one percent a day walk the other way okay now these losses are terrible but i think it's worth telling you guys that during those conversations i was really trying to hammer home the idea that these returns should have never been considered credible there's this idea that like maybe this wasn't the right investment vehicle in other words like oh maybe this one doesn't work but there is a legitimate hype out there and the answer to that like thought is no one percent a day doesn't exist if it does it carries high risk in all likelihood if you can just get it in your head that one person a day or anything close to that just doesn't exist you are going to do very well you're not going to fall for these insane get rich quick schemes so if you're one of these people that thinks oh maybe i just need to find the right one the right scheme that does work you're gonna get burned because these guys are good at making themselves look legit like they'll oftentimes put their address somewhere it's not actually like they'll pretend to be from somewhere they're not so obviously the actor we saw is russian right but they put their address in australia why because people trust australia more than they do russia now this is the street view of australia where they say they're they're located in and of course we can't find their building because it doesn't exist they also say they're registered in australia which of course they're absolutely not and that documentation turns out to be completely fake but the real cutting edge innovation is what i've been hinting to this whole time the people supposedly running the show are puppet actors so take a look at this man and this work was uncovered by behind mlm look at this guy look familiar or perhaps this guy this is an actor profile this is the same man that we see here posing as an investment professional for a ponzi scheme additionally the cmo chief marketing officer was a girl named susan pope and 78 of the committed trading transactions she also went on many live streams mini podcasts to talk to shill this thing and she answered questions like a good old pro would bs artists saying all the things they were doing and you know just get generally giving the impression this is a professional organization and i as a marketing director who was directly involved in its development can only confirm his words so she gave many interviews only it turns out her acting reel wasn't covered she says i am a student at the higher school of performing arts the same exact person this is not a marketing person this is an actor and people fell for it now the sad thing is is that once these people were outed as actors the ponzi scheme unfortunately of course collapses like it was destined to anyways and bernard and perry lost their money and are very unlikely unfortunately to get it back because unlike jay mazzini the people who set up this scam didn't put their name on it instead they just attached a bunch of hired actors to it but this is to let you know the lengths these people will go to there's so much money to be made by scamming people i mean it's the most despicable thing you can do to another human being but there's a lot of money in it and so unscrupulous individuals will go to any length to get this done in total we saw wallets approach 20 million dollars total from this scam that ran for less than a year less than a year and it had no reputation no one had ever heard of this before it ran so in one year no reputation two paid actors 20 million dollars if that doesn't give you an idea at the length someone be willing to go to get this kind of money i don't know what could but let me tell you guys they will go to this length and farther to convince you that they're legitimate and deposit money with them and once you do it's as good as gone once you transfer cryptocurrency to somebody else's wallet you've effectively said goodbye right they they're saying they're keeping your money if it's not regulated if you don't have that money insured if it's not within your local jurisdiction chances of you getting that money back are basically nothing which is horrible to say and overall you know the victims of this they just want to see that no one falls for this again we knew the consequences we saw the red lights but we still went in this is our our own mistake but it's also a opportunity to prevent other people from doing that same mistake as well i don't care if mark cuban himself descends from the dallas mavericks and tells you to put your money with him you do not do it coffeezilla says no if if they're making insane promises chances are they're insane don't put your money with them that's basically it hope you learned some lessons today thanks for watching and that's basically it i'll see you guys next time wake up and smell the coffee
