hello everybody i am very excited to be here with christopher kazor and matthew petrusek they are the authors of the recent book jordan peterson god and christianity the search for a meaningful life which is published by word on fire bishop baron's organization and so i'm really happy to have them here i have the book right here i've been diving into it looking into it seeing the different approaches and different arguments so i'm happy to have some time with them to explore why they wrote this you know what are they hoping to accomplish and a few of the main points that they're trying to make is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] christopher and matthew thank you for coming on maybe maybe introduce yourselves a little bit tell me what your background is and and moving up to why it is that you even thought of writing such a book right now sure so i'm a professor of philosophy at loyola university in los angeles and i teach a lot of courses that are related to subjects in faith and reason so i actually teach a course called the god of faith and reason and one of the big issues that comes up with my students again and again is how to reconcile genesis with contemporary science so i have many students that are troubled by this students who see the attractiveness of christian faith and then worry well i'm going to have to jettison all contemporary knowledge about how things evolved and whatever so for years now i've been trying to show students that if we put genesis back into its proper context and read it as a creation narrative that's a rival to other creation narratives that actually there's no difficulty at all in reconciling a proper understanding of genesis with contemporary science and evolution and things like that so i've been doing that for a long time but then i ran across jordan peterson's lectures on genesis and i have to say even though i had read genesis you know many many times i was really struck and learned a ton from his own interpretation of the text and so i really became quite fascinated with his work and looked at his writings and also the videos that he's done on other topics and what i was struck by really was in in my way of thinking about a continual effort to put contemporary science in dialogue with this rich faith tradition and i love that because part of my background is studying thomas aquinas he's one of my great heroes and aquinas was all about bringing together what was for him at the time contemporary science that is the writings of aristotle with the wisdom of the christian tradition people like john chrysostom people like augustine of hippo and what thomas wanted to do is bring these into fruitful dialogue and that's what i try to do in my own philosophical work so i saw peterson's work really as another way in a very exciting way of engaging in this dialogue between faith and reason so that kind of sparked my interest in peterson and led me to write about peterson and then eventually to co-author this book and so matthew you wrote the 12 rules part you know not so much the biblical lectures part so what it is that brought you to such a venture yourself well i did my i'm also a professor but of a theology just right down the hall from from chris at loyola marymount university and i did my graduate work at the university of chicago and it's it has it rightly has the reputation of doing a really rigorous maybe even suspicious analysis of the category of religion and so it's a very sort of hard knock intellectual environment and so when i when i first got this job i thought oh i'm prepared to be able to to speak to students who may have some reservations about religion in general and christianity in particular and i realized within the first semester that my estimation of where young people are where the culture is generally was way off i couldn't i couldn't even assume for example that students knew that the bible is composed of for christians of the old testament the new testament that was one assumption i learned the first day of class so ever since that's been about seven years i've been looking for ways to to re-tool to make religion first accessible and then second relevant and i've been experimenting with with different literature and and different approaches but when i encountered jordan peterson's work and then saw the effect that it was having i thought this is this is it and i've actually been able to test it in the classroom and sure enough the kind of response he gets online is is also happening in the classroom as well so so for that reason i began engaging his work and i also because i was giving such a close engagement started to look at not only areas of overlap but also what i thought were some significant gaps or areas in his thought that a a substantive christian theism would actually fix mm-hmm and so i'm i'm curious about matthew what it is like what it is about his approach that you thought was in terms of christianity or in terms of a way of living what do you thought was so close or what would enliven these young christian students that you had well if i could play sort of armchair psychologist which is dangerous to do and we're talking about jordan peterson i think that we're at we're at a point now where the experiment of secularism is not only beginning to fail but but really failing and and students are young people especially are bearing the brunt of that when i think back to my to my own youth my own coming of age and you know when i have that long commute into work i also often listen to music from the 90s you know that's now it's considered classic rock in some circles which is scary but i see i see the culture beginning to experiment with this kind of mischievous nihilism already but around it people were still basically believers in a generic sense it was still propping up the idea that their that life is meaningful that there is purpose that there there is a there is a structure to your to life in general to your particular existence that will hold you up so we could afford the culture could afford to to have these pockets of mischievous nihilism well i think it's fair to say those pockets have now become the dominant form and things are falling apart across the board we see things are falling apart so i think that there's this hunger even if it's not if it's not explicitly articulated by by most a hunger for rules and then for rules that actually have depth meaning purpose and truth yeah there's something funny about the situation when what happens when you know you when the world is ordered you have room for clowns let's say and kind of people poking at the order but when the world is upside down and every everything is clownish and everything's a carnival ah yeah what do you do and then people who tell you to stand up straight and pull up your pants become whoa like this is what is this like what is it put on your pants and then pull them off just just put them on yeah just that a lot to start with and so matt christopher in terms of of genesis i think that for sure my own interest with jordan is far more in that area you know like i i'll be honest with you i haven't actually read 12 rules for life but i really his work on the on the relationship between cognitive science and kind of evolutionary biology and the manner in which to read genesis you know this idea of perception and the problem of multiplicity this is what has kind of interested me the most with jordan what got me excited about the manner in which he talks about it and so what it is what is it about the way he talks about genesis which you found connects so much to the christian tradition well i would say the in a weird in a weird way the most basic thing was something i never noticed until jordan peterson pointed it out to me and that was that god creates through rational speech so in some of these rival creation stories the gods have a big battle a big war and then the universe is fashioned out of the basically battlefield remains of this sort of inter what would you say this war among the gods yeah and what jordan points out which again it's weird that i never noticed this but that god says let there be light and if you think about rational speech rational speech can only arise from some kind of reasoner you can't have rational speech just from a duck quacking or you know a tree falling over and making noise if it's a rational speech there is a mind behind it and so the universe is arises from this rational speech and reflects a rational mind and and that god repeatedly does this and then says and it was good that's another really key point because some of these rival myths thought of the created order as actually evil that to have a body for example would be seen as a bad thing an evil thing that we should transcend and rather than view creation in the human body as good these other stories would say no no you're trapped in your body your body like plato would say your body is a prison that traps your soul and i think in the christian tradition there's this emphasis on the goodness of creation and an emphasis on the goodness of the human body and so again jordan sort of highlighted these things and i had heard the stories before but does system never registered with me properly and he really made it register with me properly so i was very grateful for those insights and then the more i thought about those sorts of insights about how human beings are made in the image of god and therefore we too express ourselves through rational speech i mean jordan really brought that out in a really beautiful way so i guess what i was trying to do in the book is connect peterson's interpretations of genesis with some of these older classic interpretations of genesis that you find in people like origen and saint augustine and thomas aquinas and others and again i found this big overlap and in some respects i thought that these classic thinkers in a way could really contribute and augment what peterson was saying and bring him kind of further down the road so in the book that's kind of what i'm trying to do is say this is great we're moving in a good direction but if we look at these these classic writers we can go even further and even deeper yeah i think that your point about the the goodness of creation is a huge thing that seems to come up time and time again in jordan which is even though sometimes you wonder if he really believes in the goodness of the world he realizes that just like his proposition about god that if you act as if the world is good then the fruits of that will be something if you act as if the world is inherently bad then you can also see what the fruits are and it's interesting because you know in the past maybe 20 years or so there's been a resurgence of gnosticism in the popular culture there's been in you know even in universities this idea that the gnostics were the real christians and that you know orthodoxy was just suppressed all these marginal voices of christianity you know you you have this narrative which is there and it's fascinating to notice that as we kind of see postmodernism play itself out we're seeing in these transhuman moves and in these even in the digital space and this obsession with the digital space something like kind of soft narcissism where we believe that we can exist only in these kind of subtle bodies you know on on screens and that you know the our our actual physical physical bodies are something of a obstacle to our ideal existence whether it's in the whether it's even in the whole gender sexual identity thing but also in other even weirder tropes like you know like the the fashion for furries and all that kind of weird stuff where people kind of project themselves into avatars and things like that so i think that jordan even in his own persona as this kind of gritty grounded guy he doesn't anymore but he used to wear cowboy boots you know that was something about like he just you know he has this sense that he's actually kind of standing on the ground and his and is and speaking to you from that that space i really think so and also the same with with what you're saying there there's something when jordan's talking about scripture that you're like and then oh no like there's like you're like yes yes and then i don't know i'm not sure like here's when things start to get a little yeah a little soggy let's say but his his genuineness i think is part of the the attraction too like he's so genuine in his desire to to kind of plunge in and to know more and to and to move these things around and to try to see how they can connect to to contemporary issues of psychology and you know how we live in the world i think that goes a lot to why people are interested sometimes you know the the christian scholar especially speaks speaks from a voice in which you see it you feel almost as if this has nothing to do with reality like this is you know when you're talking about genesis it has nothing to do with your life it's nothing to do with how you live in the world so why would you even care about these old stories especially if they sound so foreign to our to our materialist thinking let's say yeah no i totally agree with you i think that is part of the draw of peterson's presentation in particular when he's actually talking hearing him talk so when you see him and i've seen him live twice when you see him give a talk especially live there really is a sense that he is thinking through these issues he's trying to figure out what's true and you probably noticed sometimes he'll just stop and it'll be like just you know be three or four seconds and and you're like god did he have a stroke i mean i'm worried about the guy what happened here he's still thinking he's just sort of collecting his thoughts and trying to pick the exactly the right word and for me i appreciate that i think that's great i mean it's he's sort of the exact opposite of a white house press secretary that just spits out the talking points of the day and there's no relationship between those talking points or very little relationship between those talking points and the reality of what's actually happening just you know so so i love i for me that's a huge part of the draw that there's a kind of honesty a searching quality to it and you know if you're going to search you know sometimes you're going to not find what you want or go in the wrong direction but you know i think we're all in a search i mean maybe my questions are slightly different than jordan's but you know i'm still searching i'm still trying to grow and move forward and and i love that about him and for me frankly that's pretty inspiring i think well look if i can spend my life on a search for the true the good and the beautiful and trying to live in accordance with the true the good and the beautiful well then i would think my life is going to be pretty meaningful and i'm going to live a pretty good life and there's something about that which people have a vision let's say of the middle ages or kind of middle age thinking of this very rigid and solid way of presenting things but when you look at how actually things were done with the contestations and the universities you know students would bring up questions there would be this lively debate that would be go on for multiple days you know where students would just try to find arguments to kind of to destroy their teacher the teacher would say like find all the arguments you can to try to destroy my argument and then would be this like back and forth thing it was far more dynamic and far more engaged than what we tend to think of today and so matthew i guess the big question for you is what do you make of the whole i act as if god exists thing because that seems to be the biggest the biggest thing the biggest issue that keeps coming up with jordan and he says he doesn't believe in god but he acts as if god exists how do you make of that in terms of of how it connects to christianity how it how it goes away from it or how do you how do you see that i think in a the book actually points out that that peterson's use of that of that trope i act as if god exists is actually something that that pope benedict pope benedict emeritus encouraged as a model for for europe and its waning relationship with christianity saying at least can we agree that it's all things considered it's preferable for us to to live and to act as if god exists and so i think i think we can get a lot of mileage out of that especially given the current state of of the culture at the same time i think it's it's ultimately it it has formal a formal structure to it but it's substantively empty because it's hard to have a relationship with a hypothetical and ultimately christianity is is about a relationship those are also words from from pope benedict it's not about it's not about us a set of propositions or a set of ideas it's about a relationship with jesus christ and so you you may get something but it will be a pittance of the actual reality that's behind it if we only act according to the idea that there may be some some law giver and and judge it also misses the grace it misses the it misses the love it misses the mercy it misses the best part of the christian story it it gets maybe the it might get the crucifixion but it misses the resurrection and so i think for for those reasons it's just it's not enough theologically philosophically but i also would say therapeutically it's not enough because when things get when things get dark enough a hypothetical is not going to carry you through it's just not going to do it you're going to have to walk to to jump to the other i don't like the lord jump you're going to have to have the courage to push through to the other side into an actual relationship of faith no i think your point about grace is the most important point because you know for all my love of jordan we see that his the god that he says he acts as if exists is an ideal right is a judge as a logos is is something towards which all reality tends but acts as as this overbearing you know model that you have to conform to and then this sense you know the sense that you can't right that it actually becomes a weight on you like this pressure that makes you suffer because you see it and you want to act in conformity to it but you always fail and so you know it's it's actually kind of it's actually not funny but it's kind of the strangeness which is that the whole point of christianity right is that this this absolute is calling you right it's always kind of calling you and is the source of reality and always calling reality back into himself and without that even the theory even his theory about how the world exists to me seems to not seems to fall apart because there's something even behind that that seems to even in his idea of perception and this notion of multiplicity there seems to be a sense in which you have to get it you have to understand how it's always resolved this kind of calling in right this bringing the world even as a person kind of into yourself and so if you stack that up into higher beings then you end up with something like like god and so my my biggest there's an interesting thing going on too with jordan and i don't know if you've commented on it either of you but tammy his wife is very much closer to christianity although she's not yet going to any church she has been praying the rosary every day for several years she attributes her her healing to a miracle that she experienced in the hospital i'm actually doing a series with her right now going through the symbolism of the rosary and which she wants to put up as a podcast you know on her own on her own terms and now we've heard also that michaela his daughter is saying that she found god i don't know exactly what that means but but it's an interesting situation in general to watch how how jordan seems to have been this bridge towards christianity for many many people you know and it's a bridge that he himself has he himself has not crossed yet so i don't know if it's something that you've thought about in the writing of this book yeah a little bit and actually kind of after writing of the book so one of the the important things about mary it seems to me in jesus is if jesus is just a myth or an ideal you know an ideal or myth doesn't need an actual mother but jesus was not merely an ideal or merely the archetype but but was actually a flesh and blood real human being and so he had a real mother and so i think in a way the practices like saying the rosary are incredibly important for living as if god exists so i think that there's something incredibly important about living as if god exists and and i try to do that too and there is always a gap between my ideals of how to live to love god perfectly and the reality of what i actually do but part of the the way of of easing this gap it seems to me is recognizing that it's god's help that helps us to to cut down on this on the gap between the ideal and the and the real and part of that mercy is the impetus to prayer so when we pray it seems to me what we're doing is enhancing that relationship and and moving towards ourselves transforming into being more like you know how we ideally want to be and so yeah i'm very happy to hear these encouraging developments about you know his wife saying the rosary and i didn't heard about his daughter but but i think all that is really to the good so if we act as if god exists the next thing they ask i think would be well has god given any sort of revelation about how he wants us to live and jordan's answer to that seems to be more or less that yeah jesus really is somehow the ideal and teaches us something really important about how to live but then if that's true and we look at the gospels jesus clearly talked about a church and talked about the importance of baptism and talked about all these these things that christians are supposed to do to to serve the poor and to love their neighbor to forgive their enemies and pray for their enemies and so i think the next stage would be well look if we try to live as if god exists we try to follow the teachings of jesus well then the next stage might be well we should join a church we should pray we should love our enemies we should serve the poor we should develop a life of prayer and then and then continue moving forward and and this way of it's not really an intellectual way it's almost by practice you know that that you grow not so much through just thinking but but also through living through through actual the practice of prayer the practice of penance the practice of serving others and so that can be and for most people is a very viable path to god yeah one of jordan's main points has been the idea that let's say consciousness and perception is embodied you know and that it it is it is very much embodied that is the way that we actually address the world is always through this embodied judging or evaluating of how things present themselves to us you know and this if you take that a little further you realize that what it necessitates is it necessitates something like ritual there's no doubt about it that is that if the world is teleological the way it presents itself to us and we have to deal with it in terms of our purposes then there are ways to deal with them properly and there are ways to deal with it which lead to death and that scales into social interactions right we we have ways of interacting with each other which are ritualized and are not arbitrary and that continues to stack up and so all of a sudden even within this very secular way of describing the world things like baptism things like communion things like coming together singing church buildings all the all the the kind of stuff that the modern d mythological d i can never say that word the mythologizing christian wanted to slowly eradicate all suddenly kind of flood back in and you know i think that even at the end of his own argument jordan at some point has to go to church like it has to be coming bad he can't just be talking about embodiment but there has to be a stacking up of how things come together in community you know like you said all of this is well and good unless until you have someone you know sitting in the pew next to you that you really find annoying and that just gets on your nerves all the time and now you're faced with them and you have to talk with them and you have to go up to the communion chalice at the same time knowing that you're all part of this body so matthew i know if you have some thoughts on these last few these last few points about god jordan has a bridge and and all of this towards christianity yeah one of the again through practice having having had the opportunity to teach peterson's work a few times one of the one of the the the elements of his thought that students i think react to most positively is his claim in 12 rules for life that you have a nature it comes to them as a kind of as if it's like revelation as if as if it's prophetic that there is a there's a way of being that is particular to who you are as a human being and i think that one of the reasons why that's so revolutionary for for those who have been seated and brought up in secular culture so it's all they know it's all they know they don't they don't have a reference point is it's liberating because if it's true and it is true that we do have a nature that we are made in a particular kind of way then the whole life project shifts from one of self-creation where we are not only like a a a stone carver who gets to create our own life but we are the stone itself we're the quarry we're the hammer we're the chisel we're absolutely everything's we're not working with something we are everything that we work with at the same time which is even at the most superficial level impossible to to do well because you have no reference points whatsoever you're operating a vacuum it's at best exhausting at worst tragic and catastrophic so to hear that we actually have a nature and the life project shifts from acting in accordance with a a general pattern of being that is ultimately good resets their horizon of what is possible then on top of that if you can build into that that notion of creation this sacramentality and this this incarnational understanding of god being present in bodies in matter in stuff well then there you go you've got a good religion at that point and you also have orthodox christianity yeah as well pretty much yeah pretty much and so i'm gonna i want to ask the big question you know this in the last few months jordan has really been talking a lot about psychedelics he's had quite a few experts some people even claiming you know that the original eucharist would have been hallucinogen you can feel by my tone what i think of this stuff but i wanted to know but this is a big deal like i don't want to also make people's reaction via the way people are dealing with this even in my own the own people that watch my videos this is a big thing because this is coming back into culture and jordan also seems to be if not encouraging it talking a lot about it in ways that will encourage it whether he wants to or not what do you see to be the difference or or maybe you don't but what do you see to be the difference between this vision of spirituality which is this taking of or take or having spiritual experiences seeing the sky open up you know having all these all these these types of experiences and the the spirit the christian walk like the christian transformation yeah i think one way of thinking about it would be the difference between a kind of selfish orientation versus a kind of altruistic orientation so if i take drugs what i especially hallucinogens i'm cutting myself off from reality and i'm having my own kind of private experience but in so far as i'm cut off from reality that makes it much more difficult at least when i'm cut off to really love god to really love other people and even really to love myself and the reason is that real love has to be based on reality real love is based on truth if i want to if we think of love as willing the good of the other for their sake in order for me to do that i have to know truly who this other person is and i have to know the truth about what is actually good for this person and even loving myself if i'm gonna love myself properly i have to know the truth about who i am and the truth about what would actually be good for me so insofar as i am you know on lsd or something and i'm detached from reality that obscures my ability to know the truth about myself the truth about other people and the truth about god so i think the christians thought let me just be fair for the people taking i've never taken the messages but let me be fair to the argument which is that what they say is that when you do take it it's the opposite which happens yeah that that what you encounter is more reality as you see the reality more you see a deeper reality of yourself you see a deeper reality of the world and you also see a deeper reality of others so a lot of people it's not always the case but some people like sam harris for example says that his whole spiritual journey started when he took the he took dmt i think and then all of a sudden he felt this deep love like this this like overwhelming love for his friend that he couldn't explain that was so completely taken taking him over and that when he finished his trip then he wanted more of that like he just wanted more of that so i just want to be fair to the to the to the to the psychedelic people yeah yeah no that's fair enough that's fair enough and i haven't taken lsd either so i can't comment you know one way or the other but i guess if we move off harris's insight there is something beautiful and wonderful about feeling love for other people and that's terrific but at the end of the day i'd say the christian ideal is not so much feeling and emotion but being a certain kind of person and because you're a certain kind of person you act in a certain kind of way so the christian ideal it seems to me is jesus and it ultimately is about love and love at the end of the day it seems to me in this fallen world is going to involve suffering so in a way the opposite of feeling good is going to involve in some cases feeling a great deal of suffering and again that's not the end of the story the christian story is that the suffering of jesus wasn't the end that he did suffer grievously but that you know the story continues and we have the resurrection we have that great joy and i think that my way of thinking about at least is that my the goal of my life should not be to feel a certain way or to have certain experiences but the goal of my life should be love i should try to love god i should try to love other people i should try to love myself properly and i will have deep important experiences and deep feelings if i do that i mean the more i love other people the more i care about them the more i have a feeling of love towards them so feelings are important i'm not denying that but i think that if we put feelings in the first place and chase after feelings i think that's going to get us into trouble i think the better way to move is to try to love and if we do try to love others authentically i think we will in a very natural way have very deep important and positive experiences with these people yeah i think i think you've got exactly the right point at least in my perception which is that it really is a difference between experience in a passive way and you know embodied practice in the other which is that you know the difference between receiving an experience and just kind of having it and then actually walking on a road and being transformed as you walk on this path you know and i think that that's it seems that well you can be tricked to believe one is the other because you have this elated experience of reality and you you get a sense that you pierce the veils and the mysteries that are holding the world together you think that somehow that's you you know and then when you're done you go back to your miserable little life and you don't you don't necessarily realize that when it hits the road loving your neighbor doesn't like you said mean feeling all these things about it means actually engaging with them in a certain way which which includes self-sacrifice and includes all of this and so i totally agree there even in the mystical tradition of the christian the christian church like in the orthodox tradition you have a sense in which these mystics they have these crazy spiritual experiences like in you know all these very similar to the ones people have on on on these drugs but they tell you ignore those experiences don't don't don't they'll happen just let them go actually let them go don't don't bother with them because that's not your goal your goal is not to have these it's actually your goal is to become in the image of god your goal is to become like christ not to just have these experiences so matthew i don't know if you have some thoughts on this same subject yeah it's it's it's cheating it's cheating pure and simple i mean it's you can win it by cheating but you've still cheated and so if it's true that god exists and i think that god does exist and if it's true that jesus christ is the son of god which i believe to be true then it's the ultimate cheat i mean you're you want the resurrection without the cross and jesus is very very clear that that is not the way to go that that is the way to perdition not to salvation and i think that's not because that's just the way that god has happened to rig the system that you have to suffer in order to make it but stuff that's just the nature of of of real transformation of real individual transformation is if you're not capable of of saying yes to god of saying yes to christ in the middle of the darkness if you need to trip in order to say yes to god well then you don't love god you love yourself and and you've just now now participated in a mystical delusion of what's ultimately just an expression of of self-love so it's i mean i even have what you're saying is so so interesting because jordan had this interview with this this mushrooms guy and it was it was some guy who was saying i forget what his name is he was saying that all religion was based on mushrooms and he was interviewing this other person he was obviously someone who had done a lot of mushrooms like a lot of psychedelics and they talked about it for two hours and then finally jordan asked this person and i'm sorry if he ever watches this but he asked this person so what is it about until now they're just talking about the actual mushrooms like it's hard for me to even focus that long on something like that but then they come to saying like what is it about like what's behind all of this and the man answers something like you realize that after you've been all through this you know it like like you've gone through you realize that god doesn't exist and it's just you and i was like yeah that's it you're just waiting is the final salute and i and when i say solipsism it's not even it's really is like yeah you you need to understand what the consequences of solipsism are that it's not just i'm not just being a religious rigorous and saying it's wrong like there are actual fruits of solipsism and they look like our world today and so that's the end of this stuff is something like solipsism yeah and you think of dante's inferno right the the people that are in the deepest part of hell are frozen in ice so sort of like an image of solipsism right they're just inward just themselves no actual contact with another person that that is at least for dante the very worst ending situation right to be in the pitiful which is not for him fire but to be totally encased in ice yeah exactly you can all of dante's hell until then is about love it's about it's all about love but it's about ill-placed love and misplaced love but then when he gets to the deepest pit it's like that's when the love is gone then that's it all that's left is this these frozen lac these undynamic realities that can't you know can it can't transcend themselves into others and so it's just the the flip side of that kind of ecstasy is despair i mean and it's it's paper thin of of one side to the other because if you end up by yourself and that's all there is that's also hell absolute terror yeah and the idea that this would be used as a therapeutic to help people cope with reality it's awful it's awful i mean it's i can't i can't stress how much if anybody's watching this who's thinking about experimenting with drugs as a way of dealing with depression or anxiety please don't you will end up alone in hell matthew can you tell us what you really think i'm you're holding back and i'm just i'm unclear you know it's like it's like can you be any clearer all right all right so i think i think on that last little moment of of of passion i think we can finish this everybody i you check out the book jordan peterson god and christianity you can find it everywhere and it's also one more of the great things that word on fire is doing you know all the work they're doing with connecting to the secular world and so maybe you can finish in telling me a little bit about the reaction you've had you know from the book and then we'll finish there so so please tell me a bit about how people are reacting to it i think the reaction that i've had at least has been very positive i've had actually the opportunity to go to the vatican and gave a copy of the book to the pope he seemed very happy about it i don't know now does he know jordan peterson i'm not sure but but he seemed delighted with it but in terms of people who had actually read the book i've been very encouraged on amazon at least the last time i checked there were about 70 reviews already and the i think it was 4.8 out of 5 stars or something so that's like you know that's really good i think so i think that i've been very happy with the reaction so far i i have as well there there is speaking personally there is a kind of evangelical aspiration in this book that i i think i think it's fair to say for chris as well that we hope this book not only shows christians how how peterson i think is an ally and a true ally in a very robust ally but also also those coming from the petersonian side as it were who who may be interested in christianity because of him that there is a way there is a there is an ending to this story that illuminates the whole story and puts a foundation beneath it and and makes it a true adventure and so and so i i'm hoping that the the book has that effect with some people and it appears it might be all right well thank you for doing this thank you for your book and looking forward to seeing how people react to all this everybody check out the book thank you for your attention and we'll talk to you very soon
