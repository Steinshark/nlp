china recently released a new set of anti-monopoly guidelines with ominous applications to its tech giants alibaba's u.s traded stock took a haircut piling on top of all the recent drama surrounding the failed ipo of its ant group subsidiary i did a video about that if you want to learn about it but what about tencent the other chinese mega giant tencent has stakes in some of the world's biggest video game companies they also own the two biggest messaging apps in the world qq and wechat in this video we're going to look at 10 cents anti-competitive actions considering what's been happening to ant's group and alibaba is tencent at risk of an anti-monopoly investigation as well but first i want to talk to you a little bit about the patreon for those who have not signed up to the early access tier i want to call out that there are a few videos queued up and waiting to be released that you can watch right now i'm going to try to keep the number to be around five but at this particular recording i'm looking to have around nine it will help support the channel and pay for all this coffee that i spend at cafes when writing the videos so head on over to the patreon page and take a look i deeply appreciate anything you'd be able to sign up for thanks and on with the show the rules are in the draft phase and so have not been implemented however their goal is to address abuses in the online market namely they want to make sure that companies with a dominant market position are kept from abusing it such abuse is defined in multiple ways the first notable definition of abuse has to do with the selling or buying of goods at prices that are unfairly low that also include selling goods at below cost unless there is a justifiable reason for doing so it also forbids modifying prices in real time using algorithms this probably best applies to e-commerce companies another abuse is restricting or outright refusing to transact with certain counterparts without a justifiable reason for doing so for example making it such that if a company wants to do business with you you force them from doing business with a competitor choose one out of two so to say this particular piece is big because tencent and alibaba do just that but more later companies are also prevented from performing actions that would allow them to eliminate or restrict their competition for example trying to take over a competitor over by purchasing all of their shares or by signing contracts that effectively do the same thing these guidelines are now extended to be applicable to any company that does business in china the anti-monopoly law enforcement agency whatever it will be is granted the power to undertake actions to ameliorate the abuse of market positions and notably for the first time the anti-monopoly law is deemed to apply to variable interest entities as well i previously did a video about this interesting quirk of chinese law it allows companies to establish shell companies in the cayman islands so to evade certain chinese laws regulating share ownership of internet and tech companies again these laws remain in draft format and can change at any time whatsoever as is often the case in china but the way they are written right now they arm the party with the procedural tools to attack and dissemble the monopoly positions built up by chinese tech giants like alibaba tencent and others in 10 cents q3 2020 earnings call in november 2020 company management downplayed the potential effect that the law would have on company revenues management seem to have a two-pronged response to analysts the first prong is to promote the company's support of open platforms president martin lau said in regards to the new paper fourthly i would like to reflect on 10 cents business and strategy and philosophy i would say it actually fits very well with the spirit of the regulatory framework as you can see our platforms are open in nature we work with a lot of partners we focus on providing great products and user value rather than very calculated business operations as well as monetization shortly thereafter the company points to the nature of its business model as a reason not to worry nodding to the fact that the company's revenues are majority derived from games lao says i can't comment fully right now but it looks like right from the paper that's it's more related to transaction platforms so for games which are essentially individual products rather than platforms i think they're less of the focus this is technically true 10 cent when you look at it from a revenue basis is a gaming company many gamers are very cognizant of this but not mentioning wechat as being a critical part of tencent would be a grave error wechat not its games is the monopoly that tencent controls it's hard to do anything in china without wechat wechat is your connection to any friend who lives behind the great firewall it provides news it helps you easily pay for things like fast food taxis traffic fines and more previously i have an email newsletter about wechat's rise to power then in it i did not much mention tencent's other messaging product qq when the internet first came to china in 1996 the best way for people to message each other was using the texting protocol icq icq let people open up private chats one-on-one or amongst groups mahwatang and his team at tencent released an icq client in 1998 that appealed to local sentiments this desktop messaging client joined a crowded field that includes microsoft's msn but distinguished itself due to the use of value-added items like stickers and helpful features like the ability to stop and start file downloads qq moved from the desktop to the initial generation of pre-iphone mobile phones by partnering with mobile monopoly china mobile qq achieved dominance in the mobile im market the tense relationship with china mobile would continue for many years as the telecom resented being a dumb pipe for qq services in the asian amateur email newsletter about wechat i credited the mobile apps growth to its many innovative features yeah sure cute things like the message and the bottle capability definitely helped grow wechat's market share but looking back on it now i think what mattered more was how tencent ruthlessly brought its existing base of qqim users over to wechat this cross-promotion and lock-in is a common tech monopoly tactic alibaba used its existing dominance in e-commerce to create an equally dominant position in payments with alipay facebook turbocharged instagrams rise with its own facebook user base the thing is that depending on how you look on it this particular piece of behavior is probably illegal to do per the newly released anti-monopoly guidelines not that the state is going to cut down wechat anytime soon but they certainly will arrest growth of future products tencent might try to cross-pollinate in the future like its games perhaps if you feel like american tech companies abuse their monopoly power then you're probably not ready for what the chinese do to each other wechat is well known for its state-sponsored censorship but they also have their own form of private censorship if you compete with tencent or are even not allied with them then it is highly likely that your links won't load on wechat for example on february 2021 an app owned by tech giant bike dance sued wechat and tencen from monopolistic behavior bike dance is one of the few large tech companies that came to prominence without allying with either of alibaba or tencent they are a 150 billion tech company of their own this 2021 lawsuit is because we chat restricted links associated with the app from being shared on its messages it comes on the back of a similar 2018 lawsuit regarding the same practice that particular lawsuit seemed to have failed to make ground chinese users seem to be used to dealing with workarounds to these blocks if you want to share a link to a taobao item to a friend on wechat you cannot send them the actual link you got to send them a search term so that they can go to taobao and search for it themselves the taobao share message literally directs you to do this it's wild i talked a bit about the great firewall of china in a previous video and how it enables chinese tech companies to perform these anti-competitive acts what if google prevented gmail from sending emails with amazon links in them or facebook messenger or whatsapp stopped delivering any links by google there would be an internet uprising in 2011 an anti-virus software maker named chihu360 sued 10 cent before the higher people's court of the guangdong province for anti-monopolistic practices a year earlier the two companies had gotten into a major spat first tencent started bundling its own anti-virus with qq chihu then announced that qq was accessing people's data without permission and updated their anti-virus software to block it tencent responded by making it so that  would not work on any computer with chihu installed the chinese ministry of industry and information technology had to get involved undoing both actions and making the two companies apologize to the public now chihu was suing tencent for abusing its dominance in the i am market the guan dong court said that chihu did not submit sufficient evidence of tencent owning a monopoly share in the ayam market the supreme people's court upheld the decision the court cited the possibility that chinese users can use foreign im apps rather than wechat as to why tencent does not own a monopoly for some reason i find that amusing ten years later i get the sense that the government has realized that things have changed since then the 2018 lawsuit failed but who knows about the 2021 one the first government actions have largely been for irregular pricing abuses by e-commerce companies if you recall that was one of the big items listed in the new anti-monopoly guidelines if we take the guidelines as a blueprint for the future actions that the chinese government intends to undertake over the next years then actions like those done by wechat and have previously been considered common practice are likely to be addressed in due time all right everyone take care of yourselves out there it's a crazy world if you like the videos from
