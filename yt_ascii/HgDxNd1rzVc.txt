we define maturity as as leaving home and of course that's very problematic for the millennials because many of them are still living at home and many of them know that they're not going to have a home well i'll be more careful they're not going to have a house they know that my son is going through that right now he's living with me he knows and he's like he's working full-time high school biology teacher that would used to be the kind of job that you could build home and family around and he's still living with his dad and that's hard on him this this is part of it there's a sort of a double whammy on these on these kids because first of all they're not allowed to be homesick because of the cultural thing but then they can't fulfill the cultural thing because the culture is basically giving them the finger when they try to do it and the philippines are saying oh no no no no you want to leave home not for you right and i'm worried that there's already a powder keg of resentment and then these machines are going to disenfranchise i mean economically even more people and the resentment is going to become like murderous yeah [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [music] [applause] hi this is paul and as you can see from the other four people on the screen we are going to talk today about the conference coming up in may the quest for a spiritual home that's coming up in may' to 21 in chino california chino california is about 40 miles east of los angeles chino california has its own airport the ontario airport in california and so he can fly directly there tickets are available and there's a link below but when we were talking about setting up this conference as men as you can see catherine is involved in this and catherine set up the thunder bay conference we very much wanted this to be in continuity and to continue the conversations that we began in thunder bay and we had an offline meeting where we agreed on the topic the quest for a spiritual home and so so i thought in as we move towards this conference i think i thought it would be helpful to sort of continue the conversation online which will sort of give us a little bit of a bridge to then getting to the conference so some people noted that at the thunder bay conference the the title of that conference was consciousness and conscience and some people noted that we talked a lot more about consciousness than we talked about conscience and so some people have suggested this will probably have a sort of fill out the card that we left unfinished in thunder bay so those of you who might not know who all is in this circle jonathan pajot is obviously here john vervaki as well catherine was our moderator in thunder bay and she will also moderate at in chino and john vindonk who has worked with me a lot with the estuary program is is located in chino and it's his it's his church that is giving us the facility to host the conference and john is setting this up and i thought john would be an important voice because in a lot of ways a lot of john's whole life story has been a quest for a spiritual home and and i would you know don't want to speak for john but john and i've spoken about this a lot that in in a lot of ways john is still sort of a a restless wanderer in his quest for a spiritual home taking some time on the camino pilgrimage in europe and he'll he'll share a bunch of different things as things progress i thought maybe we would begin with jonathan and john because i think both of them have been doing a lot of work that i think is is very much in continuity with the idea of a quest for a spiritual home john of course has his after socrates series which has been coming out on his channel jonathan as been involved in the exodus series on daily wire with jordan peterson the kinds of conversations he usually does and also a lot of travel so maybe a way to get into this john and jonathan would be for you two to sort of give us a little update on what you've been doing and how that begins to prompt your thoughts on this idea of a quest for a spiritual home and what we'll be talking about in chino either of you can go first i can go first and so i mean i think that the idea of searching for a spiritual home is something which is it's a it's endemic to the situation of being a postmodern person of living you know in the suburbs of growing up deracinated i myself there are some advantages in some ways to being kind of a wanderer i grew up in several cities my parents moved a lot when i was young my i know i lived in the canada and the us and and then i lived in africa as an adult and so in some ways i am an outsider just generally there's an advantage to that because you can also be a translator when you're an outsider you can kind of and paul you you've noticed that in the what i'm doing is that in some ways i talk about the symbolic world but i'm always bridging between the two i keep moving between the world of the kind of scientific material this world that i criticize but i moved from that and i try to point people into a more embodied experience but it means that i also have the same issue that everybody has right i have the same issue that most that i even i criticize about the modern world which is you know i have the difficulty of being a feeling fully part of something and to be you know kind of fully integrated into into a spiritual home and so you know becoming orthodox for example was in some ways part of searching for that but in order to become orthodox you almost also have to deracinate yourself and you you also have to be able to be willing to experience the strange and to and to kind of be able to you know tame a new world and and and and reintegrate a world that isn't obvious and isn't easy and so the one thing i can say about finding a spiritual home is that as contemporary people we have to be deliberate about it we can't it doesn't just happen you know like some maybe some 16th century village where you go to church you have the parish you've got your the priest there who's been there forever and you everybody goes to confession and everybody participates and you know what the celebrations are and you know and christmas we have this local tradition or whatever all these things are pretty much gone for us and so we have to be deliberate about it and so for for me in some ways it's difficult and it's and it's very it's hard not to still have alienation but it also makes whatever connection that i have very precious and i you know i i i i grab onto it and i and i feel like it's transformative and so i went to mount athos as some of you know in the past few weeks and you know that was a mix of those two things where i'm in mount athos everybody you know i'm in church with people who are singing in greek for three hours and in some ways you just feel this weird surreal experience of not knowing what's going on and not kind of knowing but at the same time i i was able to feel connected to to the orthodox tradition in ways that i'd never experienced before and so i come back very much re-enlive and did my own practice in my own prayer life in my own faith so yeah so i don't know where i'm going but i would say that's where i am that's what you asked where are you so that's kind of where i am in that in that respect so i am reflecting a lot on the quest for a spiritual home of all of three of the key elements quest spirit and home so around home i'm doing something that might catch you totally by surprise i'm doing the cognitive science of home what goes on there what is this sense of belongingness what's why is it how does it link up to issues of orientation navigation and so i'm thinking about that and making use of also looking at some indigenous cultures who feel at home in the world without having housing and that may help to bridge to what jonathan was talking about what is it like to be definitely they definitely have home they definitely have home without house and that's very interesting because we seem to have the reverse we seem to have houses with our homes and by comparing and contrasting that can we bring out what it is home is doing for us and there's there's you know i'm sort of building towards a proposal that and this is built on something jonathan said at the conference about he was talking about like meals and how they sort of level up i'm trying to take how does how do we exact up and that's part of perhaps the spirituality how do we exact up what you might call physical home into spiritual home and what does this what's it what's spiritual about that spiritual home and this has sort of two things one is a broader i've been making a broader argument i did it at when i was at ralston and i've done it really i've released that talk just yesterday the talk i gave at the conciliency conference about leveling up and about how the possibility of a deep or a strong kind of transcendence which is not just psychological improvement but the psyche is transcending and aspect levels of reality are being reliably disclosed and arguing for that and i'm trying to mesh that understanding and again influenced by jonathan the idea of faith as this sense of being able to level up if i could put it that way and so i'm working on that and then what has been really consuming me for the last two weeks i'm preparing a video essay for the end of the week at which this recording is happening on the scientific the philosophical and the spiritual significance of the gpt machines and what do they mean for us oh my goodness about all those and what and how that might intersect with our sense of being at home cosmically because i one of my things i'm going to argue for i'm not going to argue for it right now i think there's a deep connection though between cosmic at home fitness and spiritual being spiritually at home and part of the quest is how to weave those together and how to exact physical home into that so that's sort of where i'm at and what i'm wrestling with and it's and i i got to spend eight hours yesterday walking and talking first with just jordan hall and then with jordan hall and christopher master pietro around to this and i've been working on this as a specifically what does what does it mean for us now that these machines are emerging and and trying to cut through there's a lot of  on both sides about these machines that have to be cut through very carefully and then we're gonna face i think some reliable decision points and i think those decision points are really going to be bound to the normativity of home do we want to do we want to still have a home in the universe there's a question we we really i know that sounds like bizarre that we should even ask that question but we i'm gonna argue it let me get to chino we are facing that question so the quest is very much a quest it's not just the questioning question you know the questing and the questioning it's also the facing facing peril and really important ways and so that's where i'm at right now okay john catherine you guys want to throw anything in there well i i have given a little bit of thought to what i might bring to the table as a participant in this conversation i i i'm somewhat self-conscious in part because paul keeps referring to me as the old man i'm somewhat conscious of my age and i i would like to think of myself as representing the boomers and perhaps make some attempt to redeem the boomers but the the other thing that that my life experience has pointed out is that there is no such thing as a linear trajectory in the long view there's a lot of ups and downs and two steps forward and one step backward and three steps forward and two steps backwards and and so there's that feature yes i have some experience with a quest in the sense that i actually walked the camino de santiago which is a traditional pilgrimage which was originally thought of in the olden days as a as a very much a a quest to achieve a spiritual end and and and and reach a spiritual destination but it was also clear that for the camino at least the the focus was as much on your daily place to sleep as it was the final destination so there is a there is a sense in which some of our focus on the quest for a spiritual home cannot be the final destination but all the stops in between and so that's one thing that i would like to focus on a little bit i would also like to contribute in some fashion i don't and i don't really know where or how these things will all come up in in our conversation but the fact that i've had a bit of a aha moment kind of a time in my life when something became particularly clear and and i'm kind of intrigued by what jonathan said earlier about how how this stuff doesn't happen automatically you have to almost position yourself even for an aha moment for a particular revelation so i have a couple of stories that pertain to that i would like to have the opportunity along the way to perhaps say something on a more procedural knowledge kind of line about how estuary works and that's of course something that i have been busy with for for for several years now together with paul to try and and figure out how to make that happen on the ground and what are the mechanics that actually make that come alive and make it work so there is some procedural things that i would like to bring to the table there are some things that i would like to say about my relationship to my rather conservative church and how it becomes in some fashion an anchor for my mental meanderings my myopic mental meandering and that it provides me with a sort of a reference point from which to judge whether i'm still in touch with reality and and what does it take and how did that church you know obtain the right in my life to to be that anchor and and that is actually a story all by itself and so yeah that's probably some of the stuff that i've been thinking about some of which may be meaningful in our conversation if it doesn't all come up that'll be fine as well okay catherine i have a few thoughts i think at the forefront of my mind i just think about the feedback we got from the first conference and how helpful people found it i was talking to somebody about a month ago who watched through the series online and she said that the the word that described it most for her was luxurious she found it to be emotionally and spiritually luxurious to just listen without feeling like behind every point there was this pressure to go out and now there's the 10 things you have to do like here's a thought and now go forth and change the world and be a new person but there was just room to really talk and really unpack and really work through and see people processing in real time so i think at the front of my concern is the hope that we can continue that pattern to continue the really privilege of being able to take time to really unpack things thoughtfully and do it together so that's my first thought is i hope that that pattern can continue my second thought is in line with what you were saying at first paul that my thought in the initial conference was it would be nice to see how each of you consider consciousness differently and then to see how that might lay itself out in a moral ethical pattern so since this is what consciousness is therefore what would your conscience lead you to what should the ethical implications of that be and i think that lines up really nicely with this theme of a quest for a spiritual home because that's all very active it's all very much instantiated how do we do this how do we live this and again it might not land with like here's the 10 things to go do but is there a sense that we can get of the pattern of how that might feel talking about rituals and rhythms and how do we go about this in a way like john said that's a process it's not just where we land at the end of the trail but the stops along the way that's the second thought and the last thing i've been thinking is since this theme came up i've mostly been looking at it from the one side you know this idea that we want a spiritual home like a a structure in which we can rest spiritually but there's a flip side to that too which means that if you have a spiritual home you're going to be instantiating a spirit within it and so i think a good question is what kind of spirit do you want to be patterning within the home that you're creating because it's this double-sided thing where you will create space for your spirit and other people's spirits to rest but you also are then going to be participating in some internal pattern and so being conscious of what eternal pattern it is that we want to be instantiating i think that's the flip side of the conversation that i i hope we get around to at some point as well maybe picking up on where catherine left off thinking about what happened at thunder bay now john wasn't there but the other four of us were what what for you are you hoping for from this conference either in continuity with or perhaps a pivot from there will be playing ball for jesus there will be paintball for jesus yes and it won't be raining i i really enjoyed the conference so much and you know because there is something and we talk about home or talk about the sense of of of connection you know and i think that being in the same place together it was definitely a great added value to to for the conversations to have a different flavor to them and so i really definitely enjoyed that so i think that i'm looking forward to a continuity of that you know and i think in some ways the the theme is perfect already like just the things that that john rivaki said i've got like it's just buzzing you know i wish the conference was tomorrow so we could talk about all those things because it's just like there's there's so much comfort there's so much there's so many things to tap into and to think about so so yeah by the way i'm i'm speaking to jordan hall as well about this question soon and we're going to do it more from the principality angle of it and you know the question of of agency over us also this kind of these these patterns that act on us so so it all kind of ties in but i think that you know the i think that being in the same place will be very fruitful to to to continuing these discussions anyone else i mean i want to echo what jonathan said i'm hoping for a continuity of the like the spirit of that previous conference so that was just i i think luxurious is very apt that's how i experienced it and and i felt you know we all got to places we couldn't get to individually and for me that's the criterion of success and i i'm expecting i think i'm reasonably expecting that's going to happen again so i'm looking forward to that i i i'm hoping that this topic does a little bit more of bridging to people who are not religiously oriented i mean we we made this isn't the criticism of the previous conference because it was a it was a learning experience right by making sure that was one of the reasons we chose this title in fact we chose it collectively all of us we work together too it was a product of distributed cognition you might say but something that would bridge very deeply between people who are religiously oriented and those who aren't religiously oriented because i do think that question is now we being able to cross that divide so that we can meaningfully and deeply work together i think is now even more pertinent than it was four weeks ago and so i think making sure that we properly tend to that bridge i think is something i would like to see given a priority at this conference i i also think one of the things that i very much appreciated about the conference was again to be in person i even though or many of you watching this the primary mode of connection you have with especially three of us is our images on flat screens and our voices coming out of speakers and you might in fact be listening to us in your home you might be listening to us in your car but the the opportunity the opportunity to knit something else together and and for me as as we we think about how we will spend the time over friday thursday friday saturday and sunday in chino to me a priority is to make a space so that more knitting together can be done not let's say oh you get a chance to do a selfie with one of the speakers but you get a chance to you get a chance to make at least i like john vindonk mentioning the camino you get at at least a chance to have a manse to to locate for a brief overnight with a group of new people and find out what that means in terms of the bonds and bridges and connections and growth that can happen in there one of the one of the aspects to this is that grim grizz tells me there are still 15 spaces available at the campground so those who would like to camp for this and truth be told i'm not going to camp because i'm speaking and it's a little hard to prep for a speech if you're if you're kind of up to your up to your neck and other people camping but part of me is you know really wishes i were camping because i know from from growing up church campouts and and camping with friends that that living together in in a way that we often only do when we camp outside is something that facilitates and prompts the kinds of connections that will will i think facilitate the quest for a spiritual home and even though of course you know you get to watch myself or jonathan or john on youtube it's the it's actually there's always churn with these these these sort of false relationships with screens you listen to jonathan for a while and you'll listen to paul i'm listening to john and then you're over here this other channels and and the this is an opportunity to build some other relationships that are can actually go deeper and in my experience it's those friendships friendship relationships which actually transform us more than you know oh i listened to paul vander clay for three years on youtube you know that's it it's the face-to-face belly to belly nose to nose stuff and this is an opportunity for that and then the the overall speeches you know both what jonathan said and what john said already and what john and catherine have already said you know that sort of teases me but i think that sort of opens up sort of the micro fishers in our in our settledness to allow new growth and transformation to take place so and i think we had a beginning of that in thunder bay and i think we'll have opportunity for more of that in in chino i i've sort of directed this so far me asking questions but i don't want to leave it in that manner i don't know if any of you have questions or challenges or or something you want to throw out to to prompt this i just told to throw out the fact that the way the three of you have in the past few years engage in conversation with one another models a certain style and a certain openness and a certain towardliness that that's very admirable and and very enjoyable and it has that sense of lingering that catherine was talking about but we would like that model to translate into an underground experience also which means that it would be pretty much ideal if it could be orchestrated that a goodly number of people that normally hang out at john's channel or at jonathan's channel would would also be represented at the conference so that there can be a little bit of a mixing of these three demographics which i'm sure are a little bit different from one another and and kind of symbolically represent you know in which the three of you symbolically represent how three different ways of looking at the world in three different ways of talking about things can actually be practiced on the ground in chino that would be my super goal and and i would be just delighted if if that could be realized which means that i would very much like john your people and jonathan your people to also come to chino in the in similar numbers to what what what is coming from from paul's channel so i agree that's great what should i be doing i mean i'm going to promote this video on my channel and promote the conference that maybe i will take that maybe i'll take okay yeah i didn't want to do it earlier because it i mean generally i found you don't want to be that far from the event or people just don't do much about it they put that they just they they i'll mentally file to do that and then nothing happens and they don't do it but i think we're close enough now i'm really happy to like promote this on all my platforms and promote and mention airline tickets airline tickets we're gonna get more expensive if you wait longer oh yeah that's true i'm actually i i was supposed to get mine yesterday but i was with jordan so i'm gonna taylor and i are trying to coordinate so we can fly in together taylor barrett and i so he was also at thunder bay so yeah i'll yeah i'll scare people too then yeah but for sure that you know john to your point van duke van dunk sorry that to your point in terms of having all these people come together i for sure at the thunder bay conference it was amazing to see the variety of people that had come you know and it was it was very interesting and then also to notice people in the group you know create bonds with each other and discuss all across all kinds of of interesting lines and so i think we'll definitely see more of that in this in this conference and then i have a question from catherine catherine when you saw the tickets being purchased was there a pattern among the people who paid for the tickets that there were just a lot of women who paid for the ticket or was there or were there actually a lot of women who showed up at the conference i find a pattern right now is that i i'm i i see the name of the person who buys the ticket and a lot of them are female names so either we're going to have a whole bunch of women and girls at this conference or else they're buying tickets for their loved ones and it's going to be a bunch of guys that are going to show up you want to speak to that catherine what do you think is going to happen sure i found that there were quite a few couples that came and so often the wife would were a girlfriend or partner would go in and you know sign up and it would all be in her name and there were quite a few single ladies as well there were quite a few women at the conference and i was pleasantly surprised because i tend to think of our corner as being a little more nerdy and a little more oriented it's that more cognitive thinky-talkie space and not as much of the hands-on but there were quite a few women at the conference and i'm really hoping a lot of them will come to this one as well because i really enjoyed meeting so many of them we had a few women sign up for paintball for jesus so be prepared guys we we didn't have any women at in paintball and thunder bay so oh really so i did i didn't remember if they were women or not yeah so interesting well it is it is interesting to me how how yeah youtube is a very male oriented space but and i've noticed with our estuary meetings too and here in sacramento more and more women have been coming and it's it's interesting to me how it's always interesting to me how they sort of reshape the conversation and the dynamics in the room and so and i did notice that at thunder bay that there were good what percentage were women at thunder bay did you do run any math catherine i didn't but off the top of my head i would have said maybe 30 yeah yeah i think that's a you know especially given the i really like what i mean this this home thing john really sparked with awakening from the meaning crisis when he talked about domicide and and john also this time when you talked about you talked about those who aren't in those who are not currently see language is harder those are not sort of currently residing in a particular religious house let's say and i you know i know people look at me and say well he's a minister so he's doing this one thing but you know as a as a minister i most of the people i actually work with are sort of religiously homeless and as you often mentioned john those those numbers of the nuns that's been one of the one of the very interesting demographic realities and and so this you know part of what i think we've seen with the ongoing rise in globalization affluence transportation is that many people they are placeless i don't know i don't know any of us in this you know jonathan mentioned he grew up in how many different places i don't know how how many places you've lived john i've lived i'm an immigrant i'm an immigrant for starters yeah the donk is an immigrant catherine she's got a very interesting story in terms of growing up all over the place with a religious family so i think you know especially seeing women in this context women are you know women are often home makers in many ways men tend to be distracted foraging doers and women are often centering and so i'm i'm really happy to see this the beginning of what i think is probably more of a demographic balancing i think probably a maturing of this conversation and community all right hope so i know for sure that a lot of the people that come in kind of meeting crisis types that come into the churches they end up being guys and then you just have these crazy lopsided churches with like like in my prayer says what's going on you know it's all these like wave of like 20 guys you know like coming in and then just a few ladies so hopefully that balance out in general will balance out in terms of you know people kind of kind of entering into these conversations well maybe this brings up i don't know if it is and not maybe i'll be able to connect it but i'm also interested in i'm interested in the the other side of this i'm interested in homesickness and how is that related to what's going on i have the book not i have not yet started reading it about at the beginning of the first half of the 20th century homesickness was considered a major thing because of the rate of immigration into north america seriously and then there was a sort of cultural shift in which being sort of economically nomadic became recommended and then homesickness was looked on as a kind of weakness and what book is this john if you'll pardon me for a sec i'll go get it sure that's you know i i lived part of another interesting little facet of this corner the first conversation i had with jonathan we dug into you know your journey in africa and you talked about the fact that i didn't know you lived in the states for a while yeah my father studied he was a he studied at denver colorado at a baptist seminary there i forget what it's called and then he i lived in wheaton my dad was wheaton grad school when when oh that's the title of the book yeah homesickness susan what's who's the author susan big matt an american history so this is not this is not an analysis like of the phenomenon like a like under unpacking its cognition or or it's phenomenology or anything like that it's an attempt though to understand why we shifted culturally from recognizing homesickness as a significant and real thing that people had to be helped with to no no no if you're homesick you're just immature you haven't grown up you failed to launch and my part of my my this is only a weak hypothesis but part of my thinking is this is a contributary factor to the meeting crisis that we right is that people are in some sense experiencing domicide homesickness but they're not allowed to articulate it that way and so they're thrashing around in other ways of trying to articulate it and so you know and of course this goes back to ancient themes of you know augustine you know we're restless until we find a home in god kind of thing but i'm particularly interested in the clash between these two normativities that seem to be both spoken about in our culture as if they go really happily together when of course they don't home and right and and family values that are nebulously useless phrase because you know the manson family had family values so i i don't know what that yeah it's it's dependent family and the type of values but there's that but then we we push a culture that emphasizes right like i said economic being an economic and those two are like and you know etterstat has made a very good argument in how the west really lost god is that it's the rise of individual people living alone is the most the thing that is most powerfully correlated with loss in belief in god take that for what you want i'm not making a theological claim it's just a straight demographic argument that when people lose extended deep homes they lose a sense of why a sense for god i'm trying to speak as neutrally as i can here yeah right and so i'm trying to also wrestle with how like we should we should recognize that these things are actually in a profound tension and they have a lot to do with people's spirituality and you know that you know this overlaps with the number of close friends people's has is reliably declining also each decade and so there's there's something here about i think a vacillating unstable framing of home in our culture that is also a significant contributor to a lot of the other things we're talking about yeah but it's interesting because when you say home and especially you presented it home in some ways as part of the orientation mechanism yes and so you know and so what happens in it even without realizing you know you have this value hierarchy which says something like you go to college and then wherever you can get a job right that's where you go you just move there and then you make a life there it's just a normal it's like a normal thing you leave your home you go to college you maybe you find your spouse there and then you find a job and then you go to that place and so that this is just a normal way of functioning shows you part of the orient the orienting mechanism itself right what it is that that's making us make decisions and then the let's say the the downwind from that is it is a general destructuring of these intermediate not just family but just intermediary structures of cohesion like you know your clubs your boy scouts or whatever all these things yeah the fellowship hold this together yeah because the economic the economic vector becomes the only thing that really matters you're making money accumulating things yeah and those things buffer us right and they're the technical part the technical aspect of the thing that we have it's the they're all kind of extensions of each other right industrialization these computers these machines these things they kind of buffer us from each other and then they also become our orientating our orienting mechanism themselves and the the the preachers is and i'm not really totally speaking as a preacher but certainly as a person from a church perspective is that if you find yourself in a church that seems like a good fit a place where you feel comfortable a place where things are said the way you think they should be said and where the programs and the projects pretty much line up with your priorities and perspectives then there is a good possibility that you may be in the wrong place in that sense yeah in the sense of of a kind of complacent because a home is not it's it's it actually it's difficult right it's like being in connection with your parents your family your siblings that have been grading you for your whole life that there's been these little things accumulating it's a difficult thing it's not easy where these online communities are easier because it's all people you know it's like i like being with john rivecky you know it i i chose him as a friend he's not he's not just someone around me that's getting on my nerves because they live in the neighborhood you know it's it's a different type of of reality well this goes to a point that i want to bring up i'll bring it up in my talk but also foreshadow it a bit here i think we shouldn't be talking about home and isolation i i want to argue that there's a home horizon access axes instead and that that is what we're trying to and we even got it a bit with the quest motif in there if if home is orientation in stenberger another not stenberger that's that's the i've got the wrong name the guy who wrote the orientation book i'll remember it but if that you know if home is your original not just temporal but like in origin like an origin point on a map right if if home is your original your origin for orientation it's but it it right it also has to be in relationship to horizon in in an important way and it's interesting that home has this i mean this was part of what ryan walsh was arguing way back when when i met him on the train and read his article right that poem is also a place where we're we're it's a symbolic machine for world view attunement and it is designed to orient us to to the horizon in some fashion and so not that john the thing that you just said fits very well with the idea of the pilgrimage where there is a destination exactly there's a destination and there is these different places where you can spend the night but the thing that is most reassuring on the camino is those little yellow conch shells that tell you that you're still on the right path and and and and they they they are noticeable from the beginning to the end and they give you an orientation of kind of where you're going but they most definitely are not a place where you can spend the night because they're just a little tiny little marker thing they're just a little marker but but they are they are as a whole they are the most reassuring thing on the camino well that's exactly it like so i'm interested in the in cultures that do not have houses and yet like some of the australian indigenous cultures like they they you know when they have the dream lines and and such and so they they found a way of of not being bound to this or that but nevertheless they have a way of orienting towards the horizon because they're all they're they're moving around a lot and i think that that's there's something to be learned from them i don't know what it is yet i'm still working on that but there's there's definitely in the i think in most religious traditions there's a weird tension between a kind of home and self alienation to a certain extent like asceticism can be understood as a type of conscious alienation and and i think jordan peterson really captures it in the ways he talks about it you know it's like on the one hand you need enough home to give you that anchoring orientate orienting mechanism you don't want too much because then you just you know you just kind of run around in circles and you you become too comfortable and so you see aesthetic practice and pilgrimage is a good example seems and you see that in in a lot of the monastic especially the early monastic authors where you know they went to the desert you know they they went out and put themselves in horrendous difficult lonely situation because they were they they could see the horizon they knew that they all also has had to de-anchor themselves in order to move towards the horizon and so i'm not saying that's what we should do in some ways now we have too much of that like we have too much de-anchoring and we don't have the the the the stable orienting mechanism but it seems for sure there always has to be a discussion between those two those two sides well i'd like to bring that up too at the conference because i want to talk about the two grace the two well i consider them the two great home myths of the west one is odysseus and the return to home and one is abraham and the going to a new home and and you know the greek and the hebrew orientations there and what does that mean because that's part of what i mean by the the home horizon polarity you're it's it's it's it's like this is abraham going away from home to a new and this is odysseus trying to get back right and we have these two great and so that's what i mean about i think when we're talking about home we're actually talking about a polarity between like something where we are grounding and then somewhere where like this is assimilation and this is accommodation or something like that yeah yeah and i think that plays out in the you know that our notions of the sacred also have that polarity in it we talk about the sacred is that which makes us most at home but then there's the numinous right that is also deeply horizontal i don't want to say horizontal because that word doesn't mean what i want it to mean but horizontal right right in a really really powerful way and so i mean this is a this is a way of saying that i think sacredness and the home horizon polarity are also deeply interpenetrating with each other in important ways and that's why we have these these and it's interesting that the west has these two myths and it's holding on to both of them in a profound in a really profound way yeah well think about think about the the craziest image is obvious i mean to me at least craziest images what's happening now like for me we're entering holy week in the orthodox tradition and so we have this image of the cross which is obviously the most alienated possible it's like everybody hates you your people the everybody everybody's betrayed you everybody hates you and then christ is on the cross with this thief and he says you know today you will be with me in paradise foreign that's home right paradise is the home of homes it's the place it's the cosmic home you could say the best way of saying it but then he says that in a moment where basically everything that he can imagine is falling apart so it's like the the paradox is captured in a crazy way in in that story well i want to pick up on that too i mean because jesus in a couple of the gospels says he doesn't have a home yeah doesn't have a home and so just have holes and birds have nests but the son of man has no place to lay his head yeah yeah and he uses son of man you know that's not insignificant to that quote yes yes i was yeah i'm gonna pick up on that but it's it's so it and and and the buddha says very similar things um and so again i'm already doing what i want to do i want to problematize this as much as we possibly can and then wrestle with it because yeah i think it is a deeply deeply problematic thing but i think it's also a deeply deeply human and deeply deeply needed thing and like i said i'm worried that we're about to face something that is going to be as if you took the invention of alphabetic literacy the printing pulse and the telegraph and release them all at the same time they won't make the same impact that these machines these new machines are going to make on us yeah and you know and that the printing press is you know the protestant reformation of religious wars it like wow it's going to be bigger so i like i i i wanna like i want to really wrestle with this really really deeply like take it to its steps and crack it open as much as you can will people leave the conference in a panic yeah no no that's not what i want i want people to leave the conference with a profound sense of discernment that will allow them to address this that's what i most want people to have i mean and i don't think that answer is going to come from me i think it's going to come from all of us and all of the people who come just like that's what came out of like that's what came out of thunder bay right it wasn't any one of us i'm really hoping that i i i i i'm sort of placing my faith in that our the spirit will be able to engender there will give us some disclosure about how to orient ourselves right now we don't know i don't know right like what is happening i mean i have my kids they're young so they're more they just it they they're they're seeping into them really fast because i got a huge had gpt to be honest i tried it for like 15 minutes got bored with it but my kids they unders they can see like what this is and they intuitively just go straight to it and and so and then every conversation now every other conversation i have is is someone telling me about that in church in anywhere i go it's that's what everybody's is is talking about and so i think john you're right like this is what there's an explosion happening before our very eyes and it's funny that i didn't i didn't link it to i was i was thinking more about the problem of you know the problem of of the relationship between technology and intelligence and and how humans fit in that but i didn't realize or i didn't think about the question of home and how in some ways it can blow us out of the okay just blow up our our parameters for what we consider to be and even like what our place is you know because i didn't because that's what it is ultimately it's like what's our place think about the irony the enlightenment was which was promethean and said no no human beings are all where history is all about in the tea loss and now the enlightenment has betrayed us because it might put us in the hands of non-humans in a powerful way the one thing that sort of tutored us about how to live with beings beyond us religion has been undermined by the modern history so we're sort of like oh right maybe we aren't ultimate and oh no what do we have as a resource for dealing with that question well stuff we've been taught for four centuries to not really believe it and i'm not advocating a return to religion because i think this is going to have an impact on religion like the printing press had on religion religions are not going to be untouched by this they're going to be profound challenged and i would argue even transformed by this but nevertheless we like this is in some sense i i hope i'm not misunderstood i hope people will also wait before they jump on this until they've seen my video essay but i think this is ultimately a religious question these machines yeah oh yeah really profound way it's about what is our place in the cosmos and is it the place we have believed it to be for quite for several centuries right i really appreciate your you're talking about it as a as a wrestling and an attempt to discern these different dynamics and it's gonna be fall on in some degree on catherine i think to find we're going to have to together find some kind of a balance between the individual presentations that will be forthcoming from each of you and then some conversations that will take place amongst yourselves but paul and i have already talked about how we definitely would like to make room for people in their own small groups and conversation groups to to be able to wrestle with these questions on the ground themselves amongst themselves and to kind of see a pattern emerging that they can do that henceforth in other words that this is not a one-of kind of thing where you know we're going to go to chino and we're going to try and solve all the world problems but rather that we you know we we not only have a sense of what are the issues but we also have a sense of how can we process the issues along the way down the road so that's going to be part of the goal i think for this conference and we have to make sure we leave enough time for that to take place i think we have to give that a priority i mean i think we have to i mean i would hope that one of the things that comes out of the conference is people have a a guiding sense of what it is to exemplify being being able to feel at home in the world in a way that is not fantasy or spiritual bypassing or all the other temptations that are going to arise for people right now so yes very much like don't tell me what you believe tell me what you practice it's got to get into where people will see realize for themselves in these groups like what can they practice that will be like the best possible way of responding to this kairos i i am i have no doubt that we're now in a kairos this is a kairos just absolutely pivotal what it could be it's not crazy to say this could be the biggest turn in history and so we are here now and we have to try and we have to try and help people as much as we responsibly and best can thank you very much john i totally agree i don't want this to just be talking about it that's it's a time for just talking about these things is passing hmm catherine you wave your hand if you want to get words in edgewise and i will i will make sure i make special words to sneak in john i really liked what you were saying about the need to complicate things first before we try to answer the questions and so two of two things were coming to mind as you guys were talking one was so the image of sort of odysseus and abraham these two versions of spiritual quests something that struck me is now you guys can correct me but it seems to me that those appear to be more masculine versions of this course but the feminine version of the quest is how do you maintain the home which is a different type of quest even though you still stay in the same plot spot usually although not always if you leave it's usually the feminine role to reinstantiate the home to rebuild the home but often the story is there's a home to come back to and usually it's some feminine element maintaining that space well you know this yes that's clearly the case penelope is she is a wise trickster you know holding off all these these suitors and and kind of actually making and unmaking the home right she's weaving and unweaving and she's kind of leaving the the home in the kind of flux in order to prevent a new seed like a new identity of taking over it's a pretty astounding imagery that's used in in ulysses who did you say john i said sarah also has a rather unique story in abraham's homecoming perhaps not exactly as admirable as penelope but it's a story just well sarah and rebecca are both under threat that's true because you know it's interesting that abraham sojourns he's got to go into egypt and so in a sense abraham commits domicide when he says oh that's my sister in order to in order and i think there is a lot of domicide that happens out of fear of self-preservation and you know one of the things as you guys were talking too there's a lot of class element in this i often reflect so i have a cousin who is just a few a few months different than myself he his family was blue collar my family was you know my father's a preacher we moved around he stayed put he's a welder so he works with his hands i'm a pastor i work with my words and my mouth and and i look at the shape of our lives in your hands and my hands i've i've lived in he's lived in the same town his whole life and you know that's that's a piece of this this too that you know people john i really john viveki i really like that that that homesick idea because you know it seems like 30 40 years ago people would brag oh i'm a citizen of the world in a in a way saying i'm i'm rootless i i get married on a pretty beach someplace i i dine with high status people over in this area and there's almost a a flagrant celebration of rootlessness and so i don't know catherine if if you wanted to continue with with your point well i actually want to jump off what you're saying because that was that leads into my second point when john was talking about the homesickness the book that came to my mind was andrew sullivan's book far from the tree i don't know if you guys have read it it's a it's a fat one but essentially it's a number of interviews where he talks with people he was a gay man he grew up in a conservative home felt very much like he was the fruit that fell far from the tree and so it's a number of stories with people who are far from the tree so he interviews criminals from families that aren't criminal geniuses people with particular disabilities particular abilities anything that exceptionalizes them and separated them from their home but what made that come to mind was because it's such a i feel like that is become more the ideal now it so in the past you had the homesickness you you missed calm you wanted to be there but now it seems like most of modern culture people are encouraged to define themselves in opposition to their home and so being far from the tree isn't experienced as a a hardship although it may actually existentially be experienced that way but we don't culturally define it that way we culturally define that as your true identity which is understood and opposition and i wonder how much that dynamic if we could explore that in and engage with that might answer some of this domicide that we have because i i just see that as sort of the inverse of the book that you're reading john yeah i was very thank you for saying that i think you said it better than i did i'm very interested in that that yeah we've got this we got this you know we got the loss of homesickness as a positive and it's now become a negative as you said and we in fact we we define maturity as people as as leaving home in an important way i i think that was very well said and of course that's very problematic for the millennials because many of them are still living at home and many of them know that they're not going to have a home well i'll be more careful they're not going to have a house they know they're not going to have a house they know that my son is going through that right now he's living with me and he knows and he's like he's working full-time high school biology teacher that would used to be the kind of job that you could build home and family around he's still living with his dad and that's hard on him i mean i try to not be here as much as possible so he can feel like it's his place i'm sorry i was very helpful for that but but like this this is part of it right we we like so there's a double there's a sort of a double whammy on these on these kids because first of all they're not allowed to be homesick because of the cultural thing but then they can't fulfill the cultural thing because the culture is basically giving them the finger when they try to do it and the philippines are saying oh no no no no you want to leave home not for you not for you right and and so yeah i mean i think i'm worried i'm worried that there's already a powder keg of resentment and then these machines are going to disenfranchise i mean economically even more people and the resentment is going to become like murderous yeah it's interesting you know we talk about transformation and and in in oh let's say wisdom oriented you know we we want transformations i i think john that really gets into your both because you transform from something but that really much more gets into the horizonal aspect too because you want to transform into something that is you want to transform actually into you've talked a lot about this in your work john you know who who you are to become there's that that's there's that second self that you talk about and but but there is a there is a necessary domicide that happens in transformation jordan peterson i think talks about that well too in terms of there's something that has to break in order for something to be reformed and jonathan your point too about every thanksgiving one of the things that goes through the culture especially sort of the the zoomer class culture those of us who are citizens of the world oh i have to go back home for thanksgiving oh i have to endure my racist uncle or my my pen pecking mother or my withholding of approval father and i mean we have all of these cultural memes around this very much a an anxiety and and even an anger in some ways with respect to home and john john viveki well you just said and then if you sort of get trapped in home now and this just just coming out of covid where for example i had three of my adult children you know back into the house for the beginning of the pandemic at least and so there's there's a lot going on in this space but here's something that i like again i i i'm trying to not give away all the secret sauce yeah yeah for the for the confidence because i mean there's another myth there's the odyssian and the abrahamic and yes catherine's right we should pay attention to the feminine side of those myths so that's a very good point but the there's plato's myth of animesis that when you get the the most the most significant anagogue is also an act of deep remembrance right and and and that your your your highest aspirational fulfillment of transformation should bring you into the deepest acceptance of your finitude and mortality right and and so i i think plato is wrestling with the tension that we're bumping up against here and he's saying it doesn't have to be like this tearing there is a way in which we can find right there's a way in which we both and this sounds like a paradox even to say it we can reach for the horizon as we are gathered very very deeply back into home and that is also something that i want to propose as something we need to is that definitely i think it's great memory is i mean we talked about memory we talked about that in our last discussion sorry it's not online yet so memory seems to be part of that question like because i think of the story of jonah and and the fish you know how god tells jonah go go here right so he's telling him to leave home and go to this other place and he he doesn't want to and then because of that he finds himself in death right he goes down but then when he's in death it's actually connecting the two together that makes it work he says i remember god i remember the holy place i remember the temple i remember you know the the this holy place which is his home spiritually and because of that then he's willing to to move it's like this idea that if you're connected in memory then you can go far because you don't lose yourself completely you you have this anchor and then you have the the capacity to see the horizon and and that reminds me of the psychological research around secure attachment right that it's the person who has actually the the child that is actually properly religio to the parent that actually is capable of exploring and when you're reading the adult attachment literature they they they they they they're very sort of critical of the dependency myth you shouldn't be dependent on anybody but they're saying no no no human beings actually explore most when they are deeply connected to somebody else that is original for them in the way i'm trying to use it and so that is also like that to me is also you know holds open the possibility that we have within us ways of being ways of becoming that can address this tension this problematization that i've also been pushing on i feel like i'm giving away too much all right so but then i have to tell you that the whole question of home is pressing on me right now because i it's it's actually past the time that i should go back with my family and help with dinner and do all that stuff the time got changed last minute and i'm like wait a minute so so i actually have to go and leave and leave all of you and and and give my last invitation to everybody who's watching this to to come join us in chino because i it's gonna be a lot of it's gonna be a lot of fun all right go ahead jonathan i'll close out after you're gone all right it's good to see everybody bye-bye all right bye-bye take care jonathan bye-bye hi jonathan no i think i think john you're giving us a you're giving us a real you're giving us some some good hors d'oeuvres in terms of what we're going to want because when you start unpacking this you begin to realize that this i mean quest as as we talked about quest is it's not just a it's not just a oh there's a destination here i have to get there yes right i'm not exactly sure of the destination either and but there's a there's a poll and a push that that are coming along and we've talked about home and i think probably as with thunder bay we won't be able to fit all of the words in one short weekend but you know the question is all the questions is also going to be well what on earth do we mean by a spiritual home yes because in this i i really like the language you gave it john in terms of it being horizonal because that's going to sort of leave an empty space for for understanding spiritual it's not just emotional although it is that but it's orienting and it's active and it's moving but it's also you know horizontal i really like that word john that's that's really helpful just want to say that solomon andrew solomon s-o-l-o-m-o-n not sullivan when i heard you say that before catherine i looked it up andrew solomon far from the tree so any any other i don't want to have too much conversation without jonathan here but i don't also don't want to truncate anything that needs to be said i'm i'm not going to say anything more that would be valuable to other human beings [laughter] i i i feel jonathan's lack very very significantly yeah yeah so any anything else any detail things so this will come out on our various different channels ticket links will be below and i'll share those with all of you to include with your on your channels as well they're still our tickets still available there still is camp sites available the only crunch is i am not 100 sure that jonathan's trip to st andrews orthodox church can accommodate many more people because i i think he's going to be addressing the group about the icons that are in the church and i'm not sure that it's easy to move around with you know more than 100 people in in that church and so i'm just thinking about the specific logistics i hope to ask them about that but that if you really want to participate in that particular feature on sunday you better get you better get your name on the list so that's all i can say about that all right anything else anyone catherine you're you're okay to travel to the united states i think so i don't think it's been lifted quite yet but i'm sure no no today today i'm good to go you signed the thing that the emergency has been officially lifted perfect catherine is about the country good well thank you all for your time and we look forward to get your tickets below we look forward to seeing many
