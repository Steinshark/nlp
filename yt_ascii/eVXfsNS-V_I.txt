this is the best-selling android phone in the world it's an even bigger deal than you think if you look at the annual smartphone sales charts basically every single year you'll see the exact same trend the entire top 10 is basically iphone iphone but then a galaxy a series what specifically the galaxy a10 series and then a little while later the galaxy a0 series and while obviously one major takeaway from this list is damn apple sells a lot of iphones in a way it's samsung's achievement that's the even more surprising one because remember apple only makes four models a year samsung makes about 50. they have a models s models m models z models so for just one of those 50 models to come in fourth place to sell 30 million units on its own is absolutely astronomical but on the face of it doesn't really make any sense samsung holds massive launch events for their flagship phones they fill up vast spaces with reporters from every corner of the globe but this galaxy a14 doesn't even have a launch event or even a trailer in the west you can only find quick summary videos on samsung's in or malaysia or thailand pages and yeah sure some of these have some pretty impressive view counts but all you have to do is to look at the comments to realize that none of this is organic reach and no one actually cares about them so why are these a series phones by far samsung's best-selling specifically basically this a10 series of them and just before we get into it we're going to start a battery test of the samsung a14 versus the iphone 14. so the first most obvious thing that makes this so popular is price this a14 is around 150 outright including delivery and that's actually a quite impressive considering what you get a 6.6 inch 1080p display the very latest android 13 50 megapixel main camera a huge 5 000 milliamp hour battery and yeah sure some nice thick borders around the outside of the screen but enough fundamentals such that when i handed this phone to my fiance and asked her how much she thought it was she said 400 and it's only when i started setting the phone up that i properly realized how they've got to this price i kid you not when i first booted it up i was assaulted by recommended apps there were three separate pages of supposedly free goodies that the phone wanted to install for me it asked my gender or my age to try and target its recommendations and even went as far as to tick yes to half of the apps by default samsung will obviously be charging all of these app companies to feature on these pages probably taking extra money for the app to be some elected by default which is great for them because it takes the pressure off needing to make money off the hardware itself and it's a pretty standard trick for cheaper phones like this but it is kind of crazy that they're allowed to just cover up very clearly sponsored apps by literally describing them as if they're essential to the user but there's one more even subtle way that samsung is able to keep this phone so cheap when you first look at this phone it very much looks like this is running samsung's one ui skin right the same skin that it's flagship galaxy s series phones are running but look a little close when you see this is not the same one ui5 that the s23 ultra uses this is one ui core 5. which is a nice way of saying we stripped out all of the nice to have features that we don't think are completely necessary and left it plain and this saves them even more money it means that every time there's a software update for example the company only has like a third of the features that they need to go through and manually tweak to all that update and also because it is so simple there's just less that can go wrong which helps to minimize the amount of time that samsung spends fixing these budget phones and regardless of how irritating all of this is it's what's allowed samsung to hit this 150 price point and naturally the more affordable the phone is the more it's going to sell but there are loads of cheap phones out there so it still doesn't fully explain why this one well design has a surprisingly big part to play see when you're choosing the design of your phone the decision is not just how do you make each device as cool looking as possible the design is also the single most important factor determining how people perceive where that model is positioned within your lineup and there's two different ways that you could go here one route is the apple route where your more affordable phones are very clearly differentiated in designed from your flagship phones i mean apple makes absolute sure that no one who's looking at the iphone 14 pro max for example is even going to consider getting the 400 iphone se they've designed them to look like incomparable experiences and that if you want the best you've got to pay for the best which is also why they only use matte finishes on their pro models it doesn't cost them more to do and they might actually sell more phones in total if they use these slick matte finishes on every one of their phones but they don't want that they want fewer people to buy their very highest end models but samsung does the opposite the entire appeal of this a series set of phones is literally this is is like the s series on budget they very closely match their cheaper phones to their more expensive phones in terms of design language they make sure they still have multiple cameras like the s series does they make sure that even the cheapest phones get a nice matte textured bag and this makes their entire lineup a very smooth sliding scale where every 30 to 50 price increment there's a new option with slightly better features and this kind of structure means that most people are going to tend to start looking somewhere around the mid-range for their phone and then just scale up or scale down from there depending on what they decide they need and more importantly for this video it makes their entry level phones like the a14 feel like the best value it's samsung effectively spending some of the brand power and the reputation that they've earned from having some really high-end phones to shift more units of their lower infants but the a14 is not actually the lowest end phone samsung makes the way this a series works is you have two numbers the first is the tier of phone we're in and the second is the generation we're on really stay away from my crocs so for example last year's phone in the same price tier as this as the galaxy a13 and a sub to the channel would be a maze balls but samsung does also have a zero tip but see no one wants to have the worst phone it's actually a very well documented phenomenon that people when it comes to anything are afraid to be the extreme option they always like to sit somewhere in the middle there's a sense of comfort that comes from knowing that there are people both above you who in this case have taken a bigger gamble by spending more money and also below you you've got the most basic feature set it means that so long as you're in between those two extremes you're cushioned from risk in a sense this is why if you ask someone to pick a number between two numbers they'll be much more likely to pick something in the middle of those two numbers as opposed to the ends this is why almost every website puts the option that they really want you to buy in the middle this is why in a row of four bathroom stalls people are twice as likely to use the two in between remember that if you want to clean a poop next time pick a letter of the alphabet a to z l if you had four bathroom stalls directly mixed to each other which one would you use the second one the point being even though it's still sitting on the lower end in the big picture i think these a12 a13 and a14 phones being just one tier above the very lowest end makes them feel like a sweet spot to most people okay so the phone is great value it looks like a more expensive phone it's positioned in that sweet spot but still 30 million units every a year it dwarves every other android phone and to do that it also needs a few other things the first being availability the vast majority of load to mid-range android phones they have quite limited availability either they'll launch in just china or they'll just launch in india or maybe a few hand-picked european countries and there is a reason for that when you branch out all across the world you start racking up major shipping costs you've got to work with all manner of local carriers you've got to add in different antenna to work with local signal bands you've got to make deals with local retailers who will then proceed to take their own cut and so because the profit margins tend to be so slim on these phones anyway it's often only worth selling them in the countries that they're being manufactured in but these a series phones they're basically everywhere samsung uses the distribution channels and the brand image that they've already built up for their premium flagship phones to get these a series prime positions in stores all across europe north america latin america middle east africa effectively the world but it's not just that they're present everywhere they're also marketed in a way that goes for the broadest possible appeal in these markets like take a look at the website listing for samsung's s23 ultra for a second it goes section by section intricately describing the thought process behind each and every feature the eco-consciousness their choice of materials and even the specific processor being used this listing is designed for someone who's interested in the technology and who wants to know more about everything that the phone is capable of but the tone is completely different here and yep some part of it is just the fact that there's naturally less to talk about with a cheap phone but look at the supposed selling points like one of them just says 6.6 inch display not refresh rate it's not which technology not resolution which given that this is a 1080p panel i'd actually say would be something to boast about for this price just the size of it 50 megapixel camera which as we know means basically nothing when it comes to the end image output and let's be very clear 50 megapixel here is very different to the 50 megapixel camera you can see on higher end phones still decent results thanks to good software processing but at this level the phone actually being capable of 50 megapixels is meaningless but they go further because their next point is just the fact fact that this has an octa-core processor as if phones literally 10 years ago didn't already have octa-core chips the entire listing here is designed for someone who either doesn't really care about their phone as much or someone who isn't as clued up which pains me to say is the vast majority of people on this planet so just the fact that you're watching this means we are in the minority now remember this is not necessarily because people don't want to know though it's just that large parts of the world are still quite tech illiterate the either haven't had access to the internet for very long a means to learn about tech or a need to learn about tech and so this kind of simple broad marketing also appeals to that kind of user this is why the only trailers for the a10 series we saw were focused on developing on newly industrialized countries that have only recently started increasing in income and tech proliferation samsung does also sell the a14 here in the uk too but notice how they haven't released the a14 trailer here because they know in the uk people on average have higher income and higher tech literacy and so they would much rather that we buy the flagship s series but there's another thing you have to do if you want to become the most broadly appealing you have to exclude as few people as possible you've got to make a phone that can fit into as many different kinds of lifestyles as possible and this does that it's got a micro sd card slot so anyone who wants more storage can add it for cheap it's got a headphone jack so assuming you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on expensive wireless earphones you can still listen to music using the earphones you already have this thing has insane battery life like genuinely longer than almost any flagship phone which means that for people doing non-office more manual jobs with less access to power throughout the day you have the assurance that it's not going to run out and i guess to prove that point i've been running a continuous benchmark on both of these phones for the last couple of hours and while you can obviously see that the maximum amount of power of the iphone 14 is leagues ahead of this phone the battery difference is just as vast like for example this iphone here is on 57 percent samsung's on 80. but there's one more even subtle way that samsung is able to keep this phone so cheap notice this is the opposite of what companies do with their top end phones companies know full well that if you're going to buy a flagship that you've got even more spare money so let's remove the headphone jack and sell you on earphones let's remove expandable storage and sell you a storage upgrade for 200 oh let's add in wireless charging so you can buy our wireless charger flagships purposefully eliminates the majority of the market to make more from the 10 of people who have a lot for example if you decide to buy a case for the a14 you have far fewer options than the s23 ultra because samsung no people who spend 150 on their phone aren't going to be spending a lot of fun accessorizing it but then more shockingly the options they do have are actually cheaper than the same cases for the more expensive phones why would that be does this case cost any less to make than this case not really or like on samsung's own side for this phone you can buy a screen protector but for the flagship you can only buy them in packs of two it's them knowing that you bought a flagship and therefore knowing what that means about your willingness to spend and so yeah here at 150 ironically you actually need to spend less on extras to make this work there is also one catch with these cheaper phones in general an invisible caveat that does result in more of these units being sold budget phones aren't designed with longevity in mind so you know how for flagships the average person is upgrading about once every three years well i was talking to a couple of people from xiaomi's india team not too long ago and they were saying that only recently the smartphone upgrade cycle at this price point managed to reach once every six months they said that the real tech enthusiasts in any family would buy the latest xiaomi phone and then when the next xiaomi release happened they would buy that one and just hand down the existing phone that they've been using to another family member this is why companies catering to these price points they often release both a phone and then the upgrade to that phone within the same year this would never happen in the us market and what this turnaround also means is you get less software support and it's not just that you get the less feature rich less optimized one ui core software but also samsung's kind of built quite a strong reputation for their guarantee of four years of upgrades on their phones right yep well that doesn't actually apply to this you only get two here and this is the icing on the cake to keeping those sales figures high and because there's less price friction in the lower end of the market because you've invested less on your existing phone and you'll be spending less to upgrade to the next one it feels like less of a loss to keep on upgrading and this is footage from the most popular android smartphone in the world now one stat that's really surprised me recently even more so than the ridiculous number of units this thing sells is how much data breaches are going up every year you essentially get data brokers who make their entire living out of collating often stolen data from everyone who's logged into these websites names social security numbers locations everything this date is then sold to businesses and can often fall into the hands of criminals fun fact a single jumbo data league recently managed to divulge 1.2 billion of people's records the good news is you have a right to privacy the bad news is it would take you years to delete all your data manually this is why incognit exists it reaches out to data brokers on your behalf requests your personal data removal using your human rights as the grounds and even deals with objections from their end should they arise and it does this continually because even when your data gets removed it can still appear in follow-up leaks and needs to be kept on top of so i've literally had my data in the hands of 67 of these data brokers you can see who has your data how sensitive the data is and you can see in real time in cognitive wiggling through this list and resolving each problem one at a time oh and we have a pretty cool code if you use mr who's the boss at checkout you don't get like a 10 or 20 discount you get a 60 discount and you also get a 30-day money-back guarantee
