so we started a production company called tread lively productions and our first film is coming out september 28th in theaters and it's called the blind and it's interesting that we've had so much of a conversation about willie's dad phil because that is really what this movie is about is is phil and k story and you know we've talked a lot about kind of the success of it and you know what happened after but this is the story before we chose to go back and tell the hard days you know the hard parts of the story because i think you know think people can discount themselves and thinks oh i'm out because i didn't do this or i didn't do this right but instead god uses the people who are weak but that that surrender their lives to [music] him hello everyone watching and listening today i'm speaking with authors entrepreneurs and the stars of duck dynasty willie and corey robertson we discussed faith and family values as they were presented in the show and how they were preserved behind the scenes we also explore the balance between reality and fiction structure and playful spontaneity that was captured on duck dynasty and the true positive impact the show had on viewers as well as the general culture of the united states and abroad during and since its phenomenal 11 season run so why do you think that what you did struck a cord with people so deeply and one that was able to be maintained well i think there's probably a couple of reasons for that i think people saw parts of their family and our family and so i think it resonated especially across generations just had a lot of people say wow my dad's similar to your dad or my mom's just like your mom or we've got a crazy uncle and so i think that was one of them i think it was funny and so i think people like to laugh and have fun and also think the faith aspect was a big part of it with the the prayer at the end it wasn't overtly religious but it was it was wholesome i guess so what role do you think the faith played i think it played a really big role i think that you know we are we ended every episode around the dinner table and we set a prayer and we really didn't have any grand scheme for that we just did it because it's kind of what our family does and so we set a prayer and that just had such an impact on people i feel like that's the most common thing people commented on whenever as we've like traveled the world and seeing that's the most thing people commented on it was just this one is just sitting around the table and being grateful for what's before you you know it was just this idea that you know we would submit to to god and give gratefulness give thankfulness to him before we have a meal and i think it also willie mentioned that nostalgia i think there was this kind of like oh back to something that we've lost as a country as a people and whenever we did the show i think that you know the network the executives thought that you know we were going to look at be this like louisiana family that's so different and unique and that we hunt for a living and we eat squirrels and all this and that people would maybe look at us and be like oh they're so different and and outside of the norm or whatever but instead people actually looked at us and were like oh that's like my family or that's like my family used to be or or that is something that i long for in our family is to be able to kind of come together at the end of the day around a around the dinner table well particularly like i think in the aspect when you say that's where we used to be if you're sitting around a table where we ended every episode i think people would see that going wow we never sit together and eat you know we're always running and gunning and grabbing fast food and so i think they saw them were like wow maybe we did that at a holiday or growing up and so that was one of the parts where i felt like they were like oh maybe they didn't say a prayer or maybe they used to or maybe they heard about it so so i think they kind of really enjoyed that kind of like ah we like even if they don't do it they could they so some of them did and said hey we've changed our whole structure now we sit down and we eat together and so but they could kind of see that and so i do think it was kind of a throwback you know it was really interesting to to me because i think we we made this it was a funny show it was like a sitcom you know it was a funny show about our family but it impacted people in really powerful ways people would you know come up in tears saying like like now my family eats dinner together because of your show or my husband goes to church now because he saw real men that just love god and can be normal people you know and things like or i watched it with my dad who had cancer and it just brought us joy and laughter and positivity and hope in a time that was like a darkest time of our life hi everybody i've invited douglas murray and bjorn lomberg and jonathan paso who are three of the most admirable and deepest thinkers i know to join me on stage to talk about a vision of the future that isn't based on apocalyptic fear mongering and the desire to acrew power that's a consequence of utilizing that fear we've sold out the seats that we arranged to have opened already and now we've opened up more seats and maybe we can fill the entire place which would be quite the remarkable occurrence anyways that is on november 1 first if you want to come to the o2 and hear our discussion do so get your tickets i remember i read a couple of years ago i think that 30% of people in the uk 30% of households now have no dining room table so people don't eat together and as a psychologist it's very interesting to me to consider the role of the table in the union of families and in the the socialization of children i mean first of all people human beings do something very strange at a table and it's so normal in some ways that no one notices it but human beings are really the only animals that formally share food it's a very strange thing to do i mean even if you have a dog that loves you he's generally not that happy if you try to take his bone away at his dinner dish i mean the carnivore comes back out and so the fact that people can actually share food and that they can do that even when they're hungry that is really quite the miracle and so the fact that and then it's also the case that at the dinner table let's say that's when you get to share your day you each get to talk and to listen you that's a very good place to inculcate manners into your children it's a good place for everybody to keep track of everyone else and what's going on in their day and their week and so forth and and it's a good time for everyone to come together and discuss the separate elements of their life right and in the old testament there's an immense emphasis on hospitality as the grounds of morality itself and the hospitality to a stranger but the same thing applies within your family and so within our family and so you know it's interesting you know you said that your producers were convinced that you your family in some sense would be an audity you know out of the norm and i guess one of the things they didn't consider was that not only in some ways were you guys not out of the norm but the actual norm but even more than that you represented a kind of nostalgic ideal and obviously that was centered at least in part around the dinner table and around prayer and then you said also that it gave you a chance like the meal time prayer it gave you a chance to be grateful and that that really struck me as interesting too because one of the things that people don't really understand about prayer they think about it as a kind of a wish let's say is that it's actually a practice and you can practice being grateful and the reason you should practice being grateful is first of all then you notice what you have to be grateful about and if your foot isn't caught in a bear trap while you're dying of cancer you have plenty to be grateful for and so practicing that makes you much more aware of it but is also a really good way of staving off resentment and so it's striking to me that how much impact the fact that you guys sat around the table and all talked together and that you started that off with a let's say a prayer of gratitude it's really striking to me how much of an effect that had on your audience and the fact that also people used that as a model what what did you conclude from that it must have been surprising to you right to have that to have that have that impact it really was because to us it just seemed like a small part of life that that we've done thousands of times so i didn't really i guess i thought most people would would be like oh they're saying a prayer and that's that's what we all do and so i was what was striking to me is that a lot of people didn't do that and so or or like i said they used to do that or they didn't do that and i was like wow that's and it had this big impact on them you know it was like that's really helped our family and i was like wow that's you know what seemed like just a small thing but that but the dinner table was a big part to us even growing up that was a big part of of of the you know just our whole family it's where we you know it's kind of it was almost like a big tv show now that maybe that like you would all around that to us that was dinner one because we were hungry and i'm not sure dr peters said we me and my brothers were a little more animalistic i don't know that we'd like to share food so we were more like canines like trying to i remember when cory and i started dating she was like i've never seen anyone eat as fast as you and it was because i was like you better get it quickly because it'll be gone and so she was like you can slow down we can just eat and enjoy this they had four boys and not a lot of money growing up and they ate you know they ate all the home-cooked meals because they lived on the river and he said whenever they would order pizza which was like a a treat to get pizza they would lick the pieces so well i'm telling on you they would lick the pieces so they you you had to have one you could only have one hand on one piece while you were eating so that was it and we would just lick a little something cuz something about licking the food made no one else want to eat it at all so that was a it was some kind of animalistic thing yeah that we figured out yeah i i remember i invited one of my friends over from he was from a backwoods town up in northern alberta called crooked creek man and it was it was quite the place it had been scraped out of the prairie just about 40 years previously and there were feuds going on in that back country and he'd grown up in kind of a competitive eating environment as well and i invited him over for thanksgiving dinner once we moved out east and i invited him over in to montreal and the poor guy he filled up a pretty major thanksgiving plate because we had quite a feast and i think he was completely done eating before everyone else had even filled their plates and i i'd often seen him polish off a hot dog in two bites and he was in the same unfortunate circumstances as you were surrounded by brothers who were going to devour everything ravenously every chance they got so that poor guy i don't think he ever tasted anything it just went immediately from tooth to stomach without you know without enter any intermediating enjoyment so anyways hopefully things have slowed down on the eating front for you guys now you also mentioned and this is something you know that i've noticed about a couple of other shows i really like i like the simpsons i was a great fan of the simpsons their first 13 seasons were staggeringly brilliant and comedic as far as i was concerned and i also like this insane vulgar horrible brutal nasty canadian show called the trailer park boys which is like a workingclass phenomenon in canada and you know it's rough and it's funny but both those shows and they're both satirical one of the things that holds them together is that the characters in the shows have a genuine bond of familial love so homer simpson for all his flaws and he's pretty much 100% composed of flaws is someone who truly is in his bumbling way as devoted as he possibly can be to his family and in the trailer park boys these three naro well criminal types basically who the show is about and their two enemies they're bound together too by a a filial bond that's actually quite genuine and one of the things that made both those shows popular is that strange com combination of satirical humor that's and the ability of the characters in some ways to tear at each other but also to be bound inside this you know this this this this genuine what would you say structure of love and mutual regard and it i guess it's something like the optimal balance between cooperation and competition you know and the humor humor seems to to play on that proper balance as well you know and you can tolerate a lot of biting humor which is a really nice thing if you know that the people that are joking at you and proding at you do have your back and actually like you so your show seems to have that sort of element as well i i hope i've got that accurately represented i think so i think that's probably exactly right i think we there was a profound love and for each other we had our back however we we we don't we try not take ourselves very seriously and so we really we can see someone and and go after that person but like i said there's a love there and in fact we did it so much so that when we would be out in public it like people would come up to me and be angry with me and be like how dare you say that to your mom or your uncle or you know i just was like we're fine we're good like we think it's really funny and but some people would be like wow but we've i i guess the robertson we've always kind of had that we can we can we can make fun of ourselves and really go after each other and i don't know whe whether it was to prepare you know cuz you know when you're at school when you're in the world you know people are going to say all kind of nasty stuff and so we just kind of were like i don't know if we were preparing each other for that but like it's coming so well also i think we kind of got together as a family not kind of we actually did we set around the table together as a family before the show started and just kind of laid out some things and one i think yes we were surprised by the impact but also we did really pray about the impact you know we actually did come together as a family and said like we we hope that this you know brings glory to god we hope that this is a beautiful like blessing to families and to our family as well and if it's not just take it away you know we we actually kind of went into it with that intention and then also we said we want take our too seriously and you know you know how reality shows can be and there's these interviews and things like that and we just said we're not going to get offended by anything anybody says we're just going to have fun with this and let it be fun and not get offended and i don't think anybody ever did there was nothing on the show that anybody ever said to one another or about one another got offended by it we just we had fun with it but it was a unique reality show where it was shot like cory men it was shot like a sitcom so it wasn't just running gun cameras like it was it was it was like a sit gum like i would enter the office and hello i'm here you know and so it really was shot like that but we were we really ourselves and so it was a strange mix of how to do it but it was it was fun because we always kind of knew like okay we we you know we got to have a beginning a middle and an end like a siton like life doesn't happen like that so it was just kind of a smash of reality with kind of playing along some and maybe i used storytelling yeah and storytelling so i call it guided reality so so so how did you manage that combination of scripting and spontaneity it seems like a very difficult thing to pull off especially i presume that before you engaged in the duck dynasty series you guys weren't actors and you didn't have a lot of experience while certainly producing like a half scre scripted family sitcom so how did you manage to keep it funny and spontaneous at the same time that you managed to impose some sort of narrative structure on it and who was responsible for that how did you do that it was just talent from god oh my humility is that the right order i really you know i mean for me it was about i'd watch shows and so what i thought was funny and like seinfeld or you know i watch shows i was like oh that's really funny how they did that and so i tried to just do that remain in myself i kind of had to stay in one spot i talked to a lady at at at a&e who was just brilliant and lily and she wasn't even from america which blew me away that she she's from argentina came here was working with american television to not even grow up here but to figure out the nuances of people from the south and how that's funny that would go across america really just blew me away but she always said like you're the boss which which i am so you have to be the boss and so i couldn't stray very very far from from that because that's what makes it funny because people get in trouble and and i would i would be like oh i want to goof off and she'd be like you have to you know you have to be the boss and so so i would come there so the really there was that dynamic that that really makes comedy kind of like when you're like when you're in school and someone says something that you're not supposed to laugh at or church and it's so fun you can't help but laugh and so it was kind of that idea and so once we kind of got that dynamic which was a real dynamic i mean i'm i was the ceo of the company but i'm i'm not the oldest and so it wasn't my father so there was some kind of strange things there the dynamics of the company because it was like dad's company but i was the boss and and that's what they walked in with it's like what do we got here okay will's running it but i'm the third from the top and as as far as siblings dad's not in charge dad's kind of doing his own thing and so once we got the dynamics and then we just we just kind of plugged it in and said y'all go you know what would happen if and we would talk about frustrations where the guys would want to fart around or they always want to go hunting they didn't want to be up there actually making the duck cs which was a common theme and then we just kind of went with that and just you know it reminds me again of this show i mentioned earlier the trailer park boys where each of the people who are involved have adopted a pretty stable character you know you know more or less what their role is and what to expect from them but then that gives them tremendous latitude to improvise and so the trailer park boys in some ways like your show is a mock documentary in principle this camera crew is following these nar wells around all the time and fair fair bit of it scripted but a fair bit of it is spontaneous and it's often extremely witty i also know that guy richie you know the british film actor who's or a director who's made a number of brilliant absolutely brilliant films you know what he does is he i've talked to him about this he's he sets up the stage and the set and he primes the actors and they know the story and then they improvise the dialogue and that's so cool because one of the things that really makes richie's movies remarkable is the brilliance and harshness of the doc of the dialogue and you know he gets his actors to play along and he really likes to work with the actors that can do that and then and then the other thing that it reminds me of is what children do when they pretend you know so children start to pretend play when they're about three years old that's when they start playing with other children in in a real manner and the way they'll do that you know is they'll they'll take a scenario that's somewhat typical like a household structure because children often play house and they'll assign rules and they'll basically lay out a script idea that everybody has to agree on and then they improvise and that's actually what the pretend play is and if the kids if it's going well and the kids are friends they can get right into it and they can do that for hours and what they're doing is simulating reality and experimenting with roles and and also trying to be funny and amuse each other and so i wonder did you have i don't know if the pretense the child pretense idea has ever occurred to you before did you ever have any sense that you said what you were doing was fun and it stayed playful did you ever have any sense that you had returned to the sorts of things that children do when they're when they're very young i love that analogy cuz i do think that's it sounds exactly like really what we did but i never thought of it that way but yeah it really that is true and i think with with with this show you had some some really strong personalities and so you had some probably you know if you were kids you'd be like you're the bad guy you know and then you're the good guy and you're the horse or whatever it would be so with this one you had some just great really strong defining character so so like yeah had my father who was like the patriarch but really strong but not just you know he's not goofy dad like this guy's like really strong and really opinionated and then his brother mos sai i don't need a knife i don't need a sensor direction i don't even need clothes funny and just the most one of the most unusual guys i've ever seen like as far as and the quickness he has and how he tells stories is just epic and so you had him that you just never know you could almost play off him like he could kind of just do whatever he did so it was like he would do that dad would do that and then i would go like oh this is perfect you know i'm just going to come off this and you know if dad's really overplaying it you know i'd be like you know dad that that's we can't do you know so i could just kind of play off of where they went or unle s but uncle sai you could like like i would feed him a line like say you know especially with pop culture that wouldn't make sense that he would know that and he was so brilliant he could just take what he would hear and then he would throw it in there like he thought of it you know he would he would say like a i remember went to like a beyonce s i said sa sa say if you love it you better put a ring on it and and so sa would be talking and be like hey jack if you love it you better put a ring on it it would just come in there and and then the editing would stop it's like did he just say that and it was so brilliant and then if he screwed it up it was even funnier one time i gave him a song called uh this is how we do it by montel williams so then s goes hey this is the way that that we do it which was totally incorrect but it was so funny because then the audience like he tried to do it but he didn't do it but it but we really thought you know he just came up with that or whatever and you know i think i was talking to uh bill clinton one time and and and bill clinton like pulls me in you know and i understood why these guys can become president because he like he puts his hand on my shoulder and and he he said i love duck dynasty and for whatever reason i said you don't watch duck dynasty i don't know why i i don't why i took that aggressive like opposite approach to him and he looks at me and he goes you want to know why that show worked and i was like yeah i would love to know why bill clinton thought this show worked and the answer he gave was not just the best political answer ever cuz he covered every deal he said cuz it was real and he's looking at me he said it's real and i was thinking to myself and i and i went and he went but if it wasn't real we thought it was real and and so i was like there you go so he really he was like that's why we bought into it and and if it wasn't you fooled us but we got it so well also i think that as we were doing this and playing these roles we were also having to play ourselves so we were like oh i have to walk around as corey so i have to it has to represent who i am so that first season there was a lot of kind of fighting through okay what pieces of this is storytelling and is is pushing the story along and what pieces of it are us and who we are and so i do think that was a a fine line to try to find and you know early seasons i remember one specific scene there was a there's a scene where willie and the guys were supposed to come to the kids school instead of doing that they they skipped out and went golfing and so they come in for that evening and we're with phill and kay willie's parents and my sister-in-law and i are sitting there and and in the scene the plan was for us to just kind of let our guys have it you know because they had skipped out on what they were supposed to do they're coming in and it just we couldn't do it because we're like we would never let our husbands have it in front of their parents like we just wouldn't do that and they wouldn't do that to us like they wouldn't you know but they came in in front of our parents they wouldn't just lay into us you know and so you know the as as it plays out the directors are like come on just let them have it aren't you mad that they you know skipped out and and i was just like we just we wouldn't have this conversation right here we can't do this you know this is i'm this is who i am and i can't do it and so we u we ended up just kind of like scrapping that scene and we they said well what would you they caught y with some dirty y just gave us we some dirty looks yeah they said what they edited a bunch of dirty looks so they were like what would you do and they said well we'd have this conversation that night in our own home you know and so we come that night that evening and we filmed a whole another scene in our kitchen where willie walks in and i kind of tell him a little bit what i thought about it and there was a lot of discussion back and forth with the producers you know as we were making it because you've got to be open you know you can't just say this is it so you got to be open because even back to the beginning of the show where corey said i she said i think your family should do a reality tv show and i was like we're just normal people like i didn't see it at all and and cory's like willie y'all aren't normal like the y cuz she because i knew i appreciate that cuz she married into this family i like y'all aren't normal so i was like so you got to have an open ear to going okay some other people can see this differently than what you can see yourself and so you had to be open to producers but i think where the dynamic got a little strange was that their idea of family or or their idea of what family is was was really different than ours and so that's i think sometimes they have more of that stereotypical the dad's a goofball he's just you know all he wants to do is watch football drink a beer you know are rolling their mom's the smartest one kids are like on their phones like we hate this you know and so we we we broke that because of and we wanted to we were like we're not all families are like that you know there there's respect and there's you know like my children would would not roll their eyes at me and say whatever dad you know we hate this and you know so and and dad has a brain and he can think outside of you know whatever the those things are so sometimes that there was the you had to be open i think to listen and and be like oh that's really funny but also not just go down the path that i think a lot of sitcoms i mean honestly so many of them are just the same you know and so and so i think that's the mold that we really broke out of because before that reality tv was it was all about the fight it was all about like the train wreck what can you like the the big scenes are the ones where the tables are flipped and everyone's fighting and everyone's arguing where for us the big scenes where the family is around the table and and and there's that like willie mentioned we mentioned twice i think respect you know that respect for one another and for the kids and their parents and kids and their grandkids and there was another scene where phil who was the granddad you know was was having our the grandkids clean a football field a clear a field and they just expected that the kids would be arguing complaining upset about it you know we didn't want to do it but instead our kids were of course you know their pepa ask them to clean a field they'll clean a field and so it was just this like this this dynamic that we had to kind of work through early seasons to say like oh no that's that's just not who we are and not what we do so there was a part of it that was playful but then a part of it that was also us kind of saying no this is who we are this is what our family is about and it's going to look different than maybe what you expected or what's out there on television right now okay so there's a couple a bunch of things there that you guys drew out so you have the clinton comment you know that duck dynasty was popular because it was real or because we thought it was real and you said well that's real interesting on the political side because i suppose you could say the same thing about clinton and about many politicians but there's also a really interesting grain of truth there that also pertains to play hey so you know you said and insisted that you guys had your characters and your characters actually reflected your actual personalities and that one of the decisions you made was to stay in character and so that means that when you were fictionalizing your life and it wasn't real it was still real because you weren't willing to play out roles that actually weren't reflective of your character and i would say that actually characterizes appropriate pretend play with children too because if two little kids are playing house and they can do that very very seriously if there's any falseness in the game it's no longer a good analog of reality and the kids will get bored with it right away if the if any of the players start to step out out of character and break the implicit rules of the game it's no longer fun and it's because they're not simulating reality properly and so while you guys are playing and elaborating on your characters even if that's scripted if you're staying in character it's not false it's actually reflective of a deeper truth and then another thing you pointed out that's absolutely fascinating i think is that you know you said for example that it's typical in a sitcom and you see this in advertisements and this has really been true i think since the mid-60s that increasingly male characters in sitcoms especially fathers are presented as bumbling buffoons right they're presented as the sort of people that children can roll their eyes at now you know there's a very detailed research a body of research laying out predictors of divorce among couples in psycho theapy so maybe you come for marital counseling if one or the other partner or both rolls their off eyes during the sessions which is a sign of contempt there's a 95% possibility probability that that couple will be divorced in the next year like contempt is a very very bad emotion and the the idea that kids can roll their eyes at their stupid father that's a really really bad idea and and it reminded me of something today i was writing i'm writing this book called we who wrestle with god and i was writing about noah the story of noah today you know and there's a scene after the ark comes to rest after the flood noah plants a vineyard and i guess you know he's had kind of a rough time so he plants a vineyard and he brews up some wine and he gets pretty rip roaring drunk and one of his sons come in comes into his tent and noah is there passed out and he's naked and instead of covering him up and shutting the hell up about it this son called ham goes and tells his brother that you know dad's made a fool of himself and sort of gets them to come in hypothetically to poke fun at him and instead the other brothers come in with their backs turned and cover them up and then so the story goes the descendants of ham become the slaves the servants and the slaves of the sons who covered up their father and the idea there no this is kind of far a field from what you pointed out but the idea there is that if you don't have a certain degree of respect or even reverence for your father despite his shortcomings which we all have then you're doomed to a useless life and people who are respectful will dominate over you because they'll be you know their lives will go right because they're in accordance with tradition so the fact that not only you stayed in character in your play no that reflects the kind of deeper reality that obviously people were viewing in your show but it also reflects the fact that you presented to people something like an appropriate relationship say between fathers and sons at a time when that's become increasingly rare and then the last thing i was thinking about is recently we've seen a strange phenomenon and i think you guys were probably on the forefront of this is that as our culture has become more and more obsessed with kind of an impulsive hedonism and an a religious viewpoint the shows that have a core element of faith in them have become absurdly popular and you saw this in the last couple of years in particular with the success for example of the chosen which was phenomenally successful right that long series about christ's passion and his life and then more recently with this film the sound of freedom and the both of those are very fundamentally faith-based without you know hitting you over the head with it because the story in both cases still takes precedence by far over any expressions of it of evangelizing faith but i think it also speaks to the fact and i think you guys were early to the market with this so to speak is that as the family disintegrates as there's more and more fatherless kids as the divorce rate skyrockets and the birth rate plummets all of those things are very negative people have a longing not only for family but for more traditional family say gathered around the table and for a traditional family that's based in something like faith and so well let's talk about let's talk about first about this idea of filial or paternal respect you know you you speak of your father with a certain degree of respect well an immense degree of respect you certainly don't regard him as a buffoon he started the business as far as i know that propelled you guys into the real tv domain so so what do you think about your father and the way he was portrayed in the show and why do you think that portrayal was successful and accurate actually i would have to say my father wasn't really portrayed he just was doing exactly what he was going to do so in fact he didn't understand i i still i don't he didn't understand the show i don't know that he still understands what we were trying to do with the show and so he he still was like this is the silliest thing i've ever seen so one of my favorite scenes of him was my son john luke was was dating a girl and he he was going to get dating advice from his papa phield and so they're in a boat they're on the water and my dad sits him down he said i want to explain some things to y'all garia syphilis and he just starts listing sexually transmitted diseases except this gar wow i'm like i don't think so and i'm watching cuz i wasn't in that scene so as i'm watching on tv i'm just belly laughing this is the funniest thing i've ever heard because it's the same exact speech that i heard when i was his age like 15 phil just went straight to the sexual sexually transmitted diseases he left out one and he was so upset so so i went up to him and i said dad i said that was i saw the scene with you and john luke and i said it was so funny and dad's not smiling he went will i'm not joking i said i know you weren't joking that's what made it so funny and he said i forgot about clidia i forgot yeah he was still like bothered that he forgot one that he left out so i don't know that the show portray i mean i think phil was exactly what he wanted he wanted more he told me he said i think we should have more preaching on the show and i said dad that that's there's another robertson family that has a show it's the 700 club they preach we're just let us do this and and if they want more they can come later and so but the dynamics of the show as far as when we talked about the show phil just did what he did and we just worked around it which i thought was so funny because for a lot of dads especially you know older guys where you know especially his age where they just do what they want to do they say what they want want to say and you just deal with it you know so why in the world was he willing to go along with this at all cuz it's so absurd it's so preposterous right i mean it's like your family you wouldn't have confused you guys with the kardashians and i'm not trying to you know throw out gratuitous insults to the kardashians but you wouldn't have confused your family with the kardashians and you wouldn't presume that your father was the sort of person who would decide that a reality tv show for his family was really a good thing or something he wanted to participate in so why did he why did he go along with it and what made him successful at it well i think he i mean i think there were two things i mean one part was cuz dad said i don't think people are going to watch his show you know why would they watch us and and i said well dad it there's a bigger platform i think we could because he's passionate as as as we are about sharing the gospel i said there's a bigger platform and i think you'll be able to share the gospel with with more people with this platform as opposed to around here you know like in our little and so and and phil did he was like hey if you think it'll help if you think if we can get the gospel out more then i'm willing to do it that wasn't it i mean also i was like dad i think they'll pay us money like i think we can make good money and we could and so that was part of it i mean my dad was in his mid 60s so he's like at retirement age and we didn't have a lot of money and he was like like well this could be this could be you know something to do and so in fact i will say though interestingly phil so phil was the one who started actually filming himself so back in like the 80s we had a hunting business and he thought i wonder if people would want to watch our hunts and literally bought a video camera the sound guy from our church filmed them hunting in the duck blind we didn't buy one we borrowed one at first one the first ones we borrowed and then made yeah made a dvd about or a vhs tape actually of the hunt and it was duck hunts which it was kind of like was it was pretty much clint ewood or josie welles duck if he duck hunted and it was dad was like really into like classic rock cuz he he was very reverent like back then he would like we had a spitting scene like everybody would have like giant shoes at the back and like it'd be slow motion spitting it was and but there was like a grassroots people that like we love this it was kind of in yourr face for like the proper and i think my dad was always kind of anti- wealthy proper and so he was kind of always fighting the system and so to him it was like this is how we do it it was in your face it was like raw gritty hunting and kind of working man's type of hunting this is not your you know buy all your property and you know cu cuz they grew up super poor and so yeah so phil did do that you know he had these he had the videos that that went into tv on on outdoor channel and then so when this came it was you know i i think he was more open but i think he thought man this is going to get a lot bigger and the production will be bigger which we knew it would so that's kind of how he i guess we talked him into it and he

bit like an anthropologist when i'm when i'm in the united united states because your culture is similar to ours but it has very interesting differences and there's something extremely american about the story you just laid out because first of all there's that you you talked about clint eastwood there's sort of that backwoods rebel thing going on that's really a powerful part of american culture you know the the the alienated cowboy who's really a solid guy at heart who's an anti-establishment figure but also a traditionalist i mean that's an unbelievably deep american trope and an extremely successful one and then you know you said your dad too was interested in this in in doing the family series partly because he had some interest in evangelizing right now you said that you guys didn't want to take that to any extreme and i think obviously that was an extremely good decision because if your show would have ever got preachy people would have just shut it off right that faith had to be something implicit and displayed but not something that you were beating people over the head with to convince them because who the hell wants to watch propaganda which is something that the entertainment industry is going to have to figure out again and then you have this interesting additional aspect that's also deeply american you know you said while your dad also thought this was probably at least in potential a good way to grow the business and to make money and you know you you think about how american it is for those three things to meet there's the clint eastwood you know alienated lone backwoods cowboy with with his middle finger up to the system there's the there's a bit of protestant evangelizing mixed in there and then the last last of it is you know this this eye to the market and to entrepreneurial activity and all three of those things those those american characterological elements seem to come together in your show you know i bet your father really secretly enjoyed all this he i don't imagine he would let on but my guess is that there was part of him too that was thinking this is actually pretty cool although i'll never tell my damn sons that 100% spot on he's actually still doing it he's got a podcast that he does four days a week and he loves it and also yeah it was fun to see actually phil and kay and uncle sa how they all like became younger as we were doing it cuz they had fun with it and the family was all together you know it was such a blessing that our kids got to be with their grandparents and their aunts and uncles and all that on just a daily basis like we were you know when you film you're there a long time it's a it's a long time where things are happening you're filming there's a lot of sitting around where they're setting up lights and cameras and so we just got to be together as a family even more we we've always been together as a family a lot because we just kind of do life like that and live you know live in close proximity and and have meals together but when you're filming we were really together and and it was fun it was a blessing to get to do that it was a blessing i think for our kids to get to have that time with their grand you know their grandparents that was even a more intimate time together yeah there was like these odd combinations of family members whatever scene you were in and it but you're having to like i'm depending on my eight-year-old nephew you know during this scene i'm like come on buddy we got this you know and so or maybe depending on my uncle or someone else and so it was kind of you would be stuck here for hours you know but it was really fun i think that's what we you know kind of miss and but you're right dad would dad would gripe about it and this is you know he would gripe but then the minute our show ended he was doing a podcast the next week like and he was out there filming in the woods and and he does like four hours a week which is mindblowing to me to be doing that much and so it is funny you know he would he would complain about it on one hand but then uh but he you know he certainly thinks no willie's mom on the other hand this was her chance to be a star and she had a blast she loved it she she would carry in her purse like head shot of herself different head shot so she would lay them out like at the grocery store for someone to pick from and i and and she would say willie everybody recognized me and i said mom your shirt said miss k like every like you're wearing like a shirt like with your face on and of course they they recognize you and so it was just fun watching them kind of have this complete different lease on life you know with when like i said said where they thought i think you know i mean when we took over the company i remember my dad told me he said i think everybody has a duck call like it's over and this is 10 years before the duck n happens i was like well there may be something left of this company and but he had kind of thought that was it you know we did good and from where they came from to where they ended up i thought they felt successful but they had no idea the the wild ride that was coming within the next couple of decades so cory you married into this family and we discussed earlier the observation that well it was a a two pronged observation that on the one hand the duck dynasty family was far from normal but on the other hand they actually represented a return to a kind of traditional norm and ideal so there's a paradoxical mix there of idiosyncrasy and and peculiarity in the best sense but also grounded in something that's really recognizable and and traditional and one of the things that struck me you know my family has ridden a wave of notoriety and popularity i suppose that's lasted now probably it's almost 10 years since it really started and that places all sorts of opportunities in front of you but also all sorts of stresses when now you've you've obviously entered the family let's say as an outsider and you could see their idiosyncrasies but you've also been able to see whatever it is that's enabled them to pull together and to stay together and one of the things that's quite remarkable to me and i've really noticed this in talking to you guys the last couple of times we've talked is that despite the rapid transformation of your lives in all sorts of unexpected truly unexpected directions the family seems to have done a good job of staying together and maybe even getting more closely knit i mean that's what you essentially alluded to when you talked about the fact that you got to spend so much time on set let's say so corey how do you think it is what's your observation of why the duck dynasty family actually managed to do this without well without all turning into like raving narcissistic alcoholics and having any everything go to hell in a hand basket which is you know pretty likely outcome all things considered yeah i think there was a real rootedness and a grounded ness in our place and and who we are and and our faith of course is the thing is the ultimate thing that plays plays into that but i think that just we did stay true to who we are and we stayed in our hometown like we're still here like we didn't move away to la and hollywood and that's one thing that i remember whenever we were in the middle of it and it was it was crazy you know people like our warehouse people just started showing up by the thousands you would leave our leave our place of work every day and there'd be just hundreds of people out there and you know there it was crazy but i think during that time period i remember looking at other celebrities who kind of like moved away and were doing it on their own and being so grateful that we were doing it as a family because we had one another to kind of like be there in it together and keep each other grounded in that and and also there is a i think whenever someone reaches this level of kind of fame or celebrity there's a a it's a strange kind of loneliness that can happen because you do get a little isolated you can't go out and do the things that you maybe used to do because there is so much attention or whatever and because we were able to do it as a family and we still had one another and we you know could come back to our same church or same school or same friends or same that type of thing so we could go out into the world and kind of like do these fun things and big things but then we kind of came back to this home that there where there was a lot of really deep roots so why do you think you didn't move away i mean you know famously with the beverly hillbillies as soon as they struck oil you know they were off to hollywood and hilarity ensued but you guys made a conscious decision and maybe that that was partly to keep the show on the track that it was why didn't you transform your life radically move away and and and i presume also you haven't done that since you you you've decided that where you're situated and situated in a genuine life that has like a multigenerational history that that actually works really well for you why weren't you tempted to to seek you know let's say hypothetically broader horizons i was never tempted yeah never tempted to move from where this is i guess mostly because there's we have so much family connect because we're both from here cory's parents are here we have like so many different connections here and so moving away wouldn't have been advantageous it wouldn't have been you know and actually if you take us out like what makes us who we are it it was here you know it was being in louisiana i don't know that you know us being in yeah living in la or new york you know you know would really make sense even business wiser for what we do i mean i felt like the show was was here and that's where we needed to be and so but yeah that was one of of all the things i've i've thought about i i never had any desire to actually move to another place and yeah as bly mentioned my family's here as well so in our neighborhood is my parents my grandmother who's in her 90s aunts and uncles and all that and so we you know just feel like that's a real blessing to not take for granted and not to not to lose and it's been really neat to see as our kids have kind of grown up so as the show ended our kids were all kind of starting college and you know moving into this high school years college years and they've all gone away to college and come back here which has been really awesome for us so now we have grandkids here so on this street actually where we live is five generations and you know i think that that's just it's not it's not the norm anymore and so it's not something to be taken for granted so we we wouldn't want to give that up for anything yeah and there's nothing and another like i hate traffic and i hate so many people like i don't know how people live like this just crazy and so if you're talking about food i can cook anything i want to cook and as far as being in the outdoors i can get there and so yeah no no other city i just yeah every time i'm i i enjoy visiting for a second and then i always think i would never want to live in a city like like this or this big so yeah when when i grew up in my small town fairview alberta there was about 3,000 people there and it was about 50 years old and it was about 400 miles from the nearest city of any size it was literally on the edge of the northernmost part of the prairie and in in part of the country part of the north american plane that had been settled last i mean i had friends whose fathers had established homesteads there when there were still tepes of cre indians on the land and that was in 1937 so it was really the last edge of the frontier you know and it's funny because in our town people sort of bifurcated into two tracks there were the kids who knew they were going to leave this small town fairview and we the kids who knew that probably knew that when they were about 10 or 11 they're going to get away from the little town they're going to go off to usually the university off to the city and then out into world and most many people didn't do that many people stayed and it wasn't necessarily because they were attracted say to the kind of family life that you guys are talking about because but because and you know i'm i'm not i'm not trying to disseminate character logical assassinations here they were often people who hadn't really formulated a vision of where they wanted to go in life and didn't leave mostly because leaving would have required planning you know but but it wasn't the case like it it seemed to be in our community that if you were headed for something approximating broader horizons at success you were definitely going to leave and that was really encouraged you know my wife for example her mom and dad loved her and they had a good family and still do but her graduation present was luggage and the message and that was very common where i grew up and the message was you know get the hell out of here and get out into the world now you guys are pretty adventurous and you're pretty entrepreneurial but interestingly enough you decided to to stay within the confines of your family and to build that and i wonder how i wonder why those differences were the case and i i wonder also i guess you got enough what what did you get you got enough you got enough satisfaction of your adventurous impulses within the family structure that you guys had created was that partly a consequence of being able to participate let's say in your father's business like what was it about growing up there that gave you enough adventure well i mean i can find adventure in a lot of things so it's like cuz we i mean just growing up on the river like we we didn't really have anything but there was so much adventure on the river and climbing around it and paddling not just boats but paddling chunks of styrofoam or paddling a log down the creek where it had danger was like in fact when i go back now i'm like i could have really died at any point like as i'm looking like this could have been bad and this could have been bad but so there was a lot of adventure and i think as we got into before the show we didn't have a lot of money i think we were we were kind of like wow what what's going to end up happening from this and then once we did the show we were able to travel a lot and so we do travel a lot so we're going all over mo and honestly mostly for work i mean we go to do all over the world we we do stuff and so i guess coming back home i'm like okay now we're we're back home this is what matters so you know i'll say so willie growing up i knew we met in fourth grade at summer camp and one of the things that always struck me about willie was he was so entrepreneurial even as a kid like he was always creating these businesses and his family lived in the house that they live in on the show but it was even smaller at that time it was two bedrooms and so all our teenage years willie fixed up the laundry room or the cook shack that was his room he was always like making himself something special like a little special room or a special this so like i saw this kind of spirit spirit of like adventure and entrepreneurship even even as a kid or as a teenager as we kind of went through life together we we started dating we got married we were' and 19 and for my family we actually traveled a lot and i think travel is such a gift and we wanted to give that to our kids and you know there were times whenever we didn't have enough money to travel with our kids but we wanted to find ways to do that we an we bought an exchange student actually who became our daughter rebecca and because we wanted to expose our kids to other cultures and other things so even though we had that that deep sense of like home we do just really value yeah travel and openness and seeing the world and i think that that just brings in a whole another depth to to children and to people because you understand kind of your place in it and it's so much bigger than you and sometimes we can if we stay in our hometowns like can stay in these small to towns you can get this sense that it's like oh it's all about whatever is happening right here and we just always wanted to really kind of expose our kids and our family to oh this world is a lot bigger than what's going on right here in this little little piece mh well you know the other one of the things that travel does and this has been noted by literary figures pretty much forever is that you don't really know what you have until you leave it right because you take it for granted and you can't even see that you have a culture until you go to a different culture because you just take everything that you think is normal for granted and you think it's normal and then when you go somewhere else where normal is different you realize that no you actually came from a particular place in a particular time and and you have your peculiarities because of it and that can make you well it should if you're wise that should make you more first of all more conscious of what you have but also more grateful for it we can return to that theme of gratitude and so it sounds like you guys got the balance between familial stability and predictability and adventure in the world optimized right so you you're not you're not bounded by what you've learned let's say in louisiana because you've traveled all over the place and you've been able to see it from the outside and so you can get all that varied experience and still remain grounded in your community so so that's very that's another really optimized form of play so let let me ask you a little bit about the business side of things because i'm very curious about that so your father made these dvds that's the buckman series if i understand it correctly and so he was starting to play with video pretty early right so that was pretty that was smart because video in the hands of you know non hollywood type or non- network types it was the dissemination of early video technology that allowed that then it eventually morphed into well the kind of thing we're doing today with youtube people have these broadcast tools at hand your dad was in that very early you know and i started to record my lectures the first ones i recorded were in 1992 you know there was no way of disseminating them but i eventually did put them on youtube but i started putting my lectures online in 2013 you know and that was part of laying the groundwork for what eventually grew into the widespread distribution of my lectures and my podcasts now you know i mean large things tend to start small and you know for the first five first three years the average viewings for my lectures were probably under 50,000 which is still a lot of people right when you're accustomed to lecturing to like 2 or 300 50,000 is a number definitely worth paying attention to but your dad caughted on to the use of video early and how okay how did that contribute to the success of his business and how did that morph into the duck dynasty opportunities yeah i so dad started in the 80s so we had this bared equipment he he had a guy the church who was a sound guy and he said hey let's go shoot a video i i believe it was over three or four days they kind of really played into my father had played college football with terry bradshaw he he had the beard and and it was funny watching the video he's kind of looking down he's kind of humble he's not like inyour face yet and so they make the video i think they sold what did it say 200 or 150 copies so way less than your 50,000 people this was in fact it was pretty much like well that didn't work you know however he was like no i think we got something so every couple of years they were going to do another one and then they were going to put more footage in more and so that was going okay the big break we had was was when walmart started carrying our duck calls and then walmart put the vhs's in walmart sporting goods so now we're in about 2500 stores all over the country so we're in northern california we're on the eastern shore we're up in the midwest and that was the game changer so because they could watch something and get fired up and say man look at this guy and i think we appealed at that point again with the spitting and with the southern accents and just other unusual things that that my father would do with the music and all that we just really got this underground you know it was like a a swell of people going hey man we we love that we love watching this then they would watch them they would get ready for the duck season they would put them in and say now we got to get fired up and they'd watch them over and over and over they memorize some of the lines that he would do and so all that we felt like was such preparation to build up what which would would ultimately be duck dynasty on a&e but there were so many little things before that that we got just enough to know just enough to know how to be around camera just enough to know all that so it wasn't like just hero to hero or throw us in a show going good luck you know there's a camera and where's the mic go i mean we had had just enough to know especially how to entertain people and again back to how to tell a story which was learned at the dinner table because we learned how to tell good stories because we didn't have hardly any tv there was no computer so if you told a story you had to tell it and bring it and if it wasn't good believe me our family would let you know like that's terrible just like terrible food if you cooked it and so like everybody's brutally honest with you and so you learn how to do that good i feel like all that played into you know that and that's how the videos did that yeah and back to the business so the end of the v the videos would be their phone number which was their house you know everything was run out of their home and so their home phone number was the business and so at the end of the video there'd be a phone number and if you want more products if you want more products and people would call and it be back on on the back of the vhs tape or the dvd and so yeah people just started calling all of the sudden it's like you're answering phone calls from all over the country rather than kind of this little radius where you know before phil would go out in his truck to this little radius and sell to all the sporting goods stores well then once it got in walmart of course all of the sudden you get phone calls from from all over and we're the ones answering the phone like as a teenager i'm like duck commander and then i'm writing down orders like on paper plates and napkins and like putting them up to to ship out the next day and so that's when we just started seeing grown but that walmart thing was a big that was a big break that when they put us in that chain of stores it just changed everything which not coincidentally walmart was whenever during duck dynasty we were in i think 22 different departments in walmart and they said that they never had this no other brand including like coca-cola disney any other brand had had ever done this so we had the number one seller in men's women's kids and juniors in the department and they said they had never seen it before that the same brand crossed all the categories at the same time so that was pretty cool yeah are you looking for an all-in-one e-commerce platform that can help you easily set up and grow your business online look

with god and part of it an analysis of different biblical stories and i just did a seminar down in miami that we released a couple of week weeks ago on exodus and there's a cool part of exodus that's very much relevant i think to what happened with your father and it's the famous story of the burning bush so what happens in the story of the burning bush like this is an unbelievably useful story is that so at this time in the story moses is really a nobody he's left egypt he was kind of a nobleman in egypt but he killed an an egyptian and he had to like get the hell out of there and he went went to a different country to midia midia i think it's midia the midianites live there anyways and he he draws some water from a well for some women and and they're pretty happy about you think he chases some rude like punk shepherds away and anyways the girl falls in love with him and he ends up being a shepherd for his father-in-law whose name is jethro and so he's just minding his own damn business fundamentally being a shepherd he's out there in the middle of nowhere unknown and he's wandered around one day and something catches his attention and he turns off his path and the story makes this quite clear it's not it's not like it screams in front of him it's kind of off the beaten path a little bit something glimmers and catches his attention and he decides to pay attention and go look and as he gets closer to it he realizes it's this bush on fire and as he gets closer to it he hears god's voice speaking and then he has to take off his shoes because he enters sacred territory and then the secr of being itself reveals itself to him that's god revealing his name and that's when moses becomes leader and you might say well what the hell does that story have to do with anything and it's really it's very very clear and it's very clear psychologically you know because as we're wandering along our paths in life our normal paths so in moses case being a shepherd in your dad's case you know being a hunter and manufacturing duck call nothing out of the ordinary in some ways about that now and then something will glimmer and gleam for us that'll capture our attention you know and we can choose to pay attention to that or not now moses pays attention to it but so did your dad right so you said he done some sound work for example for the local church and so he developed a little bit of expertise with the new technology and then he had this idea which is you know it's it's not exactly a normal idea it's pretty experimental and entrepreneurial idea that he could take this new technology that he was interested in and do something unique with it and there was a little bit of courage that went along with that too and a willingness to you know to go off the beaten path and then you said too that i that i also think so interesting is and you know and everybody who's watching and listening should listen to this because what i see happening to people in their life all the time is that an opportunity will gleam for them and they notice they're interested in it but then they don't have the discipline or maybe the courage to pursue it they're afraid they'd fail they're afraid it would be foolish they're afraid they would look bad and so they put it aside and so it looks like they've missed nothing but maybe they missed you know the burning bush and god speaking to them maybe they missed the whole adventure of your of their life now one of the things that's quite interesting about you guys and maybe this also has something to do with your practice of gratitude is that well first of all you're father pursued this strange interest that he had and then did something somewhat preposterous which was to make these films that were sort of tongue and cheek about his duck hunting you know and to play himself as a character but then also when the entrepreneurial opportunities came along you guys also jumped on them and said yes and that really you know that really flowered outward grew outward like a bush let's say when when it came to walmart right and one of the things you also see about artists and entrepreneurs who want to fail is that they get high and mighty inappropriately about commercial opportunities you know you have people you hear people say this all the time he sold out or i would never sell out and whenever i hear someone who isn't very successful say they wouldn't sell out i always think well yes you would first of all and the reason you haven't is either because you're too dumb to sell out or because no one's come to you with even anything vaguely approximating an offer you know and the fact that you haven't sold out when no one has offered you a penny for your soul is no indication of your morality it just means that no one cares what you're doing now and i'm being tongue and cheek about that to some degree but i do see people fail very often because they take the moral high ground or at least they think they do by rejecting commercial opportunities that might come their way and your dad was obviously canny enough to pursue his creative interests and that's very interesting say on the and his experimental interest to make these videos but also to say yes when a business opportunity came his way you know and you said well that just grew well it grew incrementally to begin with but then when you hit walmart it was like you know well that was the beginning of the like that cataclysmic expansion and people miss those opportunities for expansion when they say no to things that they should say yes to right and they get high and mighty about it and it's stupid you should be happy if an opportunity comes your way absolutely yeah we both come so i come from family business as well and our family i i think one of the gifts that they pass down then that we kind of like utilize in growing the business was that spirit of like risk and entrepreneurship and it's okay and i think that so our family had a lot of businesses and some failed and some were a few were success uc f really successful but a lot of them walmart bought one of your business actually yeah sam walton bought one of our family businesses that's a i forgot yeah that's true so so interestingly yeah so i grew up in kind of this home where risk taking was was a reward and was a positive because you know you tried something and it was okay if you failed and that type of thing and and i think back to faith as being kind of this underg guarding of that is like if you know that you're going to be okay if it fails and i think that was that was told to us you know over and over again growing up my dad would say hey if we lose it all tomorrow it's all right we still got what what's most important so it's this grounding of like okay what's most important is our family and our faith and if we lose all of this other stuff all right we'll be all right we'll get back up and do something else tomorrow and so whenever we came together i think that was a a benefit because we kind of brought those two worlds together well i'd say the difference to like obviously not knowing your family for so long but even back then they were there was a bunch of different tries at it so it was like we'll try this and even us today we're like hey we'll try that hey we'll try this i think growing up where we were like with with duck commander and the business that was it it we're saying we're all in like we're all in like it wasn't like he we'll try this on the side we try all the chips were shoved in the middle going we're going to put it all right here and was was n a lot of chips though because it was like because most of it was being fueled by by the personality it wasn't like we had tons of money ever invested it was like you know but but we are this is what we're going for and we could always you know dad was always good like saying yeah if it doesn't if this doesn't work hey we we keep fishing and we keep eating you know the standards were low it's like hey we're we're totally happy and what we've got you know that's very cool like you you outlined something very interesting there because one of the things that people might be thinking about is well what what constitutes failure and what constitutes success and how do you how do you stop failure from taking you out and one of the things you both pointed out is that you're actually pretty careful about defining failure you say well look if this limited enterprise fails we still have our family we still have the love and respect we have for each other and we have a backup plan and so what that means is that you set yourself up strategically so that failure it wasn't failure it was just a death of an experimental enterprise and then i might also ask you you know because you had your family you had things in place that weren't going to shift even if some things shifted right so you have some security in that regard that enables you to take risks but then we also might think about failure too like i don't know what it's like for you guys guys but some here's one of the things i've noticed in my life is that i don't think i've ever actually failed when i was all in you know and what i mean by that is that my plans business plans included might not have turned out the way i had expected them to but if i was all in and i made the right sacrifices so to speak i learned something unbelievably useful that i could then use in something that turned out to be successful you know i've even noticed this when i'm writing so you know when i'm writing a book i collect the pieces of writing that i've edited out i i just i put a little i title a what a file culls and i throw everything that i don't think fits into those into that cull it's sort of like a waist bin but it's not exactly a waste bin because i can often go back to those ideas and figure out how to use them somewhere else else and so one of the things i've noticed in my life and i think it's interesting that you commented willie about being allin is that if you're really focused on the task at hand there isn't any wasted effort like it it isn't necessarily the case that you're progressing to the goal you have in mind but if you're all in and you're not mocking about then you learn something that you're going to be able to that's going to be of benefit to you and other people at some point in the future and so and and corey you talked about your father and his attitude towards s towards failure i mean it it sounds that what it what it's more like it's not so much an attitude towards failure it's a conceptualization of moving forward as an experimental enterprise right you're going to generate ideas and some of them are really going to go somewhere but most won't and you know that's typical of entrepreneur like most people who make a fortune have failed enough to be in financial distress multiple times before they finally formulate something that works but that doesn't mean that those that they were failing it means that they were experimenting in good faith and they didn't lose faith and they had enough supports put in around them so that they could tolerate you know the what would you care the ups and downs of trying to make something eventually successful now you also said that was grounded in your faith so you have your family you have your fishing right you have something underneath you but why do you think that the faith under that how do you conceptualize that faith and why do you think that was additionally necessary i think you like you mentioned it's that difference in definition of success you know and what what we deem is success and so it gives you that freedom like success is faithfulness success is is is a a healthy marriage success is a family kids that love you and that want to live beside you success is are all of these things and so when you when you understand what your definition of success is and it's those things then you have that freedom to experiment and try new things and it's okay if if this doesn't work or this doesn't work as long as this is working and i think that goes back to faithfulness and for us that's rooted in our faith in god god because that's what changes everything for us you know whenever you have that faith in god there's you come up under the authority of god then you try to live by the the the life that he puts out for you the adventure and the and the full life that he gives you and then everything that we do reflects that and so you mentioned in our show it wasn't preaching and it wasn't meant to be preaching it was just our faith sh sh shown through because it's who we are it's how we relate to one another in marriage it's how we relate to our kids it's how it's how we treat one another at work it it just informs everything that we do so there's this this faith that surrounds it all but you don't have to say it explicitly because it's just internal and it's who we are and it's how we live it's what makes us laugh you know i mean it's what brings us joy you know because it's like ah so when i think about because you said it's rooted in our faith that to me it's the ultimate and nothing is wasted is rooted in the faith because you would say well what about when you really screwed up or what about when this happened and this was terrible with that that's what triggers back that faith again going oh no it's not a waste you know to where if you were looking at jesus christ going ah what a waste they killed him you know he's like ah not a waste this was for you so it's everything keeps going back and that's it always is like nothing's wasted can i take can i take something where i really messed up you're like ah this is back can i take that and use that and yes yes that can be used yes that can be used to help not just you and if you think about life unselfishly it may help someone else you know it may be ah this is really hard for me but wow it really helped you you know it really helped someone else and i think that's why we we say it's rooted there because nothing becomes wast that everything becomes something that can be used you know for we think for the the glory of god you know ultimately because we have to put ourselves down as well and not it's not the life's not all about us you know for sure okay so cory you outlined a very interesting i would call it a hierarchy of values and i think that it is reflected in your show and in your general attitude and i do think that this is part of what made what you guys did so attractive so this is what you basically said to me you know you said ent first of all your head is screwed on straight with regard to what constitutes success now you know you could say well success is cocaine and hookers and you know the extension of a radically hedonistic life you can do whatever the hell you want whenever you want and the clear problem with that is you tend to die right you end up face down in a ditch and you take a lot of people with you so it's kind of a stupid definition of success now you had a very prosaic defin of success right it's very normal but also ideal at the same time you said and i think you said in this order you said a good marriage a good family and good friends and so you could see that that moves from you to your primary relationship and then to your family the next set of primary relationships and then to the community you said if things were are working well there and this is somewhat independent of economic status then you're successful and so so that's you know it's it's good to have your head screwed on straight about what's successful because that also means that when you have that you can be grateful right you think well and you have a grounds for gratitude and then you implied too that all of that was nested inside a religious faith right so that's this turning toward god and so it's god underneath the marriage underneath you underneath the marriage underneath your family underneath your friends and so then and and willie you said as well that your faith and this was your religious faith enabled you to laugh okay so a couple of things on that first thing is one of the benefits to christian faith is that you have a good standard of comparison and one standard of comparison with regards to failure is that if you aren't literally being nailed to a cross while you're being mocked by a mob and tortured things are actually pretty good and that's really useful to know because it's easy to think that you're at the bottom and to despair when you're nowhere near the bottom and if you know you're nowhere near the bottom even when things have g sideways you can still be grateful and that's extremely helpful so that's helpful but then you also said and this is more complex you know you said that your faith your religious faith made itself manifest in all the things you did in the show and i would say i can understand the the idea of the good marriage i can understand the idea of the close family and your friendship network but how do you specifically think that your religious faith helped keep you in character like helped keep you honest while you were doing the show how it informed your marriage and your relationship with family and friends so that you guys could tolerate the ups and downs of your wild ride toward success without fractionating like what specific role do you think that religious faith per se rather than marriage family and friends played in keeping you grounded and also in what would you accounting for the popularity the enduring popularity of your show well there's there's a scripture that talks about the fruit of the spirit and it says the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness gentleness goodness and self-control and so i think that you know whenever we are embodied by the spirit of christ we live those things and those things come out of us and so the there's also a scripture of talking about the aroma of christ and just that and that we're lights of the world and we're salt of the earth all these things that you know scripture says about us as we are embodied by the spirit is how we try to live and so i think those things just kind of come out of whatever aspect you're doing and whatever thing you're living not that we're perfect in it by any means of course we're not perfect in it but we do try to live and we try we we hope that those fruits there's an outpouring of those fruits in our life well and also he says they'll know you by your love for one another not exactly what you know or how much you know but that's how they will see you the way i see reflected like especially on the show is is you know the the when it comes down to just the show and how we're on it i think it you know our faith kept us from one taking ourselves way too seriously or thinking we're so important or i mean we could act we had the goods we could look around going hey we've got one of the top tv shows on television right now which could have made us unbearable i mean there were times with production there were so many things going on where i could just lost my mind so one of the aspects where the faith came out was actually just to actually just to be on set and do the show because there was just you know there was different wars and different things going on you know behind the scenes and so you know you had to keep that together to actually do that and i think just to remain playful and not become so serious you know when you were when you were talking about if it's not if you're not being crucified you're not you know having that i think you if not you get i think that's why people get so caught up and they they can't really enjoy success because they're they're too worried about you know either losing it or what's going to come next and so i i just see that as as faith doing that and that that's where it's just manifesting itself and just going hey i have faith you know i mean this is you know plus life is short i mean it's really short and so if you believe that life will continue and that you'll go on then it it should help you i guess to have a better disposition here on this earth knowing that you're just here like that you're gone so so that's i think that that comes out in faith as well you you point out two things there that are interesting so earlier you know you guys talked about the necessity of being allin you know that if you make made a decision you were going to put everything behind it and you can imagine that that could devolve into a kind of grim seriousness of purpose and a kind of panic because you've bet everything well first of all you know you did say in some ways it isn't that you hedged your bets you protected yourself because you had your marriage and your family and your friends and you weren't going to risk that in your all in but also so your faith it seems to me that your faith enabled you to believe that what you were doing was important and worthwhile and that it could have a positive effect for you and for other people but also simultaneously i suppose by subordinating you to something that was higher on a regular basis it also stopped you from becoming egotistical and assuming that your success marked you out somehow as you know pretty naturally special right and and that's definitely you know that's definitely a temptation for people who are celebrities because you know i've thought about this a lot in relationship to adolf hitler you know cuz you could imagine if if tens of millions of people thought you were the savior savior of your country who are you to say that you're not and the answer to that has to be well you're someone who's subordinated to a higher authority you know and if you have a religious faith that would be the authority of christ or god and and you're not that whatever you are no matter how spectacular you are un successful you're definitely not that if you don't have that and you accumulate faith or fame and notoriety like what's stopping you from confusing yourself stupidly with the deity you know and so it sounds like you guys balanced your faith so that you could take yourself seriously you know and presume that what you were doing was worthwhile and important but it also protected you against the narcissism that can easily emerge when well as you said earlier when you can't even go down you can't even walk down the street without being you know constantly recognized and celebrated and and put on a pedestal for that matter we're in our on our home right now and in our dining room we have a big scripture on the wall and it's romans 12 9-18 and it talks about all those things we just talked about it was thinking of that as you were saying it it's starts out saying love must be sincere hate what is evil cling to what is good but then it goes on to talk about not not taking your not thinking of yourself more highly than you ought and not trying to you know you need to you need to sit with people from all walks of life you need to be hospitable and all these things so all these things are kind of right there in that romans 12 scripture that we have over our table and so it's just that constant reminder you know to to yeah that we are up up under something that's greater than us so can i we're we're we're starting to approach the end of this part of our discussion for everybody watching and listening i'm going to talk to willie and corey robertson about their marriage on the daily wire plus platform because i'm very interested in what they've done right because they actually seem to like each other to some degree which is nice to see in a married couple that have been together for a long time i think maybe what we'll do before we close is i'd like to ask you guys what you're doing now and what your future plans are when when we were planning this interview this podcast discussion you talk to me a little bit about your future plans and so do you want to tell everybody what projects you're working on now and what you see in the future what you're bringing to people in the future yeah so after the show ended we and as we've talked about just saw kind of that impact of entertainment and so we started a production company called tread lively productions and our first film is coming out september 28th in theaters and it's called the blind and it's interesting that we've had so much of a conversation about willie's dad phil because that is really what this movie is about is is phil and k story and you know we've talked a lot about kind of the success of it and you know what happened after but this is the story before and it's it's interesting that we we chose to go back and tell the hard days you know the hard parts of the story because i think when you see a family like ours on television sometimes you could think oh oh of course god used them they all love each other and they're all this but actually scripturally and and you've mentioned several you know people in the bible that god used for big things but that were really flawed and had really you know had these hard stories and so it's actually you know i think people can discount themselves and thinks oh i'm out because i didn't do this or i didn't do this right but instead god uses the people who are weak but that that surrender their liv to him and so this is the family story it's philling kay story really will he was two in the movie and he was actually played by our grandson which was really fun but this is their story and their 10 hard years of marriage that k got pregnant in high school and they went off to college together and had 10 hard years where phil was an alcoholic he you know was adulterous he had all the things that you would say this family will never make it you know it's it's over and there was a point where it was over you know kay had moved to westroad which is why they ended up here because phil had kicked her out of the house and it was just a real low point in their family life and a pastor went to the bar where phil you want to tell yeah well my dad's sister my aunt jan begged this pastor to go up and and preach the gospel to her brother and and i can just imagine this conversation like it's in a different state you know it's like i'm you know it's like oh time to come to church and you know it's like no he's he's running a bar in southern arkansas and that preacher got in that car and drove to that bar and walked into this bar and phil was not happy to see him it was very adversarial and he shares his faith with him and you know nothing happens he phil says i'll i'll keep that at mind and then when he leaves it wasn't until dad really the movie says when he came to the end of himself you know when he was alone he's in the woods he's living he lived in the woods for six months running from the state police which is another reason we end up in louisiana to get away from the police and when he got to that point that's when he looked back up and said hey let me talk to that preacher again and so what blows me away is that had that not happened and i just can't quit thinking about like if that guy doesn't go there and if it doesn't happen and if the marriage bust apart and my life looks completely different none of this i mean it's like the whole you know i don't go to the church camp to meet her i'm not talking to you it's almost like every day is a another reflection of what would not have happened and i would have been you know a single parent who knows what would have how that would have ended up there would have been no duck commander no duck dynasty none of that would have happened and i can almost like 23 and me like you can trace it back and i can trace it back to that one little couple who had no money no anything but a guy went up there shared the gospel and so that's why the faith is so important because this is beyond marriage counseling daddy kicked us out the only thing that turned him around was that faith in jesus christ and said i'm in and then his life drastically changed very similar like where saw to paul you know it's like you see that kind of like bang you know almost like he saw it like like saw did yeah this is all detailed you said in the blind yes yes so that's in the movie the blind which when willie mentioned saul to paul that's exactly you know the story of saul because he's blind he's whenever jesus kind of like blinds him on the road to damascus and then it says the scales came off and he was baptized and at once he started proclaiming that jesus is the son of god and that's really their family story it was just this miraculous event in their family's life where you know jesus revealed himself to phil he changed his life he turned his life to him he repented of a sin turned around came back to their family and then his mom kay actually forgave him you know which is another miraculous thing because that's not easy to do after living through that she says he was like the devil like living through those years with him she actually forgave him and their whole life changed yeah well that's so it's so interesting i mean corey you started out this discussion with this observation that in many of the biblical stories let's say and this is true of great literature in general that it's often extremely flawed characters that make the most interesting pathway forward and that's actually pretty good for everyone because everyone is flawed and so if there was no pathway forward for flawed people we'd all be permanently at hell and that wouldn't be so great and so one conclusion you can draw from that is that you shouldn't make the presumption to begin with that your flaws as egregious as they might be necessarily bar your way forward if you have good will and you're willing to operate in the world properly now you know we talked a little bit about the story of exodus and there's a really good example of that in the exodus story because there isn't a more archetypal leader than moses and moses couldn't speak properly i mean that's continually he actually had to ally himself with his brother aaron now we don't know why i mean we don't know if moses had a speech impediment or if he just wasn't you know a very fasile public communicator the story doesn't make it clear but it does make it clear that he wasn't the sort of person you would have picked to be a leader because he wasn't verbally competent and so and yet he became the the ultimate archetypal leader and i i think sometimes people become successful because of their flaws rather than despite them and so that's you know that's a pretty heartening story and that you shouldn't write yourself off just because there's something wrong with you because then everyone would be written off and then the other part of what you just described that's interesting it'll be very interesting to see how this plays out in the movie is that you know it reminds me i read this i i've been very influenced by this russian author alexander sol niten and soulja niton found himself in the most dreadful circumstances you could really possibly imagine the most hopeless circumstances and it wasn't so much like the story you just described because a lot of this was imposed on him rather than being driven in some ways by his own faults although he admitted to his faults he was first of all he was on the russian front when it was this was in world war ii and stalin had formulated a pact with hitler and so the russians were dreadfully and absolutely unprepared when the germans came marching forward then soulja niton he was writing some letters to a friend that were critical of stell's leadership and the and the authorities got wind of that and they threw him in a concentration camp in a prison camp and then he was in a prison camp for like decades and he got cancer and you know he was three4 starved to death and he had to memorize this damn book and you couldn't imagine someone more powerless than alexander soliton in a more hopeless situation and yet he formulated a book in his imagination that eventually brought the entire communist enterprise to a shuttering halt and the story you told is of someone who had wandered pretty damn far off the straight and narrow right and and who was out in the bush hiding from the cops which is pretty hopeless place to be and you could also imagine that if you had any sense you'd be pretty down on yourself in a situation like that you might think you're the sort of basket case that could never be redeemed and yet as you pointed out there was hope for redemption even in those circumstances and the proper decision led to a whole array of extremely positive events and so you know maybe no matter how deep the abyss you manage to plunge yourself into if you take responsibility for your flaws and look up you there's still hope and that'd be nice if it was true and it sounds like this movie is laying that out you know as biographical fact now when is it coming out september 28th and yeah you just said exactly what we hope you know for the film that's the message is really that there's no one too far gone you know there's no one that's without hope and that's really the the message that of the film i believe and did you how has it been finding distributors has that been an easy thing for you guys or have you run into obstacles on that front i i know the people who who did the beyond freedom movie for example they had a hard time finding distributors partly because it was a faith-based movie you have a much broader track record of commercial success so i imagine that worked in your favor but how has it been finding distributors and what are your predictions are you happy with the film and what are your predictions about its reception and its success yeah there's definitely obstacles to finding distributors for for for our film and i i think other faith faith-based films so we we're doing a fathom release which we're we're grateful for fathom and they've been fantastic to work with we're right now i believe we're in 1,00 theaters and that's growing day by day so we're very excited about that and but yeah it has definitely you know it's not without its challenges there are gatekeepers to to to what gets out there and so we're seeing a little bit of that and but but we're we're really excited about how it turned out it was it's been a couple years work in progress of like allin like we talked about just going all in to make sure we tell the story yeah the right way and in a beautiful way and it is the film came out just beautifully done every single person that worked on it did just above and beyond and yeah we're very proud of it not yeah and it's not it says this is a true story cuz it's pretty much since mom and dad are alive and we were able to talk to so many people we we have exactly what you know it's exactly what they told us you know had happened and so that's been real neat to to be able to put that together and it's interesting like we talk about a christian movie but 95% of this movie is not christian because none of them were christians and so it wasn't to the end where they actually embraced this faith or whatever and so it's just a real story of like how damaging you know you can make people can make their lives and my father had certainly done that you know a lot of hope and promise and you know but then he just you know went terribly south and then you know when all hope seemed lost uh that's when the the gospel came in there and so it pretty much ends right when dad becomes a believer he gets the idea like okay now once he's sobered up i can maybe build duck calls and then it just you know obviously we know ends cuz you know here we are now but but that's that story is from the and it's a time piece set in the 60s 50s 60s and' 70s so it's kind of cool going back in in time and seeing how you know shockingly the places we shot it very near where they grew up and it it pretty much looks the same looks like it's been stuck in time anyway but the early response like from the people that have seen it you know we've done screeners anything like that has been fantastic and from some press that have seen it already as we done been doing these kind of interviews about it it's been really amazing to see how it's impacted people already and also i think you know there's the expectation sometimes with independent films or christian films that they might be you know cheesy or or whatever and you know we've we've gotten none of that that's been really rewarding to see too even our kids you know whenever we first showed our kids you know that's that's the that's the test you're like they're they're all in their 20s you know are they going to think this is good and they were like whoa that was not that's like a real movie that's not cheesy at all there and it's not you know a preachy or anything like that i think it's just really beautifully done and we really really proud of it tell us tell us again the release date september 28th and yeah there's a website the blind movie.com that you can go and kind of look for your theater and all that all right so let me ask you one final question people are going to be wondering how this discussion came out and so i don't remember exactly how we made initial contact i remember we met at a corporate event willie you and i met at a corporate event that was the first time we had a chance to speak in person but do you remember how it is that we made contact to begin with and why yes so in a random way so first of all our son john luke read your book years ago and gave it to me and we're big readers we loveed to read he was like mom read this so good 12 rules that one and then we went back and read out some meaning and all that and just started listening to your podcast and and have loved you and followed you and and prayed for your family that's a gift that people give us they tell us like as we're walking around like oh we pray for your family and so we've prayed for your family over the years and have just followed along in your journey and it was similar in timeline we came out in 2012 so similar kind of in timeline as well and so actually a year or so ago i was in copenhagen and met a a friend there in copenhagen and he said that you had been there the week before and we got into a discussion and so i asked if he'd share my email with you so that we could kind of exchange emails and we did that for a minute i kind of told you a little bit about our family but we didn't connect until willie met you at the day ramsey yeah this conference and you gave me such gold you don't even realize what you gave me which was a really funny story which those are things i cherish so so you were going to be there cory was not able to come because we had had our i had planned to come because i wanted to meet you of course because we had communicated a little bit but we had a new grandbaby so of course i had to be home with our new grandbaby so i didn't and my and even in our marriage which i never we're fixing to talk about that but my status went up because we were on the same venue together and so and i and cory was cory's like it's jordan peterson and and you and and i knew i knew what she meant when she said it like somebody doesn't belong at this big conference and i yeah and so which i was kind of like hey here we are so so she was like well you you know let me know when you talk to him and all that and so i was going to meet you before you you went on st because i had spoken the day before and then but it didn't work out you were doing something with the with your mic and so i said we'll just wait till afterwards so you come off the stage and and when i saw you which of course you don't know who i am and you're like hey and you said what are you doing at the you said what are you doing at the conference and i said i said i'm speaking and for whatever you said did you speak to the whole group which really made me laugh because i was like i think you thought i was like maybe like the maintenance crew because you're not going to say you judgment but you were looking at my appearance and you were thinking how are you just out there and what were you talking about and i said yeah i was speaking to the whole group and then you asked me what i was speaking about and i told you nur pro science and canadian politics and that was a joke and everybody start yeah that was good that was good i can see your face your brain was spinning and so i was proud that i had you speechless especially after just talking to you for a couple hours i had you speechless just for a second while that computed in there so that's how we met and then i told corey and then then but you said yes i remember your wife emailed and and then we circle back and here we are right right right right yeah yeah well corey i'm very glad to know that a hick from northern alberta takes precedence in your imagination over a hick from louisiana so i would have never suspected that so it's good to know anyways all right well look guys that was great i i i'm hoping your moving like blasted out of the park that seems highly probable to me for everybody watching and listening i'm i'm going to talk to willie and corey robertson for another half an hour on the daily wire plus platform we're going to talk about their marriage i'm very interested in you know biographical details of people's lives and i'm particularly interested in how their marriages survived the you know rapid expansion of their lives and all the twists and turns that their lives have taken they obviously seem to like each other one of the thing that's quite striking about talking to you too by the way is that you're very balanced in your turn taking in your responses to this interview you know you never step on each other and i would say you guys probably talked about 50% of the time each you know of of the time that that that was devoted to to your side of the camera it was very interesting to see that you know how careful you were about taking each other into account i also watch couples all the time when i'm talking with them to see if there's some underground resentment or hostility ey rolling hopefully not that you know and some competition there for status and that's always a bad sign within a relationship like it can be playful and competitive but real status competition is that's just not good inside a marriage and so it was really it was cool to see how on the same page you were in your discussions about what had happened about your family life and how you also translated that into this very playful and easy turn taking in the conversation so anyways that's what the clinical psychologist didn't be noticed while we were talking and so god only knows what i'll notice when we talk on the daily w side which we're going to do in moments and so we're going to close this up if you guys who are watching and listening want to attend to the conversation about marriage within the dark dynasty please join us on the daily war plus side of things and thank you very much it's been a pleasure talking to you too i'm really looking forward to your movie like i said i hope it's ridiculously successful and helpful to people you
