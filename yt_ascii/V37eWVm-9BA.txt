when you were a caltech did you get to interact with richard fineman analogy of a nice richard we we work together quite a bit actually in fact on and in fact both when i was at caltech and after i left caltech we were both consultants at this company called thinking machines corporation which was just down the street from here actually ultimately ill-fated company but i used to say this company is not going to work with the strategy they have and dick feynman always used to say what do we know about running companies just let them run their company anyway i was he was not into into that kind of thing and he always thought he always thought that my interest in doing things like running companies was a was a distraction so to speak and i for me it's a it's a mechanism to have a more effective machine for actually getting things figuring things out and getting things to happen did he think of it because essentially what you used you did with the company i don't know if you were thinking of it that way but you're creating tools to empower your to empower the exploration of the university do you think did he did he understand that point that the point of tools of i think not as well as he might have done i mean i think that but you know he was actually my first company which was also involved with well was involved with more mathematical computation kinds of things you know he was quite he had lots of advice about the technical side of what we should do and so on giving examples memories of thoughts oh yeah yeah he had all kinds of lucky in in the business of doing sort of you know one of the hard things in math is doing integrals and so on right and so he had his own elaborate ways to do integrals and so on he had his own ways of thinking about sort of getting intuition about how math works and so his sort of meta idea was take those intuitional methods and make a computer follow those in traditional methods now it turns out for the most part like when we do integrals and things what we do is is we build this kind of bizarre industrial machine that turns every integral enter you know products of meiji functions and generates this very elaborate thing and actually the big problem is turning the results into something a human will understand it's not quotes doing the integral and actually fineman did understand that to some extent and i i am embarrassed to say he once gave me this big pile of you know calculational methods for particle physics that he worked out in the 50s and he said you know it's more used to you than to me type thing and i i was like i were intended to look at it and give it back and i start my files now but that's what happens when when fits finiteness of human lives it's i hate you know maybe if he'd live another 20 years i would have i would remember to give it back but i think it's you know that that was his attempt to systematize the ways that one does integrals that show up in particle physics and so on turns out the way we've actually done it is very different from that way what do you make of that difference between so fireman was actually quite remarkable at creating sort of intuitive like diving in you know creating intuitive frameworks for understanding difficult concepts is i'm smiling because you know the funny thing about him was that the thing he was really really really good at his calculating stuff and but he thought that was easy because he was really good at it and so he would do these things where he would calculate some do some complicated calculation in quantum field theory for example come out with a result wouldn't tell anybody about the complicated calculation because thought that was easy he thought the really impressive thing was to have this simple intuition about how everything worse so he invented that at the end and you know because he done this calculation and knew what how it worked it was a lot easier it's a lot easier to have good intuition when you know what the answer is and then and then he would just not tell anybody about this calculation he wasn't meaning that maliciously so to speak is just he thought that was easy yeah and and that's you know that led to areas where people were just completely mystified and they kind of followed his intuition but nobody could tell why it worked because actually the reason it worked was because he done all these calculations and he knew that it was would work and you know when i he and i worked a bit on quantum computers actually back-end 1980-81 but before anybody had heard of those things and you know the typical mode of i mean he was used to say and i now think about this because i'm about the age that he was when i worked with him and you know i see that people have one-third my age so to speak and he was always complaining that i was one-third his age and so for various things but but you know he would do some calculation by by hand you know blackboard and things come up with some answer i'd say i don't understand this you know i do something with a computer and he'd say you know i don't understand this so that'd be some big argument about what was you know what was going on but that it was always some and i think actually we many of the things that we sort of realized about quantum computing that were sort of issues that have to do particularly with the measurement process are kind of still issues today and i kind of find it interesting it's a funny thing in science that these you know that there's there's a remarkable it happens in technology - there's a remarkable sort of repetition of history that ends up occurring eventually things really get nailed down but it often takes a while and it often things come back decades later well for example i could tell a story it actually happened right down the street from here i will move both that thinking machines i had been working on this particular cellular automaton will rule 30 that has this feature that it from very simple initial conditions it makes really complicated behavior okay so and actually of all silly physical things using this big parallel computer called the connection machine that that company was making i generated this giant printout of rule 30 on very on actually on the same kind of same kind of printer that people use to make layouts for microprocessors so one of these big you know large format printers with high resolution and so on so okay so to print this out lots of very tiny cells and so there was sort of a question of how some features of that pattern and so it was very much a physical you know on the floor with me two rules trying to measure different things so so feynman kind of takes me aside we've been doing that for a little while and takes me aside he says i just want to know this one thing he says i want to know how did you know that this rule thirty thing would produce all this really complicated behavior that is so complicated that we're you know going around this big printout and so on and i said well i didn't know i just enumerated all the possible rules and then observed that that's what happened he said ah i feel a lot better you know i thought she had some intuition that he didn't have and that would let what i said no no no intuition just experimental science so that's such a beautiful sort of dichotomy there of that's exactly showed is you really can't have an intuition about an irreducible i mean you have to run us yes that's right that's not hard for us humans and especially brilliant physicist like firemen to say that you can't haven't compressed clean intuition about how the whole thing yes works yes no he was i mean i think he was sort of on the edge of understanding that point about computation and i think he found that i think he always found computation interesting and i think that was sort of what he was a little bit poking at i mean here that intuition you know the difficulty of discovering things like even you say oh you know you just didn't write all the cases in just find one that does something interesting right sounds very easy turns out like i missed it when i first saw it because i had kind of an intuition that said it shouldn't be there and so i had kind of arguments oh i'm gonna ignore that case because whatever and so how did you have an open mind enough because you're essentially the same person is your fight like for the same kind of physics type of thinking how did you find yourself having a sufficiently open mind to be open to watching rules and them revealing complexity yeah i think that's an interesting question i've wondered about that myself because it's kind of like you know you live through these things and then you say what was the historical story and sometimes the historical story that you realized after the fact was not what you lived through speak and so you know what i realized is i think what happened is you know i did physics kind of like reductionistic physics where you're throw-in the universe and you told go figure out what's going on inside it and then i started building computer tools and i started building my first computer language for example and computer language is not like it's sort of like physics in the sense that you have to take all those computations people want to do and kind of drill down and find the primitives that they can all be made of but then you do something it's really different because you just you're just saying okay these are the primitives now you know hopefully they'll be useful to people let's build up from there so you're essentially building an artificial universe in a sense where you make this language you've got these primitives you're just building whatever you feel like building and that's and so it was sort of interesting for me because from doing science where you just throw in the universe as the universe is to then just being told you know you can make up any universe you want and so i think that experience of of making a computer language which is essentially building your own universe so to speak is you know that's kind of the that's that's what gave me a somewhat different attitude towards what might be possible it's like let's just explore what can be done in these artificial universes rather than thinking the natural science way of let's be constrained by how the universe actually is yeah by being able to program essentially you've as opposed to being limited to just your mind and a pen you you now have you've basically built another brain that you can use to explore the universe but yeah computer program you know this is kind of a brain right and it's well it's it's or telescope or you know it's a tool and it lets you see stuff but there's something fundamentally different between a computer and a telescope i mean he just yeah i'm hoping amantha sighs the notion but it's more general and it's it's i think i mean this point about you know people say oh such and such a thing was almost discovered at such and such a time the the distance between you know the building the parrot it allows you to actually understand stuff or allows one to be open to seeing what's going on that's really hard and you know i think in i've been fortunate in my life that i spent a lot of my time building computational language and that's an activity that in a sense works by sort of having to kind of create another level of abstraction and kind of be open to different kinds of structures but you know it's it's always i mean i'm fully aware of i suppose the fact that i have seen it a bunch of times of how easy it is to miss the obvious so to speak that at least is factored into my attempt to not miss the obvious although it may not succeed you
