ladies and gentlemen in this video i'm going to be sharing with you one of the most insane stories i have ever seen in the world of chess it's currently august 27th 2023 and there is a chess player in the world from india who is 17 years of age who in 30 days basically became a grand master you might say well from zero no not quite from zero he was playing chess for a while before that as a teenager but in the span of several weeks he gained 600 elo points and is now rated over 2600 internationally higher than most of the grand masters on the planet and i'm going to tell you how this happened it's not without drama it's not without very mild controversy not anything he did let me just share this with you and we'll just get started here this all started for me when i saw this i went to the junior's ranking on the website 2700 chess please don't worry 27 you know chess websites are not very fancy these are the highest rated junior players in the world rated 20 21 years old and younger firuja gukesh pregnant all the familiar faces and who is this guy aditya dingra 2607.8 live rating higher than multiple grandmasters including the the the the the gentleman who got the youngest ever grandmaster title abba manu mishra and he just went up 75 spots and i thought wait how did this happen who is this guy so of course i you know i clicked and i looked at his recent games and he's been playing a bunch of tournaments in europe and he's been winning a lot of games and then i saw this article indian 16 year old jumps from 2 000 to 2600 and it's not even two months the craziest thing about this is it's like 35 40 days max and i thought what so shout out to taria spencer by the way he's a norwegian journalist and we're gonna read through this together and then i'm going to show you the journey and then i'm gonna show you three of his games sounds good this is a guy that basically became the level of a grand master within 30 days now one small technicality to actually become a grandmaster he's gonna have to get the norms but he's a hundred points overqualified at this point so 16 year old indian player catapulted himself into the world the lead became an international master he already got that title in a matter of two months as described as an exceptional feat he's from a place called guruguram i think it's isn't it guru is it guru gram guru i thought it was guru guram anyway it's a city southwest of new delhi in india his rating was 2020 his rating was two thousand just less than two months ago this is what his chart looks like and he's played in tournaments where he's gained'8 points and then he you know he beat a couple of people he gained 117 more points and i was like what how is that possible and here he is by the way rocking a barcelona jersey loving it we're going to look at some of his games as well and now you know he thought he was going to become an international master but now he wants to become a grand master and wants to play chess as a professional now this is how this happened his massive raiding jump can be in part explained by a k factor a k factor determines how much your rating changes if you score higher or lower than expected now aditya has a k factor of the max 40. why because he's under the age of' and he's got a rating below 2300 when all of this started so if you go to the fide website this is the international governing body of chess and you calculate a k factor my rating right now is 23.22 that's my rating if i beat somebody who is my rating all right and i my k factor is is 10. it's 10 because i cross 2400. i would gain five points if aditya beat this person with the same rating as me he would gain 29.2 .2 20 you're below and your rating is below 2300 which his was his rating change factor is four times higher than the lowest normally your rating change factor is this so instead of 29.2 he would gain 14.6 but that is how with this factor he was for example beating people when he was on the run and he was gaining 35 points for one game right he was getting 31 points for one game 33.30 so in one tournament he gained'8 points 124 points in two weeks he gained 300 rating points he played 20 games of chess and he gained 300 rating points because of this rule it's not his fault i'm not the point is i'm not trying to blame him i'm just saying that's crazy so he gained 300 points in two weeks which is why his rating graph looks like this and this is not even accounting for the 2600. live as of september 1st he will be rated 2608 so his chart is going to be up here he was he was 20 27. and in a couple of tournaments he gained 600 points now he's just got to get the norms he's an international master with a rating of 2608 he's the highest rated international master in the world now this is insane this is craziness there have been stories like this where a player is rated like two thousand twenty one hundred and then goes to play and then you know beats everybody basically like his winning rate was like 80 because he studied a lot that's what he did he probably just had a low rating but was studying and if you don't play a lot you know your rating doesn't change and i'm gonna show you a couple of his games like here he beat a 2300 2300 23.80 so he became an international master now we're gonna see how he plays against grand masters but i got news for you in basketball they say barbecue chicken if you can score on somebody i'm not sure this this this guy is 2600 strength just yet he's clearly 2400 strength but we're gonna see if if you know if if he can maintain so he had a couple of tournaments he he played with the white pieces in this game against sonic shavakumar who's actually an american junior player also looking for his titles this game was an english opening like an english ready white played g3 and bishop g2 this is called the neo catalan because white doesn't actually play d4 so sonic took and aditya played queen a4 check trying to win this pawn back right away and it's very interesting to see his playing style right like okay you know he gained all these rating points because of this k factor rule and if you're confused i'm also confused i don't really know why they have the k factor thing like why can't it all be standardized in chess if you cross 2400 your k factor goes down to 10 most people's k factor is 20. minus 10 because i was 2400 in the past not anymore we don't talk about that his was 40. now that he's 2600 it's going to go down to 10 but the damage is done you know so queen c2 and sonic plays e5 you will notice shawna clearly a little bit shook by the opening first of all sonic i think came' minutes late to the game as you can see and then you know a little bit shook taking his time place plays e5 the best move for black is c5 followed by queen c7 and bishop east and bishop to e7 so let's see how our our our future grand master here hopefully plays the game right so pawn to d4 rook to d1 knight c3 good pressure building potential to expand here potential to get the knight to f5 playing on the long diagonal but this bishop white has a very nice advantage he develops his dark squared bishop and he sent it there to die so if pawn to h6 it was gonna go knight d5 probably you know danger levels and and smashing into the position pawn takes d4 knight d4 looking for knight to f5 sonic plays knight p6 but his position is looking very cramped and now bishop takes f6 is played and the knight arrives on f5 you may ask why did sonic not take like this i think he was worried about knight e4 i'm not really sure what he was worried about after that but probably didn't like something like of this nature rook c1 and then this and clearly we see that aditya's got very good opening preparation very nice positional awareness takes on f6 to damage his opponent's structure immediately gallops in with the knight knight looking juicy knight looking juicy light squared bishop powerful rook on the open file good opening preparation leads to an advantage and now he does not trade queens because his queen is superior to black's queen his queen is going to be useful to hunt the king also to infiltrate obstacolored bishops benefit the attacking side white is threatening to just straight it win the game so black has to play f5 and now a very nice idea rook to d3 and now rook to e3 attacking the queen sending it this way and now rook to f3 and black is just going to lose a pawn so great pressure from the opening pays off he's gonna grab that pawn on e5 and like i said i mean opposite colored bishops right so there's gonna be a bishop coming here the knight is going to come in 94 rook g5 is a problem f4 e4 e5 rook g5 is a problem sonic is defenseless like i have seen sonic play a lot of games here in america and this is not looking very good here comes the bishop to e4 the pressure is building black has to take play passively and now white just hasn't moved these two pieces here comes rook to d1 you have rook d3 and all of these different rotating ideas you also have knight e4 black just can't move a piece so black goes here and you know you could play defense but actually this this is a loose piece so bishop takes h7 nice little tactic spotted if queen takes the queen goes to g4 hitting this and this white's just gonna be two pawns up very easy conversion after that so instead of that sean it goes here and aditya gives this up but like i said that rook was never gonna stay there that rook is gonna go up and over and that is exactly what he does rook to d5 black goes bishop e7 rook h5 so that the bishop can get out of the way now rook h8 bishop f5 and the black is completely hopeless completely hopeless position the rook still goes to h7 that have rook went from a1 to d1 to d5 to h5 and to h7 like tetris king slides up absolutely nothing there knight d6 now we hunt the king queen h5 hurricane shade is not made there's a queen on the other side of the board knight takes queen takes f7 and that's mate the black rook in this game got to move once it literally moved to get off of the diagonal of the light squared bishop right look at that the only move take a photo of it right now it's like the only eruption of a geyser okay it's like you go to a national park the guys are red ropes now it's not gonna erupt for 100 years or a volcano rook b8 that's it rook b8 and then the rest of the game happened while the black rook slept the white forces went in absolutely ravaged the position very nice attack here and at the end of it it ends with a checkmate a brutal checkmate i may add the game review of this game i'm scared to even look at i am scared to even look at aditya played at 95 with an estimated elo of 3 000 and a brilliant move bishop takes h7 mildly brilliant i mean queen h7 queen g4 but yeah yeah not not too bad and and because of that because of the 2144 you know how much you know how many points you get in this game let's go back to the calculator before and again this just goes to show you so sonic is rated 2387 again if i played sonic and i won okay i would gain 5.9 points that's how many points i would gain if i if i beat sonic aditya beat sonic and gained 32 points for this game 32 points imagine the math on that right that's wild and aditya is probably better than me at chess by the way but his rating there was officially lower and he has the k factor which is craziness that is that that is that's just that's just what the rules are you know you can't hate the player hate the game he had another game against andres quarzov from montenegro in this game aditya played e4 so he all right he's he's already got a wide-ranging opening repertoire his opponent played the karo khan defense we have knight c3 the two knights very easy to play i'm gonna drink some coconut water he should also hydrate just let's let's take a little 30 second hydration break maybe an ad will play here ah coconut water is delicious all right hope you're having a hope you're having a good day take take knight f6 this is a normal line and aditya plays queen e2 which is the most challenging move now there's a lot of lines here for black taking is good then to playing knight d7 knight f6 queen a5 is a line queen d5 is a line bishop e6 is a line as stupid as that looks to try to put the bishop here queen a5 to try to play bishop f5 so we have this bishop at five the queen drops back taking is too dangerous bishop f7 queen c4 check is a fork so e6 black plays very solidly and for the second time we're now going to get a chance to see you know how how how how good is aditya like how how effortlessly chess comes to him okay he puts a rook in the center black plays a5 the idea is to take space on the queen side aditya plays a3 blackplay is a4 restricting the queen side not a bad idea not a bad idea aditya now actually brings the bishop back voluntarily two things now c4 is free for the pawn and also you can trade bishops if you ever need to so the rook centralizes now we have this position aditya plays a you know preparation type of move making sure nothing is ever getting trapped and now now he has to do something i mean he has basically maximized this position so what comes next well in every position you're looking how you can possibly make progress white can make progress here or here to c5 or a night in the center or maybe g4 black plays knight f6 and white can now play g495 but he just decides to play knight e5 right away now had black played something like rook d8 for example this is still the idea right and then h4 is an idea h5 and then you know black would go here and then and then maybe white would prepare various attacks or slide the king you know out of the way but aditya puts his knight in the center and so does andrei andre andre wants this bishop now this would not be a good decision because black would do this there's absolutely no need to give up a bishop for a knight unless you can explain if there's a good reason to do so so we have bishop g3 black plays rook d8 and now aditya goes well i have something to work with you know i did everything in this position to improve my position to the maximum now it's time to attack c4 hitting the knight knight's gotta go there or there we're probably not gonna go there because that's really ugly after that the knight has no future knight f6 now aditya plays c5 so that c pawn weakened the d-pawn when it advanced but it took space you're now fighting for real estate knight c4 knight d6 looking really juicy and the black pawns are restricted this pawn is a little stuck for the future that pawn's not getting out right so black now should probably move his queen he shouldn't go here because that runs into this but maybe queen a5 right and after knight c4 maybe you pin you try to get the queens off but white is still probably gonna get the knight to d6 you know that's at some point maybe not right away but that's kind of the idea and then here black plays queen b5 so andre wants the queens off that's his idea he does not want the queens on the board he thinks white's queen is better traded aditya takes and uses what's been given to him position is still equal but he's asking the questions pawn to c6 now black can take but it's very scary okay it's very scary you allow in the night and then you're gonna give up the bishop so you're gonna be you know down bishop for the night and then you know white's rook is going to come into pressure black is gonna have to play defense white's gonna apply more pressure position is looking like it's barely holding on so instead of that andei here goes for complications he plays bishop to e4 in fact he plays bishop before pretty fast look at his time not in one second in 30 seconds because they gained 30 seconds every time they make a move but that's a weird move the idea clearly is that if this then this but the idea is i'm attacking your pawn so push it now obviously in the game there's no eval bar all right neither player knows that it's that big of a mistake but andres basically saying look go into my position because your pawn is gonna die i'm gonna go here you can't guard it i'm gonna play knight t5 and take i'm gonna play bishop d6 and take but he missed something in this position he missed a very lethal resource and that resource is the fact that white can play a move here that does not look possible of course white can retreat play defense but then black is going to play bishop d5 and so on and this position white has the absolutely nasty night to d7 a move that was not possible moments ago because the rook would be covering that square the knight does cover that square but the knight is what we call overloaded so aditya jumps into the position knight d7 now if the knight takes the rook is going to take this but if the bishop goes back i'm not going to take that i'm zigzagging and i get your rook because my bishop guard to the pawn the pawn that you let into the position you the protagonist invited the antagonist into the house and now knight takes d7 rookie four and aditya has a bishop and a pawn that is not going anywhere and all he's gotta do is bludgeon he's just got a bludgeon he's got to defend his c pawn and he's just gotta get in there he brings the rook back black tries to activate his pieces but he's just gotta just d just rip it open the rook's powerful on the e and d files the bishops stare from a distance ed5 chop it all down at some point black is going to run out of pieces bishop d5 you can't take because bishop b7 and that's it and you might get my bishop but after i take take and rook d8 check you can't stop this you're gonna lose a bishop and then you're gonna lose the game so bishop d6 played and aditya takes takes and sometimes the best way to go two steps forward in life let's go one step back in this case two steps back but one move backwards their knight is hanging if the knight moves rook d8 happens and if rook c7 rook here you're never going to win this pawn because you're going to get mated and let's just say i don't mate you rook to b6 because let's say this was the position it's just winning i'm gonna win both pawns and then i'm gonna queen knight to d7 in this game was a brutal move and it was equal but aditya took his chance listen he put pressure with white it's all you can ask from somebody use this c pawn his opponent made a mistake because i think us 2300s are just not particularly good at chess you know i'm 2300. and then he just bludgeoned he just words of the rating calculator just so i can show you 2307 is the opponent right same thing aditya wins this game 28.8 points if i played andre in a tournament and let's say my k factor was 20 9.6 9.6 right also my rating is slightly higher but or 4.8 if i beat him right now so it's just it's it's crazy you can you can go on these monster runs and you are helped by the k factor and this was one of his best wins he also beat a grand master but i couldn't find that game i guess that game was not uploaded maybe the transmission was broken don't exactly know what happened with it but oh and aditya doesn't have a doesn't have a country let me just change that real quick he's from india as as if the teenagers of india needed another 2700 okay e4 e6 g45 this against giorgiovich it's your david you're javich georgievich knight c3 so it's easier clearly an e4 player i guess against the young guy against sonic he decided to play something slightly differently maybe he didn't like sonic's repertoire after e4 but he plays e4 and now he plays a very principled french this is called the winner this is a very sharp line where black tries to counter-attack white's weakened pawns white goes here and oftentimes we'll play h4 because with the absence of a bishop black's kingside could get very weak and white likes to advance over here this is this is all very very normal and advanced chess players like 2000 plus know all about this stuff maybe you're watching this in your 1700 you know about this stuff so black likes to shut this down and basically just bludgeon white over here white likes to take as much space as possible and then you know kind of expand as you can see here everything that white is doing is about taking space on the side of the board completely restricting black and actually white doesn't even castle he plays king f1 and king g2 because you you don't really know where the rook wants to go okay now could he have just castle yeah i think he kind of did something a bit too fancy and this is basically the position white is going to try to attack here while he is restricted maybe he will attack here black might try to fight back and for now black prepares and black brings the knight back to c8 it's going to be a bit of a maneuvering game a little bit of cat and mouse could the players just repeat moves and agree to a draw probably probably but it's you know white has more space white's got to do something all right now knight g2 all right i guess preparing knight e3 now if black just shuffles back and forth white is probably gonna play knight e3 probably play a four probably you know like try to do something so queen a5 played and now immediately a4 offering up the pawn aditya says go ahead take on a4 it's free pawn it's free i i have no intention of trying to win it back because you will just play b5 right so black says okay knight a4 come on do your worst knight a4 but with one pawn you have unclogged the bathtub all right and now now now there's a big explosion coming on that side of the word queen c1 all right now knight e3 now queen a3 look at this we're transferring all the pieces black comes back simultaneously removing the pressure on the queen herself and also potentially moving over here for an attack aditya advances black counter advances aditya plays rook aa1 because he's not sure where exactly he wants to rook now black tries to lock the position on passant and the queen infiltrates on d6 black actually has an advantage here but it's a very complex position plays knight c8 queen slides out now black relocks the position now aditya is in trouble bishop g2 bishop c6 but aditya is a man after my own heart because in this position aditya sacrificed the rook rook takes a4 and suddenly the evaluation's like wait a minute could this be a real thing is he actually doing something here black got two minutes on the clock is this he's making a run for it pawn takes now knight takes c4 you can't take because that's mate but it's not checkers the knight is going to a5 and maybe e5 the e file is suddenly open for business rook b1 what are we doing here black plays queen to e7 looking for a queen trade aditya knight a5 if you trade the queens and then you slide back to d7 how is black actually going to win this game because white is really the one calling the shots c5 was gonna happen so here vuc with 120 on the clock doesn't go for a queen trade says you know what you want to mate me i want to mate over here as well bishop e1 the ugly but necessary defensive move queen d7 now the queen it just inches forward there should be seven now black now black under serious pressure pawn to c4 knight to b6 and aditya with 40 seconds on his opponent's clock decides to remove the bishop from the board and take on d5 that move is now going to really allow white to enter with the bishop and the rook and all four pieces are playing and let's not forget white still has a c pawn takes bishop a5 if you take and then you take you are going to win so black has to play a defensive move but now here comes the rook rook to b1 bishop b6 bishop d5 and on this diagonal black is in serious trouble and in this position aditya says you know what you should have checkmated me when you had the chance because because now g4 the idea is that if you take the king and sorry the rook and the queen are going to get blocked by the pawn and king to g3 you shall not pass to the pawn on g4 if the pawn on g4 can't pass nobody can pass this is like an artery blockage and white will butcher the position and win the game so instead of that vuc place queen takes g4 but now when m appears on the evaluation bar black is a moment away from delivering a violent checkmate of his own but in this position aditya calculates forced checkmate in seven moves it begins with a check and then he sacrifices another rook rook takes b6 the double rook sacrifice giving up two rooks for two nights in the same game that's what he did right he gave up a rook for a night earlier double checking let me just this won't make it into the into the don't tell anybody he plays rook takes b6 and it's all checks queen b6 and the way you calculate is that if this then this and if king a8 you know what the best move here is you know what the best move is queen check and now the bishop and the point is that if the king moves here this is mate so the king has to go to a7 check mate brutal and in this position after king a8 he actually could have sacked this bishop too here check here and then bishop c7 would have been the same thing and if king a70 would have done bishop b6 what an absolutely absurd attacking game where he got everybody involved and one moments before disaster the queen and the bishop the geometry to get the checkmate with checkmate looming on the other side and this was one of many impressive wins for aditya dingra who gains nearly 600 points in four tournaments it's crazy it is absolutely nuts he played four tournaments in about 30 30 to 40 days and now his fide rating is 2607.8 i got no idea what's next for this guy probably he's gonna get all his grandmaster norms but he's a hundred and eight points higher than the minimum elo to become a gm which is 2500. that's all i got for you today get out of here
