oh would you look at that dell's done it again it wasn't enough to have a proprietary motherboard power supplies cases and an upgradable laptop that never actually got an upgrade now you have to have proprietary memory as well stop it geez what what okay oh wait so anyone can use this memory stand if they invented this changes everything in fact this dell precision 7670 might be the most important laptop of 2022. that's because without it the ability to upgrade memory on a laptop at all could have become a thing of the past don't believe me well you will soon after you believe the segue to our sponsor the ridge their new beveled rings come in premium materials like carbon fiber tungsten and 24 karat gold and include two lost and resizing protection exchanges get yours at the link down below i don't blame you for being skeptical dell has a long and storied history of completely bogus proprietary crap one of the most recent ones being the alienware area 51m a laptop that dell said would be upgradable until it came time to actually offer the upgrades and then they got all well technically it was as long as you stay within the same hardware generation on us so what makes me trust that the upgradable memory we're talking about today will actually be upgradeable it's because rather than going it alone dell is working with jadak and by extension jdeck members to get their new memory module turned into an open standard for laptop memory going forward and it is super cool the first thing that jumps out when we remove the bottom panel of the precision 7670 is the massive green memory module here that looks like no memory module i've ever seen before this is the cam module or compression attached memory module and looks pretty cool i guess but why well currently the memory in your laptop is probably more like what's in this xps 15. sodium or small outline dim modules have been around for 25 years and that's one heck of a run for technology but with the speeds we're expecting to see in the coming years they're simply running out of gas why good old signal integrity the longer the wire the greater the signal loss and the greater the latency look at the fastest memory products on the market hbm or high bandwidth memory is mounted right on the package mere millimeters away from the processor that it serves the gddr6 memory on a 4090 all of that is within a couple centimeters of the gpu die this keeps the wires as short as possible by comparison the chips on a sodium might as well be in narnia with a minimum wire length of around seven and a half centimeters this is super easy to see on our xps 15. the cpu is soldered to the motherboard right here then the traces need to travel all the way underneath these memory modules back up through the connector and then around finally into the package dies there are ddr5 sodiums in laptops however if i'm paying close attention you've probably noticed that machines with soldered ram have been enjoying a speed advantage compared to their sodium equipped competitors for current gen ddr5 it's not an insurmountable problem the theoretical max for sodium is about 10 000 mega transfers per second but it's already proving to be pretty difficult in the real world to get those kind of speeds and ddr6 will definitely surpass even that theoretical limit you're probably wondering why we can't just simply turn these sodium connectors around that's a good question and our best guess is that it just becomes impractical to pack enough zigzagging traces in this small little area so that every single wire is the same length something that is crucial to maintain perfect signal timing now let's turn attention to cam we've got the cpu right here and the connector yeah you can't get much closer than that even with the largest cam modules we're looking at a 50 reduction in distance to the cpu that is fantastic but there's another big reason laptop manufacturers have been soldering down ram physical size if you're looking to make the thinnest and lightest machine you can the sodium connectors can easily end up being the tallest component on your motherboard so if even a couple of millimeters can be saved by soldering down that ram it's gonna happen unfortunately such devices are completely unupgradable and very difficult to repair thankfully camera moves that excuse as well or at least helps mitigate it on top of supporting much higher memory speeds cam is 57 thinner than sodium that helps not only keep devices thinner but even helps facilitate better airflow over the memory packages back to speed for a second for the moment cam only has a speed advantage at 128 gigabytes of ram but dell wasn't trying to set any speed records on its first outing annoyingly the business users that use the precision lineup want stability instead of hollow performance so we'll have to wait until cam shows up in alienware or something to see how fast it really can go not everything about cam is radical though mechanically this design is very novel but electrically it is very similar to sodium the bill of materials between the two is nearly identical so switching between cam and sodium is purely just a packaging problem there's even a camera sodium adapter they're so electrically interoperable this is also pretty cool see how there are two sodium slots on a single cam adapter that's because cam supports two memory channels per module using shared ground pins to reduce the total number of connections and because of these similarities and simplifications cam shouldn't be more expensive than sodium in the long term currently you can expect to pay about one dollar per gigabyte more for cam than sodium but there are no licensing phase to use the design so as the wonders of economies of scale come into play and more of these modules get made we can expect the price to come down to match or even slightly undercut sodium just like how we've undercut ourselves by making the color block hoodie only fifty dollars lttstore.com it's not perfect though offers a less flexible upgrade path than sodium for instance if you want to go to 64 gigabytes from 32 there's no way to reuse the ram that's already in your laptop the cam module you just remove it and then you have to put a whole new one in that assumes that the new one even fits like motherboards and power supplies all cam modules should come in standard sizes but there are more than one standard size for instance this 128 gigabyte module is much larger than the 32 gigabyte one we have in our system but then again sodium users can run into similar issues as well especially when it comes to double-sided modules another point worth mentioning is that the standard doesn't appear to be 100 nailed down so we could potentially end up in a draft n sort of situation those of you that aren't elder nerds back in 2006 wireless networking was in a similar spot to where laptop memory is now router manufacturers wanted to continue pushing the envelope for speed and network capacity in their products but thanks to a bunch of bickering between intel abroad com texas instruments and others the 802.11n now called wi-fi 4 only existed as a draft standard in spite of this router brands started selling draft and products anyway only some of which ended up being compatible with the 802.11n standard when it was finalized later this led to some customers buying bleeding edge routers that promptly turned into e-waste the same thing could happen with this current iteration of cam to be clear i doubt the specifications for cam are going to change very much but we know that ecc support is still coming and all it takes is for one pin to go from ground to signal or something like that to make the memory and this laptop incompatible with future modules you might buy on newegg or wherever in the future so with that in mind should you take a risk on this machine well first of all the precision 7670 probably wasn't made for you anyway this is a machine you get your boss to buy for you it has a bunch of features so you can easily pitch to a business like smart card reader for greater security systems management certified drivers that sort of stuff it's the kind of product where realistically you're buying a whole fleet of them with a service contract anyway so you know upgrading something for your it department to worry about the good news is that if you do end up with one of these through work it's a sick machine to take home and play with off hours the star of the show is absolutely the 16 inch 4k oled display i'm pretty sure this is the same panel that's found in the xps 15 and it is possibly one of the best laptop displays on the market it has excellent color accuracy near perfect blacks and low input lag to make gaming much more enjoyable than other business laptops our model supports a quadro a2000 gpu which is essentially an rtx 3050 ti that is down clocked slightly to improve stability under extended loads ours is the slim version here so this is a not exactly thin or light by any means at 5.75 pounds but if you want even chunkier version well the performance version has a gpu that can go up to a quadro a 5500 which has similar performance to a laptop rtx 3080 ti this thing is going to be a sleeper gaming beast the rest of the laptop is business as usual for adele's business division excellent keyboard loads of i o and surprisingly good trackpad to boot now it's time for business as usual at ltt telling you about the segway to our
