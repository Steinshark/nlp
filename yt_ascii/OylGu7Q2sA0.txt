2022 is here and there's plenty of tech we're looking forward to this year kicking things off let's talk about new tv technology some interesting new panel types are going to be making their way to store shelves over the course of the year and one of the big ones we saw make its debut at ces was quantum dot oled now most consumers are used to thinking of quantum dot displays and oled displays as entirely separate from each other but qd oled combines the best underlying principles of both panel types a qd oled has individual pixels that produce their own light just like a traditional oled but it also incorporates green and red quantum dots this means that each oled subpixel only emits blue light and that light can be selectively combined with the quantum dots to create any color the display needs with a significantly wider color gamut than regular oleds the result is a screen that has the perfect deep blacks of a typical oled but can also get a lot brighter than previous oleds for better hdr and clearer viewing in bright rooms lower manufacturing complexity and energy usage may make quantum dot oled a relatively affordable option in the years to come though if you want one soon beware the early adopter tax if you want to know more about how these new displays work we're going to have an upcoming tech quickie episode with more details about qd oled and other new panel types but for now look for sony and samsung to bring these tvs to market before the end of 2022 assuming there aren't too many supply chain issues let's move on to something from meta love them or hate them their upcoming project cambria headset looks like it'll be pretty dang cool it will actually be able to track the movements of your eyes and face which will allow apps to translate these movements onto your avatar so that interacting with others in vr is going to be more natural not only that but eye tracking should also improve the headset's overall performance because by tracking where you're looking the headset can render only that part of the virtual space in high resolution and use a lower resolution for the parts of the space in your already blurry peripheral vision and if you want to bring the real world into your vr experience cambria has color camera pass-through an improvement on the black and white pass-through we saw on the quest 2. this could allow the headset to serve as an augmented reality device where objects are placed onto an image of the real world around you now we don't have pricing yet but zuck himself noted that these new features would put cambria at the high end of the price spectrum oculus quest pro has been floated as a possible final name for the product but we don't know that for sure what we do know is mata is getting serious about getting it to the market by the end of 2022 next up we've got something for all you gear heads out there we're talking about the ford f150 lightning pickup and no we don't think they stole that nickname from msi's line of high-end graphics cards the lightning is notable for being america's first all-electric pickup truck from one of the big legacy automakers even though it doesn't use any gas it looks like it's going to be no slouch since it starts with a base horsepower of 426 and delivers 775 pound-feet of torque so it should be able to provide enough muscle to tow an rv a u-haul or your mobile gaming den ford also says its standard battery should keep the lightning on the road for about 230 miles though you can splurge for a larger battery which will give you around an extra 70 miles for longer journeys and of course you get that all-important frunk to add on to the space that's already in the truck's bed the lightning will start at just under forty thousand dollars and will look to have the electric truck market mostly to itself for a while since tesla's cyber truck is indefinitely delayed and gmc and chevy aren't expected to bring competitors to the market until but if you don't have 40 grand lying around that's no problem let's wrap up with something that's a little more on the budget friendly side the newest revision of the nano 2 charger from anker it provides 100 watts of power and thanks to its use of gallium nitride rather than traditional silicon it's smaller than other charges with the same capacity it supports usb power delivery 3.0 pps so the fast charging will work with a fairly wide variety of devices including laptops so it could come in handy if you've lost your notebook stock power brick do be advised it can only charge one device at top speed at a time despite having three ports so don't expect to quickly power up a whole fleet of laptops with it but it's still pretty impressive given its diminutive size the nano 200 watt hits the market in march for a hefty but not unreasonable 79 bucks what kinds of tech are you guys looking forward to this year let us know down in the comments and whatever you've got your eye on here's
