hey guys this is austin you should probably click away from this video 6 grand blindness recently made a video on this the andy athlon 3000 g it's a very impressive budget processor however he tested it in a single channel memory mode which could rison has a huge huge impact to performance and of course the comments pointed this out and i and my superior intellect would never ever make a mistake like that i mean clearly i know what i'm talking about when it comes to rison i would never accidentally run something in single channel memory when it was supposed to be in dual or vice versa me clearly i know what i'm talking about for real though this is actually a very interesting processor at $50 you're getting a pair of zen cores as well as ok integrated graphics and it's even overclockable which of course begs the question that exactly no one has asked for exactly how far can we push it now of course there's the simple method we could add dual channel memory we could start to overclock a little bit but i have something a little bit more nefarious in mind what happens we parry $50.00 cpu with a $1200 graphics card see i told you this video was gonna be dumb you didn't listen to me did you now you're here you're committing the watch time is through the roof because you're stuck and you can't stop watching the video now now obviously no one should ever do this it's a terrible idea to bond like a system this hard with this we can very easily go from this $50.00 little tiny athlon cpu to a full 16 corizon 9 it would just be a drop-in upgrade so well yes i could and probably should use a better cooler than the stock one that comes with realistically even with trying to overclock this we're not gonna be able to get that much more performance out of it and we're realistically where i think we can get more performance is areas such as the memory so we had some slight issues and that our x5 70 motherboard didn't actually support our very low-end athlon 3000 g processor which technically it should have but i guess no one's ever thought to do that because that's really dumb so instead we're using the good old a 320 m gigabyte board which is a grand total of 50 bucks with this and a fresh bios we're all set up i've got 16 gigs of ram just running it 21 33 right now so just very stock see what this athlon can do before we throw some of the crazy stuff at it okay so we have 1312 as our baseline benchmark inside fire strike now let's jump in to see us go and see if it'll actually work so thing is cisco is obviously a fairly old game that's pretty easy to run so if i was going to just purely use the athlon i actually would be a good game to try but we have a couple other titles that we can also i'll say stress test with because it's not really fair i don't think gt5 will run on this thing at all actually alright so inside csgo 1080p high should be pretty standard settings i'm hopeful this is playable i seem to recall with some of the earlier athlon zand low and rising stuff it's not not bad this is fine oh oh well that's a big stutter we're looking at 30 to 40 fps i did tonight okay all right i'm willing to say that that is a almost playable 40 frames per second on high at 1080p shall we actually throw a graphics card in distance - it happens okay so with our 20 atti installed we should have significantly better performance now by significantly better i mean it's certainly not going to be as good as if we had say i don't know a not $50.00 cpu but i have high hopes we'll say high hopes for this alright so we have our driver installed and if we pull it up here you'll see that now i do we have our athlon 3000 g running it up whopping 3.5 gigahertz but it's paired with 16 gigs of ram which showing here but importantly we have our our tx 20 atti so let's see exactly how well i can benchmark how i can handle 3dmark fire strike can you take a moment and point out that we are using a 50 dollar cpu very slow ddr4 memory stock speeds and a $50 motherboard with a $1200 graphics card ooh 1918 that's where the cpu comes in so while the other chests were graphics this is purely cpu as you can see we're still complete garbage here but once you actually average it all off together this actually should be ok so for reference our score with the athlon by itself was 1 312 we're up to almost 12,000 so if you have a $50 cpu and you want to get ten times the performance in 3dmark spend 24 times that price on a graphics card then you'll be just fine while we try playing some actual games this time i'm actually kind of curious to see what we get with csgo because traditionally while it's not hard to get a decent framerate to get higher fps you really do need a very powerful cpu but because we have great graphics here i'm just gonna crank everything all the way up because why nots excuse me am i at 1440p at a hundred frames per second right now i mean yeah 100 frames per second is not great with a 28 eti but i mean it's not bad it's still running pretty smoothly i will say while i have very low expectations for this you wouldn't really be able to tell that this is a $50 cpu i mean a 100 frames per second at 1440p sure the 2080 i could go a lot harder or you could get a lot more performance but i expected this to be a pretty severe bottleneck so for a game that's a little bit more demanding we have gta 5 which is running at 1440p with most settings set to high is that 60 frames per second what wait wait that's pretty much 60 frames per second with a $50 cpu we haven't even overclocked it we haven't even like started running the ram at like more than the base bead and while yes a 20 80 i should be capable of more than 50 60 fps at 1440p that is very playable that is very very playable i am legitimately impressed so next up we have f1 2019 now i'm gonna try to push as far as i can so 2080 i is running 1440p all settings are pretty much that's ultra high so let's give the benchmark mode a try are you serious we on what is this not bad okay now okay we go outside we're down like 50 my mind is kind of blown right now that a fifty dollar cpu is not terrible i mean it's not great it's certainly not great but 60 fps is still not bad considering that we have everything set to ultra high so i think what we're finding out here is that a fifty dollar cpu while not great especially when you're running it in single channel memory and the integrated graphics this actually wouldn't be so bad especially considering that most aim for motherboards are very easy to upgrade so you could start out with the athlon and then i should get a little bit more money you want a little more performance you could upgrade to like say like horizon five or rison seven or something so i think the only thing we can do now is overclock because why not let's see what we can actually pull out of this because it's running at stock speeds and the memory is actually quite slow no i'm stupid no i forgot when i started making this video i was using the x 570 it's a very high-end board i can throw high in memory and overclock i'm using a low end board and i forgot i'd switch to another day another motherboard and let's see how far we can push the 3000 g so i was able to push it to 4 gigahertz on all well that's it all cores it's on both cores and i was also able to bump the memory up to 26 66 megahertz which is the rated maximum and that was as high as i could get it stable without losing my overclock so let's run through fire strike again and see if this is better or not so roma clock actually isn't too crazy so where someone neighborhood of like 15% higher on the cpu and another 1015 % on the memory so especially considering the law this test is graphics bound i don't expect it to be a huge difference this is really the only place where we're going to see any kind of significant difference and that's a bit better i think below it before we were actually a 1718 fps now we're like 21 so the number to beat is 11963 and we've got thirteen thousand three hundred are you serious that's actually a pretty reasonable upgrade so for contexts yes go before we are high 1440p and we were getting roughly 90 fps so average we're getting a real performance improvement here instead of sitting it like 90 to 100 fps we're like 100 to 120 which makes sense because this game is very much cpu bound when you get to those higher frame rates so we went from 61 to 70 fps and f1 just by overclocking the cpu and speeding up the memory i am legitimately impressed and again in gta 5 we're getting a solid 10 fps boost just by overclocking now the cool thing about the cpu is that while yes for $50 it is not incredibly powerful but it is a really easy upgrade platform so if you want to build yourself your first game pc you start out with the athlon you can build something for very cheap and then as you get a little bit more money you can add yourself a graphics card maybe not quite that a dti and then once you sort of hit the upper limits of that you can easily swap it out with something like a risin three or rison five or theoretically all the way up to rising nine now yes there are certainly cases where you might want to spend a little bit more money for example arisin three 3200 g is not that much more and we'll give you significantly better performance with that papoul quad-core designs but you're doing anything like streaming you're definitely going to want more cores but i have to say i am very very impressed with what we were able to pull off with a $50 cpu i mean this is a ridiculous setup it shouldn't work but it's actually not
