in one of the all-time worst moves youtube ponders deleting the dislike button from the platform in response to creator feedback around well-being and targeted dislike campaigns we're testing a few new designs that don't show the public dislike count if you're part of this small experiment you might spot one of these designs in the coming weeks and then they show you this beautiful dystopia of where you can only see the positives only the good guys youtube is a platform that's advertiser frilly and they want everyone to know it there's nobody's unhappy okay every this is everyone all the time with every video hey there's there's bad people on the platform hey there's a thought on the platform everybody's happy no nobody's upset about it guys this is the all-time worst decision youtube will make if they go through this obviously they're testing it right now but they're considering clearly for a more widespread push out but i want to talk to you guys today about why okay so first of all is it all because of youtube rewind because as you guys know they got blasted oh that's hot that's hot probably not to be honest they listen to a narrow set of creators and some of those creators aren't very well liked by the youtube community as a whole now does that suck yes do you get rid of a primary feature of your platform because a few people that you listen to complained about it no of course not but youtube is so disconnected from their audience that they think to themselves yeah we've heard it from like a few of the top creators don't like being disliked bomb to their video so we're just going to get rid of this all together this is like when netflix deleted the dislike button because amy schumer had a bad special it's like yeah sometimes people swing and they miss we don't need to protect them from it they're big people they're grown they can handle it and if they're not why are they making public things on public platforms listen there's already a way to get rid of the dislike button it's called disabling the dislike button all this is doing is hiding the fact that other people want to hide it it's basically like saying everyone has to pretend like they can't handle criticism because a few people don't want to be known for publicly signaling that hey i can't handle criticism so now this would roll out would mean that literally no one could can dislike anything ever look i don't know why this sounds shocking to say but genuinely bad things exist right and it should be okay to talk about those things and it should be okay to signal publicly that those bad things are bad especially on a platform like youtube which is so like feedback driven so user driven like the whole comment thing was revolutionary you used to just have cable tv nobody could ever say anything youtube broke that and said no we're gonna give the power for people to not only give feedback but to see what other people are doing so this is a huge reversal or would be a huge reversal if they go through with it on that sort of mission and ethos and the question is like for what end look wars exist genocide exists you know scammers exist a bunch of things that i can't say the name of exists because i'll get demonetized which is absolutely asinine but you know these things should be allowed to be talked about and we should be allowed to you the viewers should be allowed to publicly you know signal your disdain for them and i get it that sometimes sucks for us the creator look listen i made a whole video on public shaming i got publicly shamed the next month that was great a million viewed video like you know 60 70 dislikes i ended up apologizing for what i did did it feel great not a great feeling to have everyone hate you but would i have rather no dislikes be able to show up no of course not because actually the crowd is right and the crowd's not always right but in that case the crowd was right i was in the wrong and i apologize for it and it's fine we moved on i reflected i got feedback i reflected i said you guys are right i don't always do that sometimes i get like on my david ike video it's well over 50 dislikes i'm never going to take that video down because i stand by what i said so but it's important that i have that feedback from you the audience sometimes you guys are gonna say steven this is you look like a jackass and that's okay you should be allowed to say that i won't love it i it's every time honestly no matter how much a creator says they don't care about that it's a little bit you know it's like ow it's like ow kind of hurts it's it's just like ah that doesn't feel good but do we get rid of it all just so that i don't have to feel look i get publicly lauded ninety percent of the time that's too much already i mean my my ego is going to get out of control if that tips to a hundred percent honestly quite frankly look i needed a few you know bad videos every now and then to put me back in check remind me where i sit i am an f list youtuber that's where i belong and if i get out of that watch out if i get out of that realm and i start thinking of myself more than that watch out i'm gonna go nuts like you ever hear the expression like they just are surrounded by yes men that's what we're gonna create literally there will be no recourse for like hey that's actually not cool hey cause people can just they'll just delete comments just curate their own special bubble it's so weird man that we want to do this it's like everything in human psychology would tell us yeah this isn't great just telling people all the time who already are like attention you know narcissist already telling them oh yeah you'd never have a problem that's a good idea dude anyone with over 100 000 subscribers on this platform needs a reality check every now and then quite frankly myself included okay i'm just gonna kick it straight with you guys it's good every now and then just to get reminded just get a little up all right we're back okay and we are back ladies and gentlemen thank you for that reality check and we're back to making videos but you don't have that you don't have any mechanism for that and you're just you're it's like a balloon that just keeps getting inflated your ego just like yeah you're doing a great job you've never made a mistake come on we know that's not true so why are we gonna make that like in the feedback mechanism it's just such a blunt move to like fix a really small problem like it's like banning tide pods because some kid sticks one in their mouth every now and then it's like banning donations because there are political grifters it's like banning free speech because some people believe that lizards like run the entire world like yeah i don't agree with those things but what we don't have the ability to call bad things bad like no we we don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater kind of thing it's one of the things that makes youtube such a special place is that you can interact you can see what people are thinking you get that feedback in a way that no other medium does like you know so many platforms have been removing likes dislikes and it's such a mistake i think for for things like youtube where you're sharing important ideas like dude how are we supposed to determine the worth of an idea look if somebody just comes randomly talking about how it is a hoax blah blah you should be allowed to dislike that right or if you think it is and you go to a video you're allowed to dislike that too it's let the people decide i just hate this man this like overreach of oh you're not allowed to dislike things anymore guys bad things exist you should be able to express your opinion you should be able to talk about it even if it makes one of us creators go oh it's fine i don't know that's just me that's just what i think let me know what you think in the comments below and that's basically it see you guys next time i know what you need this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
