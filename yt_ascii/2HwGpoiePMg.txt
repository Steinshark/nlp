- the early 2000s was a crazy time. nickelback was still cool
along with wet look hair gel and all-in-one water cooling like this, looked like this. yes, my friends. from
one of our loyal viewers, we got our hands on an og, gigabyte 3d galaxy ii water-cooling system to show you guys just how easy it is to liquid cool your cpu 2005 style. guys, this is going to be a lot of fun. that is the original coolant in there. - [jake] it's still sealed. - [linus] it's still sealed. this is gonna be awesome. and so is our sponsor. keep track of weird stuff. that's connecting to your pc. even when you aren't
using it with glasswire, if a strange device joins your wifi, you'll be notified instantly. get 25% off today using code
linus at the link down below. (upbeat music) it brings back so many
memories, jake, like, look at this, uv sensitive. back in the early to mid
2000s, uv sensitive was like, a cool feature because you
were gonna put black lights in your fricking computer. - oh, you had to get those tubes. - yeah, that's right. you would put like cathode tubes in there. - i mean, to this day the
leds still sucks so like. - [linus] blue led! - [jake] wait, hold on. - [linus] that's a feature. - what does the lifting weights have to do with high performance in a pc? - jake, you haven't even asked
me about this color scheme. - what do you mean the orange? - this was gigabyte's branding back then. - oh, yeah! i know. - like orange and blue. it's disgusting. - [jake] i had a gigabyte card, i think it was, you know,
similar kind of coloring. - everything about enthusiast
marketing at this time was full level cringe. i mean, what is what the
name of this product? 3d galaxy ii. it sounds
like a gpu or something. - there was a case that went with this. - liquid cooling system. yes,
there was, it was hideous. - okay, but hold on, look
at this, nano scale coolant. what does that even mean? - [linus] world's first patent pending. by the way, the thing
they're talking about is literally a distribution manifold. - [jake] do you think
they ever got the patent. - [linus] i don't know.
- [jake] can i look that up? hold on, i wanna see if that's a thing. the product page still exists. - [linus] transparent led
tank for refill visuals. - [jake] so the tubing is clear, but it's got blue coolant, i guess. - [linus] yeah, that's. - [jake] it doesn't look like blue. - [linus] no, that's definitely photoshop. oh my god. it's already a disaster. okay, check out this radiator. okay, for one thing, guys, radiators, they used to go on the back of the case, because internally cases weren't designed for the additional space
that the tanks at the top and the bottom took up. so you would actually
mount your radiator either, koolance had a system where you would, kind of mount it to the top. and there were certain supported cases that you could like cut
holes out of the top of it or whatever, but most of them would go on the back on the outside, hanging off like a big
caboose wart thing like that. and then you'd have to run your long fricking fan cable inside. but that's not the worst thing about this. look at the color. that
ain't silver paint, ladies and gentlemen, we've got ourselves, an aluminum radiator with
a copper block and wow, gigabyte did not have a lot of experience making cpu coolers and it shows. this thing is barely even flat. look at, i mean, what
are these marks, even? what kind of manufacturing
process do they have that leaves this kind of crap all over it. - it looks, like, cast almost. - it does look cast - is it polished on the other side? like, did those like, clean like, cnc'ed or are they also cast? - [linus] no, that looks cnc'ed. there we go. here's a much
better look at the block. super basic pin style block. inlet doesn't even come
down over the hotspot in the middle of the cpu. outlet is directly across from it. so there's pretty much no reason for the water to flow anywhere other than straight across here. like you're basically
not, like if they had even done any kind of thermodynamic
modeling on this, they would know that there's
pretty much no purpose to having these pins whatsoever. this thing is fricking awesome. now i mentioned that aluminum
and copper don't go together, but i didn't mention why, it's because of a process
called galvanic corrosion. that essentially means that if there's copper in a loop with aluminum, the copper ions that inevitably
get drawn up into the water will eat away at the
aluminum corroding it, which is really, really bad
for fairly obvious reasons. now to get around this, it looks like gigabyte provided their own presumably corrosion inhibiting coolant that has all kinds of
important notes on it. it's designed exclusively for the system. - [jake] does it say nano on there too. - [linus] it does have anti corrosive and water quality stabilization and anti freezing characteristics. - [jake] it has it separated,
which is interesting. - [linus] step one,
shut down the computer, remove the power cord of the hd first and stop its operation temporarily. if the computer's shut
down why does that matter? open the water filler point
on top of the water container. the water filler point, oh, gigabyte. okay, well that seal
didn't really quite hold. 3d galaxy system will begin to operate to evacuate the air within the system. oh, they're trying to instruct you to bleed the air from the loop before powering on your hard drive. for some reason. maybe cause you need to borrow
the power connector from. i don't know. i don't know
what the rationale was there. - [jake] how are we gonna mount this? - okay. well, let's see
what they had in mind and we'll go from there. jake, i think the real question is how are we going to mount
this fan to the cpu block? - well, that's what it's for
to, to cool your vrm and stuff. - i know, right? - it's actually, you know, kind of smart. - it's kind of smart and look at this. - well. - it even has blue leds. that's right. that's how they
used to put leds on fans. - so this has got a couple cool features. i think that's the water
level sensor right there. - oh, that's cool. so yeah,
there's a little float on there and it's supposed to tell
you if anything goes wrong. hold on, i want to see the patent pending water valves first, okay, jake. they wanted to patent a rubber stopper and a fricking like float
controlled ball valve. come on. - oh, it doesn't smell very good. - oh, it's like fishy. - maybe we should wash these out. - that's not the 2005 experience, jake. the idea here was actually
pretty clever, okay. so you run your, your
main line through here and through here. that goes to your cpu. and then if you ever
wanted to add a gpu block or a chipset block
without redoing anything, you'd be able to just flip, flip these valves, pull off
these kind of silicone plugs and boom, you could run them without having to redo
any of your existing loop. - yeah, and they said you
don't have to drain it either. but if you wanted to swap said new blocks, you would definitely still
have to drain something. - yes. - oh, holy! look at that. we can see how this
was supposed to set up. man they literally meant for
the valve to just sit there. - [linus] no! no, no. look,
it has, it has threaded holes. - [jake] but is that
threaded into something? look it, that's definitely
just sitting there. - okay, one of the things we ran into the industry a lot before was a, manufacturer's not bothering to do proper showcase
photography of their products and b, in a lot of cases, not even bothering to
compatibility validate them. - half inch special uv tubing material allows for extreme angling and flexing. and they gave you coil still. - it's okay. - [jake] that's not bad for 2005. - this is actually pretty cool. it has a pass through
for the power switch. so it will actually turn off your computer in the event that there is an overheating or like a pump failure i think. - yeah, cause it says
there's over temp protection. man, this is more featured
than modern pumps. - in some ways, yeah. - like they don't do floats
for low coolant level. they don't do temp protection. - nope. - i mean the system itself
does temp protection. - [linus] you don't have a dial for the back of your computer to turn the system up and down. - [jake] everything
used to be pcie mounted. - something to notice that
this was not a cheap product. now it's time to meet our victim. - are you ready to upgrade this computer? - this is geoff gutierrez's workstation. and it's a perfect candidate
for what we're doing because it's modern enough that we're gonna be able
to actually like, you know, run windows 10 and modern
games and stuff on it. but it's got an old enough case that it still has these ridiculous grommet pass
through things that (linus singing) early water cooling units used. so this, the corsair, i think
it was called the nautilus. nautilus 500. that's what it was. okay, we're gonna have to clean
this up a little bit though. - [jake] oh, stepping away. (air blowing) - oh, okay. you guys should
step back. step back. this is disgusting. - ow! - [jake] what'd you do? - i just accidentally
spun the fan with this and it shredded my finger. - [jake] try not to eat any chunks. - hey, it looks great now. okay, let's get this air
cooling trash off here. - [jake] is that an
lttstore.com screwdriver? - of course it is. my lttstore.com water bottle. - [jake] is that an lttstore.com lanyard? - [linus] of course it. - [jake] is that an lttstore.com shirt? - yes, it is - is that an lttstore.com beanie? - [linus] bloody hell, jake. actually, we can't know
if our upgrade is worth it unless we do a before test - [jake] upgrade is a strong word. - well, it might be, jake. it is possible that, no, this is not going to help performance, but i want to give it a shot! so we're maxing out at 60 to 63 degrees running an fpu stress test in aida64. okay, well that tells
us what we need to know. shut her down. - did you want to read the
note of the dude that sent it? - [linus] oh, i'd love to. - [jake] it's quite the note. - i love this story. i disassembled my family's
computer without permission, but did diys fan grills - [jake] see, look, fan grills. - oh, cool! yeah, looks great. sakuraiarmory, where we design and create custom computer
fan grills full time. that is so cool. isn't the internet a hell of a thing? let's do this thing, jake. how the devil are we
gonna mount this sucker? - oh, i thought you were
figuring that one out. hold on. i'm doing very important things. just give me a minute here. it's infinitely adjustable look at that. show the camera. - okay, be careful with those. - i don't think there's any shame in frankensteining the
mount a little bit here. - [jake] i don't think there's
going to be any alternative. - i bet that we could find
an 1175 compatible back plate with the same threading. - it's so close though. - i know, but it won't work. all right. that's okay. i've got an idea. i will be right back. we can do this. (energetic rock music) oh, this will work. this is what i was looking for. great. what were you working on? - well, the noctua back
plate is long enough, i just would've needed to extend it by about a millimeter on either side. - oh, you'll probably
still need to do that because i only have a back plate. i, you know, we have power
tools right. (metal scratching) - there we go, it's on. - [linus] yeah, but now we don't have, i guess we do have nuts. i want to use the original
gigabyte hold down if we can. now obviously we wouldn't be
having the 2005 experience unless we used our
thermal compound for 2005. - [jake] should we use like
some regular stuff, you know, for science reasons. oh, it's coming out. oh, geez. it looks like toothpaste - [linus] it separated a little bit. we'll mix up the liquidy parts
with the more solidy parts. here we go. - [jake] oh, you're in my hole. - okay. enough! - of what? is it working? - oh, yeah, i'll further them in. - [jake] what about the ram though. - yeah, what is up with
these stupid barbed spots? i don't get it. what were they thinking? - [jake] we could rotate it. - yeah, we could. but then
it would be sticking out into the graphics card. i think we just. - [jake] two sticks. - go two sticks. - [jake] we could do one
stick. let's just do one stick. - we had dual channel memory.
it was totally a thing. - [jake] we. (jake laughing) linus the representative
of 2005 water coolers. - yes! - can you pass me the cables for this? - i would love nothing more. where the heck are we going
to mount that stupid thing? - i mean, it can kind of
sit on top of the ssd. - it's enormous. - it didn't even need this case. you wondering what those
holes are in the pcie slot. - [linus] so you can compress the tubing, cram it in there and get it out that way. oh my god, what are these
even supposed to attach to. this product assumes that
your power supply is mounted at the top of the chassis. this is spaced for a power supply. so it doesn't connect to your rear fan. it connects to your power
supply, mounting holes. (jake laughs) - [jake] this might be the
nicest cable management i've ever done. look at this. tucked! - [linus] you're the tuck king, jake. - i'm going to zip tie,
oh, it came with zip ties. oh, they're, like, even yellow too. i'm gonna wire it up,
dude and you're slacking. - what do you mean? i'm slacking. i had to go get washers and everything. get this all mounted. look
at this, it looks amazing. - [jake] that looks mint. - now this was another
problem with systems like this back in the day that i had
kind of forgotten about, they interfere a little bit
with your gpu connectors. - [jake] can we still get some? - [linus] we can still
get the ones we need. but back when dvi was this big, the odds of installing one of this and having it just
outright make it impossible to connect your monitor was not zero. this barb design though. it's just like basically
a straight cut pipe with, like, a thick part on it. - do you want some lube? no. come on. that's your cut finger. - oh, that is the cut finger - [jake] oh, god. you
should wash that out. oh, jesus. - coolant applied directly
to the bloodstream. yeah, that's on there. - [jake] oh, it doesn't sound happy. - [linus] it's on - [jake] does that barb do anything? - [linus] i'm not convinced
that clamp does anything. i need lube, okay? just choose
a different finger this time. - [jake] hey, can i give you,
like, wd-40 or something? - [linus] wd-40? we're not
putting wd-40 in a cooling loop. - [jake] why not? - [linus] because we're not. - [jake] why not? - because we're not going to - [jake] give it like, why not? i don't think we're gonna be able to close the side channel like that. - jake. oh, ye of little faith i believe - [jake] here, how about? - [linus] jake, give up that. oh my god. - [jake] how about that? how about those apples? oh, we should just take
the top off and then just. - i hate this. maybe with the coils we can actually make that turn here. - [jake] what do you think? - i think we got this. - [jake] oh, buddy. oh, it's just hitting the, oh. - [linus] see? it's good. - [jake] wow. that is. - [linus] it's good. - [jake] you know, usually i say mint, but i'm going to go with
a decent on this one. - [linus] decent. yeah. we can just pop this off to fill. - oh, okay. that actually is kind of genius. what if this leak? - it's good. it won't leak.
it's gigabyte quality. - i can't wait for this to perform worse. - [linus] can you imagine paying $200? and then your computer looks like this. - this is pretty good looking
for, you know, the time. - okay. are you ready to fill it? - [jake] okay. - [linus] okay. you ready david? - [david] he's got small hands. - [linus] okay. - [jake] oh, the blue goo. - [linus] do you want to power it on? - [jake] i mean, you're
dripping on the ssd, so. oh god. - [linus] what is that? - [jake] nothing, it's all
good. everything's fine. - [linus] hey, is this pump gonna go? - [jake] if the pump didn't
work that would suck. - [linus] if we waited all this time. if we waited 15 years to find
out that it's got a bad pump. - it looks like it's going up. yeah. oh it did. oh, it's doing, - i was sucking on it. - [jake] oh, do that again.
- trying to get a little. - [jake] suck again. you're a good sucker. yeah. keep going. - no. cause, i'll be drinking
coolant at that point. i just don't want the system to blow up. - it's already in your blood, who cares? - [linus] jake claims
that we can actually see the pumping pillar through here and spin it. do you think that's spinning anything? - [jake] i don't know. - [linus] i can't really tell. - i think we should drain the coolant. i wish this just worked.
it's be so much easier. - yeah, it really would. - [jake] oh, hi-five baby. - [linus] nice. - [jake] hi-five baby.
- [david] well, there we go. - [linus] no, it's going. we need water. well, a couple of times back. ow, it hurts. back off! - [jake] no (bleep) it rips. that is a strong bump. it literally has enough pressure to do this stupid loop no problem. - [linus] oh yeah, for sure.
- [jake] that's awesome. it sounds like a modem. some like product executive
project manager dude from 2005 it's like really
stoked watching this video. - [linus] yeah, for sure. okay. let's see if the
system safely shuts down. okay, here we go. there we go. you ready? - [jake] oh, wow. it rips. oh wow. it's off. - [linus] did it turn it off? nice! - [jake] the system really shut them out. - works freaking perfectly. - [jake] you just lose all your work and just immediately. - hey, better to lose your work than to lose your whole
damn system, right? - yeah. well, was there really
no temp protection back then. - on high-end stuff like modern stuff there would have been,
like core 2 duo had it, athlon 64 had it, but if
you were still running, like a pentium 4 or
something, then it is possible you wouldn't have it. oh no, i forgot one of the clamps. i was so on top of it. and then i finally. - [jake] you're going
to have to fix that now. - [linus] where the zip
ties that came with. - [jake] oh man. - [linus] good enough.
definitely matches the theme. - [jake] what do you think
the idle temperature is? - i'm going to say 30. - 23. - 23? not bad, well
that's never the measure of a cooler's performance. - yeah, they're kinda all over
the place. the average is 23. - all right. hit it with the load. - [jake] oh, it definitely. - [linus] does not perform
as well as the noctua. (jake and linus laughing) - it like straight up went to 60 degrees. - the coolant. - yeah. it's cold. - is at this temperature right now. it's just like maybe 17 degrees in here. - i already feel it, actually - it's official. it's worse. - what? - it peaked at 70, it's at
like 66, 67 right now, yeah. and the worst part is
that the noctua cooler had the fan like barely going. this thing's going full bore. geoff, we really hope you
appreciate your upgraded pc. thanks for freeing up
a decent cooler for us to put on our test benches. - it really gives me like linus vibes. - thank you. time to bring geoff's computer back. - [jake] with the half
the ram and worse cooling. - [linus] and half of the
display connections inaccessible. all right, geoff, we
upgraded your computer. - you're now water cooled, officially - got a little, yeah, it's not any faster. actually. we had to
remove half of the ram. - yeah. - [jake] as an added bonus,
it's 10 degrees hotter. - it actually performs
worse than the air cooler that was in here before. - and i hope you're not using hdmi because your port isn't accessible. - okay. well, no, you've got display port. - you got two display ports. i think you may even be
able to get at this one, but your hdmi is definitely quite covered. - okay. - [jake] i have your ram. - there you go. - [linus] yeah, it won't
fit back in though. - [jake] for linus. - this is a future review.
make sure you're subscribed. louis vuitton earbuds.
they're probably great. oh, and geoff, it's also less reliable because there's sort of
more points of failure. - [jake] yeah, if it feel any better when we turned it on the pump didn't work. until we stuck a screwdriver in it. - and the cooling is 15 years old. - and thank you to our sponsor. thanks to vessi footwear for
