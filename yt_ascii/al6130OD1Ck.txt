person didn't even count. so good job winning, even
though it was handed to you. - there was a lot of salt in
that, jimmy, are you salty? - i'm just slightly. - oh, he's goin' mental, bruh. i think the game play on this
streamer is very magnificent. (jake laughing)

shadow legends streamer, okay? - okay. - i just found mine. grab yours. - jimmy.
- yeah? - you're not gonna like this. - uh huh. - there are zero people
currently streaming raid: shadow legends on mixer. which means my guy won. (loud upbeat music)

playing the best game ever, - oh my god.
- here ya go, mate. - thank you guys so much. jesus. well, that's gonna take
care of some bills. how in the world did you
guys find my channel? - we just searched the best game ever. yeah, i'm gonna raid him as well. - 9,009-
- do it. - he currently has eight viewers. just wanted to point that out. - oh, he doesn't have mods. rip. rip. you just ended this
man's streaming career. oh no.
- look at his chat. look at it.
- have you deleted the tweet? you might need to if you haven't already. - he has 2000 viewers, i'm
gonna delete the tweet. that's the mrbeast touch. (sad music) so chris, since $20,000 is on the line i'm gonna pick a really small streamer. - let's see, mrbeast says,
"can you turn off the music?" that'll be a negative, sir. hey, can someone ban mrbeast real quick? - i asked this guy to turn off the music. he said, "can somebody ban mrbeast?" - oof. so my guy wins by default? - we're just gonna not give him $20,000. - i've got a perfect streamer right here who's ready to get $20,000. - let me find someone else
who does not try to ban me. alright, we're not
having good luck, chris. - yay.
- oh, wait. i checked back in on the guy
- i guess he's gone now, huh? - and he turned it off. - it would seem i've made
a mistake. come back. - this is for $20,000. the first one to drink water, because staying hydrated is important. - he has a cup of water beside him, so i'm actually okay with that. - drink some water irl, please. - notice my chat. drink water. come on, man. - i'll do what he says.

some other mixer streamers. hey dad. i see you found a new home. - oh my. and the 3000 ember? that's not the real one. - i sent to him a dm. i said, "it's me." - dude, okay, so apparently

specifications of crying? - crying is sweating from the eyes. - well then, i guess he cried. - did he sweat? or did he cry? he was crying his sweat. oh gosh. chris, come back. chandler doesn't know the difference between crying and sweating from the eyes. you wanna just switch with him? - i don't understand what's goin' on. - okay.
- well i'm gonna go sweat in the bathroom. okay?
- okay. - by myself.
- that's called peeing. - oh my-
