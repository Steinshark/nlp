today we are looking at some of the worst crowdfunding projects in the world starting with this one the leaf mask it raised over four million dollars and claimed to be an n99 mask that's four levels better than the n95 but people got skeptical when their hepa filters weren't actually space-age tech at all if you look really closely there's a little diamond pattern on it just like toilet paper that's not a safety filter yikes you thought you were getting in 99 ply and it was one play people were so mad about this that they started to try to track down the creator of this scam and when they finally confronted him he he gave him the oldest line in the book how come you haven't contacted me i came by your house i wanted to ask you some questions i'm just heading to the airport you can reach out to me where where are you headed airport the airport what are you going to the airport for i think i can answer that question i think he suddenly got a need to go international is my guess all right i know it's ridiculous but it's gonna get worse next scam ladies and gentlemen do you remember this guys this is the uno brush raised 1.6 million dollars it's a toothbrush for every part of your mouth all at once sounds great right what could go wrong with a stylish danish mouth gag well it turns out a lot they've actually gone under yes they've declared bankruptcy in a statement that talks a lot about unforeseen challenges they basically say hey your money's gone and everybody who hasn't gotten the product isn't gonna get it and just like that they made a clean mistake done dumb joke sorry for the dumb jokes guys there's going to be a lot of them now before we go into our next scam i want to remind you don't forget ladies and gentlemen what month it is it's a coffee sill of christmas which means it's time to pump the stock it's absolutely free just like and subscribe and if we get to 1 million subs by the end of the month we are giving 10 000 to save the children's the actual charity thank you for all your support now back to the video guys this next one actually we have some good news about this is a story of crowdfunding scammers finally getting caught arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison that's right you thought it was harmless to promise everything and deliver nothing but the guy behind the dragonfly future phone finally found justice if you don't remember this flaming dumpster fire this was a hugely successful campaign that raised 5.7 million dollars so that everyone could get all their smart devices in one let's watch the promotional video and you tell me when you think this is full of it introducing the dragonfly by folding and transforming dragonfly provides the devices you already use in an elegant new form creating one device out of three to truly simplify your life with its dual displays everything from working playing and communicating becomes a breeze well you can't do that flip it around the he's a transformer guys i mean honestly who fell for this 5.7 million dollars to fund some unknown company that came out of nowhere that promised you the impossible on indiegogo just take my money i guess but eventually i guess people found justice because after over half a decade the creator has now been sentenced to eight years in prison and bear in mind eight years might seem like a long time but that's only a little longer than his backers had to wait without receiving a product now the last few products we're going to be reviewing on this episode of gofundme garbage it's going to be a little different i'm going to try to be ahead of the curve on this one these are products that are not scams yet but that i predict will either under deliver horribly or should be criminal to be worn outside you see style is not exactly a forte of these crowdfunding types they're too busy imagining the future to worry about such things as style or being able to wear something outside without being the laughing stock of your neighborhood so first up to the future we have metal detecting sandals these are made for people whose number one problem is wearing a metal detector on the beach and wishing that they could walk on metal detectors so the first thing you're gonna do when you're out looking for treasure is turn on your sandals and then you're going to well try to walk in these things now i want to watch watch these first steps as you just realize what an absolute disaster these things are that looks so uncomfortable and just try to imagine holding a conversation on the beach and your shoes are beeping at you and it's like oh hold on real quick i gotta turn off my shoes oh and of course since they're electric you have to plug them in at night so don't forget to plug in both of your sandals now if your eyes are getting tired of looking at horrible products we may have just the thing for you this is the idea it's a personal eye massager that looks like you're trying out for the x-men this thing easily met its funding goal and raised two hundred thousand dollars and i'm sure you'll see why in a second hmm [music] did that say truly wearable these have to be the least wearable things i've ever seen i mean imagine putting these on anywhere and they don't even look that comfortable to wear look at her eyes that this does not look like not look like you're having a good time [music] no oh dude it's great marketing great i gotta hand it to him it looks like great marketing but you honestly look like you're in a d-list marvel movie now last but not least might feel like a rerun to you this is a product called dmask and if it looks similar to the leaf mask it is similar but only with one difference this product might kill you here's the creator taking off this very form-fitting mask here and here's him walking around his neighborhood like a totally normal not at all a super villain guy it doesn't matter who we are what matters is our plan now why did i say it might kill you well very simple reason you see these two hoses right here in the back well these are the only ways to get oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out of the mask and since they have these long tubes you have to force a ton of air out of your mouth to clear the tubes and then you have to suck a lot of air back in to actually get fresh oxygen into your lungs and all of it goes through these tiny pinholes so yeah hopefully your thing doesn't actually get suctioned on your face because you could very easily suffocate yourself in this stylish mask literally just think about it most masks you're having air and carbon dioxide exchanged all throughout the mass this one you have two tiny tubes that are your only lifeline just just imagine trying to suck a long tube and it's got a bunch of tiny holes at the end trying to breathe through that it it's a travesty luckily for the founder the mask probably will never make a full seal and it was never funded so this is very unlikely to hurt somebody but the level of stupidity on these websites is truly remarkable so anyways i feel like we've gone through the full circle of people going to jail people who should go to jail and people outright scamming people that's basically it this is your money at work guys gofundme is where your dreams go to die thanks for watching i'll see you in the next one [music]
