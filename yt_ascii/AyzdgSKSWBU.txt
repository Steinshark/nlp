christianity is revealing to you the pattern of reality of how it is that complexity works how it is that any type of unity and multiplicity cohere but that also means that you you know it is calling you to actually participate in that in a real [music] way this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic [applause] world hello everyone as we are coming closer to theophany and in the western tradition epiphany which in the orthodox church is mostly surrounding the baptism of christ i thought we could look at one verse in the bible which talks about the baptism of christ chr i chosen a virgin in the gospel of st matthew could have chosen another virgin in another gospel to see just how much it packs in terms of understanding so many things related to christianity whether it is this idea of the new birth or being born again the idea of the new creation you know what it is that christ represent in the in the story all the meaning of theophany and the baptism of christ is of course contain in the icon of the baptism of christ but what i thought is we'll look at the text first and then maybe we'll come back to the icon a little bit later to see what it is that the icon contains in terms of this mystery now we'll go into the gospel of matthew chapter 3 where it says that as soon as jesus was baptized he went up out of the water at that moment heaven was opened and he saw the spirit spirit of god descending like a dove and a lighting on him and a voice from heaven said this is my son whom i love with him i am well pleased now of course this is seen in the orthodox tradition and in christianity in general as the revelation of the trinity which is that we hear the the voice of god the father of god above who says this is my son and then we see the spirit descending like a dove on on christ that comes out of the water and so it's seen as a revelation of the trinity but there's also something else really going on here which is that when christ comes out of the water and the spirit of god comes down on him like a dove what we're seeing is a reference to two stories in the old testament at the same time first is the very beginning of genesis where it says that the spirit of god hovered above the waters so at the beginning of genesis you have this before creation even starts you have this image of of these chaotic waters underneath and of the spirit of god above the waters right it's a it's a basic cosmic image of heaven above right because there's no difference between heaven spirit and air all of these things are related so when it says spirit in the old in the old testament or in the new testament for that matter it is the same as wind or you know what's above this this invisible thing that moves above that you can't see moving but you see its effects and so this is what is above and then below are the waters so it's referring to that but then it's also referring to the end of the flood of course because at the end of the flood noah sends out a dove and then that dove finds a branch by which it is able to know that the flood has abad and that the new world has begun and so what is all going on here so of course what we're seeing is a new beginning we're seeing a new creation in this particular instance christ appears as the tree the branch that the branch that the bird comes and finds and when we hear the word branch and when we hear the word tree we always have to remember that a tree is the is the pattern of reality itself that it is the fractal pattern of reality of unity splitting into multiplicity and that mult that new multip unity and now splitting again into multiplicities right the the structure of a tree which is which is that exactly one and many joining together in a in a in a pattern of hierarchy that is how reality lays itself out that is the structure of the world that is what connects heaven and earth together is this embodied structure that manifests itself right and so you could say that the tree is the connection between heaven and earth it is the invisible principles of reality manifesting themselves in an embodied form so that you can see the pattern of the heavens the pattern of reality in on the earth connected to the earth so it's like a a bridge between the two between the whole completely invisible patterns and the you know the chaotic primordial earth and so in this context now christ appears as this new connection between heaven and earth as a connection between heaven and earth and so what like i said was joined together is the first chapter of genesis that is the actual creation of the word of the world and now the the second world which is after the the death of the first world the flood and the beginning of a new world so christ is manifesting the beginning of a new world and then when we hear that the voice of god above saying this is my son that is this is the one that i have engendered this is the one that i recognize as my own the one that manif that is manifesting my identity now into the world that is of course the idea of what the son of god is we have a relationship again between this idea of the son of god and the branch that the bird finds in the world that manifests the the pattern of a new order which is being born in reality you know of course this is related of course in the old testament it's related somewhat of course to the voice of god as well that pulls reality pulls the world pulls creation out of the waters that separates the waters that pulls the earth out of the waters all of these things are being referred to of course it's amazing because it's using images so it can be very simple with just this one verse and bring out of of our knowledge all of these other images that appear in in the old testament okay now so what we're seeing importantly is to mostly to understand that what we're seeing is a new beginning a new heaven a new connection between heaven and earth or revealing the connection between heaven and earth and this can be represented in many ways it could be represented as for example a new creation a new kingdom right the kingdom a new kingdom is also very important to understand how it connects which is that a kingdom is similar to a tree that is a kingdom is the way way the world lays itself out or in an orderly way connected to a principality connected to a king which unites all this multiplicity together so a tree a kingdom you know and then of course it can be represented as a new birth as a new beginning and so once you start to see these images come together there are a lot of things in the bible that will start to make sense be even though it sometimes they seem obscure at the outset and so as we you know what i i wanted to do is to look at another text in scripture one which is very popular especially in kind of american christianity and see how we can make sense of it based on these images that christ himself brings up and this is of course john 3 so we're not going to read all of john 3 but i want to read a part of john 3 starting with verse three where christ encounters nicodemus so it says now now there was a pharisee a man named nicodemus who was a member of the jewish ruling council he came to jesus at night and said rabbi we know that you are a teacher who has come from god no one could perform the signs you are doing if god were not with him jesus replied very truly i tell you no one can see the kingdom of god unless they are born again it's like already it's like if you just look at what is being said here it is very obscure despite the fact that some people will tell us that this is as clear as crystal this is very simple right you you can't see the kingdom unless you're born again this is this is simple and obvious of course nicodemus asks him how can someone be born when they are old surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother's womb to be born so jesus answers very truly i tell you no one can enter the kingdom of god unless they are born of water and spirit flesh gives birth to flesh but spirit gives birth to spirit so he continues and said you should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again the wind blows wherever it pleases you hear its sound but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going so it is with everyone born of the spirit and of course nicodemus asked how can this be and so christ chr continues and reproaches him you know and says how don't you know these things you are a teacher of israel how is it that you don't know these things so what is it that christ is talking about here of course christ is referring if you've read the gospel and you've read even the gospel of st john if you read the other gospels you know that he's referring to the baptism he's referring to his baptism he's referring to what it is that happened to him at baptism but then in the in the same way he's not just referring to that he's referring to what it is that baptism means to what it is that the baptism is manifesting in the world because he says you have to be born of water and spirit you know that is what happens in the story of christ baptism he descends into the water and when he comes out of the water then the spirit comes down upon him and so the first thing in the image of baptism that has to happen is what what what happens at first st john what st john is doing st john is clearing the way right st john is the one that baptizes he's clearing the way he's making a level he's removing the old structures he's removing the old things and he's t and he's making the world level he's making things straight paving the the way for the lord to come and so that is the first part of the process you have to remove the old things and then you have to be born again of the spirit you have to be born again from heaven that is you have to re re receive a new identity which comes from above a new connection which comes from above and so that is exactly what christ is saying that needs to happen now this has to happen at every level right it's something that happens at every level of reality but has to happen if you want to see the kingdom of heaven if you want to be in the kingdom of heaven if you want to participate in the kingdom of heaven heaven you have to remove the old kingdom and then you have to be connected to the new kingdom which is the the kingdom of god and so what's interesting about what happens of course the way that christ reveals it is that it it is happening at every level it has to happen at every level of reality and so it of course has to happen internally and this is usually the way that a lot of you know kind of modern evangelicals will deal with it they say this thing has to happen internally that is that you have to remove the the sins right you have to confess the sins you have to kind of remove the old man and then you have to attach yourself to this to the the the spirit you have to attach yourself to that which is above and then you can live in the kingdom and then the kingdom will be manifested within you now that is of course true but it it also has to happen you know in terms of your actual participation in the church and so you have to actually be baptized that's why christ is actually baptized even though christ didn't need it christ is actually baptized to say for this to happen it's not just about a kind of mental game or a mental thing or or just a conviction you have to you also have to embody it in the world by being baptized and by receiving the spirit from above now in christianity this has become two sacraments which is the baptism and chrismation or baptism and confirmation that is there's a baptism from below and then there is this receiving of the the the anointing right from above the receiving of that which comes from above this and this of course in orthodoxy is seen as what we call chrismation which is an anointing on the person's body which is this image of light which comes down which influence which comes down from above and this has to to be let's say connected with an actual participation in the body of christ in the body of the church and an actual connection to an authority which is the fractal representation of this whole thing that is you can't just be on your own you also have to have someone who is manifesting this authority of god down upon you that that you participate in and so you can see that the the simple little verse of christ is representing not only the way that we are transformed and enter into the kingdom of god not only the way that we do it internally externally by actually being baptized and by receiving the the spirit but then it is really just once again an image of everything an image of reality and so you know if you want and if you want to to make a meal that you also have to do that that is that you have to level the ingredients so that they become a kind of potential for the the recipe and so you have to remove the peel you have to take away the stems you have to take the bone out or remove the skin or whatever it is that you're doing to the ingredients and then you have to align it attach it to an identity which comes down from above that is whatever it is the recipe that you're doing will then create the kingdom of that recipe within you know that you're going to make but that's true of anything it is just an image of the revelation of how reality works that is if you want to participate in any kingdom in any form of of of participation whether it's a family a team anything then this is the process there has to be a baptism which is that you have to remove your attachments to the things that came before you have to level the remainders of those of you have to you know clean out the remainders of your previous attachments that's a same thing that happens like if you start a new job right you have to cut your attachments to your old job you have to you know take your things out of that office you know take the take all the stuff out so that you're not you're not connected to that ancient identity anymore and then you have to come out of that transformation process come out of the waters and receive the new identity that you're going to participate in so hopefully this is helpful to understand that like i've say over and over christianity is revealing to you the pattern of reality of how it is that complexity works how it is that any type of unity and multiplicity cohere but that also means that you you know it is calling you to actually participate in that in a real way which is it's not just showing you the pattern of reality abstractly but calling you to be baptized to be chrismated and to enter into the kingdom in a very explicit practical way as well and so so i wish you all a blessed theophany i hope that that you that this was helpful to you and thanks for your support everyone i really appreciate it in these strange times and i will talk to you very soon bye-bye
