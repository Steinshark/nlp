do you have any idea what our all-time most profitable videos are are you kidding me well neither do i but i want to know so i asked the team to put together a list of our 10 biggest money makers and on camera i'll be trying to guess just how much we made on youtube adsense reaction goggles please wow that's a fast throw oh yeah james helped put together the list and he's gonna be here too i don't know what's on it either though oh you don't oh well you know what we do know is our sponsor smart deploy now powered by pdq.com it's zero touch zero headache pc management for it you can deploy windows apps and drivers from the cloud no vpn required get your free subscription worth over five hundred dollars at smartdeploy.com linus we're gonna have that linked down below [music] before you guys ask no this is not necessarily just going to be our videos with the highest view counts as we know both from our own experience and from talking to other youtube creators there are different topics or different entire categories on youtube that pay dramatically better or dramatically worse than the average okay here we go this is the 10th really opening the ultimate pc intel's 28 cores xeon w you know what the funniest thing about this video is we didn't even know if this was gonna be a video the main point of it was i think it had a super weird cooler inside it this is over three years ago and it's a stream this i kind of expected and i get asked this all the time people will say oh man i feel so bad because i subscribe to youtube premium so you're not getting any ad revenue is that bad for content creators and the answer is no it's not bad and the way that youtube premium pays out is not based on the view like ads based on an ad impression it's based on how much watch time you dedicated to that video all right this thing has 6.6 almost 6.7 million views so how much money do you think this thing made my general rule of thumb is per million views it's about two grand for us i'm gonna say 14 because a lot of this because it's a long stream we have the breakout between adsense and premium dollars how do you think it's allocated i think that for adsense the cpms are going to be on the lower side so i think it's going to be like 10 grand of adsense i'm going to revise it i'm going to say 15k another 5k of premium okay it's kidding me the total revenue is almost 34 grand'k not 5k for youtube premium and it's 15k not 10 for ad revenue that one we have a pretty good explanation for it's got keywords from major brands intel xeon it's long it was clearly engaging enough look at that thumbnail that's a good thumbnail it's just an excited dude by a big box the box has nothing on it all right producer man show us the ninth most profitable video no way the all aorus gaming pc build we like quadruple dipped on this thing so we get paid by a gigabyte to do an all aorus build which is not included in this this is also a stream also two and a half hours an extra half hour compared to the last one six points the same view count the last one was 33k right yeah i'm gonna say that it is 20 more no no no no no there's no way i'm gonna say it's 15 more 38 thousand dollars survey says 34. i'm over it's barely more the thing that's really baffling me here is the premium revenue that means that either that last half an hour of the video was so unengaging that people were tuning out at pretty much the same time or overall the video was less engaging and that sharp drop-off at the beginning was drop off here and then you had fewer people watching the entire rest of the video i mean between our our 10th and 9th most profitable videos the difference is only 675 that's close i didn't see that coming is this just all going to be streams then i don't think so let's see who has the best pc at ltt that's not a stream remember the quails i do remember the quills this one's hard for me to watch for other reasons they're long gone let's miss you tyler it's a good thumbnail you're holding this thing that people want but can't have this is another one that i looked at i went is this even a video because the inspiration for this one was that we did i believe who has the worst pc at ltt first that came first sponsored by intel and it was more obvious how the intel sponsorship would play into it because whoever had the worst pc was going to get an intel upgrade but this question is way more interesting to the audience but how do you what you're giving the that person with the best pc and upgrade it didn't make any sense your brain on the inside of this company this thing has 12.4 million views it's because everybody wants to know if you work here you must have a good pc so who has the best one oh wow you should have totally had me guess the premium versus ad revenue split i wouldn't have gotten it though on the previous ones the streams we were 50 50. this goes to show you guys how much of a difference it makes how long the content is i think this video is about 15 20 minutes long so that's even that's a pretty long video by youtube standards but even 12 million views is only worth 4 600 is that a six compared to 6 million views being worth what was it almost 20 and this is a sixth as long yeah our typical cpms lately have been actually have this down about eight bucks some other categories are way higher than that so that is the amount of money you get per thousand impressions here's a list email marketing and insurance and real estate are the highest it seems to be the kind of thing that like you only watch it if you're about to make a purchase decision yeah and it's a big purchase high intent vloggerpro.com i have no idea what their resources that they use to make this list really just the top google result i didn't vet this list at all fair enough all right let's look at the next video hive mind setup build this was our first full build stream and we only did it because lg sponsored us to do this weird ultra wide festival thing that they used to do we couldn't figure out a way to make it compelling content other than to just i don't know screw it let's just stream it this video went on to get over 5 million views which absolutely blew my mind and is the reason that we have done other pc building streams since then now this one i know made a ton of money because it was the one that raised the question for me in the first place what is going on with these live streams why are they performing so well and why are they so profitable as it turns out youtube's discovery algorithm for stream archives is actually different than youtube's discovery algorithm for vod context so you've got to remember guys when talk people talk about the youtube algorithm it is actually a family of algorithms and sometimes the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing sometimes that family don't get along they're not on speaking terms this one is a two to one premium to ad revenue split could it be that people hadn't figured out this whole long live streams youtube premium hack and we were getting a disproportionate amount of youtube premium revenue way back in 2018. tech viewers might be more likely early adopters of something like a youtube red or or premium yeah they could be maybe we just kind of lucked out and we hit it at the right time the playback based cpm is crazy high on this one but to the point where i almost wonder if it was specifically targeted that does happen you know when there's a big apple launch for example every time you go and watch a tech video it's like boom every building iphone ad iphone ad hit it the walmart pc this is just through sheer view numbers 14 million views this thing ended up doing the answer was yes by the way if you haven't seen the video already and you don't feel like sitting through' minutes and i'm willing to bet that this is a double whammy of having a ton of views and also being a long-ish video so it'll have significant premium revenue' minutes this is the first kind of topical video that we did where we had to get this immediately hit it hard let me go back to my general rule which is about 2 000 per million so i'm gonna say this thing did like thirty thousand dollars in adsense alone and i'm gonna give myself another five grand in premium that's only three that's less than the last one oh crap well look at what 38. it's 14 million so 38 for hey i got the first one right almost no premium 337 from ad revenue cpm's the lowest of our top performers so far that's right but that makes sense because if you're getting that big youtube premium money from longer form content so we're into our top five now oh yeah you knew this okay well this is just one of the top performing videos on the channel ever i took so much flack for this video where apparently i was just like mean and or rude scotty and i are fine everything's fine i was super tired the big problem we ran into here was that i set out to go into this weird tech mall full of weird stuff supposedly and it just had all the same freaking stuff from the same freaking brands that we have back here in north america so my whole angle for the video was falling apart in front of my eyes i've heard you say before that you're surprised that this ever did as well as it has so why do you think it did i think it's just the sheer drama and energy of me not knowing if it's a video okay scotty played his role perfectly he was the ultimate tour guide and that's one of the reasons that i'll often tell you guys no no i don't want to see it don't tell me anything about this product before i can sit down and experience it so it's like going to an ethnic restaurant with someone who really knows the menu and knows the cuisine and with someone who just really loves food and just that raw joy and excitement and and fun of that it's just it's great there's a reason it works so well are you asking me out i wasn't but i'm not saying no i am asking you to check out our amazing water bottles over on lttstore.com cheers all right how much money does this make i mean you spoiled it you saw it already 40 grand it's got to be almost all adsense right yep pretty much all adsense number four i wrote this video faster internet for free this is just like 1.1.1 dns oh no this is such a clickbaity title man it's not clickbait it's clicky it's click worthy yes af because it is what we said it was it does give you faster internet for free in 30 seconds so how much do you think i made for daddy i don't like being called daddy but let's say 42 it seems like we're getting for 43 do you think no premium this is the lowest youtube premium ratio we've seen look at this hump because this is the shortest video and nobody's watching the whole thing there's a hump here man like show me how to do it and then i think we show them how to do it and then we just explain dnses and stuff and like who cares i wonder would never make videos like this anymore we would never have that much exposition in a row because we know it's terrible for retention now but this was this was four years ago and this thumbnail oh pushes it over the edge it makes it look like there's a setting or a router you buy or something i know i'm so sorry that was totally on purpose next number three so this this warms my heart building a 500 amd gaming pc this one performed crap out of the gate and then just went swamp 113 days after posting it went is this a stream archive or is this a vaude go back to your search look at this streamed there was a problem with the stream vod so it got all screwed up we had to edit something out you can see the runtime of these is actually different and we had to upload it as a vod something that we always avoid and that's why i remember it having a slow start because normally when you upload a duplicate of a thing you just streamed youtube only gives you so many notifications to each subscriber per day so you start notifying too many times and they just go nope forget it you don't get any more notifications and the monies there it is 43 000 man so i could buy like a car like a nice car a new car just for building a 500 amd gaming pc we should just upload videos like this every day we won't though and the reason for that is that unless you do all the other groundwork making you know really cool other content no one will care about your opinion on a 500 amd gaming pc so it's not as simple as just well let's just cash in we got the formula guys yeah let's just do these every day okay so we're on the podium now let's see which video gets a silver medal second most profitable ever building a pc using wish.com this is our top performing video ever it's the most mainstream how can you not click on this i seem to recall that we were borderline late on the wholewish.com trend now we already know it's been done yeah how have we not done the home theater with wish.com yet we should do everything using onlywish.com yeah that this is something we actually do need to make a series we should do like a streaming setup using the stupidest thing is we've done other concepts that we're riffing on this one the all aliexpress pc did pretty well itself yeah it doesn't slap the same wish.com man it's garbage and you love it this is a great thumbnail the the hand on the head obviously means exasperation frustration but you're still smiling you're almost like damn wish.com people it's clearly gonna be hilarious right now i know that wish.com and other online scammy type sellers do spend a lot on online advertising so i would guess this is well above our average cpm i'm gonna say this boy at 22 million views is probably like 60 grand oh let's see oh my god it was published on my birthday 67 000 and let's look at the cpms i nailed it for adsense though but totally wrong take on the on the cpms but for one that has so many views that's pretty good all right are we ready for the number one oh my gosh i love building computers okay this one obviously is super long so almost four hours that's part of it but yeah this title also was like one of our first like just troll titles like pc go burr damn apple yeah this was me just sitting there going we need to build some workstations nobody else with the experience to build machines that we're gonna rely on is available to do it so the only justification we can have to allocate four plus hours of my time to just building computers is if we point a camera at it this only has 83 000 likes the actual engagement with this video is extremely low only one percent of viewers engage with only 10 million views is it even a good video i don't even think so i love watching people build computers i can't afford yeah fair enough what i want to know is if we made enough on this stream to buy all of those computers well how much do you think all those computers are worth their threadrippers i'm gonna say 80k and i just pulled that out of my button just like this video 74. that's nuts wow i think the big thing we've learned is that evergreen content is the king because you can't rely on just that initial view spike you need something that's going to continue to be served to people and continue to be clicked on for years to come otherwise there's there's no way it's going to be a top tier performer for this long live streams long live streams and you get lots of views so should we do a live stream every week that was the guidance for a while remember if people know it's on the same bad time and same bad channel then they can plan for it right when we do live streams like this they're just so random so random and the thing too though is not every live stream performs like that here let's let's pull pull up the tab we've done lots of live streams but you can see that even the ones that do perform you know these have three million views they don't necessarily perform like that and the drop-off is pretty steep unboxing a surprise gaming pc i don't see why that would perform so much worse than that one where i'm sitting next to the box i don't know i've waited so long for this with the black question mark it's clear it's not a silver bullet yeah and this one's 2 hours and 40 minutes maybe we should just go more straight shooter with the title what was this one i think pcs finally became like affordable again or something like that when did this one go up no it doesn't tell me the year this was two months ago okay there's still time still time to hear about your sponsor oneplus the oneplus 10 pro 5g is officially available
