i remember seeing the press releases for this thing and thinking whoa that seems so cool but also who in their right mind would ever buy it i guess now we've got the answer because an ltt viewer from milwaukee put the galaxy gtx 460 whdi in the mail for us and after 10 years i finally get to be hands on with to my knowledge the only wireless gpu that has ever existed what makes it a wireless gpu i'm so glad you asked on the back of the gpu aside from your dvi and displayport you will find five antennas which supposedly allow this graphics card to send an uncompressed low latency 1080p image to supported devices what supported devices i don't know how does it work i guess we're gonna find out and who sponsored this video well our sponsor signal rgb with signal rgb you can control and sync your favorite rgb devices all from one app best of all it's free so download signalrgb at the link in the video description because of the age of this product it was released before linus media group was actually founded as a company we're going to be doing the video in a bit of an older classic ltt style starting with an overview of the box what's included oh good driver installation disk whoa it includes the whdi receiver so theoretically we could actually use this on any modern display antennas power cable and this is it right this is the whole sales pitch free your hd content from your pc and display it on your hd tv up to 100 feet away through walls with uncompressed less than one millisecond quality hahaha on some alcohol handy what what did they change their mind about here using hdmi something and whdi you can now stream your movies music and pictures to the big screen in glorious 1080p hd with support for hd audio have you ever wanted to play the latest directx games okay so it has one sales pitch reiterated three times use this thing with a tv that is far away completely wirelessly what and what hdmi 11 4a oh hdmi 1.4 a so it was probably 1.4 b or something and they interesting there were a number of things that raised questions about this product at the time of its release first of all galaxy which has since been renamed galax is a sub brand of palette who also owns a number of other brands gain word daytona vivku you want an expert vision none of which have ever really had a strong north american presence other than maybe game word but gameward was a long time in the rear view mirror by the time galaxy was trying to make inroads second of all was the price it was released in january of 2011 and was sold for a price of 499 dollars which for a 60 class nvidia card might not raise a lot of eyebrows today but to put it in context at the time was a whopping 315 dollars more than the version that didn't have wireless display so it was kind of in a no man's land where it was priced like a premium top-tier gaming gpu but then positioned as a replacement for a media center gpu which would have cost you half as much as even a 460 which was considered overkill for that at the time this is an accessory package the likes of which i have rarely if ever seen for a gpu what are we looking at here first you've got one of the fancy danciest hdmi cables that i think i've ever seen included with anything we've got a usb a to usb mini b wow these are impact hell am i looking at a female usb-8 a mini b and a male usb a to mini b izarre dvi to vga adapter that's pretty standard fare i can't believe the condition this thing is in it's open box but as far as i can tell this stuff has never been touched here's a power adapter for the receiver dock oh yeah i know ghost spell power very reputable oh yeah yeah very famous famous brand user manual what do they have to say for themselves oh my god yeah that's definitely dating itself a little bit fun fact by the way even though this gpu family the 400 series is no longer getting active driver support we were able to find a driver that supports windows 10 and is only from about four years ago so we should be able to play most modern games on it assuming there's enough performance whoa this thing has like weights in it to keep it from moving i guess it's a weighted base station for ah here we go you know what i'm gonna leave the peels on i'm gonna leave the peels on out of respect for the viewer who lent us this i don't maybe they like their peels they're an andy type character so this is the whdi receiver hub which is not to be confused with why die which eventually became a modern standard that we can still make use of today and is built into many tvs it was built into some media devices including tvs but as far as we can tell it never really evolved and amounted to anything the website is still up but as of filming this video it has a picture of a playstation 3 on the home page meaning that it doesn't look like there's much in the way of active development we also have seen this type of technology continue to get support so for example we did a video recently on a wireless hdmi solution that can simply be added to any product rather than being baked in which is in retrospect the direction in the industry was obviously going to go rather than forcing consumers to buy a completely new wireless video card every time they wanted to upgrade at a significant premium there's our receiver dongle which needs to plug into the wall and i don't know what this usb port is for but presumably something are you getting all this brandon maybe just get a shot of it like that user's manual mini hdmi okay nvidia control panel sli oh my god yeah sli was supported on 60 class cards it wouldn't surprise me to see an sli connector on this thing i can't even imagine i wonder if the mismatch bios would be a problem if you tried to sli it with a non-wireless one holy crap this thing is glorious wait is this rusting or is this no no it can't be rust no no no no it's residue it's residue if you want to talk to galaxy which doesn't exist anymore then you can call that number hold on this has got it yeah this has got to be anodized aluminum there's no way yeah yeah it comes off it comes off jake it's not a rusty boy pretty cheap for a 500 gpu oh my goodness okay what are we looking at here pretty basic board layout oh in terms of specs so what was a 460 one gig of vram a mere 336 shaders it used the same fermi architecture as the much maligned gtx 480 although the 460 was actually a pretty sensible card it didn't have the same power consumption problems it's got support for displayport i believe this is 1.1 i want to say hdmi 1.4 a although you'll notice that the hdmi port is conspicuously absent and of course dvi that's because the only hdmi-ish port on this thing is these five antennas why does it need five antennas you might ask ah because 60 gigahertz wireless didn't exist yet these days 1080p 60 wirelessly no problem i mean we've got wireless vr headsets that are doing far higher than that with incredibly low latency and indistinguishable visual quality but these are all five gigahertz so in order to reach the three gigabit per second of advertised throughput it needed five five gigahertz streams at 40 megahertz each at least that's our understanding of it as you guys can probably imagine there's not a whole lot of people at galaxy that we can talk to about this technology [laughter] man i freaking love it an advantage of five gigahertz is that unlike the 60 gigahertz that we use for wireless hdmi today theoretically at least if they're advertising is anything to go by we should be able to punch through walls with it and that's thanks at least partially to the quality of service features that are included with the product that allow it to analyze the streams of data figure out which elements are most important and ensure that those ones get through how it's doing this with one millisecond latency i have absolutely no idea and honestly i kind of just plain don't believe it but that's what this is for we're gonna install it we actually don't know if it works yet oh my gosh this is flipping wild now theoretically we shouldn't really need to configure anything about the wireless stream it should just work and it features encryption so again theoretically no one should be able to snoop on your video stream because i don't know what kind of videos you're watching in your in your full hd tv but maybe you don't want people knowing about it that's all i'm saying it's also hdcp 2.0 complaints shut up it's hdcp compliant too i mean that's pretty cool because you got to remember too that this is a product of its time right at the time optical hdmi cables were not really a thing so transmitting hdmi over long distances particularly to a projector or something like that was very difficult it's the sort of thing i never would have spent money on like even if i had it at the time i don't think because you know you're buying into a dead upgrade path but it's definitely cool imagine having this hanging off the back of your computer probably wouldn't use that hdmi cable yeah i'm using the hdmi cable no i want it this is a wireless hdmi cable okay it's quality it's gonna work you just wait man this is one of those like i feel like i feel like a young tech enthusiast again you know it takes me back to 10 years ago when this stuff came out and i was like well that's so cool but i'll never get a chance to look at it or touch it so i'm i'm making up for those lost opportunities now this is this powered on or what it looks like an ir receiver does this thing have a remote again this wasn't the only product to use this technology it is possible that it had some kind of intercompatibility with other devices for example at best buy at the time you could get a whdi hub for about 300 bucks so actually not that much less than the cost of you know buying this fully integrated device that comes with everything you need is there a power light on there there no there isn't a power light there's a network light and a video light is this yeah let's just let's just turn it on and see what happens huh okay what are the odds this just works painlessly and that's why this technology was so successful in the long run whoa shut up shut up no way shut up i have two lights on the back of the gpu i have two lights on this thing oh my god did this just oh my god work no way that is freaking crazy never been turned on before immediately works no no that's probably just the drivers grabbing it we set up this windows install with a 480 because it was something that we already had on hand and it would use the same family of drivers so it's probably just sort of picking that up oh no okay device manager come on buddy you know what come feel this jake jake come here oh my god look at it it's jittering okay but hold on hold on the latency whoa would you know it's wireless oh my god no no don't do that don't do that just move the mouse smooth mouse it's not bad would you know it's wireless no i just think it's like i would just think the cable is shoddy which may be true i mean it was folded for 10 years in half oh we're totally gonna have to game on this right oh yeah oh yeah we got a game on this we might have to play some older games you know yeah but we might need to see a source never mind cs go jake wait what this girl could run 2010 didn't it come out like 2012. hey okay wait the frequency hurts whoa there's like an overlay and stuff oh interesting believe this [ __ ] worked out of the box that is wild okay you're seeing the real deal here guys this is the only way literally the only way that we could capture what's going on here that benq monitor is a super unique item it has almost every input under the sun and most importantly it has an output it has hdmi pass-through kind of like some capture cards now normally we could use hdmi pass through on a capture card to capture what we're doing while also outputting it but because we want to show you guys any degradation of quality or jitteriness that's coming from the wireless connection we actually need to capture what comes through the monitor rather than output what comes through a capture card so our capture pc here is coming whoo out of the monitor yeah that's it it's coming out of the monitor nothing else has gone right today but everything here is just immediately working i'm so happy is it 60 or 30. i mean i'll record it 60. yeah it's 1080 60. it's not interlacing i think it's just like blocking and compression artifacts on your side yeah yeah interesting i wonder if they're faking the 1080pness of it because looking at this guys whatever they're saying about there not being any compression is clearly a lie watch how far this is across the screen versus how far this is across the screen see the window deforming as i move it back and forth i have seen an effect like this on cheap tablet screens i've seen an effect like this on lcds in very cold weather so where the where the switching speed of the pixels is affected by the actual almost freezingness like the the gel like state of the liquid crystals i've never seen it on a wired connection but then again i still haven't because this is clearly wireless we haven't seen it yet but apparently a feature of this quality of service feature that it has is that some aspects of the image can be lost altogether or not update altogether if they are deemed to be less important apparently nothing we were doing was considered important in that case hey there it is it is 1080i you're right there must be de-entralizing on the receiving box yeah so they're actually completely faking the 1080p aspect of it now hold on just a gosh darn minute here in glorious 1080p i guess they don't technically say that the source is 1080p so as long as your device supports upscaling 1080i to 1080p then you will be experiencing it in maybe not glorious 1080p but 1080p nonetheless and not fooling around on the desktop though let's play a video game how pissed off would you have been if you were advertised glorious 1080p and you got this jittery mess for five hundred dollars but as angry as i am the flip side is that there was absolutely nothing else even close to this and once i'm in content not gonna lie guys it's not nearly as noticeable okay this is totally playable especially in a game that has like you know ambiance you know like got film grain or or fog effects or anything like that okay hold on i want to look at it head on here [music] there's a little bit of jitter you can see it see how he's kind of bouncing up and down a little bit everyone just calls me coach but when you're playing like really playing in the zone it's not the kind of thing that you'd be likely to notice with that said one of the use cases that they advertise for it is multimedia like watching hd movies in a movie this would drive me absolutely bonkers not cool not cool galaxy yeah let's try okay yeah let's try something a little more demanding i think we figured out the weird usb cables it seems like you can also wirelessly transmit usb all you've got to do is inject usb2 there we go into the back of the gpu then you get a female usb hanging off the back of this guy huh and theoretically i think it'll just work huh probably not okay i have no idea where we would find drivers for something like that at this point honestly it's bad enough close up like this that i really don't think we even need to see it not gonna lie in a game like this where every little bit counts this is not this is not cutting it not cutting it even a little the really good latency experience we were having before i think was due to the relatively low complexity of the image oh it looks awful now yeah i don't even think we need to i don't think there's anything else sure give it a shot i wonder if i look up you should watch a video it's gonna look bad but this feels bad man oh we're in a real match so you'll have to wait maybe you're just bad man no it feels bad i hope oh god see what i mean lean back you're blocking my signal [laughter] oh my god god whoa does it affect it that much no no no i might have just been a random spike you're not sniping everybody else is oh god no no not even a little xbox controller oh no i can't believe console people deal with it i know i mean they don't deal with this anymore not by a long shot let's try some video oh my god look at the move oh god yeah the fact that they advertised this as uncompressed if anyone had ever actually bought it there would have been lawsuits this looks fine yeah you can't tell on camera that much actually it seems oh we got screen caps hopefully it wasn't so bad the second time the first time i looked at it and all the crabs were moving so i just like walking oh yeah that's awful oh look at the legs that's that quality of service right there oh yeah he needs legs anyway right over [music] oh there's just stuff just missing sometimes though so
