hi i'm janspeller i'm your host for the municipal plus online job fair which will be in two weeks and i thought i record a quick video about it and show you a bit like behind the scenes and stuff which you as a candidate don't see and probably as an interested employer that's stuff which you will see once you sign up for the sponsorship of the program and i thought i'd you know just talk a little bit through this so the event was set and as a two-day event once in the afternoon once in the evening to kind of accomplish that you know european hosted audience can join from all of those days and that asia and america also has a chance to either run events and as you can see for the event in two weeks already two companies have signed up at sponsors lumix and ivu technology traffic technologies and thank you very much for you know sponsoring this event that again makes it possible for me to kind of you know continue this work and improve the event there's some improvements i'm going to talk about that later also software i can think that have signed up again and i just think there is again there and i don't know if soft drive maybe they were there last time i don't remember that so much but definitely companies are returning and they're successful finding a lot of candidates i'm gonna have some statistics in a minute let's go [music] to this is a view kind of the recruiting view okay where you for the first view is just you know it's like you see how many candidates you have from which countries the statistics and as a test i only have like one submission for testing so you see this is from the philippines if you scroll a bit then you see the field where like all your submissions are and then [music] again you can see like a general overview over those submissions as a statistic this to me very important to give you those statistics because that makes it easy to communicate that with your boss or as anyone else is your team you know what was the result of the event how many candidates came and if i go back to the can to the event the event is on the 28th and the 29th and it's three hour long but if you sign up as a sponsor you're able to get candidate profiles all the time okay you're not limited to the event you will be able to attend the event to talk to a lot of candidates there get them to know and have a bit of fun with them but you will receive a lot of cvs of people which are not able to attend in those three hours for whatever reason maybe you know they they they need to work or maybe they you know have something else on that day but they still you know are looking for a new position and they would like to submit so this is the the really the advantage of sponsoring the event is they make it helps me and making the event more successful that i can communicate a bit better and more visual with your logos which i do and it gives you a bit more exposure on the website and the communication and also it gives you the full exposure to every candidate that wants to submit in that phase okay and this is a view where you basically can overlook at all can have a look at all the candidates currently implemented i plan to also have a search there that you can search through your submissions and like particularly like search on the country the candidate name but also like what they have in their message standing and other things and the way the candidates submit to you is via a form and yes this is the employer view of the cv upload form okay so normally this view this form looks a little bit different but for an employer this is the way it looks like this is the way they can choose from you know from which area do they want to have candy dates a new thing which i implemented now is the relocation level and also which i'm going to add is the level like i want to work remote and like how remote should it be like should be country continent international again i added remote here to that but i'm going to remove that again because that's a bad mix up so it's going to be like you're going to have like non-country and continent and international as remote options too and in the form for the candidates there's gonna be a drop down with it and can save it i wanna be in the country remote i wanna continental motor are just internationally available as a remote candidate and companies then also can decide if they want to see that and they can filter after that then we have the cpus plus skills where candidates can give a profile but companies can do the same thing a company can say i want to see dates which no cute and i want them to speak c 17 because we are planning to go to q6 and then that's important and i'm probably going to add a bunch more in that too like like cmake for example it's just you know build systems is not covered in here and maybe you want to have that but let's say you also want to have more than c plus plus and you're interested in people which are windows all linux and op is important in your code base and now you can say it's a minimum match okay you can say i want a candidate which has at least three of these okay they don't have to have everything per default they have to have one but maybe as a company you want to be picky then you pick one you'll pick like three or that's up to you you know it's it's it's gonna of course you know water down your results it's it's gonna be more precise than the the series you get but you're gonna get less cvs then i have a similar choice for the fields of work people we have people experience and working in okay like desktop and embedded and then this will filter and and in the form for the candidates they can you know just give you this profile of where they have work experience candidates also give the years of experience and as a as an employer you can say this is the minimum of experience and years we want and per default when you sponsor the event this all will be empty okay you will receive every cv you will matches every candy date and i plan also to have this available as a search so if you matches everyone you still can search through those candidates with this form and even if you met with the candidate the candidate still has to decide to match with you as a company it's not automatically that they just you know get shared it's still their decision if they want to share that with them and when we talk about candidates this is an overview area i have a block rule i have a block published about this which is a bit more precise and a bit more text but here we have a bit more images to look at the z plus plus skills of the last event when we first had this data or first set the form worked like that for the first and the time in the last event and this is the candidate results which we had like from 60 candy dates over 50 new secrets plus 11. linux was very popular see that was p and super plus 17 are kind of the top five and things like boost and cute that's important to your code base you might want to filter after that that's like one of the practical things this form allows and when we see with the fields i added robotics as a new field maybe as you spotted that wasn't available the last time and this is both of that is multi multiple choice for candidates of course so this is the results for the chosen fields and there you see that we have a lot of candidates which have experience in desktop and embedded and server and if we look at the years of experience this is also kind of interesting to see you know from which fields people come but also how many how much experience do they have and i find that particularly interesting to see that of course we have you know more junior developers and people with not 20 years experience looking but also the excess there's a few of them but like 20 25 years of experience wow that's cool from the countries this is like the first event and the second event on the right the first event had a lot more sponsors with companies from various places in europe though we had a lot candidate response in europe but of the other reason was that the the second event which had a lot of candidates again from india and india has always been popular with reform and i have a lot of reach in india the second event was at the end of may and that was not hugely popular with the companies but also with the candy dates so while we have like more submissions from more countries it's a bit a different makeup and i suspect this is growing again especially if we get more companies to sponsor this and to be behind this the whole event is as a format it's unique and it's very successful and i hope that the next event in in september we will see a lot of candidates and companies talking to each other and that brings me back to the job fair page thanks again to lumix and ivu traffic technologies if you as a as a company want to sponsor this that's very easy that's available here if you register for a sponsored table yes also listed kind of what that gives you and there's a free table option which will give you a two seat table in the conference and it will be hosted in hobilo and actually let's close it with a quick preview into who below that is the september meeting which is on thursday which is not a job fair but it also has this launch and this launch the candidates will be able then your logos will be in in this place we'll be able to find you and they have some other ideas which posting on who will you know change the event but for now we're going to hang out on the launch and you want to have be able to talk to three candidates which i think is a good number and yeah with that thank you for listening if i go back then i'm happy to see all of you at the conference of candidates yeah candidates i should talk to too candidates are often very interested in all the things which employers know so be sure you kind of link to your career page in the logo because that's something i didn't point out the logos are linked okay so candidates actually can click on that and yeah if you click on your career page then people directly will land and in your job offerings and know where where to go for that and with that thank you for listening hope to see many many of you at the event in the end of september
