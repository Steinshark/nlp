this video i'm going to tell you how to learn the javascript programming language really fast i think it's an excellent choice for beginners for many reasons first of all javascript is a very high level language so it is very easy for beginners to learn number two you can build a lot of cool stuff with it like pretty much the whole entire web runs on javascript number three it's probably the most in demand language in the world alongside python probably tied with it most of the jobs are in web development so therefore if your goal is to get a job as a software engineer really quickly and javascript is one of the best choices for you step number one is that you need to learn programming fundamentals and for this literally just type on youtube like right now like after this video you just type on youtube javascript programming basics or javascript fundamentals and literally just pick any of them because most of them will probably teach the same things it's just about which sort of teaching style you prefer concepts that you should focus on in this stage are basic programming concepts like loops how functions work what are variables what are types how the program flows what it actually means to run a function to define a function what are methods at this point if you're watching this video i assume that you sort of decided that you wanted to get into web development because that is really the area where javascript shines after you've done that step two is to pick a web developer curriculum for an excellent free option i would choose the odin project i think it's probably the most popular online web developer curriculum you just follow me at your own pace it has a bunch of practice projects along the way this is personally the curriculum that i did when i first started getting into web development i actually didn't end up finishing it for reasons which we'll discuss in a moment other options include free code cap a lot of their courses are also javascript slash web dev focus i personally did not enjoy free code camp that much but it's also a resource that many people enjoy the downside with the audit project and a lot of these free resources are that they usually text space so essentially in the audio project each lesson it will be linking you to a lot of different external articles and i found that studying by a sort of text-based articles was not the most engaging way for me to learn personally so if i was starting oh well what i would probably do is pick a video course something from udemy or xero to mastery's full web developer curriculum most recording courses i do nowadays are from zero to mastery it is paid but it's just one subscription that gets you access to all of these different courses what you could do is do the web developer curriculum then go into the advanced javascript course and then the 20 javascript portfolio projects course all just for the same subscription and i am affiliated with them because i love them so much so if you want 10 off you can check out my code down below in the description whichever curriculum you choose completing this step is probably going to take you a couple of months but then again many people have completed it in a lot less time it just depends on how much time you have to put into it but first let's talk about morning routines i used to just open instagram at 7am and before i knew it the morning was pretty much gone but luckily i found morningbrew who are today's sponsor morningbro is a free daily newsletter delivered monday through sunday that gets you up to speed on business finance and tech in just five minutes this means i can finally be up to speed on what is going on in the world without having to spend time reading through all the junk that i'm not actually interested in and you can also learn some very interesting things here like for example just today i was reading about how meditation apps are going down in uses and this was really interesting to me because i use these apps myself so if you're interested in business finance or tech there's literally no reason not to subscribe because it's completely free and takes only 15 seconds to sign up to sign up for free by using morningbrewdaily.com internetmadecoder or click the link in the description thank you for morning brew for sponsoring this video and making these videos possible with many other languages at this point i would recommend you to also learn computer science fundamentals by doing something like cs50 but i think if you're going into web development learning computer science fundamentals at least early on is not nearly as important because when you're building websites it's simply not that important to know like complex algorithms and data structures this is stuff you want to learn eventually but at this point if literally your goal is just to get a job as a web developer i would probably just focus on learning programming and web development concepts first step number three is build a lot of simple projects and probably step number two and step number three will sort of happen at the same time as because as you do your web developer curriculum they will include a lot of practice projects for you to do at least if the curriculum is good it's easy to think that you are actually learning but if you've just been watching tutorials without actually putting the stuff into practice you have no idea how to code bro just code it up just do it yourself and you will actually be humbled when you open your empty code file you will actually remember a lot less than you think but once you go through with it those things are going to actually be ingrained into your brain and you can move on to the next step which is start learning some intermediate javascript concepts specifically object-oriented programming again probably during your curriculum whichever one you're following they're also going to teach this essentially to learn to understand what a class is what it means to create an instance of a class why object oriented programming is so important and so popular nowadays and at this point you also want to start thinking about a slightly more complex slash bigger project that you want to build and get started with it and this is the part where you're actually learning just the whole lot i remember the first times when i was building full websites i was doing the cs50 web development course first time when i was building websites this is really the time when i felt like oh my god like literally my programming and i was like jumping up like every hour when i was coding up something i had to like look up all these things like google how to start up a web server all these things i was learning so much so i can't stress enough how important it is again find exciting projects for you to do when i first started learning to code i first learned the basics of python but then right after i got into web development so essentially what i've just described is almost exactly what i did except i had also done cs50 and then the cs50 follow-up was on web development because i was also very excited to learn about computer science concepts at this point this is also the point when you'll probably know enough about programming and maybe you've been doing a lot of research in the different areas of programming to really answer the question of whether web development is actually the area that you want to specialize in whether you're actually interested in building websites and writing javascript and i actually found that at this point this probably wasn't the area for me and i described in my other video about python and javascript so i did actually end up sort of switching over to focusing more on python and that's why i still write more python nowadays but what i'm now gonna describe to you is what i sort of would do and probably what i will do eventually once i sort of get back into javascript go into a lot of the more advanced stuff so the next step i would learn is some more advanced javascript concepts and then general concepts about modularizing your code and just writing better code and as i'm starting my full-time job i'll obviously be learning about a lot of these things along the way whichever programming language i will be writing in my job because a lot of the concepts are very similar across languages and again if you did the zero to mastery web developer curriculum before with the same subscription they have a course on advanced javascript which i actually plan to do at some point very soon because there's a lot of holes there which even i haven't really learned about javascript yet so after you do all of these steps you are now going to be a pretty good javascript developer congratulations but you still have a problem even if you build a bunch of really awesome portfolio projects to pass the resume stage you're still not going to be able to get a job unless you learn to pass the dreaded coding interview and to do that you're finally going to have to learn some computer science concepts namely data structures and algorithms because these are the things that most big tech companies actually test in their interviews so it's absolutely crucial that you take the time to do that next and luckily for you i made this video right here where i described you exactly how i learned data recognition algorithms as well as the exact step-by-step path that i recommend you take i also have my own data structures and algorithms tutorials coming up on this channel where i describe in my own words how i understand these topics you absolutely must hit that subscribe button right now so that you don't miss them but first you have to watch this video right here
