ladies and gentlemen chess is hard watching chess is hard playing chess is hard and learning chess is hard but on this channel we try to do things in a way that make the chess journey a little bit less hard and in this video in particular i'm going to be diving into what i believe to be the single greatest mistake that something like 95 to 99% of chess players do incorrectly in their games and it basically revolves around one question and that question is what does my opponent want to slightly rephrase that question it would be does my opponent have any threats does my opponent have any desires in this particular position i've asked a bunch of my subscribers to submit games they're all very brave for doing so i'll be going through four games that my subscribers lost so we can address this fundamental issue and before we jump into the games today i'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video surf shark surf shark is a vpn or a virtual private network which allows you to encrypt

sponsored gotham my friends i understand that chess is a difficult game and frequently when you are playing a game let's say on your phone or your computer you might not be actively thinking about the fact that you're going to end up in a gotham video a short while later i understand that and the truth is that many of us just play chess we don't necessarily study it like we do school subjects but this game was submitted to me and in this game and all the others we will be addressing the fundamental question of what does my opponent want and whether that was addressed or not all right and the last game of this video will be a game where all of those questions were addressed very very well it was a very high level game so this first game wi opens up with the kings pawn on 700 rated players in the rapid portion rapid rating and the gotham subscriber with the black pieces plays the caroan white plays queen f3 because they're 700 and white is still trying to win the game in four moves with a scholars mate scholars mate doesn't work against d5 and black already enjoys a very comfortable position from the caroan now white here plays bishop here the reason why white played bishop to e2 is because well white wanted to go there that's you know and white didn't really think it through so white decides well i wanted to move my bishop anyway so let me move my bishop now at this point you can already begin asking like what does my opponent want but the truth is that black already got what they want and black takes the entirety of the center this is perfect this is excellent white plays d3 at this point it's really difficult to answer what does white one if i'm if i'm being honest with black i'm just going to do this this and castle i don't like that black plays knight e7 it's a little bit passive from my liking but it's a little bit too early to judge pawn takes pawn takes knight d2 yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't move that knight to c6 i there's a knight that could go there in one move you understand what i'm saying but again not exactly the biggest deal knight h3 what does white want i'm being honest still kind of difficult to say and now now we have a problem now i have a problem with the way black is handling this because black is not castling black is not finishing up their development black is not bringing out the bishop black plays bishop takes h3 that is a non-starter for me a good rule of thumb my friends is if you don't have a good reason to trade a bishop for a knight if it doesn't damage your opponent's pawn structure if it doesn't create a tactical possibility for you if you cannot explain why you are trading the bishop for the knight don't do it and if the explanation is what does my opponent want knight g5 queen f7 mate it might be time to stop taking hallucinogens because that is not possible for a variety of reasons the queen can't go over the pawn the pawn is also covering that square so all right good rule of thumb bishop d6 knight f3 and now again can't stress this enough we're not what are we doing we we can't we can't even explain certain moves that are being played right now there's no explanation for these moves if you ask me what does my opponent want probably something over here right but is that worth you know dealing with if you're worried about the queen trade the queen if you're worried about getting m it right what does my opponent want active queen but we can't explain this move what does my opponent want some attacking ideas okay if we're worried about the queen again i would try to trade it yet we're not castled we shouldn't push pawns now what does my opponent want they want to open the position that's what they want to do because right black also opened the position and i i don't support this i don't support opening our king and trading off pieces in front of our king i don't like that but it's still in okay position according to the computer but now this and that move at the 700 level definitely looks like it makes sense but what does my opponent want they're going to want our king we left our king in the center you've got to be careful leaving your king in the center and now white is totally winning white doesn't find the best way but what does my opponent want my opponent wants to get out of the fork right like right now white is panicking so what does my opponent want they're trying to get out of the fork they trade they do get out of the fork and now they're safe right knight to f4 this is a great move by black finally we are addressing the question of what does my opponent want all right dust is settling also i've got a threat and a threat and i'm threatening the knight and white does not ask themselves what does my opponent want hanging two pieces in the process great move move by black grabs the bishop black is winning knight d6 check discovered check all right what does my opponent want well they want to attack my king so i could either walk into the center or hide behind the pawn what's the best followup what do what do we think what's safer what does my opponent want my opponent is going to want to attack my my king right i kind of get why black went here cuz black probably thought while i'm attacking the knight i wouldn't leave the king out in the open like this you got to think more than a move ahead yeah you just have to you got to think more than a move ahead now what does my opponent want this doesn't really address that and that's why it would have been better to just hide the king right hide the king what does my opponent want they want to attack my king uhoh uhoh and now a major question depending on where you move your king white is going to have another check what does my opponent want they want to attack my king what am i going to do i'm going to make a move where there's no checks the only way to do that is to play king to c8 that is the only move there is no check from the rook or the knight we can't go here because we allow rook f7 now white goes here hanging a rook oh my goodness it's the wrong rook and black can just take the rook and be up a rook but this is madeen one this is checkmaid in one move what does my opponent want they want to attack us that was 4 seconds spent white misses it but then white gets in and now it's over now there's nothing you can do so white didn't see mate and one but does swarm and gets black into an unstoppable checkmate situation black stops one of the mates but unfortunately gets mated that was not a game of asking ourselves what does my opponent want it was a little bit of a chaotic opening but again some quick things to follow don't give the bishop for the knight for no reason right don't push and open up the position of your king if you've already made moves stop stop it get your king to safety if you're worried about the opponent's attacking peace trade the queen there's a lot of stuff to learn from this game and we don't want to open the position what does my opponent want they want the king that's what they want they want the king black did a nice job fighting back but sadly not good enough now in this game gotham subscriber once again is playing with the black pieces we're just going to go up the rating ladder we're going 1,000 we got 1,200 we're going to end with an 1,800 level game here black is the higher rated player by nearly 200 points okay i like that username the resign gambit this one a london i mean listen it wouldn't be an instructional chess video unless we had a london being covered knight c6 all right what is my opponent want so far they're just playing in the opening i mean this is this is odd like again just like the previous game you you shouldn't make multiple moves in the opening with with the pieces i mean we we should get castled that's the way we should play but all right fine all right you want to do it this way you're not losing you're developing your pieces now c4 what does my opponent want they want to pressure my center and if i take they want to develop a p they want me to lose a center pawn so black takes no no you can ask yourself these questions in the opening too no don't take play here maintain center right get the bishop out what does my opponent want they play c4 because they want you to why you taking why you giving them the center what does my opponent want all right some pressure no threats though maybe they want this right we got to start thinking a move ahead okay but for now you know if i'm playing black i'm playing a6 but one of the other moves you could play as bishop here you're not you're not in bad shape yet takes now me personally i would get the queen into the game because my opponent has a queen in the game as well but fine c takes look that's what our opponent wants right they're attacking our knight for some reason black castles it actually turns out not to be the wrong move according to the computer because if you play rook c8 white can actually even take this pawn whether this was seen at this level is to be determined but what does my opponent want i'm a little confused why we didn't play defense right like i'm a little bit i understand the computer is saying it's not the top move and i just told you the computer says it's this but good rule of thumb is like if something's under attack you should probably protect it and now white is just up a pawn what does my opponent want well my opponent wants to castle if i'm looking at this position i'm thinking what does my opponent want they want a castle they want a castle so i would play here i would not even hesitate there are other moves to prevent white from castling this physically prevents white from castling right right now white doesn't have a threat that's not what white wants this move prevents white from castling because it hangs a knight right you can't castle now and if you play something like rook d1 well then heck i can play bishop here i can put a rook on that square i can still play bishop d3 what does my opponent want black plays rook c2 i do not dislike that move i do not dislike it what does my opponent want excellent now what does my opponent want well they save the but i we're going right there that's what i'm doing next i'm not even hesitating oh this is this is that's bad that's bad that is not asking ourselves what does the opponent want the opponent wants a couple of things they want a castle which they can't exact do at this moment but they want the bishop i mean the queen is staring at the bishop you got to mentally just it's just got to be there mentally you just got to go what is my opponent seeing it's right there it's the most powerful piece and it's the only piece that the queen sees it doesn't see anything else now if i ask you how many squares the queen sees a lot a lot one two three four five that doesn't count 6 7 8 n9 10 and backwards sees a lot of squares but this is inexcusable no and now white castles white hangs the night black now decides i'm g to take i'm not going to take i'm going to play bishop d3 and now pandemonium take take okay what does my opponent want my opponent wants to take the bishop all right we get the bishop out of danger that's easy what now the way you avoid doing stuff like this this this was either a blind spot or black spent two minutes two seconds going i'm going to sack my bishop and open up the king open king is good open king is dangerous no the way we prevent stuff like this the way we prevent stuff like i'm sacrificing a bishop for a check do you have two more attacking pieces than they have defenders the answer is no sometimes it doesn't matter if the answer is no because you have a knockout he ain't got no knockout literally you can reject bishop takes and check by just thinking one more move ahead and we're not doing that what does my opponent want what what's what's my opponent going to do ask yourself what's my opponent going to do black did this just to give a check that's it just to give a check what is my opponent going to do they're going to run to safety do i have a followup no now at this point you got to go what does does my opponent want well my opponent probably wants to bring the rook and my opponent wants to trade pieces because they're winning so then how in a million years how can you play this there's no excuse for that there's no excuse for that my opponent of course they want to trade queens white would pay 20 bucks to trade queens if if chess was pay to win the game would pause and say deposit 20 chess.com units right now to trade the queens how can you play this move in two seconds you spend two seconds sacrificing a bishop and two seconds trading a queen and now you're completely lost why why are we not stopping and going what does my opponent w now if i'm playing black it's over now if i'm playing white i'm thinking all right i'm going to just slowly walk my pieces forward trade win some pawns and win the game f3 g5 okay okay yeah but we're just i mean we're just losing pawns now we're not even you know okay fine now we now there's that was a bad move by white look i'm threatening this and this white can save one of the pawns white can play king g3 white can play knight f3 defending that pawn right you can choose instead white played this move and blundered both pawns that's not good like we don't want to do that but we didn't we white didn't stop and think what does my opponent want what does my opponent want they want that pawn so let me defend it for another move nope okay now what does my opponent want they want to go win the rest of my pawns okay i'm doing my best yep but it's not good enough and now white should just promote nope white should just promote that's what white should do nope what no no no no no no no no no no no why why are we doing oh my god we oh but now there's rook f1 check yep and that's winning okay rook g5 and white goes on to win the game check check and it's made why did black lose that game two moves black is playing 10-minute chess and on the'th move has over 9 minutes both these players need to calm down by the way sacrificing the bishop and trading the queen these two moves just not not thinking like what what does my opponent want well they want to simplify the game that's what they want to do that's what my opponent wants that's what my opponent wants you know and that's not that was not addressed in this game all right now next this was a crazy game this was 1260 1260 is early intermediate this intermediate chess right here this game did not address the question of what does my opponent want probably about 20 times on both sides so watch okay watch was a carl khan started out pretty normal carlan defense advanced variation knight f3 take take knight c6 what does my opponent want well black went here and thought white wants to take on c6 with the bishop what does my opponent want this is not complicated my opponent is threatening my knight so guard the knight i mean folks you are not gordon ramsay stop cooking fancy stuff in the kitchen it's going to burn down why does just winning now after this you can't take cuz you lose the queen you can't take this cuz you lose the the rook what is going i mean this is what is happening you just lost the game in six moves but white takes with the bishop they don't take with the knight and then doesn't take the pawn either it's free free pa okay fine yeah now black just defends the center and now black is doing very well so my my gotham subscriber here got thems in a little trouble and now again just like the last game don't sacrifice pieces if you only have a queen attacking white goes for a sacrifice and is now completely lost if i'm playing black what does my opponent want my opponent wants to attack me what do i want i want to trade pieces bishop f4 with black i'm thinking rook f8 i'm thinking consolidate maybe okay knight f5 uh-huh knight a4 we what does my opponent want they want to take my bishop i mean this is this is a one mover it's not addressed white takes the folks this is in this is not excusable chess this is not rook takes b2 fine what does my opponent want well if i'm playing white i'm i'm thinking rook here and i'm thinking get in on that side because that side's open and this side is all congested instead of that white hangs a knight in one move i think i think there was an idea here to sacrifice the knight maybe to try to get the queen over here but what are we doing h okay takes you could take the rook now good bishop b5 a4 yeah tough move what does my opponent want they want to open up that now here black plays a good move what does my opponent want they want to get queen b8 queen b7 all right take on this move i can't tell if it was a mouse slip or what happened but black went here now white is winning so after all of that drama rook a1 excellent move excellent stuff now what does black want black wants to consolidate okay black wants to defend the position so if i'm playing with white i'm going to play rook c7 target the knight i'm going to take on g7 take take never in a million years do you trade the queens here all right never in a million years if you're gna trade the queens you best believe you're going to win this end game now secret trading the queens is actually forced now why' you say never in a millionair trade the queen well you best be ready to win the end game if you're going to trade these queens and what i mean by that is you should have been ready for that when you took this pawn i would have played rook c7 why would i have played rook c7 because rook c7 prevents the trade of queens because of rook c8 so i'm saying it's too late now you took a pawn what does my opponent want they want to they want to relieve the pressure that's what they want to do if i'm playing with white i will never trade the queens ever i'll play rook c7 if you take with the knight you get mated but now it's a little bit too late okay so how are we going to win this end game we got to start hunting the pawns g3 no it's too slow it's too slow slow i love that okay let's start taking great let's start take oh it was winning it was winning we to back we took back too quickly rook c3 no what does my opponent want they want the rook to leave they want the rook to leave yeah now there's rook g4 now you're too slow now you're going to lose your pawns oh my goodness and then how did we lose the f pun a lot of mistakes a lot of mistakes and now the final dagger what does my opponent want they want to take my pawn how can you just abandon it like that white gave away so many things in one move in this game just not thinking what does black want right and one final moment what c4 was played what does black want black wants the pawns connected connected king up rook down instead of that that's what happens rook c4 and now this is a draw you just have to know how to draw this game king d2 king e2 and one final moment white needed to know how to draw the king and pawn endgame but that's an end game thing that's not really what is my opponent one type of thing yeah white's got a lot to work on in this game a lot both players in this game had multiple moments they did not stop and go what does my opponent want now i'm going to show you a game which was a perfect neutralizing by asking ourselves this question now of course to look at a game at this level we do have to go quite a bit high up now here my subscriber is playing with the white pieces and their opponent is quite a strong near 2000 rated player this was a scotch take bishop c4 scotch gambit and white plays this very aggressive line catching their opponent in a trap with a sacrifice of the bishop black losing the right to castle and now white takes on c5 and gets this now a lot of people here with black would get really scared they got caught their king is stuck in the center white is doing very well black sits there and goes what does my opponent want they want me to take them they want me to activate more of their pieces so what i'm going to do now if i'm playing with black is i'm going to speed up my development i'm going to try to trade off my opponent's pieces speed up my development white takes black offers a queen trade remember a couple games ago i said ne last game actually i said never in a million years do you trade the queens in this position never in a million years do you trade the queen you can't you are down a pawn with white actually you offered up a gambit with white you tried to play a gambit you're not even playing a gambit anymore if i'm playing white i got to keep my queen on i got to prevent black from getting out and castled i need to use black's queen as a target both players asking each other what do you want white offers a queen trade black breathes a sigh of relief of course i'm trading the queen because again black was caught in an opening trap and now black is worse and white completely relieves the pressure now you may think white is getting help developing yes but in chess the higher you go superseding concepts yes i'm helping white develop but i'm no longer worse i'm no longer worse the queen was the most aggressive piece black now threatens to trade some pieces and consolidate white continues to attack black plays defense right what does my opponent want simple chess now a fancy moment threatening the rook if takes it's a fork a lot of people would panic here if take it's a for fork on the king and the bishop so black decides look i'm going to lose my rook but if i take the bishop i'm going to lose my bishop what if i take the knight first if i take the knight and they take my rook i'm going to take a pawn and another one bishop takes f3 i'm going to take the knight first and if they take me i can take the bishop i couldn't take the bishop a move ago cuz there was a fork so i deal with one problem now i take and i've got a bishop i took excuse me a knight and two pawns for a rook and now after knight f6 i will happily make this trade and now the position's in the balance black has a knight and two pawns what does white want white wants to get the king out of danger and activate their rooks white wants to open the position and bring the rooks to the game what does black want black wants to make it a nightmare for white to castle make it difficult for white to castle white's king is going to be in dire straits right now there we go but here comes the knight who's going to guard the pawn here comes the knight into d3 king d2 now if i'm playing white here excuse me if i'm playing black if i'm playing black i have the option to take this pawn threatening the rook if i do that i got to be ready for one of these moves i probably would play r knight takes pawn black decides to play rook f8 and then play c5 and now white is white is a bit stuck depends where white is going to move right white could move the bishop to either square potentially losing a pawn they lose this pawn if i'm playing you know i got to be careful here with my bishop many people here would take and then take again forgetting the bishop is hanging black plays d5 everything is protected takes what what does my opponent want if take then take what does my opponent want rook f3 check white resigns perfect game by black that entire game was spent thinking what does my opponent want what can my opponent do and that's how black managed to win this game that's why black is rated 1950 a lot less one move blunders but also a constant question of what is my opponent want in this position what does my opponent see in this position and what threats can my opponent create in this position not just right now but if i move that's going back to this game right right here what does my opponent want they want a castle what does my opponent want they they what they see the bishop so if i go here what do they want every move you make the position changes and you've got to be thinking of your opponent as well many chess players make this mistake you will continue to make this mistake i promise but chess is about slowly improving and then you will get to this level and then chess is going to be really really fun that's all i have for you today now get out of here
