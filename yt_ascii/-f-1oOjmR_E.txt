welcome to my office do you want to know what the one skill is that experts are saying is going to be recession proof actually not only are they saying is going to be recession proof but they are actually saying that 97 new million jobs of this are going to be created between now and 2025 what is it you ask how do we obtain it you ask we are going to get into that in this video hey friends welcome back to my channel in this video we are going to be covering the top skills to learn for 2023 what is most in demand where should you focus your learnings this is a question as a software developer as a person in developer relations a tech creator that i'm always trying to keep up with the latest tech trends where should i put my learnings my time because if you are learning something new you want it to be relevant you want it to be something that is actually going to be in demand and that is what we're going to uncover today if you haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe button for more tech encoding related videos and let's get into it that was very slow [music] so tiff you ask what is this one magical skill one area that you need to focus on well my friend it is the one area that is taking over a lot of jobs that rather than fighting it be on its team which is artificial intelligence there are so many job openings coming up for artificial intelligence actually the world economic forum i have it on screen here the world all economic forum future of jobs reports predicts that 97 new ai jobs will be created between now and 2025 and they also say salaries are rising accordingly those well-trained and experienced can command average salaries of around 150 000 u.s so that's a great starting salary that's a great salary to transition into for this area now the next question is well ai is a pretty broad topic what area should you focus on and this is a really exciting part because i think there are so many areas within ai that you can focus on that i wouldn't necessarily switch your skill set at this moment but what i would do is if you are a programmer focusing on taking some programming courses related to ai if you are say a marketer focus on taking marketing courses towards ai or taking some courses to understand ai rather than completely doing a'0 you don't have to because ai in itself there are so many different spots and opportunities that will come up that maintain what you are passionate about and interested about and then just kind of shift into the sector of ai here are some really great courses from if you are a programmer a technical person or maybe you want more of the ai soft skills that you can pick up okay i have up on screen here ibm applied ai professional certificate i think i'm going to take this course for the reason of i'm not an ai expert by any means i'm just learning about it as many of us are and it's something that i think will be a really great course it's you know beginner level no prior experience is necessary and it also goes into bit technical skills but a bit more soft skills and you also receive a digital badge which is really great for the resume so if you see in up to six months that i have a certificate on my linkedin that is because i took this course so this is a great course i think to dive in and really show that you are interested in ai and building skills around it another one that is really popular is one that is offered by udemy which is ai a to z learn how to build an ai and this is a great course it's very accessible if you're going on this link right now they're all linked down below by the way if you're clicking on this link it probably says a really expensive number for me it says 120 right now but that really honestly just wait till there's a sale and you can get it for under 10 bucks like do not purchase it at this price i love you udemy but you have some really good sales and you just gotta wait for the sales and this will be really interesting you can build an ai make ai to the beat of games like there's so much you can do it's 17 hours get a certificate on completion and this i think will be the second course i'm taking so this is another great opportunity if you literally just google ai courses so much comes up so rather it's not an issue of are there enough courses it's an issue of what course is good and i always look for what are really popular course is what are courses that are recommended by professionals and these two are two of them and these two these two are two of the best courses next up is anything to do with augmented reality this is such a growing area of tech and our world as well and ar is becoming extremely popular and understanding ar and what it's all about and being able to build it those are skills that are going to continue to be very intimate now coursera offers by actually google a course called augmented reality in ar core and this has literally i mean recent recent views on this is 42 000. it's extraordinarily popular it's about 11 hours to complete so this is something that you could commit to even for a hardcore weekend if you wanted and you really get to start from the basics of understanding what ar is all about and working your way up to understanding how to create and use ar build an ar experience use a technology ar core and all around it's a really great course another great ar1 i promise you were going to get to other platforms other than udemy and coursera but they offer some of the top courses in my opinion and and you can build with this one 15 augmented reality apps with unity and actually it's on sale right now maybe it won't be by the time we watch this but right now it is so stay tuned for the sale this is a great way if you want to get really hands-on with augmented reality and the other thing is you get a certificate as i mentioned i'm linking all these down below so you can go check them out okay next on the list i have to list this one because for when i listed for top jobs in demand for the future which is another video i recently posted i didn't put on their cloud computing jobs and i got so many questions from you is this intentional tiff should i be learning cloud computing yes cloud computing is so in demand i mean at the end of the day there is only so many only so many slots that i can add in for the videos for jobs i'm speaking about and it didn't make the top five that i listed for example but it is so into mad and skills for cloud computing are going to continue actually i'm stretching my legs right now but let me get back to my computer so i'm doing a little office tour this isn't my office just for the record it's just a co-working space but let me see here because on screen i have some stats you know me i like a good stat so here we go cloud skills with microsoft azure cloud deployments expanding by 33 year over year and other cloud platforms growing there is no shortage of demand for cloud skills it's going to continue to go into more demand and you know what's interesting i for a long time thought cloud would be the way i'd want to grow my career and recently though maybe it's because of all the hype but i've really been leaning towards ai and i think i'm just gonna i think i'm gonna dive into the ai direction it just is i just see it as the future but cloud is extremely important as well and it's not going anywhere so let's dive into some courses to take around cloud anything when you think cloud a lot of times we go to aws or i do anyways and any kind of course that is related to cloud computing with aws maybe you take some aws courses is a great way to go and get certified if you want to kind of dive into have some prereqs before you dive into that even courses on udemy such as this one here introduction to cloud computing is a great way to go it really teaches you the basics the foundation and then you can work your way up there is no shortage of cloud computing courses and i think it really you really need to narrow in on where you want to focus in the cloud do you want to focus more on the devops area do you want to focus more on the marketing similar to all these types of areas there are so many opportunities within them that you really need to find what you are passionate about and then structure courses around that i'm not going to recommend you know 10 different cloud computing courses that are focused on programming if you aren't into programming maybe you have stronger skills in other areas so rather than that search up courses that you are really intrigued by that offer certification and that match with your skill sets you already have or want to grow next on the list is data analytics and i have on screen here let me pull it up for you actually some stats around this so data science positions are expected to grow by 28 by 2026. that's a huge i mean for all the jobs and skills that you hear are going this way that ai is taking over data science is not necessarily one of them and salaries range between 125 000 to 150 000 and up up kind of thing up up sounds kind of weird you get what i mean and there are so many courses online for both data science and data analytics and what i'd like to do if you want to focus in on one of those areas is because its skill is so in demand all the top companies offer courses that you can get certified in in their area of data analytics or science and i'm going to pull up on screen here i found one that microsoft offers and this is for data analysts so not data scientists but data analyst and it's an associate level certificate so if you are just starting out i believe it's around 165 dollars so it's not free but it will provide you with a very credible certification that you can add to your resume and it teaches you from the ground up this is a certification that employers will take very seriously that you have this i'll link it down below and if you are not interested in maybe the microsoft path there are so many others all you need to do is type in say amazon i can't speak today amazon data analyst or whatever the company is and most of them actually offer certifications so just do a little research on that and then if you are targeting a specific level company or anything like that you can focus that way now if you're not focusing on a specific company or getting with a specific company any of these certifications are still very valuable and will be recognized by other companies so there is no right or wrong way to go really the last on the list is smart contract developer this is an area that is so in demand and going to continue and i know we think of crypto a lot of times with a bad taste in our mouths or for many people because of what's going on in the news because of everything but the technology around blockchain i'm not talking about cryptocurrencies i'm talking about blockchain is here to stay it's something that more companies are continuing to implement and having developers or people with the skills to build smart contracts is so powerful now if you are watching this and you are not a developer and you're not looking to become a developer it doesn't mean that you can write off smart contracts what i would do is focus on blockchain as a whole and getting certifications around understanding the technology the business side of it and if you are a programmer or developer focus on understanding how to build these smart contracts they're actually really simple to build i mean they get more complex as the contract gets more complex but i used a lot build space when i was first learning about smart contracts and it broke it down sounds so well for me it was very friendly i will add it on screen here and link it below because they have really great paths not only to build smart contracts but nfts a range of other things and they have a huge community on discord too so i really i started out when i was learning blockchain doing that in build space but there are a ton of other great courses for smart contracts okay and on screen here i have ethereum and solidity solidity is a programming language that is used to build these smart contracts and it's super user friendly i was i feel like these things are so intimidating to people until they dive into it and you realize wow this is actually pretty user-friendly pretty developer friendly it just seems more intimidating than it actually is so i'll link this course down below this is another great course to understand why the why behind we would even want to use ethereum and why we want to use solidity and make smart contracts and all of that and it really builds up your knowledge from the base up and then also to how to build smart contracts and it gets into the more technical side of things i don't know if you can hear that but there is a leaf blower outside it must mean that it's close to the end of the video here leaf blower is gone probably will come back in about two seconds here so i'm going to end this video here i linked all these courses down below these are just courses that i started researching i've either taken some of them or want to especially the ai ones and just heard really great things about i'm curious to know though what area of expertise are you going to focus on building your skill set in in 2023 leave down below in the comments and see if there's a trend here for me it's ai and i'll share with you my journey into ai throughout the year and if you haven't already make sure
