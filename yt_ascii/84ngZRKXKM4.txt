we are doing a very impromptu video this actually was not the video i was going to be posting when you watch this and the reason for that is i just had this feeling in me that we really needed to talk about tech layoffs i mean everywhere you look everywhere you speak to someone even you are probably going to hear about tech layoff and i don't know about you but for me as someone who works in tech the last few weeks especially this past week i would say has made me feel a little bit a little bit i don't even know what the words are a little bit strange a little bit uncomfortable if you will and i thought you know what it's time we talk about it now i'm not going to lie i went into 2024 kind of naive if i'm being totally honest with you looking back i thought you know what 2023 was a really brutal year for tech especially with so many layoffs we're going into 2024 experts are saying no we're not going into recession the economy is going to be okay and i just had this optimistic point of view that going into this year tech would just kind of sort itself out only to you know start opening my laptop in january and very quickly see all the different tech layoffs going on at these big tech companies i mean okay i have crunch based open up and i want to share with you some stats so layoffs during the week ending in january 19th so literally ending in last friday there was at least 2,200 us tech sector employees that were laid off that was just last week for the record and in 2024 there's been at least 6,500 workers at us-based tech companies that have lost their job so far now those numbers feel pretty intense it feels as though everywhere you look tech companies are laying people off and it brings up the question why what is going on here why are all these companies laying off these employees is it really because ai is taking over all of these jobs is this what we have to look forward to moving forward now there's two sides to the story one i want to talk about first which is what happened during the pandemic which is when we really saw this rise this boom within tech i mean working in tech was so glamorized so cool to be in tech we just thought this was the place to be people were making very large salaries especially working in big tech i mean massive salaries and major benefits it just seemed like the place to be everyone was flooding into tech and the jobs kept on opening up now on that note it's really interesting i was reading a report by who was it by i'm just looking it up here by 365 data signs and they attempted to really solve this question around what is going on with all these big tech layoffs so they did some data analysis on it one thing i found really interesting which lines up to the timeline with the pandemic is the data shows that the median time of an employee to be at the company when they were laid off for these employees who were laid off was roughly 2 years suggesting that in some ways this cup represents essentially a winding back of hiring policies put in place before the pandemic so it's not necessarily going to say that this theory or this kind of it's not even a theory it's it's more so facts at this point but this kind of angle suggests that really it was over hiring during the pandemic everyone was at home on their computers tech companies could work from home and in turn a lot of them were booming especially from all the usage so it made sense they were hiring a lot now okay great tiff so you're saying it's because of you know they over hired but when is this going to stop it it seems like they are constantly it was all through 2023 i mean actually another fact about 2023 in 2023 91 or over 191,000 us-based tech company employees were laid off i mean how many roles do we need to cut down what that we hired during the pandemic there has to be more to it than that well there is all right let's address the elephant in the room the technology or thing that helps so many people and you know to be honest i see so much benefit in but it definitely is an elephant in this room i'm sure you know what i'm getting at it's ai is ai taking over our jobs or a lot of tech workers jobs is that actually happening or is it just kind of people saying ai is taking over the jobs insert this meme here where it's the dog i think holding a coffee cup and everything's burning around him it's a classic by the way but really is ai taking over jobs well here's what 365 data science tried to figure out and used once again the data to see if this actually is happening by the way i'm using this report because i just find it very interesting from an actual data standpoint i don't know about you but i'm sure many of us in the tech tiff in tiff in tech community good thing i can talk this is what happens when you're filming at 700 p.m. at night in the tiff in tech community you're very numbers or data driven in different capacities and for me understanding the data behind it versus just articles where they were assuming things or making assumptions anyways that's a long story short as to why i'm using the 365 data science report so going down into it i found it really interesting though who like what types of roles were laid off and i mean there was really every type of role no role has been safe including software developers but what they report is that 28% of all layoffs were within hr and i find this really interesting for a few reasons i mean when you think of hr as a whole it is one area where a lot well let's not say a lot but some functions are being placed by automation a lot of these tools that are coming out around ai that companies are adapting to or starting to integrate really do have a direct impact on hr we just don't see it as much as individuals who aren't in hr if you're someone watching this that isn't in hr and we don't really understand that there are a lot of systems being put in place that can kind of do that manual tasks that were covered by hr so that is my theory or reasoning as to what is going on with big tech laying off so many individuals and i needed to have this really logical explanation for it because i some days can feel very overwhelming when you're talking to a friend and you hear they know someone who got laid off or you see in the news every day it feels like different companies laying off employees it just makes you feel very uneasy i thought i' share with you as well some signs as to how you can tell if your company might be starting to do layoffs one of course is a hiring or payroll or promotional freeze so a freeze across a company they are not hiring they are not going to do promotions this year different things like that is a very good sign or a good indicator anyways that something might not be right another area or an indicator that there might be layoffs happening at your company is the company's financial performance now with big tech this can kind of be hard to have insight into especially because there's so many different compartment ized compartmentalized compartment comp compartmentalized comp so many different departments you get what i'm saying but there's so many different departments that this often isn't transparent but if you are more at a smaller company or mediumsized company this is information you should have some insight into now another thing that i don't see a lot of people talking about but which is a sign that there will be mass layoffs is decreased workload or project cancellations you be like being what why is that a sign well this is a sign and i've heard from many friends as well around this as so because your managers or your manager managers whatever the case may be depending on your company size are so focused on what is to come a lot of times there's no point of course to start new projects or wonder how you're doing because they know what is coming now this is coming from the very top but so i'm not saying even your manager might know this but the decrease in workload is another sign now all these signs don't line up directly to layoffs they might just mean other things going on in the company but there are some ways you can identify that some things are shifting now here's a question that i think it's been on all of our minds when will layoffs stop there's no perfect answer as we can't look ahead into the future but i do think they will slow down eventually but i do believe at least in the next 6 months we will continue to see quite a bit of layoffs intact now what can you do to protect yourself or at least help yourself in these scenarios well for one thing is don't panic i know yeah i'm saying this to myself too because it's just it's one of those things where when it's happening to everyone else around you you start to panic the reality is it's out of your control do the best you can at work work don't kill yourself at work meaning because this is all going on i'm telling you if you put in an extra 5 hours in the evening after an 8 hour day or anything like that it's not going to make a difference whether you stay or go some of the most talented people have been let go in these scenarios it's not about you it's such a bigger issue at hand and i'm saying this because i need to hear this as well taking it back to myself as someone who gets anxious really easy but it's not about us just remember that all right i hope you enjoyed this video and i hope if it left you with anything is that you're not alone in these feelings of uncertainty or just feeling that uneasiness even if your company is definitely or most likely not going to be doing layoffs and you know that in your hearts it's totally normal to have these feelings and i think the biggest thing is you're not alone i got you i'm here with you i think we all experience these things i just really hope that having insight into some of these statistics whether they are positive or maybe a bit negative will help you at least have some facts because there are so many news outlets that really cling to these headlines and just run with them i mean what sells better than fear nothing and the reality is you just need to take a step back analyze your situation and if you're anything like me just remember it's not about you and i hope that brings you some peace i don't know if that's going to bring you the opposite but for me it brings peace especially as someone who you know always wants to put your best foot forward at work not sounding cheesy but you honestly give it your all and you give it everything you can to have those fears or those feelings of uneasiness about everything going on right now in the tech industry sucks i mean it's like we we give it our best and this is what happens but i do promise you it will get better things will work out as they are meant to be it's just we got to go through a bit of growing pains right now and i know that's easier said than done as someone who hasn't had or gone through layoffs personally so i know you're probably sitting here if you you have being like tiff what are you talking about but i just wanted to shed some really candid light into how i'm feeling and if anyone else is feeling this way too i got you and we are not alone anyways i hope you all enjoyed this very candid video it's literally very last minute that i'm i'm filming it just because i it was speaking to me that i was like this needs we need to speak about this so anyways leave down in the comments other videos you want to see and i got to go eat dinner now [music] bye
