how's it going guys in today's lesson we're going to be learning how we can create this colored text in the python console and this can be used to make your console look a lot nicer a lot cleaner and you can just use the special effect to really make your programs stand out and as you can see we have some text that is colored and we can actually specify at any point in the string where we want the text to be colored or we can even make the whole text call it or we can even highlight the text so it's a very simple tutorial but it's very effective so let's go ahead and start with the import we're going to be using something called colorama and this will allow us to easily create color text and i already have it installed so i can just ignore it and from colorama we're going to import the four color the background color and the style and to really simplify this we're going to create a function that returns a colored string so here we're going to go ahead and create something called cola and it's going to take some text of type string obviously and a foreground color and a background color set to none initially because we don't really know if we want a background color or not and that was going to return to us a string then we're going to create some colored text which is going to equal a formatted string and inside here we're going to insert the foreground color followed by the text and we're going to call style dot reset all and this tells us that we want the caller to stop here if we do not include this it's going to make the whole string of that color so we want it to stop immediately after the text that we select and let's also go ahead and return it so we're going to return the caller text if background is none else we're going to return the background plus the color text so this is going to go in front of the foreground color and that's going to give it a background so this helper function is going to make creating colored text really easy now we can go ahead and run the program inside here and if we go ahead and print something such as this is and inside here we're going to interpolate and add the color text that we want to add so for example inside here we can go ahead and say hello world and we need to specify some colors so of course we decided to give it a foreground color and we need to call four and it's going to give us the options of the colors that we can provide so for this example we can go ahead and pick something such as light yellow and we're going to add an exclamation mark here so if we go ahead and run this you'll see that it will say this is hello world with yellow text and we can duplicate that and we can decide to change this to a blue so we can say light blue x and the background color is going to be set to red so we're going to write back dot red and when we run that we'll get this very ugly text but as you can see we were able to customize it this would actually look a bit better with white yeah like that that looks a lot better than the blue and the red background and if you want to add multiple colored text in one string you can just do that by interpolating again so you can say this is some more and we'll just create a new line for simplicity and say cola and he will go ahead and say hello again okay and the color will be four dots light reds and if we go ahead and print that you'll see that this is hello world this is some more hello again and we should add some space here and there we go so we were able to customize the text however we like and you can use this with any string you want and it will work as you see you can even go ahead and assign this as a variable so you can say call it text and that's going to equal let's say this up here so we'll just copy that and if we go ahead and delete all of that and print ct we're going to get the same output this is hello world so there are ways to clean this up you don't just have to print it immediately and yeah that's actually all i wanted to cover in today's lesson definitely let me know if you found this video interesting or if you learned something new and with that being said as always thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next lesson
