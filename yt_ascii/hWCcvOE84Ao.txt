one of south korea's greatest economic strengths is also one of their biggest economic weaknesses their country's economy is divine by a series of massive business groups with names familiar to everyone samsung hyundai and lg these groups power its export economy and dominate its people's everyday lives they also manipulate the korean economy to their own advantage and pay millions to maintain corrupt ties with the highest levels of power in korea corruption in korea predates the modern state the japanese colonial state and its agricultural economy was also quite corrupt and unequal the large landlords earned all the income and ruthlessly exploited the farmers this administration ended with world war ii much of its legacies however passed on to the new south korean government which fell under the western sphere of influence its first president sigmundry thus was a staunch anti-communist and i guess he proved it first by committing a variety of massacres against suspected communists that left some one hundred thousand dead the bordeaux league massacre in 1950 i felt was especially cruel and second recreated the chebul he needed to raise funds to fight the korean war so starting in 1946 and peaking in the 1950s his government sold off many of the assets they seized from the old japanese state along with a few other prized state-owned entities the prices for these privatizations of public assets were determined by a private negotiation rather than public auction a steal by any value investing metric valuable companies like tong yang beers today oriental breweries de haan textile and tong yang cement heart of the tongyang group like with the zaibatsu of japan the purchasers of these amazing assets would eventually become the chebul then in 1961 a park tonghi led a military coup that ended the second republic immediately after the coup park arrested the heads of the chebul on the basis that they were corruptly accumulating wealth but very quickly afterwards his government negotiated a crony capitalism deal with the chable park wanted to emulate japan's industrialization process and sought the company's help the chebo would support parks policies for import substitution and later exports the korean government would in turn lend the table of foreign currency loans at below market interest rates so that they can acquire foreign technologies and build up their capacities in those industries and oh by the way the chable will also contribute funds for park's upcoming 200 million dollar presidential election campaign these came in the form of 10 to 15 percent loan commissions namely kickbacks companies realized that the best way to acquire cheap capital and get rich was to be good friends with the president for instance park chung maintained very close personal ties with cheung juyong of hyundai and kim woo-jong of daewoo the kickbacks also grew over the years adjusted to 1990 prices the top five chebul contributed over 800 million won annually to the park government before 1972 that grew to 1.5 billion after 1972. over the next 20 years the government and the chamber ran korean society as dominant actors the companies helped fund the government's political campaigns and satisfied social compact of growing the economy the government in turn granted the chable privileges and used this force to impose the costs of the chable's excesses onto greater society for instance in 1971 the triple found themselves over-leveraged and requested a bailout the korean government converted all the chapel's private market loans to five-year public ones and froze private interest rates small lenders got hosed since nominal listed interest rates for such public loans did not exceed inflation but as korea entered the turbulent 1980s the military dictatorship gradually lost its monopoly grip on power the partnership began to get a little shaky as the balance of power started to shift by the mid-1980s things had tipped decisively in the chambel's favor the top five chapel accounted for nearly twenty percent of the country's gdp and forty five percent of its mining slash manufacturing output the top ten table owned an average of 8.6 manufacturing businesses 20 to 40 businesses in total korea's chable-centric strategy had suffocated the country's small and medium-sized business sector from 1966 to 1976 the number of manufacturing firms in korea grew just 10 percent but their size exploded 176 percent by contrast taiwan pursued a less cozy state business relationship with its corporate elites and also did not get hit with a devastating war they saw its number of manufacturing firms grow by 150 percent and firm size by 29 over the same period of time this vast imbalance between the chable and the rest of the country started to become an issue the people of south korea disapproved of the outsized power these big business groups had the people were getting richer and with that they wanted more than just higher wages they wanted better environmental regulations working conditions and a better life in general the government now increasingly democratic had to respond switching from a stance of support to one of regulation the problem was that the government's leader still needed the chairboa's financial contributions to stay in power this continued regardless of who was in charge pakchangi was assassinated and another military leader chun do huan came to lead south korea afterwards during his administration the chable contributed 15 to 22 billion won to high-level political campaigns and 21 to 25 billion won during the subsequent administration of president rote wu this corrupt deal between the korean government and business evolved this way partly because of how weak korea's political parties have been during the military dictatorship era parties served as simple shells for their candidates people voted the party simply because they wanted to vote for the candidate then the country democratized in 1987 holding free and open elections for the first time but after so many years of military dictatorship there had been no time to build suitable political campaigning norms without an above-board financing system parties and candidates found themselves starved for cash which made them vulnerable to corruption which means the chable are still able to get what they want government aid in the form of plentiful capital favorable regulations and protections from competition the asian financial crisis would demonstrate the consequences of korea's inability to rein in their big businesses in the 10 years after democratization in 1987 the chable gained substantial political power for instance in 1988 daewoo group was able to force the national assembly to amend the law so to allow the government to bail out the ailing daewoo shipbuilding corporation they also used that power to get rapid liberalization reforms to aid their growth and expansion one of those reforms had been to allow the table to more easily access foreign capital financing in other words take out cheap loans denominated in foreign currencies this would eventually kick off a massive debt boom that ended in the asian financial crisis another major reform allowed the chebo to take limited ownership stakes and non-bank financial companies this encouraged super complicated cross-ownership structures obscuring their true size for instance the samsung group and its controlling lee family the lees own a minority of the shares in samsung affiliated firms yet through that small slice they exercise operating control over almost all of those companies these companies increasingly complex structures meant that nobody knew which subsidiaries made money and which ones burned it the profitable companies started propping up the weak ones leading to market inefficiencies and oversupply in certain industries this all came to a head in 1997 which vastly paired back the power of the chamber it left an open door for reforms encouraging a more unquote common prosperity to steal a term a variety of reforms were imposed on the ailing chebor by both the kim dae-chong and rue mu hyung administrations the goals were to prevent another financial crisis from ever happening again by limiting debt capacity and cross shareholder structures some of these reforms succeeded but not without wide ranging consequences for instance in my video about hunching shipping i talked about how the company had to reduce its debt to equity loads below 200 percent it forced hanjin to sell off ships and lease others to retain capacity converting those financing costs into operating ones reforms did cut a lot of the fat in the korean car industry in 1997 there had been five independent korean car companies soon after there would be just one hyundai the chambo dialed back their affiliates and further separated them in 1997 a sample of chebour showed 819 affiliates three years later that number became 544. dividends to minority shareholders the ones getting stiff the most by the cross holdings structure increased from 2.2 trillion won in 2001 to 10.8 trillion by 2006. the crisis also helped create the korean export juggernaut realizing the unfriendly domestic environment the biggest charitable seized on a variety of free trade agreements in the 2000s and turned outwards they became wildly successful by 2013 86 of samsung's revenue came from abroad and this success drove the korean economies a top-line recovery from 1998 to 2010 korea's economy grew at an average rate of 5 percent a very good number but that shiny golden number hid a variety of troubling social issues beneath the surface on the basis of gdp growth alone the korean economy grew well and everything should be fine right the problem however was that the benefits of that growth fell to a very small cohort of people a significant gap opened up between the haves and the have-nots in korean society in 2013 the table brought in over 50 percent of revenue and value add in the manufacturing sector but they employed less than 20 percent of the sector's employees as part of the negotiations during the reform era after 1997 the government wanted the table to become more profitable so that they can more easily service their debts the table agreed but wanted to make it easier for them to lay people off the korean government agreed hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs many of them have never found regular salaried work since and instead work irregularly elder poverty in korea has since reached four times the oecd average income share for the top 1 percent of korean society rose from 7 before 1997 to 12 in the mid 2010s the korean people recognize this inequality that they have seen and shared none of the success by the country's so-called national champions and its plutocratic owners and that is why the korean people voted for a change of direction in 2007. president lee myeongbok is a conservative from the pakchangi line a former businessman and ceo of hyundai construction his 2007 presidential campaign emphasized economic recovery after what he called a lost decade of liberal rule note again that the korean economy grew 5 a year from 1997 to 2007. nothing like the glory years of the 80s and early 90s but very good by almost any measure lee's campaign made the 747 promise to the korean people by bringing ceo style management to korea he would raise gdp growth to 7 percent achieve a per capita income of forty thousand dollars and make korea the seventh largest economy lee won with the highest margin in years but record low voter participation indicated that the korean people were starting to lose faith in their government's ability to curb the country's social inequalities and bring the good times back fundamentally lee's business policies indicated that he felt the previous 10 years had held back the chairboard's abilities to compete against other multinational corporate giants thus not that big business was too big for korea but big business was too small for the world he lowered the corporate tax rate from 25 to 20 raised the ceiling on non-bank financial investment and amnestied a number of executives convicted in wake of the financial crisis he also oversaw a continuation of market-oriented reforms giving more decision-making powers to the industry one can argue that lee's goal would bring back the era of pakchanghi's rapid economic growth and development lee traded on those sentiments especially when he added puck era economic planners to his administration but unlike with park lee did not force the chebo to funnel profits into new and risky industries something wild and crazy like quantum computers offshore wind or fusion energy that the chamber would otherwise not really invest in the government failed to do that and instead funneled money to rust-built industries like construction and infrastructure in the end the lee administration could not deliver the growth that they promised gdp growth has continued to decline throughout the 2000s korean presidents only have one term so lee soon stepped down in 2018 he was arrested for charges of bribery embezzlement and tax fraud during the next presidential election in 2012 conservative park geun-hye moved leftwards on her messaging she combined her platform of nostalgia for the glory years with stronger emphasis on welfare notably however she did not advocate for a higher capital gains tax key to the accelerating korean wealth gap modern corruption committed by the cebu is done to maximize their wealth and market power in korea and elsewhere two areas in particular focus maintaining control of their empire mostly through the use of tax manipulations and legislation and regulatory capture i want to talk more on the latter a lot of people today take a nihilistic perspective to the wealth inequality and big business corruption problem gosh it might even be cool to do so now who cares we can't do anything about it they got all the politicians in their pockets the reality is that these actions have consequences and that came to be most apparent with the 2014 said wool sinking which claimed 304 lives most of them high school students a variety of things have been said about the say well sinking most of them are true for instance i mentioned that the ferry already had been quite old when it was first purchased and converted to passenger use and that it had been very overloaded when it set off on its journey the most proximate reason why the death rate was so high however was that safety and rescue regulations were ignored and had been so for a while for too long the regulatory agency and the company worked closely together to ignore violations and keep the profitable status quo a status quo which included the continued rotation of government employees into the industry and the ferry companies continued monopoly privilege of the lucrative incheon jeju ferry route without pressure from either government or market why should a ferry company try harder why should any company south korea's struggle with its biggest companies continues president park geun-hye's administration ended in a spate of corruption scandals and impeachment her successor president moon jae-in has responded with certain business reforms and higher tax rates and it seems to have brought about a bit of an improvement at least in the court of public opinion however the south korean economy like taiwan's to some extent is now quite dependent on its handful of super powerful global companies it is more than likely that substantial reform will weaken their place in the world marketplace against companies in the united states europe and china south korean democratic society has become increasingly polarized like many others in the world and the issue will be furiously debated chible reform and what to do about it continues to be an issue in south korean presidential politics right up there with what to do about north korea alright that's it for tonight thanks for watching subscribe to the channel sign up for the
