in the 1970s and 80s, the soviet union 
put 5 landers on the surface of venus   and they each survived for over 30 
minutes. no one has tried it since. from time to time, someone will post to reddit 
pictures from the venera missions and everyone   goes "nice". and yeah it is pretty cool that these 
pictures exist. but have you ever wondered what it   took to build a machine capable of taking 
those pictures? like, how did they do it? in this video, i want to look at the 
venera space series and the engineering   behind this stunning achievement. sit back 
and enjoy. this is going to be a long one. let us first talk about venus. i 
cannot imagine a harder place to   land on anywhere in the solar system. okay, 
maybe the sun. but venus comes in second. venus has been called earth's evil twin. the   planet that started off similar to the 
earth but eventually went oh so wrong. the two planets are close 
together and are similar in size,   but the venusian atmosphere is as 
different as it can get from earth's.   this is due to a runaway greenhouse effect 
that has gone on for who knows how long. the venusian surface gets hotter than mercury's: 
864 degrees fahrenheit or 462 celsius.   the surface pressure is equivalent to being 
over 0.5 miles or a kilometer under water. that thick atmosphere presents special challenges. 
its clouds are made up of sulfuric acid,   used in lead acid batteries and as an 
industrial cleaner. and you have to survive   atmospheric entry, where friction can 
heat you up to 11,000 degrees celsius. the americans put a dude on the moon, but they 
never tried to put a legit lander on venus.   the soviets would eventually do it 5 times. but i am getting ahead of myself. let us 
wind the clock all the way back to 1967.   as the year was coming to a close, the 
soviets found themselves at a crossroads. eleven launches to venus. eleven failures. 
that was the scorecard going on to venera 4. the mission of the venera project 
(venera is russian for venus)   was to land a probe on the venusian surface. 
with the space race in full swing, the soviets   wanted to outdo the americans by piercing the 
venusian veil. the american capitalists were   sending a flyby probe to venus that was scheduled 
to arrive in late 1967. let's show them up first. for the soviets, it was now or never. 
after venera 3 failed to reach the ground,   the whole venera mission was transferred 
over to the aerospace company lavochkin.   venera 4's launch date was set 
for the autumn 1967 launch window. venera 4 was a hefty thing. it stood 11 feet 
or 3.5 meters tall. its bottom lander was   essentially a bunch of instruments and a battery 
wrapped up in a pressure shell with a parachute. venera 4 reached venus in october 1967 
and successfully launched its lander.   the mother craft released 
the probe over the planet   and it entered the atmosphere. temperatures hit 
11,000 degrees and entry forces reached 450g.   the onboard instruments began analyzing 
the atmosphere and sending back data. the first recorded temperature 
was 102 degrees fahrenheit or   39 degrees celsius. atmospheric pressure 
was about the same as that on earth. but both measures began rising. and they kept 
rising. quickly. 10 atmospheres. then 20.   it just kept going up. far higher 
than anything engineers anticipated. 93 minutes into the mission, with the probe still 
over 27 kilometers above the venusian surface,   venera 4 cracked open - likely near its 
top - and was crushed. the measurements   at crush point showed 22 atmospheres and 530 
degrees fahrenheit or 277 degrees celsius. by now, the american probe 
mariner 5 had also reached venus.   it flew past the planet and sent back data 
on the planet's atmosphere and composition. the soviets and americans compared their 
probes' data and came to the conclusion   that venus was a hotter, drier, far more 
hostile planet than anyone had anticipated. as a great american once said, 
"you're going to need a bigger boat." this realization required intense 
engineering. but with construction   for venera 5 and 6 already finalized 
and the 1969 launch date coming up fast,   there would be no time to make major 
changes. engineers did what they could   to strengthen the landing probe and left 
the radical re-design to the next launch. 5 and 6 were sent on a mission 
they were not fully prepared for,   and the results were similar. venera 5 transmitted 
data for 53 minutes before succumbing to pressures   of 27 atmospheres and temperatures of 600 
degree fahrenheit or 320 degrees celsius. venera 6 lasted for 51 minutes, but it had gotten 
slightly further. descending 37.8 kilometers into   the atmosphere before also getting crushed. 
you know what, i am sensing a pattern here. with the 1970 launch window, the program directors   were determined to make it to the 
venusian surface. whatever it takes. and now they knew what it would take. 840 
degrees fahrenheit or 450 degrees celsius.   100 atmospheres. burning, 
corrosive acid. let's go! venera engineers consulted submarine designers 
for tips on how to survive deep pressures.   they sourced new materials to build it. and they 
got a hotter, stronger test chamber to test it. engineers wanted to maximize the amount 
of the time spent on the surface,   so they modified the parachute 
to make the lander fall faster.   when temperatures hit 390 degrees fahrenheit / 
200 degrees celsius, a restricting cord would melt   and the thing would fully open up to 
assure a soft landing. a nifty mechanism. the lander was built in the shape of an egg. 
made of titanium, its surface was smooth,   with as few ports, welds or 
sub-structures as possible.   the inside was lined with shock absorber 
and an unknown insulation layer.   like with its predecessors, the chamber would 
pre-chill to freezing temperatures before entry. after a 4 month journey, venera 7 reached 
the planet on december 1970. it separated   from the mother ship and descended into 
the atmosphere, transmitting data for 35   minutes through the atmosphere. the parachute at 
first worked as intended. things seemed smooth. but six minutes into stage 2, the chute melted 
or tore and the probe dropped like a rock.   venera 7 then unexpectedly hit 
the ground at 35 miles an hour   or 60 kilometers an hour - 
4:42 am venus solar time. it hit the venusian ground (determined to be 
harder than sand but softer than pumice) after   free-falling and bounced. the signal then abruptly 
seemed to have cut out a second after landing. soviet engineers sadly thought 
the probe was crushed to bits.   but a few months later, radio 
astronomers reviewing the radio data   re-discovered the signal, extremely weak 
and lost amidst the noise. incredible luck. as it turned out, venera 7's bounce had misaligned 
the antenna and caused it to come to rest on its   side - weakening the signal to 1 or 3% strength. 
the probe sat there transmitting data for 23   minutes in temperatures hot enough to melt zinc 
or lead until its shell cracked and it too melted. the data sent by venera 7 (and venera 8, a 
similar design launched two years later in 1972)   helped pave the way for a new 
generation of venusian probes. it would not be until 1975 that the 
soviets launched their next series   of venera probes - 5 years after venera 7.   by then, soviet engineers now knew what to expect, 
and designed the two to do more than ever before.   and that includes sending back black and 
white photographs. in fact, that was the   probes' primary goal: send back the first ever 
photographic panorama of the venusian surface. new rockets developed for propulsion 
to the moon and mars allowed for bigger   probes than ever before. venera 9 and 10 
were 5x heavier than their predecessors,   weighing 5 tons or 5,000 
kilograms at launch in total. venera 9 and 10 had an orbiter and 
lander component. the entry capsule,   the equipment designed to bring the 
lander to the surface, was a spherical   capsule covered in an asbestos composite. it 
would enter the atmosphere, take the heat,   and split into half like a plastic easter egg - 
ejecting the lander forward to its destination. the lander was magnificently 
designed. the six and a half foot (or   2 meter) tall lander was essentially 
a hermetically sealed titanium sphere   2.6 feet or 80 centimeters wide with some 
peripherals attached. that sphere would   hold the instruments and was bolted together 
with gold wire seals. inside, shelves made   of beryllium and electric fans would evenly 
disperse heat to prevent instrument failure. the sphere's inside would be lined 
with a type of polyurethane foam now   forgotten. they then wrapped the whole 
thing in 5 inches or 12 centimeters of   a honeycomb composite insulation 
and another layer of titanium. on the bottom of the lander, they 
stuck a shock absorbing ring. at the top, titanium disk that kind of looks 
like a hat. that funky hat would serve as   an aerobrake that replaced the two-stage 
parachute design that so troubled venera 7. the way it works, the parachute entirely detached 
at 30 miles or 50 kilometers above the surface   and the aerobrake does the 
rest. to see if it worked,   soviet engineers threw it out of an airplane 
8.7 miles (not 87 mi) or 14 kilometers (not 140 kilometers!) above the ground.  two cameras were placed in the middle of the 
lander so that they can see both the surface   and out into the horizon as far as possible. 
equipped with goldfish bowl lenses,   they were protected with a special 
pressure window made of pure quartz.   the lander sent its image data - 512x128 pixels 
large - at a rate of one line every 3.5 seconds. maybe they should have set up a starlink 
or something. might have sped things up! scientists estimated with all of this, the entry 
probe would probably last an hour on the surface.   just one hour. but it would 
take at least half an hour   to send the full panorama, so i guess it was fine. late october 1975, venera 9 and 
10 arrived and landed as planned.   their parachutes cut at 50 kilometers as 
planned and both landers hit the ground   at around 15 miles or 25 kilometers per hour. venera 9 landed first. touching 
down on a slight slope, maybe a   hill or the side of a volcanic crater, 
and kicking up a bit of dust at landing. one of the two cameras succeeded in 
photographing and transmitting their data.   scientists waited. slowly, the data trickled 
in ... revealing our first ever picture of   the venusian surface. what they saw were 
sharp rocks, soil, and a distant horizon. it might have looked like a 
spot back home, but it wasn't.   these images traveled to us 
from a whole different world. the sun was shining bright on venus that 
day, although obscured by the clouds,   and there was a gentle breeze blowing. a pleasant 
morning. well, except for the crushing pressures,   nearly water-less atmosphere, corrosive 
acid and 800 degree temperatures. venera 10 landed similarly a few days 
later but on much more boring terrain.   a rolling plain with hardened pieces of 
magma. these rocks are much older than   those venera 9 saw. the acidic atmosphere 
has had time to chemically scorch them. both probes transmitted for 50-60 minutes 
until their orbiters went out of range.   at that point, the temperatures inside the 
probes' measured about 140 degrees fahrenheit   or 60 degrees celsius. they could have kept 
going. when they actually died, we don't know.   the orbiters themselves later burned up in the 
atmosphere once they completed their mission. venera 9 and 10 were stunning 
successes and represented a   triumphant public relations event for 
the soviet union. they sought a sequel. venera 11 and 12 would go on to do some 
interesting science, but because a mysterious   electric anomaly disabled their cameras, their 
trips have largely been forgotten. it was a bit   of a disappointing follow up to the 9 and 10. but 
soviet scientists geared up for the grand finale. kind of like the iphone 11 as compared 
to the iphone x, the venera 13 and 14   retained the core principles from the 9 
and 10 but refined the edges and corners. engineers improved the cameras, 
the scientific instruments,   and added new heat-resistant technologies. 
they even rated it to last at least 30 minutes   down there. guaranteed or your money back. 
and cool, color images can now be taken! the amazing thing was that many of these 
sensors and instruments could now mounted   outside the spherical pressure chamber. made of 
platinum and covered in acid-resistant enamel,   their placement is a testament to 
their engineers' understanding of   and experience with the 
crushing venusian environment. venera 13 arrived first, landing as planned. 
the lens cap popped off as expected and took   two photos. a first contingency photo of 
black and white and then another in color. the photos showed a surface of pebbled, 
loose soil amidst outcroppings of bed rock,   looking similar to the bottom of the ocean. in the distance, rolling plateaus and an orange 
sky. the venusian atmosphere absorbs blue light,   so most things will look orange or yellowish. venera 14's images showed a more weathered 
plain with fine-grained rock and far less   loose soil. something like a baked cake. the 
rock appears younger, but nobody knows for sure   because venera 14's drill famously drilled 
exactly on where the lens cap had landed. the two probes held microphones and sent 
back what they heard. amazingly enough it   never really occurred to the soviets at the 
time to release the audio they picked up. you can probably find it on reddit 
somewhere, but after you hear the   lens cap blowing off and the drill 
drilling, venus sounds like a gently   blowing wind with faint hints of distant 
rumblings. presumed to be venus-quakes. an amazing soviet achievement. but 
they would be the last landers to   touch the venusian surface. venera 15 and 16 
swapped out the lander component with radar,   thereafter mapping the 
venusian topography from orbit. the last venera landers were built in the 1980s.   space programs since then have shifted to the 
moon and mars. i suppose there is a justified   reason for this. no human is ever going 
to set foot on venus. well, alive anyway. but it is possible to send another lander 
back to the venusian surface. engineers know   what to expect and that it can be done. the 
soviets did it with decades-old technology. the problem is of course 
economics and cost-benefit.   there is something weird about 
investing so much time and resources   into a thing that survives less than a day. and by 
weird i mean insane. most of the venus exploration   proposals have been things like balloons and 
other high altitude floating explorations. to make the economics work for a lander, you 
have to send something that can get there,   move around and last for weeks on end. the 
cooling technologies capable of doing that   are, to put it lightly, a few years away. much of the secret work done during the 
soviet era for the venera series is now lost.   but there are some interesting developments 
in extreme environment technologies   that might make a return trip possible. 
perhaps we can go over that in a future   video if this one does well. let's say 700 likes? regardless the venera series was 
an amazing engineering achievement   and in my opinion represented the 
country's pinnacle of space exploration.   i loved researching every bit of this.
