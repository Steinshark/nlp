i don't think there's been a video that has ever been asked for so hard for me to watch and so we're going to watch it big box s by the way check it out big boox we i have never been harassed so much about watching this this video which makes me think okay it's from big box everyone's asking me to watch it it probably mentions me that's that's that's probably where this going i'm hoping that i'm not going to get dunked on but let's find out i i'm ready to get f dude it's going to be vim he's going to dunk on vim i already know what's going to happen and then i'm going to be sag okay all right okay software is known for producing a lot of scams think nigerian prince tai lopez crypto nft aaa gaming industry but i ain't talking about all that i'm talking about the lies sold to developers and it's a pretty long list so buckle up clean code see i knew it i knew it i knew it sock mustaches look at that look at that that's skill issue okay that is a skill issue i can already tell it's about to happen i can already feel it i knew i came in i came in on the defensive here because i knew i knew what i was getting into this is a skill issue i'm sorry if you you can't grow up monache you got skill issues okay clean code you see the way charles ponzi put the ponzi and ponzi scheme uncle bob has put the be in bakas clean code has gone through a reputational renaissance similar to ellen jimmy and james bros whole book is a filler episode when you take the energy of a junior engineer and combine it with such riveting advice that's how you get a po request the size of epstein's list ain't nobody reviewing that bro i just give us the list just just just do it just do it what's the why why not why not man this is this is already it's too much but it is true man i do i i'm very curious what uncle bob has to say of why four to six lines per function like why put that arbitrary limit on a function i just can't imagine anything good comes out of that because i have this i have a my my opposing which i think htm x has claimed the best as far as like a term for it which is locality of behavior the more you have to jump from function to function like the less it's the less easy it is to hold in your head what's happening right the equal thing happens when you have a really long function that does a lot of things it's really hard to hold it all in your head but i think it's significantly easier than 40 functions all in your head trying to figure out what what those things happen locality of behavior is is is is very very very useful and so i i just would rather air on slightly longer functions that maybe it does one and a half things as opposed to four to six line functions is like considered like a good a good range anything beyond that is considered like time to refactor now obviously that's not a hard and fast rule but you know i think you would like the philosophy of software design i very would very well could by the way for those that don't know it's right here i think that locality of behavior carson gross the primary feature for easy maintenance is locality locality is the characteristics of source code that enables a programmer to understand that source by looking at only a small portion of it this is this is good the behavior of the unit of code should be as obvious as looking only at the at that unit of code this is good this is exactly what we're talking about locality of behavior it's very very it's very very different than clean code clean code is the the polar opposite of locality of behavior code and i'm not saying locality of behavior doesn't have its own own edges and and issues it's certainly does and it can certainly get out of hand easily barely read my own code and that's jamie oliver's recipe for a 3 a.m. christmas eve production outage and off the back of the last famous manifesto uncle bob decides to write his own on the topic of agile development now this is the manifesto that deserved us military intervention because it infested the whole world from brazil to india orlando to ohio we're all super happy sitting in another sprint planning agile was a 9,000 iq chess move by the boomers to get into tech without coding but quite honestly we're the plebs because we listened to the boomers and fell for the next scam cs degree there were so many shots fired i'm not even sure what to do i'm not even sure how to process all of this and i've i've stopped at this frame this is the frame that we've decided to stop at okay that was just a massacre dude that was just a massacre brazil mentioned potentially brazil might have been mentioned i'm going to say something and i think a lot of people might be upset about it agile in its manifesto is great let me let me explain why let me explain why every team themselves should de decide how they commit and run their own little units right that's like one of the most basic forms of agile i think that's great every su little team should have their ability to make the decision for how they follow their own process what's the problem what's the obvious problem of it all a sub team isn't isn't an island onto themselves no it's not management well i mean you could call it management but not like people management it's that there's that that each team then needs to also get in line with each other and so what ends up happening everyone discusses hey we need to come up with some sort of everybody is in step to make the same decisions across this thing and so what ends up happening you get the average of everyone's decision okay i don't know if you know this but here's the this is why group decisions suck this is why you should have an informed captain and you should never have a group of people making decision because on one side you have really really bad decisions bad ones right here right and then in the middle you have just like just the place that makes nobody happy right and when i say bad decisions i mean someone else's opinion at this point okay and maybe it's actually not that bad it's kind of like an inverse an inverse normal normal curve and this is great decisions by the way these are my ideas okay these are your ideas that i don't like these are my ideas that i do like and this is the middle ground which is actually the worst place to be it is actually the bad ideas and so what happens is that when you get a group of people well we can't go over here and you can't go over here so you compromise right here you compromise right in the middle and guess what you've created the worst possible solution and now we call this we've codified this term today we've actually created a word for this exact thing in that word it's called scrum scrum is the codification of agile inter interacting among many teams it's just the worst possible outcome ever and so what i really mean by this is that agile truly is communism it always fails and people always blame that we did not do it correctly all right i'm sorry this is designed by committee it is all right it has never been tried i get it it's never been tried really there's no real scotsman you've never done agile correctly javascript can work on a server i've heard it okay i've heard it a lot of times i'm also trying to equally offend as many people as possible and by the way i have a lot of opinions on this one and so this one's already triggering me so this is actually i'm i'm i'm still a pro college person but let me just give you my base take before we go on i think that computer science would do a lot better if we dropped all of the core requirements all the stupid stuff to make you a well-rounded person when i say stupid stuff i actually don't mean it's stupid i think people should go to school to become well-rounded but the first initial courses in becoming a well-rounded person are absolutely worthless okay nobody cares about the cop and weather system okay the fact that i'm going to be like well brazil is a you know is a is a class a subb tropical rainforest a cop and weather system like people don't care no one cares it's completely worthless why are we doing this why are we doing this to ourselves okay no one cares that california has a mediterranean climate on part of it and that's what makes it such a desirable place for people to live i get it but nobody actually cares okay that's not helpful information doesn't make me more well-rounded okay i can say the word cop and weather system and it doesn't mean anything okay i had to spend an i think i spent a semester learning about dumb geography things when i was a senior in college because i did too much lsd as a as a freshman in college and so i had to make up a bunch of core classes and one of them was geography it was worthless it wasn't i didn't become a more well-rounded person i didn't get to go like read the great poets like imagine if i had to take a class that was like reeds wordsworth and and and augustine and thomas aquinus and coolidge like that would have been a great experience why didn't i get the reading of the the poetries of the peoples instead i got some stupid ass cop and weather system so i i totally get it this is why college is bad i would really yeah marcus raes i' i' totally down to do that hot take master's degree is the new bachelors doubt anyways i do think it'd be really awesome if we had something like a trade school for programming and i don't mean a boot camp see boot camps are fundamentally flawed because boot camp's goal is to just make you learn one thing and get you out as quickly as possible and in a market that was starving for need no i don't want that i want something that's like a 2-year kind of traditionalized school that's at a fast pace that that like forces you to build a compiler that forces you to do some operating systems some database stuff like you actually do real real part of it like a trade school right i think a trade school would be way way way way way better because i don't think you need all of this i i think college is a dying sport for a lot of people and so cs degrees is how we get a lot of that and so but boot camps are pieces of [ __ ] and largely leave a lot of people disenfranchised and are terrible there's like a tech school somewhere in between right that i think would be really really good anyways just a thought that's what i think a lot of colleges suck too yeah absolutely i the thing the thing that makes college nice is that they have something called abet accrediting and what makes it really nice is that with abet accrediting it forces you to teach certain subjects so even if the teacher sucks you have to go off and learn by yourself and read the the book and become good at it right and and and and at least you force yourself to go see stuff right my favorite i started off at montana i was also at montana montana state university best one ever but i dropped out and transferred to colorado state they wouldn't accept my dumb general electives i refused to retake them and god accepted upper level electives it isn't about being well-rounded it's about getting those tuition dollars well at one point it was about being well-rounded the whole point of getting a a a a bachelor's degree was for you to be able to leisure well for you to be able to study and read the poets and do all that so the original college degrees that's why it had so much emphasis on writing and and reading the poetry and all that kind of stuff right anyways all right now that we've said all that and now you know exactly where i stand it's time for me to become emotionally damaged now although degrees are a society level scam leave it to programmers to over engineer education like in any other occupation you have simple linear career paths you want to become a plumber go to trade school you want to become an accountant get a degree but the path to software engineering is like a fidget spinner there's like three options and none of them work anymore and it's also out of style despite your education all developers can agree leak code is a me okay can can we got we got to quit having dev rails convince we this this right here just has to stop can we all agree that you're not helping your case cloud flair no ain't nobody helping right now okay this just has to stop we just got to stop doing this all developers k agree leak code is a massive scam look man it's been discussed to death but all i'm going to say is do you think mechanics need to build a car from scratch to get a job all this grinding just to code some front end but wait that's another scam okay this too many scams are happening at one time le code so i i dude i the some of the worst insults i've ever received are because i have a mixed feelings about le code and so i always get this i get prime is out of date because he thinks people should do whiteboard interviews so what's the alternative right the alternative is what apprenticing for free or some paid contractual amount like that's going to happen that's not going to happen okay that may work for some people but that's largely not going to work two a take-home okay so you want me to work for what 10 to 20 hours on a takehome is that what you're suggesting you no that favors people who have no kids that have free time right it's it's it's it's it's all it you optimize for a certain set of people with any interview take homes are absolutely the worst i know so again what's the alternative there's someone has one where you go to the place and you and you get a problem where you work on where you have to like hook up to an api and make some calls and do all that six months apprenticeship it just ain't no way right i'm not taking a contract for 6 months the thing i like about leak code and by the way i i've told you many times don't do leak code i think the only leak code you should do are the array problems if you're going to do anything with the le code learn data structures and algorithms okay be good at data structures and algorithms you can solve most you can solve most problems just knowing a few data structures like almost all problems in interviews can be solved with this again i get just hammered in the comments about this specific thing which is that if you just know your data structures and algorithms you will pass most whiteboarding inter you will the third one is just come up with better whiteboarding interviews i think that that largely works if you can come up with good ones one of my favor questions to ask is an async request queue just simply go out there and just build something that takes that takes in a promise or that takes in a promise factory and produces out a promise and when you're done with that promise and when you can execute that promise factory you will execute it get out the promise resolve it and return out the return value or propagate forward the error like it's just pretty simple it's not like a hard thing to do it it's pretty easy but man i've watched some pretty crazy things by the way i've seen people prompt interview by the way i gave this as a question and i watched somebody prompt interview me i watched somebody do this it was awful okay i watched somebody give me the old ai okay i watched them go go like this this is what they' literally do they had their camera on on them and they go like this and then i tell i i kid you not they actually had the gall to tell me i've never worked with typescript i don't know typescript and then proceeded to do the following thing const fu equals array. shift bang they did that after telling me they've never worked with script and i was just like bro you tell me you've never worked with typescript but you just did a false or a a a what's it called a forcing undefined removal in a single bang like that that ain't no way ain't no way you don't know anything about typescript and you're hitting that what's array shift bang it forces out the out the undefined so it just becomes t it becomes type t and so to tell me that you never did it you're off looking at a screen and typing and then you hit me with a bang t at the end ain't no way ain't no way right how did you respond of course i didn't say anything you i i don't i don't call out people because i wanted to see where they could go and guess what what happens when there's a single problem and you are doing and and you're using chat gpt what happens with chat gpt when there's a problem it reproduces a new set of code yeah so guess what that person did they also went i'm going to do it in i i'm going to start over erased everything and started over from the beginning yeah yeah certainly anyways chat gpt ridiculous and so that's my take on leak code which is if you know just a little bit of le if you know if you know how to do the array stuff which by the way i actually think this is a very positive part about a le code and probably the most beneficial practically to your career for the rest of your life is learning to be effective with arrays do the array problems with le code i think they're like cityscape completely piece of [ __ ] annoying problem takes like an hour to get correct it's just like such a tedious exercise but man does it make you good with a raise being good with a raise is very very very beneficial i strongly recommend you at least do that right and that will just help you for your career just being strong with them is never a bad thing and so i recommend that plus dsa and you will be able to conquer most whiteboarding interviews now if you can't conquer conquer the whiteboarding interview and likely if you know all of your base data structures and you can't do it to me all it says is that whoever designed these interviews designed them in such a way that they're complete morons and you probably don't want to work at that place to begin with okay it's as simple as that dynam yeah exactly if they give you some crazy ass dynamic if they like ask you the coin change problem it's crazy it's actually crazy anyways is a massive scam look man it's been discussed to death but all i'm going to say is do you think think mechanics need to build a car from scratch to get a job all this grinding to be fair they would build an engine from scratch in some sense and i i i'm sure there's plenty that would love the opportunity to do that and i'm sure there's a bunch of gearheads who have built a lot of their own stuff together and probably the best mechanics do like real talk i bet you some of the best mechanics out there are are into that are are into building things as much as they can right obviously you can't build things from scratch in the sense that you can't like you can't like build your own engine block but most certainly they put things together and let's just face it a mechanic putting a bunch of pieces together is not much different than the front end okay okay can we be real here for a second you put a bunch of pieces together and you call that come on you you put a bunch of pieces together you don't actually build any of the pieces and then you connect them all together and you're like oh crap something's not working you're just glue engineering i hate to tell you this people being just a code some front end but wait that's another scam front end is easy front end being called easy is a scam perpetrated by insecure backend engineers because they think gluing together some crappy spring boot to postgress is real engineering they're probably coding that mess in neovim and preaching the next scam to unsuspecting developers i already knew this was coming okay we knew for a fact what was about to happen okay okay i'm not mad i'm not mad i'm i'm not mad okay i'm not in shambles night sh dude i'm not in shambles we're not in shambles okay i'm shambling i'm not mad can can i get can i can can c can can i get a second c can a man get a second here can can i get a second first off i would just like to let you know okay mr big boxu you think i'm not keeping the receipts mr big boxu i already knew this was coming okay i already knew it was coming i already knew it was coming yeah mr big box by the way go follow him on twitter great guy let's go in here look at this he uses vim motions okay which means he used vs code hurts but he likes vim motions too okay so mr vim is productivity scam who also uses it i'm internally maling okay okay but let me be real for one second about why i why okay let me give you you my pre my precursor okay let me just let me just tickle the tip just a little bit the reason why i choose neovin is because i like to craft my own environment okay i like all my own shortcuts the way i want them i like the ability to be able to create whatever i want to create like right now we are creating a real-time rendering engine in neovim right now and it's been fantastic and for me that is just absolutely lovely i really like my tools i like to be able to go deep on my tools and neovim is by far the best editor to go deep on second i think vim motions by themselves are the superior way to edit text i think if you're doing lots of programming if you're not using vim motions you're just you're you're just wasting time okay you're just wasting time all right and some people you can use vim motions in your vs code you can have your nice luxurious scarf on with your nice little you know you can totally do that and no one no one is hey i copium yeah i know but you can do that all you want okay just saying just saying acoustic af maybe the acoustics are a bit off in here okay vim productivity vim productivity is stage one of toxic developer disease otherwise known as tdd which often develops into stage 2 iuse arch by the way and the final stage is when you spend half your salary to buy a keyboard split up like bang adition okay okay the kinesis 360 advantage is a great keyboard okay what is this this is this is a direct this is a literal direct attack against me okay this is not even fair it's not even fair it's saying it's split like pakistan and bangladesh just i'm getting owned right now pakistan to hook up tier overpriced think we were going to finish setting up our system 76 after a couple more videos people so not really sure what to do with this at this point i i feel targeted okay i feel i feel genuinely targeted in this one pat only to be paid half as much as your coworker with actual hobbies a girlfriend and a life outside of programming but wait you're having a maladaptive daydream because you don't have any co-workers because tech jobs are literally a scam sure you're highly paid but the amount of time you'll spend unemployed from layoffs averages out to working at mcdonald's the biggest pain of being laid isn't even losing money it's over hearing your mom say oh b what to do my beta no study no job no sh you see auntie your beta fell for the biggest scam everyone should learn to code a scam pedal by politicians and their buddy businessmen when they outsource your job to a develop i do think he's right on this one and what i mean is that i don't think i don't think it's not that i don't think everyone is not capable of being a great programmer i don't think most people want to put in the effort it takes to be a good programmer no job no shouty got me it's true and so that's where i think a lot of this comes from with where where where people say everyone should learn to code the hard part is like man you got to you you got a full asset as judo says as the man judo says you got to full ass that it's it's hard it's harding country no no no it's for the greater good of of the economy tech bros love spouting on and on about how anyone can learn to code and build a startup my dude mark zuckerberg dropped out of harvard you're dropping out of udmi and getting kicked out of free code camp design patterns at this point there is a little bit of a difference there is a little bit of difference and i also think you know like real talk you cannot like i've always hated that phrase where be like well mark zuckerberg dropped out of harvard all the best all the biggest tech entrepreneurs these days have dropped out of harvard there's also this fundamental problem which is that during that time there wasn't much on the internet it was a giant a giant a giant opportunity like just well sitting there for anyone to make anything and then second the gold rush is over the gold rush is over it's no longer it's no longer possible to do what they did back then also can we can we do the second thing they got into harvard okay so step one they were already smarter than you step two they were so smart they just left and did something different you know what i mean so i hate to tell you this dropping out of college does not make you a genius okay counterpoint counterpoint i got into cmu and i'm an idiot okay fair step zero rich parents that's one of the easiest ways honestly if you guys really want to do this you should just have rich parents it's honestly the easiest way to make a lot of money is just have your parents give you a lot of money like simplest it's the most straightforward way so if you just got better parents honestly work out pretty easy thanks for the advice prime no problem no problem yeah yeah i only give the most based based advice around here i but you know i real real talk i just wanted to be such i wanted to be such a chad that i just i personally chose not to have rich parents okay i was going to make all of my money off of $5 a month that's what i decided okay that's what i decided personally so thank you for all the $5 a month personally chose that one personally strats strats and strategies okay you wouldn't understand honestly i you know what i dropped out of harvard so hard i didn't even go to harvard think about that point a good rule of thumb is that if uncle bob has a book on it you really shouldn't be using it design patterns like many aspects of software engineering great in practice impossible to implement similar oh gosh i just had i just had i just had i just had earl gray come up into the nose on that one i was not ready for that one i was really not ready for the for uncle bob catching multiple strays on this one i was not i was not i was not ready for that one okay two best practices oh did you even catch that picture you really shouldn't be using it design pattern like many aspects of software engineering great and practice the person's writing this looks like they're getting hung in the [laughter] other this is pretty clever impossible to implement similar to best practices and if you disagree you can kiss my dry yagy ass because your code is always going to be slow and unreadable not that it matters if it's fast because code performance is literally a scam code performance is like astrology for developers i mean it could have an impact on your code but more often than not it's just to sell you a course your real performance is actually how quickly you ship features this whole industry is full of scams man but you know what isn't a scam the spons we'll get we'll get to the sponsor don't worry we'll get to the sponsor actually that's that's the one i kind of partially disagree with in the sense that if you don't make something to begin with it can be really slow right and let's just face it when you use a slow application it's pretty infuriating right there is a good enough threshold absolutely i think you like you should definitely consider the program you're making right you should definitely consider the program you're making and it matters more and more and less right if if if you are making a simple website then 600 milliseconds is fast as [ __ ] okay if you're making like you said ssh that hurts you know if you you have to press buttons and everything is super slow that hurts that that's emotionally painful and so there's definitely there's definitely you got to rate the program you're you're you're using you know what i mean i don't think some apps are intentionally made hard to use i don't believe that even one bit what i believe is that the average app is just what people think people like and what most people think is good ux is not good ux okay i'm sorry i hate to tell you this but just because you call yourself a ui engineer doesn't mean you know what makes good ux good ux is hard and i think it's really i think it's very reasonable to have somebody that thinks only about ux i think it's really good to go and actually have qualitative research on what makes good ux i think it's really really good to test proper ux to be able to have two different user experiences and test them in production to see which one's actually better quantitative and qualitative research is really really important and the bigger the company the more opportunity you have to do that now smaller companies you just have to kind of guess right you kind of just have to guess and you hope that you got it you got it good enough but it's painful serve today's video brilliant.org bril oh brilliant hey thanks for the hype train everybody is an app and website with an amazing collection of lessons on math and science i love learning new things but learning math and science has always been super tricky most of the material online is very drawn out and not as engaging i've also recently been trying to get into game development and needed to brush up on my physics fundamentals with the lack of time and resources i needed a solution and that's where brilliant came in you see brilliant uses a combination of techniques such as visual learning with interactive diagrams and reinforcement learning with experiments but the more important thing is that it's delivered in super concise and fun lessons i've been using my commute as a key trigger to use brilliant and in the past few months i've gotten to the point where i can understand and think critically about basic physics problems don't believe me you can get started with brilliant for free for 30 days that's brilliant.org big box site the link is in the description do that you'll also get 20% off the annual subscription thank you so much to brilliant for sponsoring this video and thank you for your time i am big box let's go let's go let's go that was great that was great it was a scam definitely got scammed hard with the i don't know i i have you know i know i can't tell where satire ends and where it begins in that video cuz i don't think he likes clean code right i really don't think he likes clean code but does he not like all of those things or are some of those things i can't tell einstein had a mustache exactly exactly exactly see it's not that simple that's the point i can't tell i can't tell when things end and begin it's impossible anyways i really i really satire ends when he talked about the split keyboard yeah that was just the split keyboard on on system 76 was clearly a he was fist fighting me and he just landed one right in the gut and i'm very upset about it the name the name it's the prime engine
