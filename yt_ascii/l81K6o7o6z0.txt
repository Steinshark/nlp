hello everyone and welcome for the very first time lg energy solution this video sponsor let a creator into their battery manufacturing facility for a tour in holland michigan lithium ion batteries are currently transforming the automotive space so in this video we're going to be answering three main questions what is a lithium ion battery how does it work and how is it made so a lithium ion battery is made up of four major parts cathode anode electrolyte and separator you can think of your cathode and anode as your positive and negative terminals of the battery and you're going to be exchanging lithium back and forth as well as electrons between these two sides now you have an electrolyte solution which is facilitating that lithium exchange back and forth and then you have a separator in the center which is preventing your cathode and anode from touching so you don't have a short circuit okay so let's get a better understanding of these components starting with the cathode whenever you hear about certain metals being used for battery chemistry nickel manganese cobalt aluminum this is generally in reference to the cathode material and generally speaking these materials mean the cathode is the most expensive part of the battery which is the most expensive part of an electric car now there are all kinds of different chemistries which can be and which are used within the automotive industry and you may hear car makers say things like nmc 622 when talking about the chemistry for their battery this is discussing the composition of the cathode in which it is roughly 60% nickel 20% manganese and 20% cobalt some interesting points here though the industry is shifting towards chemistry with lower amounts of cobalt due to scarcity and sourcing and higher amounts of nickel which improves energy density but can reduce longevity now we're probably getting too deep too quickly but increasing the nickel content of the cathode is actually a really interesting discussion using higher percentages of nickel tends to cause microcracking of the cathode as well as increasing reactivity with the electrolyte but you can actually use higher concentrations of nickel by using a gradient in the cathode with higher nickel concentration in the center and less at the exterior this results in a particle that's less susceptible to micro cracking and has less surface reactivity with the surrounding electrolyte so you get improved energy density without the major drawbacks of using high nickel content okay that's just one component we also have the anode which is typically made up of a graphite structure this is great for storing and exchanging lithium but there are materials that can store even more lithium like silicon because of this silicon is currently being used in anode chemistries but it has its own challenges as it tends to have significant expansion and contraction as the lithium moves to and from the anode next we have the electrolyte which is typically a liquid and traditional lithium ion batteries this electrolyte is what allows the lithium ions to flow through throughout the battery electrolytes are made up of lithium salts solvents and additives and you want something that allows for lithium ions to travel easily that doesn't react with other materials within the battery with a low freezing point and a high ignition point so that it's suitable for all kinds of environments finally we have the separator which again prevents the positive side and the negative side from touching this separator has micro pores in it which allow for lithium ions to flow between the anode and cathode but interestingly the pores aren't actually always open if the battery starts to get too hot the pores can close protecting the battery from overheating okay so how does it all work well i've separated this drawing into two sections here on the left side here we have what is essentially a dead battery that is just starting to charge and then on the right side here we have a full battery which is just starting to discharge and power our electric car so the process is pretty straightforward we have a lithium atom which which is within the anode structure and it loses an electron to that anode structure which then goes on to power our car well since the lithium has lost an electron it is now a lithium ion and it travels through the separator to find a parking space within the cathode structure where it is then rejoined with an electron and once again you have that lithium atom now for charging the process is simply the opposite so you have your lithium atom it loses an electron to the surrounding structure that lithium ion then travels across through the separator through this electrolyte where it then finds a parking spot within your anod graphite structure and it is then rejoined by an electron and once again we have a happy stable lithium atom now with this explanation we're looking at just a single layer of these materials but of course if you look inside a battery you'll see many of these layers and they can be packaged into different forms with the main ones being cylindrical prismatic and pouch style cells so the battery sheet could be tightly wound into a cylinder or a prismatic hard shell or you can stack layers of these sheets into a pouch cylindrical cells tend to be faster and easier to manufacture bringing down cost it's a similar story for prismatic cells and you now have very flexible sizing but unfortunately the hard exterior shell and the packaging also means that this has less energy density finally you have pouch style cells which take longer to make but can offer better energy and power power density lg energy solution makes different types of cells as well as different chemistries simply depending on what their client prefers to use for their applications now once you understand how a lithium ion battery works i think it helps answer two key questions that are commonly brought up first off how do charge cycles relate to longevity so we often hear that the more charged cycles you have from full battery down to low battery back up to high battery back down to low battery well this impacts a battery's performance over time time and it'll slowly lose that performance over time well why is that well again keep in mind that you have this lithium shifting back and forth within that battery so you have expansion and contraction in different parts of the battery so you have to manage that expansion and contraction which poses challenges to the internal structure in order to have longevity the other question it helps answer why do batteries charge really fast when the battery is low but much more slowly as you approach 100% charge so remember you've got a lot of lithium ions and they're all trying to find a place to stay within the anodes structure so i've heard the analogy of it being like a parking lot and i really like that because if you think about a wide open parking lot with no cars in it it's easy to park a lot of cars very quickly in there because all the spots are available well as you get down to fewer and fewer remaining spots as this battery gets closer and closer to being fully charged well it takes you a while to find a parking spot so it's a little bit slower to charge that last little bit moving on to our third question how are lithium ion batteries made and while i witnessed the full process from mixing up a metal slurry all the way to a completed battery pack there's an extraordinary number of steps from start to finish including about 850 quality control checks along the way so we're going to keep this fairly high level breaking it down into four main sections first is electrode manufacturing here the cathode and anode slurries are created and mixed these mixes are then coated and cooked onto the current collector generally copper foil for the anode and an aluminum foil for the cathode the rolls are then evenly flattened before being cut into battery sized pieces next we get to cell assembly where the battery sized pieces are laminated adding the separator and stacked into the appropriate number of layers for an individual cell finally the electrolyte is injected which starts the process of bringing the battery to life next we're at formation where the batteries are charged and discharged as well as an aging process that's applied to stabilize the cells with this complete any gases that have formed within the pouch are removed and the cell is sealed inspected and sent off to the final step the pack process here individual cells are inserted into a module where they're wired and connected and then multiple modules are added to a single pack housing that pack housing includes all the other required parts like dcdc converters bus bars fans or cooling equipment and then the final fasteners are torqued sealing the pack it then goes through final inspections and tests before being stacked on pallets and shipped off to the car manufacturer again witnessing the full process took a few hours traveling through multiple massive rooms in the lg energy solution michigan 1 facility which has a 5 g hour capacity that's the equivalent of 50,000 large 100 kw battery packs a year or 100,000 smaller 50 kw packs and they're currently building another facility next to door which is going to provide 25 gwatt hours of output with mass production expected to begin in 2025 if you're interested yeah they are actively hiring quite a few positions and will be for the foreseeable future in this space worth noting they've been actively researching lithium ion batteries since 1992 and with over 30 years in this space they've accumulated over 27,000 battery related patents this will continue well into the future as they look into to different materials inevitably solid state batteries and chemistries that might not even rely on lithium it was awesome to be able to see this in person so a big thanks to lg energy solution for sponsoring the video and thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to
