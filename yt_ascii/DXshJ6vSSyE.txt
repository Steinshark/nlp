hi and welcome to a short introduction to our sponsor sauna source today i'm really happy to have you as a sponsor and have you on board for the tool fair again let's hear a bit about sonar source hey this is brian cipolloni i'm a consultant with sonarsource since 2008 zonersource has been creating open source tools to help developers write cleaner and safer code during this session i'm going to show you how to use sonar cloud sonar lint insular cube in your c plus plus development process to improve code quality and security center source's mission as a company is for every developer and development team to use our tools for code quality and code security i've highlighted a few items here to emphasize that sonar source takes a developer first approach when designing our tools we feel that if developers find our tools cumbersome or difficult to integrate in their day-to-day processes they're not really going to get a lot of value and they're not going to have much impact in their code quality if you've used our tools in the past you may think sona source is focused as a java code quality product and you may be using other tools for static analysis security testing over the past few years we've improved our support for c plus plus and we vastly improved our ability to detect security issues with speed and accuracy it's a great time to consider sonar cube sonar cloud and sonar lint for your c plus plus and quality and security needs i'm going to jump into a demo of our c plus plus capabilities in sonar cloud our cloud-based code analysis platform sonar cube our on-premise deployment as well as sonarlint our companion ide plug-in here's an example of a bug detected through analysis and sonar cloud in this example a particular execution path will result in a memory leak sonar cloud annotates these issues with a logical path resulting in the issue so that's easy for a developer to trace through their code and find where a fix needs to be made even if it's in multiple files in this example sonar cloud has detected a vulnerability where the developer is using the memory set function to clear a buffer since this code may be optimized away by the compiler it leaves an opportunity for sensitive data in the buffer to be exposed all issues in sonar cloud in sonar cube have full documentation so that developers can understand why this is an issue and have access to code samples on what they need to do to resolve it when a vulnerability is detected our recommendation is to developers to go make a code change to fix this issue and then the issue will automatically close and be resolved upon next analysis here's an example of a security hotspot on sonar cloud unlike vulnerabilities security hotspots require a code review to determine if security sensitive apis are being used properly and a code change may not necessarily resolve this issue when sonar cloud creates a security hotspot it will prioritize and assign it to the developer that wrote the code the developer can use the built-in interface to perform a code review and if the code is safe or a compensating fix has been made the developer can mark it as such and close out the item the interface gives full reference as to the nature of the issue so the user can use this documentation to determine whether or not their code is at risk what's the problem here how to evaluate their own code and if there is an issue what they can do to resolve it also if you're using sonar cube you can open these security hotspots directly in your ide when you're using sonarlint in this example sonarkeep has found a code smell where the developer has placed some includes after some code in the file while this may not break your code or make it vulnerable it makes it more difficult to maintain if it's allowed to be merged sonar source uses rules like this to help in ford misra c plus guidelines and c plus standards from c plus plus 98 to c plus plus 20. again all of these reference all these standards are referenced in the documentation contained with every rule the goal here is to prevent developers from adding new technical debt to their code base sonar cloud and sonarcube commercial editions can be used to analyze branches and pull the requests so developers can focus only on the new issues that have been introduced as part of this branch's development every time sonar cloud analyzes a project it calculates a quality gate that gives a simple pass fail indicator on whether or not this new code meets the standards expected by your organization these quality gates are fully customizable as well as the rules that are being applied to your code if you're analyzing a pull or merge request on github bitbucket gitlab or azure devops you can add the scan results directly to your pull requests so you can consider them your decision on whether or not this code should be merged you can use the qualitygate status to break builds or block merges if you choose to do so in this example the sonar cloud quality gate has failed due to a new vulnerability and too much technical debt being added to the branch being merged the qualitygate status will automatically update with subsequent scans so someone doing this code review will have the latest up-to-date information okay i'm going to switch over to sonarlint in visual studio the final tool i want to show you is sonarlint an ide plugin that brings sonar source analysis to developers desktops so they can find and fix issues as soon as they create them here's sono lint running in visual studio it's also available for sea lion and eclipse issues detected by sunderland are highlighted and developers can quickly navigate to all the issues in their solution also access to rules documentation is available via clicked and will open up in a web browser right from the error list if i introduce a new issue is this unused variable will immediately detect a new issue upon save so the developers get instantly feedback as they create issues certainly can also be connected to sonarcube or cloud to synchronize rule sets and receive notifications when new issues are detected from a server-based analysis this ensures that developers receive consistent feedback within their ide and from sonarcube or sonar cloud using all of these tools you can add code quality and security into every step of your development life cycle adoption of sonar lint and sonar cloud or sonar cube helps you shift left to adjust issues shortly after developers create them it all starts on the developers workstation where they're writing code using sonar lint in a supported ide gives developers the opportunity to fix issues even before they commit the code as developers commit code or issue pull requests they will trigger ci processes to execute sonar source analysis in line with automated builds in unit tests the scanning results are posted to sonar cube or sonar cloud from which users can gather reporting with the web ui or use our rest-based web apis to enable custom automations and integrations and finally to close the loop notifications are sent back to developers letting them know that they have issues they need to address these notifications are delivered via email in ide using sonarlink connected mode and or via those pull requests on github bitbucket azure devops or gitlab if you're looking to add these tools to your development process sonar cloud is free to use for open source projects you can register at sonarcloud.io and find walkthroughs to help you start scanning your code quickly if you prefer an on-premise deployment you can find more information about sonarcube at sonarcube.org note that c plus plus scanning with sonarcube requires one of our commercial licenses starter lint for c plus is available via the marketplaces for eclipse sea lion and visual studio and free to use in visual studio and sea lion and if you'd like to learn more about sonar source's capabilities for c plus plus visit sunresource.com cpp thank you for your time today if you have any questions some developers from our product team and myself will be available during the tool fair
