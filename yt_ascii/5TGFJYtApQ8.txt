does anybody else like the smell of books i'm not sure if that's super weird but for as long as i can remember i've always loved it maybe almost as much as i liked reading books [music] and i do love reading as a filmmaker it can be tempting to think that the best way to get better is by just studying other movies and while there is a ton of value in that good old-fashioned books can be some of the best resources out there i read all sorts of books both fiction and non-fiction but in this video i'm talking about six of my favorite non-fiction books that have helped me break through major filmmaking career struggles over the years i'm not going to put these books in any particular order but the last one is the one i've read more than any of the others so if you're going to start somewhere maybe that's the one so let's not waste any time and get into it [music] hey guys welcome back and if you're new here my name is luke forsyth and on this channel i teach the skills i've learned over 10 years working as a documentary filmmaker and photographer have you ever heard of a japanese word called sundoku i'm sure i'm not pronouncing it right but as i understand it it means the habit of buying and collecting books you might not ever read just to be reminded of all the things you don't know i'm not sure about you but i personally love this and it makes me feel better about my book buying habits i'll spend way more time than i'd like to admit just staring at my bookshelf thinking about books i've loved for different reasons and ones i might read someday but also maybe not i absolutely hate getting rid of books which isn't great for someone who moves as much as i do i mean for reference i've only been back in canada for three years and i moved here with no books at all and since then i filled an entire bookcase so it's a pretty serious habit for me some people might call it hoarding but i like the japanese word better they're my go-to's for creative career motivation and all of them have helped me get through rough spots on multiple occasions and if you can't tell from the change in the studio background for the last few videos i'm in the middle of a big move and so i don't actually have all the physical books with me at the moment but they'll all have permanent real estate on my shelf whenever i actually have a place of my own and can get my stuff together again one day first up is the obstacle is the way by ryan holiday and i'm putting it first because it perfectly sums up so many stages of the filmmaking experience this is one of the books i don't actually have with me right now but i'll flash the cover art somewhere up here this book was really popular when it came out and it still is everyone from elite athletes to comedians have talked about this book and holidays all over the podcasting world talking about his modern version of stoicism so you might have heard of them as the title suggests the main point of this book is that the hardest things you're presented with in life are actually showing you where you should be go going not what you should be running from as filmmakers this is extremely relevant are you scared of starting your first film or maybe diving into 20 hours of footage for an edit submitting to a film festival the obstacle is the way whatever you're most scared to start is probably exactly where you'll get the biggest rewards so take a good look at yourself and find the obstacle in your filmmaking career and then go at it hard the book is short and very easy to read so it's not much of an obstacle itself which is nice or is that a bad thing i don't know either way highly recommended next up is mastery by robert greene which i also don't have right now but i swear i do actually own these books i want you to stop lying to yourself green is famous for his crazy research and some of his books are even banned in prisons for being too good at helping people consolidate power and actually i think ryan holiday used to work for him before he started writing his own books mastery is all about how people well become masters actually the first time i went through it i listened to this book while i was driving across tibet a few years ago and the audio version was great do you guys like audiobooks as much as paper books i can't decide let me know in the comments i actually liked listening to this book so much i bought a paper copy as well so i could look at it and remember all the lessons this is an extremely detailed book but basically the process of mastering something can be distilled into a three-step process apprenticeship the creating phase and then finally mastery the book is full of examples from history from people like darwin and mozart and henry ford and a bunch more and if it worked for those guys the same process can also work for you on the road to mastery and filmmaking or photography or really anything each phase has multiple steps like how to find your calling the role of mentors the importance of social skills and many more it's a dense book backed by a lot of research but if you want to be more than good at what you do this is an amazing read the next book i actually do have with me and it's been a staple in the writing world for a long time and for good reason it's called bird by bird and it was written by anne lamott who's a multiple time published author teacher and overall cool lady it's technically about writing but it really applies to anything creative the subtitle is some instructions on writing and life and that should tell you a lot it's part autobiographical part advice driven it's really a story about life in the arts it's funny sometimes really funny and it's full of wisdom and humanity and the reason why this book is so popular is that it shows that all creative people deal with the same struggles with some routine and time in the game we can create amazing things and lamotte is a great writer and it reads almost like a novel while giving out timeless advice let me just read you a quick quote off the back so you get a sense of it 30 years ago my older brother who was 10 years old at the time was trying to get a report on birds written that he'd had three months to write which was due the next day we are at our family cabin in bolinas and he was at the kitchen table close to tears surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead then my father sat down beside him put his arm around my brother's shoulder and said bird by bird buddy just take it bird by bird if that's not relevant to building a career in the competitive and sometimes tough world of filmmaking i don't know what it is i personally love this book and i've read it i think three times times now every few years or so whenever i need a little reminder of why i do what i do in this edition just really smells great it's sort of the right kind of musty if you're into that kind of thing or maybe that's just me i don't know now let's talk about the revision process a little bit and my personal favorite is draft number four by john mcphee it's not a technical guide on how to edit it's a personal narrative about the experiences of one of the all-time great non-fiction writers that most people have never heard of and he really is one of the great storytellers alive when it comes to real life stories he's written entire books on topics you never think you wanted to know about but within a few pages you're totally hooked he's got a whole book on oranges and another one that's only about a single tennis game from global logistics to geology john mcphee makes anything interesting which is why i guess he's always appearing the new yorker this book is another one about writing but it's really about the revision process and storytelling more broadly it's not a writing manual it's a first-hand account of how he revises and like bird by bird it's also funny and really entertaining and even though it is about writing it's very relevant to editing film in terms of the approach just like editing is the art of chipping away more and more this book is all about taking away things until only the best is left it's super short very fun and a great look at how one of the great writers of all time reworks and stuff deals with editors and thrives in the arts okay we're getting close to the end but i've got a couple more left i've gone into philosophy life and editing aspects of the creative process but all of that work doesn't count for anything if no one sees it the next book is all about how to get over your fear of presenting your work which we all struggle with and that's share your work by austin cleon this is one i read as an e-book but i definitely recommend getting the physical book because the illustrations are really good klingon is pretty well known in the creative world for his book steel like an artist and this one is i think the companion book to it and i'd argue it might even be the more important one when it comes to filmmaking if you want to succeed people need to know what you do for them to know what you do you need to share your work which is hard because it's scary embarrassing and opens you up to criticism but if you don't share you're not going to get very far and this book is a great reminder why and more importantly how sharing which in filmmaking basically means publishing online these days is also great for networking which almost no one likes but having others see your work spontaneously and then come to you is the best possible networking so if you have any projects sitting on your hard drive this book can help you find the motivation to just swallow the fear and share them nothing bad will happen and you have everything to gain lastly is my personal favorite and maybe you've heard to this one before you're only going to get one book on this list i'd probably make it this one and that's the war of art by stephen pressfield this book is super popular and for good reason it's a play on sun tzu's the art of war and it's written in a similar format of tiny bite-sized chunks filled with good stuff that can be a game changer when you're struggling with creative obstacles the writer stephen pressfield was struggling for most of his career and i don't think he made it big until he was in his 40s or maybe even his 50s i can't remember so he knows a thing or two about working hard but not seeing much in the way of results the real genius of this book is that he identifies the forces working against us when it comes to creating and gives them a single name resistance whenever there's something holding us back it's resistance and you need to conquer it can't get started resistance hurt by an ignored email resistance think your gear isn't good enough resistance once you start naming something it's like mindfulness meditation and when you feel something holding you back you can be aware of what's happening and then tell that voice to shut up like when i don't want to make a youtube video when i've had a busy week which probably happens about once a month or so i just say resistance to myself and then get on with the work and in the end once i get started i realize that i actually like making videos and what was really hard was just starting which of course is just resistance it's a seriously groundbreaking philosophy and of all of the books on this list i've come back to this one the most i've probably read it about four times all the way through now and a bunch more times if you count all the times i've just read random sections when i'm struggling for motivation and that's part of why this is such a great little book you don't have to read it cover to cover just open it to a random page and you're guaranteed to find something that helps so that's it six non-fiction books that i love that have helped me most when filmmaking is hard i go through at least a couple books a month both fiction and nonfiction and i really believe reading is one of the most important things filmmakers can do because at the end of the day storytelling is storytelling no matter what medium you're doing it in and books are one of the oldest ways that humans have of sharing stories and if you like hearing about the books i'm reading i always make sure to include a few examples of what i'm reading in my monthly newsletter which also has gear tips career advice subscriber q a travel stories and a bunch more so if you want to get the next edition it's totally free and there's a link in the description thanks for watching hope you found it helpful and happy book hoarding see ya [music] foreign
