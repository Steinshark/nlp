[music] today we've got a phone that's a little bit crazy it's called the new moon s50 pro and the company has said feel free to drop it put it in a freezer or even run over it with a car so that's what we're gonna do all right before we start destroying stuff let's take a quick look around the phone on the front you've got a 5.7 4-inch display on a phone powered by android 8.1 the phone is massive and it weighs a well above average 300 grams but this heft gives it three significant advantages number one it contains a five thousand milliamp hour battery which is a good 25 to 30% more than most flagships the s50 pro has pretty ridiculous durability as you're about to see and the third thing is that whilst most of those flagship phones have ip 67 or ip 68 resistance this phone has ip 69 what this means is that it can withstand not just immersion in water but also uncomfortably high temperatures as well as high pressure jets aside from that you've got a 13 megapixel camera with a fingerprint scanner just below it and the last thing really is the design language this is a bulky phone but the company hasn't tried to hide away from that it's embraced the heft of the device and tried to create something that feels like a tool as well as a smart phone okay so we're gonna do a bit of cooking because apparently one of the things this phone can survived is being cooked with your breakfast now i've got no idea in what world this actually happens but we're going to try and fry it with an egg and if it somehow manages to survive that we're gonna have to up the ante so we're just gonna make a standard fried egg here nothing fancy but this pan as we go through the process of cooking the egg is gonna reach a temperature of over 200 degrees celsius with most phones this could be a real problem regardless whichever phone you have please don't try this at home plastics can start melting fumes can be released not to mention batteries can start exploding so the eggs completely cooked now so i guess it was just time to see whether the phone was and i suppose because of that ip 69 water resistance you can literally to stick it under a tap and not really worry about it what i did do which felt pretty wrong at the time was cover it in cleaning fluid and scrub it and the phone was completely fine in fact if nothing else it's just cleaner than it was before so now for a slightly more conventional test for a way that people genuinely do break their smartphones i decided to put it in a washing machine i've known people who only too late realized they'd left their phone in their jean pocket and at that point it was game over i found the phone at the bottom of the pile and it was covered in soap and water felt like a bit of a greasy mess but the screen still worked absolutely fine i didn't even have to wipe the liquid off but of course if i did want to do that you just turn on the tap and yeah problem solved okay so i started off the durability test by holding all the phone at about a height of 1.2 meters and dropping onto a concrete surface and everything works the screen was completely intact the only damage being in the bottom corner where the impact was and even then it's not too major so then it was time to step it up a little bit [music] yes so we then run over the phone with a car and this car was about twelve hundred kilos so about 1.2 tonnes in terms of weight initially i actually thought the screen was cracked because of this but actually it turns out the car had just compressed the bits of dirt that were already trapped underneath the screen protector and this had caused the screen protector to break so when we took that off the screen underneath was unmarked so for the sake of making sure that it's totally car proof we decided to do it again with the unprotected screen facing upwards and at this point i'm like ok this is impressive the phone has - surface damage on the front and the back but it's pretty much still unmarked the phone has managed to handle a lot of pressure here not to mention being pushed directly into hard irregular gravel but i wanted to test the limits here so a bit of help we started throwing it and to start with throwing it along the ground about 10 meters it was again completely fine you'll start to notice a few dents in the corners where the impact was but in a sense this is protecting the main body of the phone we then threw it into a tree and let it drop which equated to about 3 meters of distance between that and the ground and again we must have thrown it 20 meters forward into a hard concrete surface but the main damage here was literally just that these sintra had come out scuffed up obviously but it's still breathing impressive so that was the nomu s 50 pro and just from the way it looks alone i was expecting durability but not to this extent i will leave a link in the description below so feel free to check that out and as always thank you so much for watching my name is erin this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
