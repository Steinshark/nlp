[music] the creator is one of the most visually engaging films i've seen in a long time the locations the costume design and of course the visual effects in this video i'm going to be attempting to replicate the robot head effect of the simulants from the [music] film so that was my little test scene for the effect and for the rest of this video i'm going to be breaking down how i achieved it using blender and nuke as you can tell from all the layers in these breakdowns a big part of achieving that negative space look of the head is building the background up from back to front so in all three of these shots i started off by using a clean plate of the back wall and then from there i work my way forward building up things like the inside of my clothing then placing the cg objects on top of that and then roring all the foreground parts like the collar of my jacket on top so that's a simple ified rundown of all the steps involved in this process now let's go through step by step and look at how it was done also be sure to stick around for the rest of the video so you can find out how to win this tourbox light it's an amazing little macro keyboard with loads of tactile buttons and dials which are perfect for 3d artists and digital creators i started by creating a mood board with a load of screenshots from the films and some of the behind the scenes this was super helpful to give me a direction when i was modeling all of the pieces i'm not particularly good at 3d modeling so it really helps me to have something to look at to kind of copy what but i did didn't end up being exactly the same as the films i did kind of my own thing but it's in the same sort of world i suppose once the model was finished everything needed texturing and then for the cut out of my head i did a proper 3d scan of my head and then used that mesh as a hold out which you'll see later in the compositing stage so i brought in the head scan and then cut out all of the negative space like around the jaw and the neck and as well as using this as a hold out because it's exactly the shape of my head it also really helped to see when the object track was working when it wasn't because ideally it should line up perfectly with my head as it's a model of my actual head and then after that we get on to the fun stuff so to start off with once the model was finished i obviously bought in each of the shots into blender and then the first thing to do was an object track for each so i b in the exr sequence and i used all the tracking points that i put on my face to track i'm not going to do a deep dive on object tracking but essentially my process was just go into the track tab add an object track so it starts off with the camera you can just add a new object which i called head you need to have a minimum of eight tracks that exist throughout the entire shot and then once you have that blender can do the reconstruction of the geometry and actually do the head track so you go into the so tab under the solve menu i turned on key frame and then i press solve object motion as you can see my object solve is 0.53 which is pretty good for an object track and then from here what i do is i go into the 3d viewport i add a camera and i lined it up in 3d space while i was shooting i took down notes of the focal length and how far the camera was from my face so that i had a good idea of where to place the camera in blender so for example for shot two i know that i shot this on a 50 mm lens so the camera is set to 50 mm and the camera is also placed pretty much ex exactly a meter away from the face of the object once that's done i add a camera solver constraint onto the camera and then if i turn on motion tracking this will actually allow me to visualize where the points are in 3d space so i used these to make sure that the head was perfectly aligned and then i usually turn them back off just cuz they're a bit distracting and then once that's in the correct position i went on the object that everything was parented to and i added an object solver constraint which actually applies the object tracking data onto the head this strange bit of goo here that looks like a bowl is actually some temporary geo that's casting some shadows like my clothes so it's kind of there to mimic my collar it's in its own collection and it's set to indirect only and what that means is it won't show up in the render but it will cast shadows and be reflected in all the materials so if i turn it off you can see all the bits of the cg that are meant to be inside of my clothes and should therefore be uded from a lot of the light are still lit up so this bit of geo is just mimicking that occlusion so that there's some nice shadows and it looks like they're actually disappearing inside of my clothing you can see that there's a holdout setup so the 3d scan of my head is being used as a hold out if i turn this off you can see it's actually here and it looks pretty horrifying with the textures on it but when this collection is set to a hold out it means that the 3d geometry of the head will actually cut out all of the stuff behind it and there will be transparency here which will help for compositing this and overlaying it later so that's pretty much the whole setup in blender i rendered this with an hdri that i actually took in the living room so as you can see if i turn off the transparent background the hdri is the same as the environment that it was shot in i had a massive reflector here with a light behind it which is like a very big soft box and then there's also an led tube in the background here which is giving me a bit of an edge light rendering wise i'll show the setup in the compon compositor there's four different render pares for each of the shots so we start off with the beauty which is just a straightforward render of the head which looks like this then from that same render pass i also rendered crypto object passes and a depth pass the third pass is a face mat and it just looks like this it's just the head scan on its own the uvs are all messed up for some reason i think i must have broken something but i'm not actually using the rgb channels of this if i look at it in nuke what i'm doing is just shuffling out the alpha and i'm just using this which assists me with some of the roto and i'm utilizing that here when i'm restoring my face over thep top of the clean plate and then lastly i did a hair detail pass it's actually very difficult to see it in blender cuz it's so fine if i zoom all the way in you can see there's all of these individual hairs that just go along the edge of my chin and around the top of the ears and they're just rendered out on a transparent background and then again i'm using them in nuke just to blend the cg and the live action face a little bit better so that's everything in blender i rendered out those four passes and then it was just time to composite everything but hold that thought for just a second while i talk about this the tourbox if you've watched lots of my videos you might remember a couple of years ago t box were kind enough to send me their neo model which is this one and it's been on my desk ever since i used it loads on this project as well as all my youtube videos essentially to box have also just released a new model which is called the torbox light and it's this one obviously i already have a tor boox on my desk so i don't need two i would need an extra pair of hands for that so i'm going to be giving this away to somebody that watches this video if you'd like to be in for a chance of winning it all you have to do is make sure you're subscribed like this video and then leave a comment below and then in a week or so's time i'll pick a random winner from the comments and i'll ship this to you so to demonstrate how i used it on this project i've got the blender seene with the head model open here the main thing i use the toolbox for which saves me loads of time is switching between all the different workspaces in blender so for example normally if you want to go between them you have to come up here and then go to the shader editor or whatever and i don't really like diving through menus so the alternative is you can do things like pressing shift f3 but you have to press it multiple times to get to say the compositor or the shader editor so instead what i've done is i've assigned a lot of these buttons around the edges to the workspaces so for example if i wanted to open the compositor or the shader editor to tweak something i just split the window half and then i can go to the shader editor or i can press it again to get to the compositor and i can just cycle through those really easily if i want to go to the uv or the image editor i just press this top one here and as you can see it's switching between those the button on the side is the movie clip editor so i can come in here and load in some footage if i'm going to do some object tracking or anything and then this left hand button takes me back to the 3d view port so as you can see i can jump between all those different workspaces super easily another thing i use it a lot for is navigating the timeline so this scroll dial here allows me to go backwards and forwards on the timeline then i can also use the d-pad to step through individual frames and the up and down arrow keys are the same as the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard so they allow me to jump backwards and forwards between key frames this middle dial here i have set up for changing brush sizes so if i jump into sculpt mode and use this i can change the size of my brush and then these two thumb buttons i have assigned to control and shift which i use more a nuke for when i'm doing clone painting and things so now let's have a look at a time lapse of how much i use this while 3d [music] modeling [music] [applause] okay back to the video so back in nuke like i said i start off with the first plate which is just a shot with me in it to remove the markers i used a variety of techniques depending on where they were in the face as some of them were quite difficult to track to do all the ones that disappear i just did a very traditional technique of tracking them and drawing a mat around them and then using a transform mask node just to remove each of those by taking taking some of the pixels next to them and just transforming them over the top and then for these ones on the side of my face i used a slightly different technique because i've already done the object track and blender by this point i have a 3d track of my head and because these markers are always visible throughout the entire shot i decided it would be easier just to use the 3d track of the head and project an alpha for all of the markers so to do that what i did is i drew rotor shapes for each of the markers you can see that here i did it on this frame and then from here i project them onto the geometry of my face that might seem like a slightly long- winded way of doing it but it's actually much quicker than individually tracking each of them so once i've got the alpha for these what i did is i used a node called pxf filler this is a third party gizm mode that you can download for free i don't use this very often to remove markers but in this case it just worked quite well what it does is it just takes the colors from around the edge of the mat that you feed it and just drags them inwards so as you can see here that just fills the markers in with some skin color at a glance you might think that that's done but if i actually look at the areas where the markers have disappeared you can see that they lose all the skin detail and they become really blurred so what i'm then doing on top of this is i'm restoring the skin detail by using the frequency separation technique that i showed in one of my previous videos so what's going on here is i am taking the footage and i'm then blurring it by 5.2 pixels and minusing the original footage from this which gives you just the high frequency skin detail and then i'm using the mat of the markers which comes from the head track again and i'm then using a transform mask node to take some skin detail from the areas around them and put it on top of where the markers are then if i plus this back on top of the footage that's now restoring just the high frequency detail without affecting any of the color underneath it and so it restores all of the detail like the fine hairs on my face and the paws over the top of the tracking markers that have been filled in and then lastly down here i'm just rotating the glasses back on top cuz again there's a couple of bits where they got filled in slightly from that process so that was quite a lot of talking actually but that's how i removed all the tracking markers after that like i showed in the beginning we now put the clean plate back on top so i've got this clean plate of the back wall and i'm using a key mix just to merge that over the top of the footage and then i'm using some masks over here to define where the clean plate actually goes so the first mask is just a big soft mat that basically puts it over my entire head which looks like this then i've got a second mask which is here which is putting the bit of my face that should be there back on top so it's still cutting out all of the neck and the side of the head but it's restoring my face and my hair and everything on top of the clean plate and then lastly i'm using the head mat which i rended out of blender to actually restore my face as well so this mat gives me that nice outline for the jaw and then i can go in later and key bits of the hair to put back on top so that my chin isn't this perfect cutout and i also used the cg hair which i blended on the edges here which you'll see in a bit after this the collar goes back on top this is essentially rebuilding the inside of my jacket as you can see the way i did this is after i finished filming each of the shots i got up and took my jacket off and just filmed myself rotating it around in front of the lights so then later i could take a frame of this do a little bit of color correction to it so i make it a bit darker and i did a roto shape in the middle and darkened that as well and then cut out just a bit that i wanted and then i did a 2.2d track and just tracked this into the shot so all of that together looks like this next up the cg goes on top so if i turn off all of the stuff that i did to tweak it you can see what it looks like in the first place so this is the render straight out of blender with no compositing stuff done to it and i'm just overlaying it on top the first thing i did is just set the black point as it was a little bit too dark and then here as you can see i've got a few different crypt mats that i'm just using to tweak some of the colors and i've also got an exposure node which is just lifting the exposure slightly so that's the exposure this is grading the ears to be slightly brighter it's all pretty subtle i think i'm lifting the gam up slightly as well cuzz they felt a bit too punchy this one is making the spine a little bit darker and making the bottom of the pistons a bit darker as well they felt a bit too lit up considering they're meant to be inside of my jacket and then lastly for some reason this screw was really nuclear so i just used the crypt tomat to turn that right down so it doesn't stick out then down here i'm putting the cg hair back on top at the moment it's just around the ear and then i put this stuff back on later so you can see that's just blending that outline into the hair a little bit nicer so it doesn't feel like it's a perfect cutout then there's a slight zedd focus going on i'm using the new boken node and nuke which i really love i'm using this to set where the focus should be on the cg it's really subtle but it just means that the whole thing doesn't feel perfectly sharp then i've got like an overall general defocus on it this is really low it's just set to 0.09 this just means that even the bits that are in focus are just being softened ever so slightly so they match the sharpness of the alive action plate the next thing i did which i found worked quite well for blending the cg into my face is i created a kind of fake 2d contact shadow and that looks like this so i'm just taking the alpha of the cg and eroding it outward slightly and blurring it and then i'm using that face mat that was rended out of blender just as a mask so that it only appears inside of the face mat and then this is plugged into a color correct and i'm using that just as an alpha just to grade down the side of the face then obviously cg goes back on top and then here this is where i'm putting the extra cg hair onto the chin like i showed earlier it looks like this or this is what the render pass looks like straight out of blender i graded this to be quite a lot darker and have some more contrast as you can see and then i isolated the side of the face and the chin on its own and put this down here it's most noticeable along the edge here and then on this bit where the skin transitions to that metal jawbone in the 3d model is probably the part of the effect that i'm happiest with actually i think the hair blends really well with my real hair then the last thing like i showed earlier is the rotor that goes back on top i tracked and stabilized a few different bits of the shot so for example to roto my torso i did a onepoint track on the t-shirt here and just corrected them where needed and as i'm moving obviously my t-shirt is moving when i lean forward so it needed a bit of animating then the same thing for the collar here again i did a two-point track and stab ized it and then just drew some roto around the collar and then lastly this bit here is the roto for the front of my neck so that's this rotor shape here i did the same frequency separation technique as earlier this just allowed me to see where the paws were moving and it gave me slightly better reference when i was moving the rotor shape as to how much i should move it per frame so i combine all of that roto which looks like this and then it gets copied and pre molted with the plate and put back on top of everything and that's the final result again all of the assets from this
