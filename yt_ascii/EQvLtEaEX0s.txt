this is big the sharmini nine has just been announced today in china and it is loaded with exciting features plus a price tag that will probably make other 2019 flagships quiver oh yeah and the phone is also being released alongside what i think is a record-breaking 20 watt wireless charger which charges this phone faster then many smart phones charge when they're physically plugged in let's get into it xiaomi zni 9 is built like something out of a sci-fi movie minimal seams and ports so no headphone jack or microsd card slot and a super glossy back the front is fitted with the latest gorilla glass 6 and the entire back glass is curved unlike past variants where only the edges were curved and so it slides effortlessly into your palm but just be careful that it can also slide out just as easily if we compare to hallways made 20 pro the curves are gentler here because the sides are completely flush with the back and what i was impressed by is that xiaomi have managed to do this whilst creating a firm that doesn't really wobble on a table and to top it off there's a google assistant button but you can configure to a certain extent to be honest color wise i'd say black is the least exciting version there's a blue and a purple variant which have this holographic layer to disperse the light and an ultimate transparent edition which we're going to come back to so the way it's built gives a really positive first impression and this extends to the software the slickest new ui experience i've ever tried animations fly and is filled with subtle visual flourishes like the blurring of the background when you pull down your notification bar the animation of icons when you exit applications not to mention being able to hold down after unlocking to quickly access other shortcuts i imagine that by the time this year is up the teardrop not on the front of this phone is going to look a little dated but at least the phone has a six point three nine inch amoled display which is good but colors do get a little funny at extreme angles plus points for a second generation in display fingerprint scanner boo so for the main event i was cautiously optimistic about the camera this is xiaomi's first foray into the triple camera market and for the most part it seems like it was worth the way at the top there's a 12 megapixel telephoto lens which lets you zoom in two times below that the primary 48 megapixel sensor and at the bottom a 16 megapixel super wide angle camera and weirdly enough the flush module is actually behind the glass on the back of the phone the company has added this halo around the top camera doesn't really do anything but what is cool is that the camera portion is coated with sapphire glass which stops it scratching when it's inevitably scraped along a table because let's face it it does kind of stick out standard photos come out at 12 megapixel which is the mode i'd recommend you keep it in hdr looks good and colors are balanced but in good lighting you can take full 48 megapixel shots they're a little noisy if you zoom all the way in probably a sensor limitation but nonetheless more detail to them the standard 12 megapixel shots there's a night mode too leaps and bounds ahead of just taking a normal photo in the dark it doesn't take much motion to cause the picture to blur though and the detail isn't quite what we seen on the pixel 3 but the colors are really nice and contrast on point so you might know that i've really grown to love the ultra wide lens on the mate 20 pro and so it's kind of relief that i can carry that on over here the quality isn't as good as shots taken on the main lens but close enough that changing lens doesn't feel disjointed and the flip side of having an ultra wide is that you can also get much closer to subjects it actually doubles as a macro camera pretty cool so overall it's just an all-round really solid setup there isn't any optical image stabilization but the electronic is okay and it can shoot 4k video at 60 frames per second even the front camera is improved this is a 20 megapixel sensor and in broad daylight hdr is amazing and when the light starts to dip detail is still retained surprisingly well with the snapdragon 805 and 6 gigabytes of ram the me 9 is one of the most powerful phones in the world this chip is a beast and its effects extend far beyond just having a responsive ui wi-fi speeds are awesome app load times are fast and you often still have a spare 20% of unused headroom even when you're playing top-tier games now that transparent edition we talked about doubles the ram to 12 gigabytes and comes with 256 gigs of storage compared to 64 or 128 on the others and yeah 12 gigabytes pretty overkill but that's an argument for another day because this design is epic it feels like a real second-generation product like a slicker more powerful version of last year's transparent in e8 pro i mentioned that the phone also supports superfast wireless charging and well we've seen similar improvements to the wired apartment the me9 comes with a 27 watt charger which can fully charge the phone in a fraction over an hour faster than one plus - charging but not quite as fast as their new walk charge 30 the phone kind of needs this charging speed advantage because it's 3300 milliamp our capacity is definitely on the lower end but bear in mind the latest android 9 and efficient 7 nanometer chip and a 1080p oled display all contribute to pretty good efficiency here the exact price is going to be announced roughly when this video drops so i'll leave that as a comment below but my opinions here are based on the expected price of about 500 to 600 pounds in the uk which is a fair bit cheaper than the likes of huawei and samsung if you enjoy the video a sub would be massively appreciated and as always my name is aron and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
