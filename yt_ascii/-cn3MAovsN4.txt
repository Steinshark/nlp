overcoming vim phobia when i learned vim i actually had vim fomo i had such phobia or fomo of missing out on vim and mine was right around 2012 when i started learning vim anyways heha here we go i've been coding for almost a decade now and for anyone who spends two-thirds of his day doing doing so his tool chains matters let's go for a walk down memory lane this article is going to be different disclaimer today's content is going to be subjective okay i like i like subjective content i was dabbling in notepad plus+ i actually did try to notepad++ for well over 10 minutes and then realized ain't no way i'm going to be using notepad++ to learn java development as a young clueless potato in my school they forced us to use blue jay blue jay to learn java at that moment i didn't even understand what an editor was to me it seemed like notepad with extra buttons yep fair okay this is completely fair the focus was on learning program not dx developer experience the only intriguing thing i was that i could run code using a plugin by pressing one of the function keys it it gave me a big advantage over writing and notepad and running windows command prompt absolutely did someone just say they make their living using notepad++ i made a living with notepad plus+ for almost two years that is insane you are crazy you are crazy key points it's good to have a place to write and execute code together okay fair two years later eclipse oh oh oh the the poor man why would you want to do this i could decently code in a couple languages now one of one of the books i was reading recom the next shiny thing eclipse eclipse had hit quite the right spot for the first time the tool chain was becoming addictive the joy of coding building and running those java swing apps without diving into the build and execution system was simply m yeah i do agree there was something very beautiful about having everything just build with net beans the superior java experience net beans okay net beans the internet was not big so i often would go through offline docs and figure out figure my way out out i got let's see it got tedious at times but there wasn't another way out for the first time i wondered oh why this software didn't behave like the previous one no i didn't know the word ide yet i only knew that java runs on three billion devices it had to be good and i had to be good at it this is a fair take hate is a strong word i hate java also fair type one in the chat if you have never programmed java and you hate java wow all right all right all right all right key points it's better if your software can handle the configuration work for you it's even better if the software if your software can tell you what to write next fair meeting linux in vi linux i also run a pizza a piece of bread from last week wait run i also run on a piece of bread from last week fair windows your cpu is not of the latest generation please click here to find out more information this is pretty good this is pretty good pretty good meme right there i got this new blue laptop the sticker says ubuntu it do you guys say ubuntu or ubuntu i like to say uu see me personally i'm kind of on a i'm kind of on a different train a little bit i don't know if you guys know this but i'm more of the i'm more of a fan of the o1 two o o anyways i'm not sure where that was going let's see let's see what the heck is this thing where is my dvd with pirated windows an activation key written on the back of it i went to school library and boy that book on unix gave me tremors of joy i decided to shift to linux perman i never and i've never touched windows ever since based based based based based same here same thing happened here it's pronounced as arch it's arch i couldn't understand why weirdos on the internet always suggested editing random config files using something called vi who on god's green earth would open up the terminal navigate to a file enter into this creepy vi thing where one can't even quit this was literally my mentality 2010 this was my mental 2010 i kid you not i use vim full time now this was my mentality completely isn't it funny how that works sadly it was part of the college curriculum and i had to write in it the good thing is is that after you press i vi becomes normal i hated it so bad that i wrote a g at a config so my professor thought i was coding in the terminal what a great professor let's go professor let's go great professor something about writing a g config edit or g config just to do that also great teaching you to get around it i can appreciate that key points never push for a product sl outcome you may push for an idea and see if people resonate with it every developer should use linux no exceptions personal take i also consider mac os a linux drro i'm just waiting for chat i'm just waiting for chad chat is in shambles what the hell is this oh man all right right sublime art of coding oh if you hit let's see hits s twice sublime text i'm once again asking you for forel you know what the best part about this this meme is is that it actually puts programmer humor right here and you know for a fact that programmer humor steals and does not ever give the original source credit ever shy ryan can tell you all about it guy you want to tell you want to you want to tell them all about it there's a picture of me on on programmer humor and they don't even know who i am now things were taken shape i have decided my career path as a web developer i often build small utility apps again the book was i was referring to told me that sublime is the next shiny thing oh hoy i was on bo board there's something about it that feels close to my heart it was json configuration i spent the whole week tweaking things in the settings file it was near magical experience of to copy a jon file on a usb drive and make my friend's machine like mine lowkey dot files fair fair i mean i like that experience it's a good experience it's a good experience that you can have what you want and you can save it to a usb and just make something else yours i mean we call get now these days but i guess you could say it also at that point my sublime started to look like a different application to regular sublime users to this day i am a hardcore ricing fan a fancy term for customizing your software and yes i'm immune to that popup asking me to buy sublime just like good old winrar there was somebody in twitch chat whose name was i actually bought winrar it was it was one of the best it was one of the best ones ever all right the rise of vs code when people ask me to recommend a text editor visual studio code absolutely everyone got on board on this i spent about i spent about probably three to six months trying to make visual studio code work for me key points missed oh i missed the the key points okay okay sublime was fast for that kind for for the kind of things it can do absolutely it's still really fast if sublime was one of the best editors ever for opening up large files it was really good the only reason it failed was due to vs code similar pitch corporate backing and excellent community support developers moved to vss code and no and no one develops tooling around software they personally don't use vim is nowhere close to sublime's power the almighty gue but the community stuck to it and it became awesome over time i i mean i don't know about that last sentence but whatever key point number two maybe i disagree with prime and shambles i'm in shambles let's see i felt like i was getting a getting ancient and even started working professionally sublime text was like the back of my hand now every key binding and config option lived in my mind not to mention the plethora of extensions well customized for my work flow flow at that point losing my sublime config folder was more of a worry than the laptop itself just kidding i knew i knew get by then and yet and yet mr never use windows again still calling them folders absolutely shame just a shame to see just a shame to see that's actually my my favorite linux neck beard shaming is actually it's directory windows are folders okay the office was asking to work in vs code so again there was no option spent a month tweaking it in the end i wondered what a frankenstein's monster i had made it looked like sublime it responded like sublime married to vs code and started heavy like my old friend's eclipse the worst part was that the senior guy scolded me every time he tried debugging on my machine using hacker problems no big deal usual hacker problems no big deal oh my goodness one thing i fell in love about vs code was is its zero config extension ecosystem and it overall felt smart under the hood while coding i could feel that it had something that sublime lacked to this day vs code has been my favorite coding software if something can be coded it will eventually be in vss code i feel like i i feel it is the modern version of emac what emac is an operating system okay what what is he talking about i felt the difference between strict and dynamic type languages firsthand i worked on ruby on rails those days and dynamically typed languages are a nightmare for any editor don't tell dhh sh shoot me but i hate ruby sh stop it dhh could hear us at any moment python javascript etc even though i coded them daily for one reason maybe for that one reason i knock on the doors of jet brains from time to time fair key points vs code had a vision of being an omnipresent editor and the community made it made it happen i know the community the really the community has the biggest bamboozling that's the best part is that microsoft got the community to do so much heavy lifting for them its core is rigid and well thought out on top of which people make what they want it's a ble let's see its blessings proves to be its curse since anybody can easily write anything people write them without much thought and later blame vs code for being slow well i mean it's also written in javascript so there's only so much it can do you know to be fair javascript is like single execution it's not like you can it's not like it can just magically become multi-threaded oops i have a bit of perfection problem it happens this happens it's literally a browser it's literally a browser what's this ocd looking thing you ask it's a condition where you are a bit too strict about how things should be you may say wow that's a good thing but then if your table's edges don't match your laptops and you get a shiver of anxiety that's dude i used to i swear i used to be so so bad that i would even organize my shirts by like colors by type i would organize everything so much and i remember one day i was sitting there organizing everything and i just thought what am i doing with my life and it completely disappeared like it just it just disappeared from my life from that moment i just realized i will never be so concerned about things again like that like i can't i i emotionally cannot handle the amount of time i spend organizing the most meaningless things and then it just went away it just went away i even still remember exactly where i was i was in the john the johnston dormitories in boseman montana it was awful i remember just like spending an entire day just organizing the stupidest and then i just realized i can never do this again i can never do this again i now buy the same socks right the same socks every single time no this was long after my meth days i buy the exact same pair of socks i do not fold socks i buy the same set of shirts i have three or four shirts that's it they're all the same shirt and i buy black hoodies and i just don't think about crap anymore you know how annoying it is to just just spend your life doing that also i get distracted fast so i need to f focused environment i left this article to get the above image and now i'm back after reading about the movie this meme came from okay cool we're on the same page now see we aren't much different after all that's pretty good statement i like both environments outside and inside the laptop to be ultra minimal check out the screenshot at the bottom of the page the there aren't even clo close icons on the application windows if possible from letter spacing and fonts to the inner padding of a popup everything is a trigger to be honest it makes me happy to do this kind of stuff and if you search for unix racing you'll get blown away on the other hand literally on the other hand i started getting wrist pain due to the constant jumping from letters and arrows grinding 80 hours a week comes with its own perks yeah this is one of the reasons i switched to vorac i was googling about wrist pain conditions and funnily enough one of the tips was using vim mode on your computer that sneaky vi i couldn't even understand was the same thing until i opened it i had some rual residual hate towards it let's go for for the for server work i was using nano later i moved to micro which was closer to vs code bindings every stunt it takes to avoid my arch nemesis vi i realized that or stint did i say stunt is it supposed to be stint that literally every tool i use has a weird sublime and vs code hybrid key bindings gosh i hate myself i can't even use another person's computer running pure version of that software to support the no terminal mindset set over the years i forgot all my appreciation for a said gp etc things needed to change i couldn't live in this denial this is a great moment this is a great moment right here i love where this is slowly coming to you realize that like it's one thing that i really like is that i can log on to any server and be fairly efficient with vim right you just give me vim long as i can long as i can do global marks i'm i'm starting to hop around pretty fast on on on projects i don't really use that often you know or on servers i never use and it's just all a sudden you know you start hopping around love it it's good it's a great experience once you know what you're doing it's a great experience even when you're not good at it right do you enjoy let's see do what you enjoy not necessarily keeps you abstracted from real problems fair everybody spends time in in denial it's normal as long as you are ready to come out of it after realization learn core g linux tools this is the best piece of advice in this entire article right here you'll understand the benefit in the long term for example i have been much better at rex okay bad example if i just continued using gp and said okay bad example don't no this is not why you do it stop it stop it but real talk the amount of benefit you'll get from just learning these stupid things i cannot tell you how many times i've seen somebody write something to walk a file tree guess who also wrote something in an interview to write or to walk a file tree for a pattern and i did it in java i did it in java i did it in java vim has search scroll plugins like easy motion vim sneak to navigate buffer you should use them vim go i was i i resolved to use vim not because it's any better for my specific workflow but because i wanted to break my dependency on vs code i knew i couldn't drop into vim for my day job so i settled on the middle ground of using vim bindings in vs code courtesy of a youtuber called ben awad ben does love does love the vs code vim bindings who showed this peaceful path of adopting vim i've always wondered how he could magically teleport to random places when i could only move there really fast on the safe let's see on the safe side i automatically turn it off in all my office project folders nothing in vin particularly amazed me because i had a similar shortcuts in mind for vs code yet the constant tussle between both was getting hard by the end of the year i could fluently navigate in vss code using vim bindings after almost a year of usage i started seeing the ergonomics and functional benefits key points be practical you son of a gun learn to walk before you run temptations okay that's actually fair temptations to achieve what others flash is a good motivation personal willpower won't be enough to explore uncharted territories we need some rocket fuel to kickstart the process i honestly don't even know what that means this is fair this is fair it works it works you know it's hard to explain to people why vim is so good but i feel like every time someone gets good at a set of key bindings even if you use the emac one i've seen someone really good at the emac one like once i which still blows me away but he doesn't type properly and so i think the fact that emac is so crazy and his inability to type well worked for him but when you see someone really good at what they use you understand you know what the power looks like but until you felt it it's just so hard to to explain why it's so good it's so hard to explain why it's so good it's so hard it's impossible i was darn stupid of me to think that one day i'll uninstall vs code and move to vim someday because i could navigate there similarly similarly i didn't realize i was using vim bindings for doing vs code things the workflow part was still a miss all that i learned was a few keyboard shortcuts i moved anyways one day i had to find and replace a word in projects i couldn't do it so welcome back home vs code at this point had become my identity i couldn't fly through code blazingly fast blazingly fast in vs code and my friends knew that me for that so i settled back in leaving vim i was happy i could do whatever those vim nerds could do yet i was still in a big comfort zone bias my problem was that i was using vss code with hybrid key bindings and now replaced even with something else what kind of solution was that luckily i got a break from office project work sometime back and i knew this was the chance to transition my configs i realized i had no trouble in moving to from sublime to vs code it was a happy process i started working in raw neovim just rod dogging it and yeah it was painful but i had a plan whenever i miss something i would re i would read neim docs and add it tj i could you just hear tj tj right now is crying oh my goodness this is straight up this is tj look at this this is tj makes me happy i understand and never written every single line of my editor conf fig took me two months and now i have my own sweet pte personal development environment let's go te no te is crying te is happier tj has never been happier in his life tj let's go reading the docks and everything let's go this covered everything from default indentation size to file tree to language servers earlier i watched a youtube video from the private on neo setup it overwhelmed me so badly that i had to take a week's break from thinking about my own let go let's go i do set up the entire neovim configuration in like 20 minutes everything i did get a prime mention but i would say it was probably a little negative mention but still we still got one we still got one acknowledge the iceberg theory one gets attracted to what floats and not the work it will take to create and understand the base my suggestion if you ask is simple respect it 30 minutes we got them my biggest motivation for making the final switch was a new off factor surrounding vim as a software all you see in the screenshots below text terminal on the windows no images no real buttons no gue of any kind they aren't even real icons it's all it's really hard i imagine you can't even change the font or the size of it every single thing is carefully manipulated text on a black terminal window that respect for the people who built it keeps me going all right i think we're hitting the end here prime gen making a new vim users feel bad i am you're you're welcome i thought the video was great okay people loved it like and subscribe hey like and subscribe right now press the like and subscribe button now that i have fully moved my workflow to newm it doesn't feel any different i was already using used to the vim bindings by the way this is the best way to do it if you're going to learn vim learn vim bindings first okay learn vim bindings first it's totally worth it it's totally worth it because then you don't have to fight like you don't want to learn two things at once learn one thing learn one thing just one all right exactly the let's see the only aesthetics i have change yet the good part is i understand how these moving pieces work i understand that the inline error messages shows from where these fancy auto completions come how each line gets formatted and much more looking back i could have peeped into the source code of vs code or it's extension but but the mindset was to use it not to learn it this is a great this is a fantastic line by the way right here the mindset of vs code is to use it not learn it whereas the mindset of neovim is to learn it then use it it is just a little bit different it is just a different type of mindset the biggest shift is that i look at software in general from the mentality of a builder rather than a consumer now when i see something i ponder how to build it rather than use it let's go after all i'm an engineer and my identity revolves around two main things how well i understand software and what i can build beautiful look at look at that beauty look at that beauty look at that beauty you're using cursive disgusting but whatever i'm not gonna i'm not i'm only i'm judging i'm judging i did judge i judge thoroughly look at that look at that look at that telescope let's go telescope let's go telescope unfortunately i can't through go through every screen in utility but if you'd like the setup i can write an article on how everything i did from scratch okay nice frequently asked questions will using vim make me a better developer yes take that i take that guarantee i agree i know people hate that but i actually agree with that no harpoon screenshot i know sad it was sad how hard is the transition pretty easy just a few hundred key bindings it is the reason why is that you have to learn your environment and learn learning your environment and learning how things work makes the world seem like a smaller place and a more overcomable place and you're able to learn things in a new way just simply because you've taken such a hard step and a lot of people don't take those hard steps very frequently in their career and so i think it's very very good to take those steps and to know that you should do that right because language servers there's nothing really that crazy about it overcomable all right what does it even matter it's just an editor my go let's see my work goes with what i write if you want to be an engineer or a writer figure it out fast good that you chose engineer now think again how many fundamentals of engineering do you get exposed to that your day job abstracts from you you don't want to be an engineer with a weak core do you you don't do some sit-ups sit on a ball it seems hard to to get started will i grab it it took two years multiple quits and let's see and it only worked when i started from scratch an incrementally added functionality it's your child now you won't say anything bad about it remember that you didn't choose your interests you raise interest in a thing you put effort into also really good yeah to be honest i lost my usb dongle true story poor usb dongle you know he had the ability to make to make sublime edit like his on any platform and then goes and loses it did i go fishing i used to fish a lot vim rocks hoodie comes in when we'll think about it ah this is great this this was actually a really good article it makes me realize like all the things that i had to do to go through vim mine was a little bit different journey but i did like i mean i started in net beans or i started in like some other editors blue jay then net beans then i tried eclips hated eclips back to net beans tried vi hated vi went back to net beans then from net beans i went to in from intell i started vim motions and then i started using vim motions and i got really good at vim motions and then from intellig i tried out vim hated vim went back to intellig went to vs code sublime's been sprinkled on and off in there for so many times from there i went to back to vs code then i went to adam realize adam writes everything in coffeescript went back to vs code realized i still don't like vs code retried vim again still didn't like it went back to intellig then eventually i went back to vim and then i was just using vim and starting to like it and then i went and started using neovim and i love it hey the name don't even try it with me the name is the primagen
