- i bought this entire island! i have 10 challenges,
and we have 10 people! and the last one of you to
leave this island keeps it! (everyone cheers) so, let's just jump right
into the first challenge. - oh my god. - the last one to put a
coconut in this hole leaves. bye. go. (everyone shouts) - oh! - yes! - buddy, no. oh, you're very sweaty. - my whole family is gonna
be so disappointed in me. - i didn't have time to get
anything through my mind. - i got so lucky. tyler grabbed the one i was going for, and there was one more
right behind the rock. that wasn't there, i'm out. - jed, i'm sorry, but you
lost the first challenge, so you must leave the island. - i'll miss you, bro. - it literally could've been anybody. that's so true. - [man] do a flip! - and there goes our first contestant. by the end of this video,
only one person will remain. i feel bad for the man,
but the show goes on. i got an island to give away. for the second challenge,
you're gonna vote someone off. everybody write a name on that clipboard. whoever has the most votes is leaving. this is about to be really intense. so, everyone's stuff is written down. everyone give me all your pens. there we go. now they cannot change what
they have written down. the votes have been added up,
and we have a clear cut loser. tyler, you're safe. - oh my god.
- all right, good job. - and between you two... - yeah. - i'm bad at this. i'm really bad at- - spit it out. - darren, you lost. tyler, tyler, you're- - i'm in? - that's crazy, bro. - i wonder where darren, how he feels. he's over there standing. he don't know what to do. (mrbeast sighs) - it's painful. just so you all know, the person about to walk in front of you, the person about to lose
this island, you voted off. - it was all karl's fault. - it was all karl. - all right, darren, walk down the pier. - sorry, bro. this is bad. - [mrbeast] oh my gosh. - i saw that. - i love you. thanks for coming out. - thank you. (buzzer buzzes) - i feel so bad. but the show must go on. before we do the next challenge, i just wanna see how you
guys are doing and feeling. - anxious.
- i wanna die. - i feel betrayed. - highly paranoid. - if i win, i'm gonna sell this island. i don't want it. (everyone laughs) - karl, here's a camera. tyler, here's a camera. now you all have a camera. for this next challenge, we
are playing hide and seek. - no!
- no, please, no! - [mrbeast] you can go hide. (everyone shouts) - i'm running. - and now all eight of them are hiding. one, two, three. - yo, i gotta find a tree to climb. - find something quick. - i swear, every noise i hear, i feel like i'm about to get caught. - i've lost so much
money on hide and seek. maybe i'll climb on that tree. - [mrbeast] 89, 90, 91, 92. (mrbeast sneezes) - i gotta fart. [music] hiding and seeking [music] [music] but i'm just hiding [music] - imagine if you lost an entire
island because of a fart. - 296, 297, 298, 299, 300. ready or not here i come! whoever i find doesn't
get a private island. the beauty of this is i don't have to find all eight of them. i only have to find one. i bet a lot of them hid in these bushes. i see you! that was a joke. but if someone is over there, they're pooping their pants now. - did they go past me? - no one over here. chandler, i have food! i have a feeling i'll never find anyone. birds usually make noise
when they see people, and they're making noise right there. i'm onto something. oh! tyler! - no! - [mrbeast] oh my gosh. wait, did you see me
walking up that whole time? - yes! - i found him! - i just lost an island
'cause i laid here? - so, tyler, you lost
$50,000 in hide and seek. - yep. - 60,000. - yep. - 70,000. and now 700,000. you've lost a million dollars
to just hide and seek, tyler. congratulations! i didn't find any of you. the person i found was tyler. - [chris] woo! yeah! - all those people are now
gonna compete for the island. i want you to walk past
them towards the boat. - it was an honor buddy. - can i get one? tyler, let me get one? - bye, tyler! glad it was you, not me! - [karl] tyler! - [mrbeast] you missed,
the boat's right there. this next challenge
will be a swimming one. - yeah!
- yeah! - i need you all to turn
around and face the beach. and then on my signal, turn
around and swim to the boat. last to touch it is out. but i'm gonna put it further away. this next challenge is very physical. it's easily the hardest
thing we've done so far. one of them is about to
lose that entire island. three, two, one, go! all right, tyler's in 1st. ethan's in 2nd. jess is getting left in the dust. come on! come on! all right, tyler's 1st. ethan is 2nd. karl is 3rd. chris is 4th. chandler has an interesting
strategy, but he's 5th. nolan. and jess came in last. - i can't believe i didn't lose. i really thought that was me. - i'm so out of shape. - i knew i was gonna probably lose 'cause i'm not really fast at swimming. - i'm so sorry, jessie! - we love you. - [karl] we love you! - so, do i make her get off
the boat and then get back on or do we just send the boat off? what do i do? i'm new to this, you know,
island game show type thing. it was a close race,
but jess came in last, and we have to send her off. and i feel bad for making
you get off the boat just to get back on it. boys, salute. - bye! chris, here you go. ethan. karl. you must be behind the line. and the only way to score
is to put it in the circle. land on the pad, i don't care. you're all gonna throw at the same time. - what? - okay. three, two, one, throw! - yes! - oh! - let's go! - let's go! - mine went over the hole. it glazed over it. maybe if it was even! - we did it. - nothing is stopping me
from selling this island the second i win it! - congratulations on the win, boys. i'm proud of you guys. so, one of them is about to leave. - thank god. - i'm letting you guys decide. - chris, easy, easy. - you want chris gone? - absolutely. - chris is a threat at the end of the day. he wins a lot. - [mrbeast] he does. - all right, nolan. - [nolan] i'm sorry. - chris. - yes. - you're out, i'm sorry. honestly, i thought you
were gonna win the island. - i tried. i gave it my all, but, you know. - you gotta go get on the boat. - nolan- - come here. - i have no regrets. (everyone laughs) - nolan! - i'll miss everyone except for nolan! - who was that guy? who was he? was he a contestant? - for this next challenge, i'll need you all to put on a blindfold. blindfolds on. - how do you wear this? - pull your blindfolds up. look at this treasure chest. all right, put your blindfolds back on. i'm gonna go hide this on the beach. the first person to find it wins. hey, can someone give me a shovel? i don't actually need a shovel. timmy's our tarzan. just put it right there. and they don't know this, but whoever finds it first
gets to pick who leaves next. it's about to get insanely intense. oh man, my back hurts. boom. they're gonna think this is it as well. first one of you to find
the treasure chest gets to pick who leaves next. - oh, what? - yes. go! find the treasure chest. - i'm so dizzy. - there's no chance. - karl, what are you doing? you're just digging a random hole? - i just know that you think, you're gonna try to put
it next to like a landmark of some sort. - oh god. - where the heck is it? - [tyler] that would've been a play. - oh no! dude, is it in the water? (chandler groans) - [chandler] ow! - oh, snap! - guys, keep looking. where is it? - bruh. - where is it, guys? - it's in a tree? - i just don't know how
he found it so fast. like, i'm sitting there
looking for it in the sand. - karl, open up your treasure chest. inside is a golden coconut. - yeah! - whoever you throw this
golden coconut at is out. make your decision. - it's between you two,
i'm gonna be honest. i'm just gonna say that. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. - i love you. i appreciate it, buddy. - i picked the wrong choice. (everyone laughs) - this does not get
easier the more i do it. tyler. - hey, it's been real. - you gotta walk down the pier of shame. - i love you, dude. - oh really? so, you're not mad at
him for voting you off? - the beef isn't worth it, man. - get out of here. - nice knowing you. (buzzer buzzes) - [mrbeast] oh, he is a little mad. welcome to the final four! - yeah! - here's the thing. you four need to pick one
of the people who have lost and bring them back. - jessie. - i'm voting jessie. - so, that's two jess. - i am also gonna go jessie. - jessie. - i picked jessie 'cause
i think she was one of the only people that's out right now that didn't say they
wanted to vote me out. - chandler and karl are tight. me and nathan just had a talk. we really gotta get jessie on board or else we may have a problem. - there was three vote all jessie, so really my vote didn't matter. - you guys voted for jessie
and now she's coming back! jess, jess, jess! - i'm back! - welcome back to the island, jess. there's now five people. let's go to the next challenge. here's what we're doing
for the next challenge. we're gonna go person to
person to person to person to person and see if you're
subscribed to the channel. if you're not subscribed, you lose. i'm confident you're all subscribed. you're literally competing
for $700,000 on my channel. like, how could you not be subscribed? all right, karl. - oh my god. - we're gonna search mrbeast. he is subscribed. he passed the test. speaking of which you
guys should subscribe because if you're ever competing for a million dollar island, i'd hate for you to lose
because you're not, just saying. i'm going to open up youtube. - yes! - [mrbeast] he is subscribed. - no way, no way! - oh my god! - okay. - you are subscribed. - woo! - he is subscribed. he is subscribed. you're the last person. subscribed. you all were subscribed
to the main channel. so logically now we check if you're subscribed
to the gaming channel. karl is subscribed to mrbeast gaming. - with that bell pressed. - oh.
- look at that. nolan is not subscribed to mrbeast gaming. (nolan groans) but don't worry, nolan. we have three more people to check. all right. are you going to redeem nolan? no. you're on our island. search, mrbeast gaming. he is subscribed. - ring ring that bell. - all right, boys, pay attention. she is subscribed. she is subscribed. everyone that is actually logical and subscribed to important
channels, step aside. - gladly. - and now it's time for the
most important subscribe test of them all, pewdiepie. are you subscribed? i don't know, yes! yes!
- subscribed. - yes! let's do it! if you're not subscribed,
you have to leave the island. - oh my gosh. - pewdiepie. he is not subscribed to pewdiepie. nolan, you continue to the next round. and tags, i'm really bad
at this, but you don't. - it wasn't even your channel. - ethan, buddy. i'm sorry.
- it was tragic. - you already know what i'm gonna say. the boat's there. - hey bro, i've been in a spot like this. it gets better. you just keep losing over and over. - i'll keep this seat warm for you. nolan, your next, bud. bye y'all. - bye. - you four are all that remains. i want you four to
break into teams of two. i'm gonna let you decide. - i think a lot of people slept on jessie but she's a winner, and we're
gonna win this together. - this is my buddy. - and now there's four. again, take your golden coconut. take your golden coconut. toss it to your partner. all right. now, take a step back. now you must throw it back. whoever drops their coconut first loses. - you ready? - [karl] yes. okay. - all right, they caught it. take a step back. - if you need to... - all right, take a step back. - oh, we're out next. - [nolan] let's go! - now, we're getting pretty far away. give it another toss. - go. - [jessie] ready? - oh! (nolan yells) (karl laughs) - go. - miss! (jessie yells) potato. - all right. ooh, okay. - easy!
- that's all day. that's all day! - oh! - i'm so nervous. - [karl] i'm so nervous. - i have an intense feeling
that karl's about to drop this. - stop, stop, stop! - [mrbeast] you ready? - don't drop it, don't drop it. - yes! - all right. - i cannot pass this line. - i got you. - [mrbeast] karl, throw that coconut. oh! oh! - that was so money! - ready, nolan? - [mrbeast] oh, she threw it. - [karl] yes! - i'm so sorry. - you were close. - boys, pick a number between one and two. - two. - two. - okay, i'll be right back. - oh no, wait. - now we're gonna have a game of luck. i had karl and chandler pick
a number between one and two. whichever one of you guesses it stays on. whoever gets it wrong leaves. nolan, what's your pick? one or two? - i'm gonna go two. - [mrbeast] what's your pick? - one. - okay. chandler, you want to tell
them what number you picked? - i picked two. - yes! - [mrbeast] they picked two. - i have to go back on the boat! - are you getting seasick by this point? - i'm so happy you're still in. - nolan, you can head on back. - i can still sell the island. - i'm so sorry. - today's been a
rollercoaster of emotions. it's been ups, downs, but i'm still here. - bye! third time's a charm. - nolan! what's up, dude? my biggest competition is probably karl. but we're on the same team right now. but if he separates us,
which i think he will, there's gonna be a problem. - i'm an animal. i'm an animal. we got this. we're winning. - the second to last
challenge is coconut bowling. we set up bowling pins
and we have coconuts. they have to bowl. (pins fall) ooh! and see how many they can knock over. dude, i'm pretty good. - that was first try. we're deciding who's getting
a $700,000 island by bowling? - that sounds about right. - [karl] okay. - karl pick who goes first. nolan it is. nolan! here's your golden coconut. you get one bowl. whoever knocks down the
least amount of pins loses. - it's just a little bit of pressure. not much pressure. - [mrbeast] let's see it. the island, baby. the island! oh! - i'm not happy with that! i'm not happy with that! bro, some stupid pins
could cost me 700 grand. - they probably already did. so, you can go take a seat, sir. - yeah, all i have to do
is give a little effort and i'm beating nolan. - if you knock over five pins,
you have a guaranteed slot in the final two. chandler! chandler! - oh! - ain't nobody beating that! i think there's 10 down there, and i think there's 10 knocked down. that's 700 grand! - this is the least
confident i've ever been about any of the challenges
we've done today. i'm not gonna lie. - you literally just have
to knock over half the pins. - i know. - karl is known for choking. - exactly. - hear that music getting more dramatic? the whole world is watching. you watch "survivor" every week. - i know. - well, make it happen! - let's do it! ready to watch dreams come true? - no! - don't think about how your entire life you'll think about this bowl if you miss. - karl, just please hit at least one. - oh my god. - don't choke! - karl! he did it, he did it,
he did it, he did it. - oh, oh, oh, oh! - there's four! we tied! - karl! i thought you were gone. - i barely reached the pins. - [chandler] yo, they fell in slow motion. - [karl] i don't know. - karl, the ball literally
stopped in front of the pins. - [karl] and just went... - [mrbeast] and then knocked over four! - oh my gosh! - remember how i said the
music was getting intense? - yeah. - now it's getting more intense. - oh god. - nolan, i think we can cut the chatter. literally all you have to
do is knock over some pins. just hit it. feel the moment. - yes! - [mrbeast] oh my gosh. - no! no! i keep on throwing it left! i missed all the pins! - karl, step up to the plate, step up. - all you have to do is hit one. - booyah! woo! yes! - nolan, no. - we did it. - i'm proud of you, karl. you clutched up, man! - oh my god. - but you still didn't do better
than me, but you did good. - nolan, buddy, i'm sorry. i know you wanted 700 grand. - just wanted to sell it. - i know you did. i know. but the island deserves not to be sold. - yeah, i'm not gonna sell it. - the boat will be here any second, but this time it's different. it's carrying all the losers on it. - why? - you'll find out in a little bit. welcome back, everybody! - i don't know why you're here, but hey! - welcome back, everybody. nolan, i need you to join them. - [karl] nolan wasn't rolling! am i right? - our final two contestants
are karl and chandler. - let's go! - you're probably wondering why i brought all eight of you back, and you're probably wondering as well. you guys will decide who
wins this $700,000 island. and here's how we're gonna do it. chandler, we'll let you go first. i'm gonna give you a
minute to plead your case. say whatever you want. - guys, if this magic trick
does not convince you, i don't know what will. as you can see, they're connected. (everyone applauds) ladies and gentlemen, thank you. - i don't know what just happened. this is a serious video, i promise. all right, karl, come on over here. - i can't one up that speech. - yeah, i don't know
how you're gonna one up whatever just happened there. but karl, you have the floor. these eight people determine
whether or not you're rich. - oh!
- oh! - he just turned around. oh, dean just turned around too. see, it doesn't matter if
you get in the top two, it matters how you got in the top two. - here you go. let's go. yeah. yeah. - maybe you should dance. (upbeat music) - all right, i'm ending it here. i'm ending it here. you're picking who leaves. we'll start on the end, and
we'll work our way over. nolan, proceed. who do you wanna vote off? - sorry, karl. you caused this. - i don't think i need to talk anymore. the betrayal. karl gotta go. - me and my boy, karl, we're
going to the finals together. i am voting out chandler.
- wait, really? - i love both of them so much, but i know if carl doesn't win
this, he's gonna be very sad. "survivor" is the only thing
he cares about in life. i'm voting chandler. - i'm writing down chandler 'cause i really don't think
karl's gonna get a single vote. karl had it hard. i wanna make sure he
gets at least one vote. - i feel bad. sorry, karl. you're still my friend. - [mrbeast] all right, there, jed. - karl played a good game. but on the other hand,
i now hate coconuts, and his head is just
kind of shaped like one. like, it's difficult. - all right, come on down. you're the last vote. - it's tough because
karl wrote my name down. it's almost like i'm supposed
to feel sympathy for him, but he didn't feel sympathy
for me when i got voted off. nothing personal. i'm so sorry. - all right, i'm now gonna read 'em off. karl. - oh wait, that's bad. - karl again. chandler. chandler again. - [chris] it's tied up. - oh.
- anxiety. - karl. - less anxiety. - chandler. three votes for each so far. - yo, it looks like a
couple names on there. - karl. - [chris] this is the final one. - currently karl has four
votes and chandler has three. the final vote goes towards chandler. it was a tie. - oh! - y'all just all change
your minds about karl? i thought you guys hated him. - karl was in the lead, and
then he was the last person. and then he flipped a coin. - [chris] what happens now? - i didn't really have a backup plan. - honestly, i thought it was
gonna be completely different. - here's what we're gonna do. we're gonna put all
these votes back in here. all eight votes are now back in the box. i'm gonna let someone pull one. jed got out first. he didn't really get to do
much, so let's let him do this. - yay, jed! - [mrbeast] he's about to determine whether or not you have 700 grand. - [tyler] oh, snap, he has it already. - the winner of survivor mrbeast, chandler. - oh! (chandler yells) let's freaking go! yes! - [jessie] you got 2nd place. - karl, it's just like hide
and seek all over again. - lost a million dollars all
the way up to this point. i won 700,000. - i thought this was my time. - i'd say he is overreacting, but $700,000 would be enough to retire. - if anything under-reacting right now. - this is going in my room. - you're gonna win one day. - guys, karl's officially
lost over a million dollars in challenges. - yeah! - look, now you get to win. - all right, i can't, i can't. - don't get hurt on my island! i'm responsible! you guys made memes about
me, saying i would never win. well, look i tried today and i won! - you heard the man! make memes about him winning! now hit that subscribe button so you don't lose $700,000 in the future. congrats on your island. karl, stop crying. we'll see you in the next video.
