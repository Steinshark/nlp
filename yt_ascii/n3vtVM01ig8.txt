ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the road to grandm series here on the gotham chess youtube channel this is episode number four and in this series just in case you need a reminder i'm taking you through my journey of the return to competitive chess at the age of 28 how i'm practicing what i'm doing on a day-to-day basis taking lessons and so on and so forth first of all we've had three episodes already your feedback has been amazing couple of very quick points here number one in today's video i'm going to be showing you one of my best recent successes in the title tuesday ch.com tournament where i defeated three grand masters part of that is something that i implemented where i hide the person who i'm playing against obviously you cannot do that in over theboard play but it's interesting to see how my nervous system fares when i have no idea who i'm up against particularly online the second thing that i would like to say is that there are i'm playing a lot of blitz games right and there's a lot of feedback like why are you playing blitz games you trying to be grandmaster the two have nothing to do with each other you're right but there's no other way to practice for me there's no slow game tournaments around new york where i would play people who are around my strength so my first tournament will be in june and i'm just getting as much practice as possible while going behind the scenes third thing i just want to say i might put out a patreon i might put out like a like a behind the scenes exclusive content i might even do it on chesley my educational platform for you guys to follow along you'll be able to follow my games you'll be able to analyze my my training games i'll go in depth on on a lot of my own analysis i'll take you you know vlogs behind the scenes so let me know in the comments if you would enjoy that type of stuff and i will make it happen on that note let's go back to may 7th this was the tournament the title tuesday tournament on ch.com and at some point in this event i had seven points out of nine so i was literally in the running for like a top five finish vladimir kramnick was on the hotline that's a current events joke and what i did is i did the following i installed a chrome extension which hides and removes the elements on the screen so i don't know who i'm playing against now rather than you know what no we'll we'll i'll show you who i'm playing but i didn't know in the game who i was playing and let me show you the difference so here's a couple of games and i defeated three very very very strong grand masters and i did it in in a variety of different fashion so my best result and i hope you hope you watch and i was very very happy and i actually hit my highest bl rating in a year i was sort of up and down in the 2600s and i hit my highest blitz rating in in approximately one calendar year so i'm very happy about that so i opened the game with e4 serge responded with c5 jago plays against hikaro a lot he plays many many many tournaments and i played this a3 sicilian now i i have defeated him in the past but again i didn't know i didn't know i was playing him so you know when you beat a guy maybe a couple of times you there is a level of like i can do this you know and i mean not when i play caro because i beat him once and that doesn't seem to help me ever but but that is kind of a that is kind of a thing but i didn't know i was playing him he played knight f6 this is actually the best move against the a3 sicilian there's others but in general challenging the center is very annoying for white and here rather than playing what i normally play which is moves like d4 c4 i played bishop c4 which is i mean it's just a move like i basically we're in a very very fresh position and he played the move e6 and i played knight f3 and and basically i was just going to develop completely normally except i have the pawn on a3 which in the future i could use to trade off his pawn and then take the entire center but i was just going to castle i i never really play like this i mean i generally played in gambit style but i was like let's play it you know in the following fashion castles and here he really surprised me he played knight e7 now everything tells you that in the opening on the first six or seven moves black should be trying to make progress this is the opposite of progress i mean this is like he's trying to put a pawn in the center but he's now moving a knight for the third time in six moves and he's going to have to move it again because he can't develop his dark squared bishop i mean he could go here and here there's something wrong about this move and so at this point i'm thinking okay i've castled i've developed my opponent's going backwards repeatedly i think i need to play in the center and so that's why i play this move c3 the computer already likes d4 which didn't really make much sense to me because i can't even take the pawn well yeah but now the computer says well now you play rook e1 and then you take the pawn right so it's kind of the same idea he plays d5 and here i thought again he still went backwards every move that i'm making is making progress i developed my bishop my knight i castled i to i'm trying to take the center i take on pant i don't care that his queen comes out because now i'm still playing in the center and as you can see already i have an advantage now i don't see this thing during the game but i thought this was very comfortable for me because my next few moves are very natural and he still needs to move this knight again and he needs to move the bishop right so he took on d4 i took which now grants me knight to c3 and now he went back to d5 and i was like what he's made 10 moves and 40% of those moves have been with the knight to f6 to d5 to e7 now the one thing that is going for him is this is an iqp isolated queen pawn position and if i trade too many pieces my isolated queen's pawn is going to be very bad so for example like i okay very obviously this is none of this is going to happen right i'm just saying if we start trading a bunch of pieces right this is going to be a weakness and what i need to do with the with the pieces is i need to play around the pawn and one of the ideas i had here was actually to take and just start attacking him like bishop d5 and i thought oh i'm checking him and he's not going to c but actually no nothing works like i'm not in time because he's protect in so i thought okay well why don't i just develop like this and i thought this was very smart cuz i'm going to the e4 squares he plays bishop b7 again he's playing catchup i've made a lot of progress in the position i put the rook in the center i didn't think much again i'm i'm also one thing i'm very proud about in this game and in all these games time management was very good so i'm up a good amount of time here against grandmaster shalo and so here i need to come up with a plan and the thing is a lot of chess's pattern recognition i don't really have a lot of experience playing iqp positions because i don't really get into them a whole lot but i know the general basics and one of the key ideas of an isolated queens spawn position is if you have all these pieces on the board you try to generate an attack because the pawn is actually a very useful plant for your pieces in the center and then you can make progress and go attack your opponent now i played the top engine move here i played queen d3 i was very proud of this move it's a deep idea it's got a lot of ideas behind it number one one of the ideas is to connect the rooks in the future in the future number number two you want to wrap around you want to go like this because this knight is off of its natural square and if it returns there it will be traded not right now but in the future right so the other idea of queen d3 is i can always put my queen on the third rank once i move my knight forward so now that my queen is up and i have all these ideas i'm going to go over here and i'm going to start being a menace because that is one of the ideas of the iqp so i put the knight on e5 it's not the top engine move the the engine wants me to be patient it wants me to go bishop d2 this is like the gm move you know this is like the you don't got to rush your opponent didn't do much with the position yet but i'm always a little like i gotta i gotta you know but bishop d2 just keep it you know bring a rook and then when the opponent starts going here then you play like rook c1 and then when when you've made every preparatory move that's when you put the knight on e5 right that's when you play your bishop a2 bishop b1 so i went knight e5 right away but it actually worked out quite well because serge traded with me and then tried to trade queens and here i found one of the ideas that i'm probably most proud of in recent memory i'm winning but i'm only winning if i find my idea now one very appetizing move here is knight to d6 just but it doesn't work because my queen is overloaded i'm defending too many things bishop d6 e d6 he takes on c4 and then i lose my pawn on d6 well if i trade queens with him he brings the rook i have no attack so what do i do queen to g3 i simply leave my bishop to perish because that knight has moved one two three four five and now this would be the sixth move so 33% of the game actually it's six out of 17 not even six out of' would be with that piece and i'm threatening bishop h6 now if he defends against bishop h6 like let's say king h7 well then i just move the bishop and it only gets worse right g6 i play knight and knight f6 i play queen f4 queen e3 queen h3 so what i calculated here when i was deciding to make this move queen g3 it's funny cuz i spent 5 seconds on it i didn't spend a minute sitting there nervously like i don't know if this is the best move blah blah bl bl no i just had a feeling it was the best move and i calculated queen g3 knight c4 bishop h6 he would give me his rook and i wouldn't take it i would not take his rook i calculated this this this g6 and now i have to find a good attacking move and again i'm very proud of this move i was patient i did not cash out because that's not a good cash out i lose both my rooks i saw that the dark squares were weak and i played rook to d1 and this very simple move is the death of the black position and the reason for that is the dark squares so if he blocks i was even thinking to play something like bishop to g5 but even something like knight f6 check he can't defend himself because the rook hangs and the bishop hangs this is probably what he should have gone for a position like this where you know he's going to win some pawns i'm still winning but it's you know it's a a little scary i might lose this pawn he might make three queens but he didn't do that and instead he brought the queen out and here i was like wait a minute and i found a very nice winning idea i took a step back now i can actually take the rook at this point and just kind of go all in i thought this was very clever bishop g5 the idea of bishop to g5 is that while his queen move targets me over here i have knight f6 check so the the real winning idea is this like this is game over for black black cannot stop the dark squares from collapsing and so on this move i realized i have a very simple tactic i can take the bishop that's it and the point is the rook is hanging if he moves it there i have knight of six check and on top of all of that when all this dust settles he has 5 seconds on the clock and i have i'm winning i i have a completely winning position because i'm gonna pick up the rook but i'm not just picking up the rook he can't move his bishop this was very he can't move his bishop there's nothing he can do so since he can't move his bishop he plays king e7 now at this point normally panic would set in i would realize that i'm i'm winning but i found a very clean very very simple solution rook c1 i don't need to defend my pawn if i play rook e2 here he plays bishop d7 and then if i hesitate some some i'm going to lose a rook like just rook c1 and if he defends his knight with b5 i play b3 but if goes here i sneak in and once i'm in i'm not getting out i'm not getting this is a very very very important move as well rook c2 to kick his knight out give him a check and that's it now i'm back in there and now i weave the mating net pawn to f4 i am threatening rook to f7 mate knight h7 he went here and ultimately resigned in this or ran out of time but okay he had 0.9 seconds and this was one of my cleanest wins in recent memory i mean the level that i played in this game i was so happy like understanding the structure a little bit more than my you know than him with queen d3 i rushed it a little bit with knight e5 but okay it's a blitz game i can't really be mad about that time management was good finding this and just playing on instant keeping the pressure on him and again i did that without knowing who i was playing like that you know ultimately that is a that is a massive component of the whole thing so unfortunately that's that's not how it always goes yeah that's that's not how it always goes but the next game i was playing panov now what's funny is that i i played pav elov a couple of weeks ago and i i had a game i'm just going to pull this up on his you i i've never played him before and i had a game where i i was playing with the black pieces and it was it was a complicated game it was it was very like i was attacking as king so i had the black pieces in this game this was some weeks ago and i was attacking him and i had an advantage according to the engine but i had sacrificed material and i didn't capitalize that right way i was very upset was very upset i didn't win that game so i didn't know i was playing him right i i had no idea and this time i went for a dutch defense because i the dutch has always been an opening that i that i dabble in that i like to play i really like the dutch and it's it's very imbalanced and one of the lines that i like to play against the dutch is actually in my dutch course on chesley which is e4 take take bishop e7 i actually don't mind these positions all that much they're a little bit dangerous because white plays like this and then i just say like look you missed your chance to take my piece here so i go back to e7 now maybe what i should have done is i should have went bishop e7 before castling because again it's blitz so you kind of play quickly once i commit my king to the e7 square i realize to the g g8 square he could play h4 and then he does get knight to g5 with some or knight even fg5 with queen h5 stuff so i realized during the game like oops i mixed up my move order i shouldn't have done that because now he can actually attack me and i i was sitting there a little bit annoyed at myself luckily he didn't punish me for that and he went queen e2 what i should have done is i shouldn't have castled and i should have played in the center but okay life goes on bishop e7 he went queen e2 and i implemented the game plan which is to take the center now we are back to equal this is what the position should have looked liked should have looked like not look liked but i gave him a little bit too many chances so now dc bishop c5 and i thought okay look from the opening i thought my position is is pretty decent i gave him a check i thought this was very smart by me i induced this move because if he castles he's going to have some weaknesses it was very stupid move i should have just brought my bishop back completely inaccurate assessment of the of the check i thought well i'm making him push a pawn so he's obviously not going to castle there yeah it's still the top engine move but he believed me he believed me and so here he played knight to d4 and something really funny happened really dumb actually i realized he was threatening knight6 and i thought well what better way to stop that than to just develop the queen and you know and defend my pawn and as i went queen f6 i went wait a minute e5 is just winning he just blundered just blundered in one move like he can't take because the queen and the king are still in the center and if he doesn't take i just i fork him i was like what if first of all he blundered that right like he it didn't even dawn on him and i just blitzed out queen f6 and sat there like what am i doing i just didn't expect to have like a winning tactic on the 14th move i should have just focused for a second i was very annoyed but the game goes on all right bishop knight b5 bishop f4 he attacks me and here i thought again i was doing something pretty creative by creating this you know shot a6 and i thought if he takes my bishop i take his knight i think the game is still quite complicated and he tried to attack me here by playing this move f5 because he's going to lose this pawn now the engine is a scumbag who just tells me knight g5 is just a good move the idea of knight g5 is actually knight h7 which is quite a brutal idea that's a very rare fork so if i play g6 here here he actually just takes anyway and then he plays queen h5 king g7 rook g1 and i can't stop rook g6 so he had to find a really nasty idea turns out that neither one of us saw it really it was quite quite a brutal concept both of us thought black was doing pretty well here clearly with some of this pressure and maybe he was also rattled by blundering e5 maybe he saw it right away and was like what am i doing and he went f5 and then i was like what about rookie 8 you know what about rookie 8 targeting the king in the center he castled and i just shut the door and went hold on a second i'm better and i'm up on time like i'm better i have a nice position why don't i play this position for a win what's stopping me so he took on b5 and i went with my knight and i'm down a pawn but i have the center i'm going to win a pawn back his king is wide open at this point i'm starting to believe he goes here i take the pawn i'm like i'm not even down a pawn anymore and bishop e4 just straight up wins so i'm starting to believe now the problem for me is generally when i start to believe i also start to panic a little bit right so i'm like okay focus focus now he goes night to g1 at this point i'm up 50 seconds on the clock and i know i know i'm winning i know look at white's position and i i thought i just outplayed him as you can see the computer ruins a lot of the fun the computer is like you both miss chances you both suck but i thought i was outplaying him which was giving me confidence obviously i don't know who i'm playing my screen during the game looks like this i don't know who i'm playing but i do know that it's a good player because i have a lot of points in title tuesday like i'm not an idiot i am but not in this context and and i was like okay i'm probably playing some gm and he's playing you know like this and so here i played e4 i thought this was a smart move i take away the square from the knight and i and i enable this which could enable potentially some sixth rank activity in the future he plays rook d1 i just bring my rook and i thought look i'm going to play fast he's going to start playing much faster cuz he's his position is bad and he's low on time right he plays this move f4 right away something in my mind is like wait but that's a really bad move because f4 changes nothing like now i have the position and pass pawns this one's not a passer but this one is like now my e pawn which couldn't go forward originally can just go forward now so i was like what a what a bad decision but i don't exactly know how to punish it well actually as it turns out this move just loses on the spot to this on pant i should have known better now if he takes with the queen i have a this i have this move he probably was going to go here and take with a knight but it i'm still winning like he can't do that rook f8 i you know and then he would go back and then so i should have just taken but again in blitz you make these split second choices and so my the decision that i made here was play a fast move let him suffer let him think because that's how people beat me so i said you know what f4 king h8 i didn't even spend a second spent like two seconds maybe king h8 you make a decision i want to go d4 i don't want my my i i don't want my king on on this diagonal i don't want my king on this diagonal i'm going to go d4 king h8 so he thinks he let play queen f2 and now i'm like okay buddy e3 i mean you let my pawn go and now d4 and now everybody's going and now bishop b4 is a problem and he takes i trade the rook he takes here and he he misses that this comes with a check he thought i couldn't take because my rook is hanging but it comes with a check now he has to block and my bishop is getting in there as well so i didn't play it the way stockfish wanted but i played it my way he goes here and the game now ends in style everything is winning of course i can play bishop b4 i can trade the rooks and bishop b4 but the game ends in style because a move ago i said this is a bad move because it allows me to get a pass pawn and it's only fitting that the way the game ends and i get my revenge on mr elot of is that i push the pawn pawn forking two rooks is how this game ends very very very nice finish he could take my rook but i take a rook and i get a queen that's the thing and he can't do this because he would be hanging as king so that wouldn't work yeah i was very proud of this like this was and then i you know the opponent got revealed because again i didn't know who the opponent was so i was like wow i got revenge that's amazing you know if i knew i was playing him there's a very good chance somewhere in in the middle game i would have done something stupid but maybe not you know may maybe i'm elevating and so in the next game the very next game i obviously know i'm playing somebody good i have i i just beat two gms back to back like obviously my next opponent's going to be good and i just had some success with my with my sicilian a3 so i played against this player again i don't know who this is during the game you see it now and we played this system i love this a3 sicilian you play posum you wait for them to castle and then you play h4 and actually the engine loves this attack and when they go h5 they get a really bad position after g4 take and this like here black has almost already completely lost now my opponent who i didn't know during the game but mr trough he played d5 and i went to h5 and he gave me my attack because otherwise you know and and here i'm thinking like am i going to beat another grandmaster this is insane this one not so much so he went knight c6 i decided okay look i'm going to take because i want to open up my my file he took with the f pawn because he wants to create a little bit of counterplay and planted my bishop on g5 and now my plan is like rook b1 queen d2 finish up my development and keep putting the pressure on him now here he really didn't like his position which caused this move c4 it's kind of a desperate attempt at muddying the waters at complicating things he has moves like queen b6 which threaten mate and i thought i played the best move here which the engine also approves simple development and i like that i i didn't spend a whole lot of time i mean i spent 13 seconds but he spent 13 seconds on this move point is he can't open the position he opens the position too much it's going to be plus two and a half he is the one that is under pressure with my bishop with my bishop with my rook so he goes queen a5 again looking to complicate things and i just play very simply queen d2 every move i've made has improved my position i develop my knights i develop my bishops i developed my queen and now he plays this move d4 d4 also works in my favor because after knight to e2 he's still under massive pressure massive massive pressure in this position if we trade queens like queen d2 i can even come back back he can go cd3 cd3 he's lost he can't defend against my my my bishop like he can play bishop d7 i just play knight f4 knight g5 i mean like he can't defend himself it's kind of insane but it's the truth so he goes here i take take and i just play queen e3 i'm like wait a minute his attack is over like it's completely over and i'm up 40 second again i'm getting the more i win the more nervous i get cuz i'm like oh my god like this is unbelievable i can't believe i'm actually playing like this he goes rook f seven now i know i i i have a chance here right i know i have a chance i want to play knight f4 i want to play all this stuff i but i decide you know what just like the alan of game i'm just going to improve my position my pawn is defended now there you know i don't ever have to worry about blundering it he doesn't have a move i'm not sure this is even an improvement of his position because it's in the way of my pawn let him think he goes here and now i'm thinking all right i got to go like i got to go because he's going to start bring so now it's time for knight f4 at this point i think it's over i don't see a move everything is defended i'm threatening knight e6 like the game is over and so i thought he has to go knight d8 defending himself at which point i would figure out a move i would play d4 d5 i would play bishop h4 here i'd play bishop h6 i'd figure something out all right but then he went here with 20 seconds on the clock i have an 80c time advantage in a blitz game kn4 is very complicated because if i take the knight he takes my bishop which is a little bit scary but i was like so so what i'm winning i'm up a pawn and i'm going to win a rook but now the nerves start kicking in now he takes takes rook a now the nerves start kicking in now all i'm hearing in the back of my head is don't screw this up don't screw this up how do you win this position now i'm starting i'm seeing ghosts i'm seeing ghosts if i take the rook my knight is hanging if i move the knight he takes my pawn on g2 okay what do we do i mean how are we going to you know what are we going to do about this well the honestly the easiest thing to do is probably just play knight d5 knight d5 i get a rook off i might get a queen off i might get a knight off he plays queen g2 he hangs the night and then i castle queens side like it's it's a wp i go g3 suddenly he goes here and i'm like uhoh he's going to get my bishop he's going to fork me oh my god what have i done i'm panicking panic mode sets in i'm like what do i do i got to get his queen off the board if he's going to attack me i gotta trade queens with him right he says no queen trade i'm like oh god all right i got to take the he's attacking my i gotta take okay i got 50 seconds he's got 10 seconds how do i deal with knight to d4 i kind of want to play f4 right kind of want to play f4 kick his queen out all right let's do that he goes here now i'm like now what i want a castle but if i castle along i mean that's really dangerous like am i going to get mated he's got queen d6 queen a3 is mate oh my god i can't go that way maybe i keep my king in the center maybe that's the right way to go oh i know he's going to play knight d4 let me just play rook h2 i spent' seconds on that move so this is overprotected now he puts the bishop there which is not what i was expecting so now i go queen e2 he comes here i'm like oh man oh man oh he's going to mate me somehow he's going to mate me somehow this is very scary stuff now the engine to to my credit the engine wants to go king f1 that's a very tough move to play and suddenly i have 19 seconds suddenly from an 80 80c time advantage we're down to 10 i'm panicking he puts the knight on d4 i don't know what to do i go here my idea with queen g2 was to trade the pieces i panic completely and this just loses on the spot just straight up losing like the just i like i i mean it's incredible what my nervous system does it's just like a series of unfortunate events is is is what just occurred like yes i allowed counterplay and yes i should have obviously you know been a little bit like more but that's that's what my anxiety does that's especially in blitz like in classical chess you have way more time here i i i missed this move now i'm like okay i got to focus i got to focus let's let's settle down let's settle down all right we take easy night is coming and now i'm like oh god you know now i'm spinning now i'm spinning out of control i'm trying to and and i and i blunder but he doesn't want a queen trade he doesn't want a queen trade because why would you want a queen trade you're losing but he forgot about knight c2 as well because he had nine seconds now i go here and now very different story now i'm solid he goes queen a4 and i take this pawn and now i'm fine his knight is hanging he goes here i seal off the diagonal and we're both got 7 seconds i mean the nerves are skyh high he goes queen d7 and he hangs his knight now i consolidate i play queen here i don't care if i lose my pawn because now the king comes up and i bring my rook all i got to be careful about now is not hanging anything which is why i kept my pieces as close together as possible rook f8 now i don't want to lose on time so i play rook h1 h5 and rook g2 and that's it his queen is trapped and i'm winning i'm going to take on g6 i'm going to take on h5 he goes here i mean we play a couple like one or two more moves and he resigned here and i won this game too and i and i and i ended the tournament with with seven out of 11 and i i'll show you one of the last heartbreaking games that i played this was my last round of the tournament i had seven out of 10 and i was playing puani very strong iranian grandmas so what happened in this game is as always you know from the opening i was very comfortable i had a very interesting position this is the position straight out of the scandinavian defense course that i have by the way i misplayed it i should have taken on a4 here i misplayed the opening but so did he and the position was equal and i and i knew the position was equal and here my very strong opponent straight up hung a pawn straight up hung a pawn and then went here and i was like well okay i'm going to take and he gave me this check attacking my king attacking my knight and i spent a while here i spent 48 seconds half of that was nerves because i was like am i really going to beat another like very i didn't know why i was playing him but i was i calculated here i calculated knight c6 i calculated knight b5 calculated a lot of different complicated lines i was calculating queen b5 as well like all all sorts of different stuff where i could take the bishop and ultimately i settled on knight c6 which is fine bishop c3 and i decided you know what i spent all that time i'm just calculating random stuff let me castle and from a distance when i got here i i spent so much time trying to work out the intricate details of all these different moves and i when i when i finally like realized i wasn't seeing much i was a bit tired i was nervous i hung mate this is a very famous checkmate pattern and if he go if i go here he checks me and then puts me it puts me away in the corner which this is brutal i mean this is just like this is like the chess gods looking at me like you had a good run buddy but you know that's the end that's the end of the run and yeah it's life i guess what can i i mean i i should have seen knight f6 i mean i should have just paused and been like can he check me and actually yeah it just so happens that's a completely winning tactic and then he couldn't mate me like he he had a madeen four here he didn't find it it was still plus 15 but somehow i like i i i i saved the game to a reasonable amount like i made it plus three but it was always lost and i i don't think he blundered again yeah i was just completely i was getting demolished and i ended up i mean i lost on time but okay it's with two seconds is basically resignation would have been very nice to get eight points but i i beat three gms and i still have room to grow this game was almost the beginning of the unraveling like had i lost like this it would have been brutal if i threw away the game like that just in a pure panic but i beat 3 gms and i did it you know in this mode of of of anonymity you know playing against a kind of a hidden accounts i will continue to try to do that it it does seem like like an interesting experiment to me but in the meantime road to gm number four is
