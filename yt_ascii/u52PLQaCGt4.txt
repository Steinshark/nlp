ah yes the noble art of speed running ladies and gentlemen once hailed to be exclusive to mostly gamers who are speed running video games now the scammers are in on it guys we got sec speed runs coming through and i'm excited about it i for one think it's gonna be a very interesting new sport so if you if you'd like to compete no i'm just kidding don't you you don't want to compete with this but what we're talking about today is this guy i've never seen an sec indictment so quick boys this thing right here is about a twitter investor stock account which grew its following from a relatively just like 13 000 followers and used it to shill penny stocks in order to make a quick buck now i think three or four months from when they started ladies and gentlemen government comes knocking baby and i think it's an interesting sign of the sec's new priorities as they see the unregulated market on twitter of people just shilling random stocks we all know that a lot of it's illegal but nobody's really been doing anything about it it's been kind of the wild west but this i think signifies that if you're out there shilling stocks shilling companies they're watching for sure i mean because this is a small account the account is called oc millionaire bulls make money bearers make money pigs get slaughtered and wolves take everything this is also known as the vapid profile something that sounds cool but ultimately anybody who say pigs get slaughtered often time you're the guy getting slaughtered it just takes a while like you're the guy getting indicted by the sec so who are you talking about right this person also calls himself a penny stock wizard wow that's interesting now here's the deal our boy oc millionaire he was shilling and a cannabis company that was known for basically nothing i mean they're just like this defunct company and on december 10th he starts pumping it up boys and as you can see around that time frame it of course spikes about four thousand percent and immediately it dumps in that time he sold his stocks he bought 41 million shares of stock this is all these penny stocks are he's like you got 10 million shares for 10 dollars i mean that's basically how it is and he ended up making let's see here oh almost a million dollars which in a way is like i mean i'm shocked that you can profit that much off such a tiny audience that's like my twitter audience i mean actually come to think of it it's giving me an idea no no no wait wait not though because they have morals but yeah he shield this to his followers increased four thousand percent he profited off of it and then the sec is like no you don't no actually bunk them on the head and so yeah you love to see it and i think that i hope that this is the start of more accountability with this stuff because these people he was just shilling arcs again and again and again sorry that's the name of the cannabis company if you guys don't know just shilling it man always talking about what's going on it's so great it's so great this is what you call fraud i think most people aren't aware if you own a position you shill it out especially if you're telling people false information buddy that's called fraud and lastly i want to share a fun little meme with you guys to end the day because i saw this and it sums up my channel in four seconds ladies and gentlemen this is my channel wake up and smell the coffee
