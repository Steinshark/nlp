hello and welcome to everyone in the stream in this video in this talk we will now focus on hiring with meeting c plus plus four c plus plus and see some people on the chat hey welcome to people from canada india vienna so quite international audience today that's nice to see so let's get started with a presentation here we go so hiring for c plus possible meaning c plus plus i'm your host and organizer so let's go this quick overview on meeting c plus plus like when you're hiring when you're actually you know have open positions and you're looking for a service to use to to find candidates meaning c plus plus can give you huge visibility linkedin and twitter are now above 30 000 followers and in total if you add them together they have written over a million developers and impressions in the months so to this comes youtube two it comes facebook which also have about 25 000 followers each so a loan and followers now we are way above the 100k and so for you as a company if you're looking for deaths that is untapped possibilities a community outreach which you did not have prior to that so this is at your fingertips this is what i offer to you this network in the prior job fair in the last event we had actually a company was one position and they found three deaths which they would like to hire for this position and they were like well actually currently we are discussing if you know higher them all or who of them and that said it's of course not always the case that a company makes an offer that they get to hire the person because a good deaths are still in high demand which i'll get later too i published in the blog earlier this year the results an overview from the 256 candidates which submitted a little bit data on that i will publish a blog post about something i'm gonna cover in this talk which is skilled by region the way the drop fair works there's a cv upload form which we're going to talk a bit about too and we you know have a lot of candidates submit through that form it will give us a lot of data and if you put an aggregate we get actually interesting graphs as you'll see later the last event actually for the first time ever had a hundred folks submit their cvs so we had 100 submissions so like every number from the event as a percent which is rather nice right and was that you know let's just generally talk about the topic of hiring and ffp i keep hearing that c plus plus divs are hard to find and for years so why is that right for a long time everyone has been looking that's not right now the case but it's still the case that a lot of companies are looking so there's a lot of competition but then there's also like the way companies are looking you get a lot of messages these messages are from singles and german and they are towards me and i'm definitely not looking but those people just spam everyone and yeah that's that's how you find the candidate and you feel your role but you alienate like the the other 99 which you reach to you know and those messages always claim that those people look at your profile artisan hiring we're looking at profiles and we're only selecting the best the fitting one that's not the case you would have seen that you know in my profile i actually have or had sentences a thing of the past actually now that i'm not looking for jobs and some some head-on was actually right move that changed which is okay but don't spare me like that you know and the other point i want to mention is like misgendering that happened to me once and maybe it happened to you once well if you're a man if you're a woman happens like you know once a week once a month and it's like such a common thing which really alienates a woman in our community and so yeah that's really where headhunters and our community needs to do better in this regard and when i started doing these talks i was like well actually i would like to have some data on this on for from the community so in 2021 and 2022 and 2021 is not relevant anymore so i only have the data from 2022 here so the question is if you are not looking for a job how many headhunters recruiters companies have contacted you for one within the last three months and here you see this was exactly one month ago that the service started and it's more than 10 companies is 30 and more than five companies contacting or head underst contacting you is 45 of the community these numbers are probably this year a bit different but this year had a different question which i'm gonna get in the next slide too now let's first look at the results from linkedin where we see that yeah linkedin is similar just as if you know at the more than five together then it's 59 of the audience so it's a bit too much and yeah that's that's like one of my motivations to change that is like you know to to give companies the more direct access to the audience they're looking for people to hire which saying this is like for me the big question this year is with all the news of at least big companies which get the news right letting people go is that like a trend is this like most of things what what is in our community happening and so i asked your employer is currently hiring not hiring or letting folks go and these are the twitter results so you see 48 on twitter and 36 48 are hiring 36.5 percent are not hiring and 15.5 percent are actually letting people go so yes there there's some companies which need to reorient them and i think that you know we we will see some more that this year as was you know refinancing companies and startups with money from investors and banks and vcs will become a lot more difficult and if you look at the twitter from twitter to linkedin then you see same question and these numbers are remarkably similar just 48 35 and 17 so there's a few more people on on linkedin active who are either have been let go from their employer or have you know had teams been set free and they're so like having a job but so maybe they're also then you know that if if like you know some co-workers of you that you know have been let go and you might you know don't want to wait for the next round right you you're looking so no wonder that there's more people on on linkedin with that but the numbers are similar they're so close you know it's 48 and then it's not hiring and letting folks go which are just a few percentages at all so let's interesting and with that let me quickly read the chats i see there's more audiences from all over the world nigeria i see twice mexico egypt iran nigeria yeah thank you for coming so yeah so okay then if you have any questions about this or any comments then post them to the chat right now i don't see any questions in the chat that made it to the software here then we'll continue with the data on the job fair and let's go so two and a half years ago 2020 soon it's going to be three years in september i started the ministry purpose online user group and as part of that i was thinking what can we offer for hiring you know remote and working from home came became suddenly an option for people and also like online events were big and companies always were eager to you know to find new devils and then anyway i thought maybe this is a time to to build a new event a new format and so the median c plus plus online job fair was created which basically has a goal to bring together those that are looking the companies can attend and then the candidates are just you know able to hop from table to table and this is remove the actual platform which we used two years ago when we hosted in march and things fall of 20 21 we're actually using obito and so this year the job fair will be in march may september november and the next drop favorite i already mentioned is in may 9th and 10th it was just a few weeks ago great the job fair concept is basically the candidates you know can join any table on hop from table to table as i already said and the conversation is about the companies and of course what they do with c plus some of the candidates for the university plus and if there's a match the event is on two days and the first day it's on at three o'clock in the evening at three o'clock in the afternoon cst is like central european summertime i think berlin or amsterdam okay so london is an hour ahead of us so second day is evening eight o'clock eight pm twenty twenty o'clock pull in amsterdam and each of those meetings last for three hours where people sit on those tables and talk to the candidates and the candidates can meet the various companies and there's always a welcome table where usually i sit on and then you know just two candidates that are coming in that have technical issues or just questions or just want to come by and say hi always nice and then there's the cv sharing form which i also already hinted at this is always online and will then be used to capture the candidates that are either coming to the job fair or maybe not have time to be coming to one of those three units two times three hours and then everyone is again busy in their lives but people are still looking for jobs and all the cv sharing form is a big part of this this event basically is a traffic generator for the cv sharing form to make people aware that they can reach out to those developers and to make people aware that you know if you're looking for a job that you can reach out to those employers so these are actually not current plans i should have changed the slide this is where the current plans for the previous event and that was a success so we're going to do that from now on every time the live stream was an employer intro will be the welcome message and kicking off we'll be also going on into linkedin together an additional audience and the goal is that has worked wonderfully so we're gonna keep doing that and actually next week we have a fair but it's a little fair it's a broken tool fair we're going to do the same thing so that has been a very good add-on which we did in this year to the fair events and i i do offer employer branding so if your company of your employer is you know looking for a way to reach out to our community i am happy to facilitate you as a sponsor of the user group meeting or just have your own live stream if your hr folks want to you know gather a few team leads and talk speakers with us in an evening or an afternoon i'll be happy to host that if you have your own ideas of course i'm open to that now we're gonna talk a bit about the cv sharing form it's always online and the job fair sponsorship gives you six months of listing this is also to give you a bit of help with finding candidates and of finding and giving candidates a bit of help on reaching companies so for six months a few books is you listed and so if the job fair you know if we don't have enough companies at the job fair and we don't attract as many candidates which currently will probably not be the case because currently a lot of people are looking at like 15 17 of companies are letting people go there so a very good job market right now for people that are looking for deaths so so here you see the form which i've already mentioned a few times this allows candidates to share their cv as an ms versus the sponsors and the past sponsors which are then and i'm prior listing and the the overall thought of this first page of the form is to create a light profile was you know has certain things like the relocation remote things where the candidators from the c plus skills the field of work where you you know have gathered your experiences and the years of experience in total and as every candidate that uses this form gives us a little bit of data and if we aggregate that we get to have some interesting graphs so if we look at that this is the data from last year last year we had 200 56 candidates and from 57 countries i want to say that we always like don't don't over some companies see this graph and think like whoa whoa only one candidate from denmark but yeah we also didn't have any kind of i think i know companies from denmark so it's always a chicken neck problem most of the companies which we have for right now are european companies which are coming to the fair and the audience is at the moment and we're going to see that in this presentation mostly from asia and europe so the job fair in this year and march 36 countries again industry and then we have germany united states some asian countries some wild mix of european countries with various candidates and some candidates from the rest of the world more or less this is the skilled graph for last year and the top five is c plus 11 c plus plus 14 linux c plus plus 17 and object orientation here let's look at the graph for i know right right so yeah we had 250 candidates last you know 256 so 50 is 20 then 100 is 40 60 is 150 so we see the top six are actually 60 can 60 of the candidates and all this and 80 is only c plus plus 11 and i assume that cpfs 11 is more is probably oh close to 100 by in the candidate field but there's some candidates which do not choose c plus 11 because they are already on supervisor and 14 and 20 you know so this is the data now for march with linux being like you know slightly in their leaders like 80 is like right we have the every number here is a percent so over 80 percent is linux and c plus 11. and then at 70 percent is 14 and 17 and c make almost is 70 and then we get you know it gets less and less and less and yeah the last of the really influencing things which like 30 percent have as c plus plus 20 and then we see everything below that is under 20 which is understandable that's just new technologies and old things which are not so much which also candidates for you know more candidates would have ex experience with mfc but they probably don't you know are interested in a position they're not looking for an mfc position so they're not having that in in this form so much so here we look now at the regions and this is for the first event of this year 35 candidates from asia and this is part of the candidate profile again you know so this time we have c plus plus 11 linux c plus plus 98 14 17. in the top five and followed by you know object orientation etc so asia and north america is one of the sources for c plus 98 which was one of the things which stood out to me that so many people actually choose c plus plus 98 in the in the first job fair this year and then we look at the overall from last year and this year and we see that the top five is pretty much what we've seen in other data it's c plus 11 14 linux object orientation and 17 followed by windows 98 modern c plus plus and cnac will see if we go to europe cmake actually becomes more and more popular or important to candidates and candidates you know identify with that linux c makes 11 14 and c plus 17 are the top five here in europe those 40 candidates for the last event again if you look at the aggregate for the last here and this year it changes to superfast 11 linux 14 cmake and modern c plus plus being and the top five this yeah z plus 17 probably also gaining over time so we'll see how this matches out over time but this is like you know with syrup you see that cute is more popular and then next is north america you'll see cute it's not as popular as boost as it is here in this graph so north america we only had 11 candidates which is actually good and so this is where we 've failed to have a statistically relevant graph i do want to mention that okay it was just 11 candidates if you had 20 candidates as graph would look totally different again the the things we've seen as popular is already like in the top five c plus 11 more than c plus plus c make c plus plus 14 17 object orientation unit testing and linux the unit testing probably you know will fall behind and other things will become more popular but it also depends like you know which candidates do we attract from north america from which from which region if you take the aggregate you know that's yeah that's actually it for you that's a great for north america we see like 43 candidates from last year and this year came from north america c plus 11 linux 17 modern c plus person 14 and object orientation are the top five what i find interesting is that in this graph now c plus plus 17 is ahead of 14. and the other regions that's the other way around and as i already mentioned cute is not as popular as boost and there's you know a lot of minor things going on c makers also here in in the in the big group in the middle when we have fields of work last year we always have desktop and embedded that's like the most popular ones where people naturally when they work with c plus plus had you know to to deal with so they are always in the first two places for now and then we head to the communication server and finance and for the first event and this year we had again yeah the top two is clear then automotive server other finance and science but there's another change in here which i found interesting which i noticed if you look at ai here last year we had yeah it's 21 maybe 22 candidates for ai right a bit more probably an aerospace should be 21. so that's why 20 maybe 25. probably not 23. that doesn't matter if you look at the graph from the first event this year people that you know have experience with ai suddenly jumped to 20. which is less than last year right but this is the first event so we have three more events to go so ai is really doing a jump in here and going more into the smithfield and you know maybe that's part of the hype i will see but i find it interesting to see that this field is actually catching up the thing i cannot say is like is that something that employers are looking for i don't think we hadn't i a company or a company that is really looking for that on the last job fair so that's not the explanation for that and then we always have years of experience which as i like to say you know it's one of the third was more than 10 years and about one a third with up to five years experience and then one third between that that seems to be the rule so we have people it was 25 years more experience and it kind of stays true the biggest bar here is also from last year there has been like one year experience of people joining or wanting to join the industry coming in that's also yeah again and this year naturally there and that is all the data from the cv sharing form i'm looking at some other ways to do that and previous meeting embedded gonna look at the skills of the folks hitting embedded and comparing it to other things but that's probably the next presentation or something so again this creates a light candidate profile and the companies actually can filter on this okay the company is like we are using heavily boost and if candidate doesn't know boost doesn't assign boost without interest at all or cute or they're like saying well modern c plus is a master or code bases written in c plus 17 so the candidates we want to to to interview should have c plus plus 17. then they can you know make a combination of those things and say like you know we choose five things which are important to us as a candidate can match to and we want to have at least two of those covered that would be for example a good experience for them to filter on that and find candidates it also depends like how many open positions what they're looking for large companies hiring for whole teams you know they have like 20 teams and 10 10 positions and then there's a small company which hires for one position there's a big difference and i kind of have to accommodate both for the candidate the next steps are to upload the resume of course to select the companies so something i want to stress on here the companies do not get your data by default you have to choose that okay so your choice candidates choice not the company's choice to contact you they get the data only if you wanted to share the data with them and some people then also add a general cover letter which is optional but of course always nice to do that and from the candidate perspective this is how this looks i will mention the 100 candy dates which we had in the last event and prior to that we were like around 60 candidates with each event and the two events you actually see which are below 60 by a bit these are the may and june events from last year where you know this respect to back and probably you know would be one point was one event around 60. and i do want to stress again like the attending companies also clearly influence the audience which is coming and it's just using this form right if we have an automotive company then there will be more automotive so if we have an ia company and we will have more ai and if we have like you know a financial company we'll have people from the financial world so this event if you if you'd like to you know be part as an employer there are sponsor tables which were as a sponsoring as part of the sponsoring will give you all of the things i've seen showed you and will show you you're listed in the cv sharing form website and up section with your logo and link there will be an introduction on the live stream access to the recruiting tooling this enables of course the advertising can tell come people that you're coming and drives and guides the tooling for me and the three tables are only for the events so the cv sharing form is off limit for you you've listed below the sponsor tables of course and it's kind of you know get a feel for the event and it's for that i have to limit it to two visits and you get a smaller table quickly also explaining what a table is a table is a video room with eight four or two seats everyone is able to join by clicking on a seat wants to folks at a meeting starts and meetings have their own view are limited to one hour by hobilo and you rejoin your table at the end when you know you have to do that manually which i think is yeah is it the backgrounds in the future i'm torn with this so below gives you this meeting which is going for an hour and then they simply don't warn you they just kick you out of the table of course the meeting is over it's kind of yeah but on on the pro side for the companies on the recruiter view it you know freezer table for new candidates and some companies really have like the table full for three hours so they they're happy if they you know can talk to other candidates and not every candidate like you know closes the connection or automatically leaves your table so that frees your table again from people taking up space as in the system there's like you know no unlimited way to join tables quick view on the recruiting tooling from the employer side yes you get the graphs i showed you for the candidates that have submitted to you you see below us's pay-per-view where you also can sort after country name and date and time to find candidates again and this you know these graphs also help you if you have to present on the results of the the fair to show like you know what what was the general knowledge of the candidates and where did they come from etc there's a search form which is necessary now we have over 100 candidates or 100 candidates submitting and soon probably more than that so a company can expect like 50 60 70 or maybe a hundred submissions and if you have multiple positions you might you know want to look for the steam users boost you look for boost or still users cute you look for cute you're using pc plus 20 already yeah yeah better filter the candidates for that or maybe for 17 so that they are like you know learning in your team then or you're using a package manager things like that you know or you have like an embedded position and the other position is like image processing that helps with searching their your candidate pool and then to be you know to get an overview on the candidates you want to contact again and that is the job fair it's a long time project because i think that with employer support we can make this work for employers please sign up early it helps me with the advertising of the event i cannot and advertise an empty event you know come to my job fair and there's no employers coming that's not so good so sign up early is always helpful if you return into the event or if you want to go and so tell your hr to you know to do that early if you can forward that today that would be helpful also it's a long time project because you know from the developers i reach right now for this event probably like from 100 level developers it's useful for five or ten but the other 90 happen to know about the event and maybe in a year or two they are in the position to know about this or maybe the later in the year or so right now are able to help someone else so i know from someone from the team that you know lost downstairs and let me quickly look into the chat again i see there's a question so milad asks find remote job for c plus plus is harder than other languages are you agree i i don't know i don't i'm not able to compare that i i have no remote working experience across multiple languages and so i see that remote positions have become much more common and the world but i also see like right now we had this today is a remote position in india but you can work from anywhere in india so it's remote in india which i find interesting and there's a lot of people which of course look for remote work from india and other parts of the world and there's the on the other component of course that people are looking for folks that can only partly work remote but yeah it's a question which i find interesting if you have experience on that please you know put it in the chat but i it's like i i don't know a lot about the company's site like in hiring the feedback from the companies is there sometimes but it's not a lot okay and i see there's more people joining from all around the world someone new from malaysia hello malaysia that's awesome to see let's continue with the presentation then again so if you're looking for a job right now this form has eight companies which are king imagely lada davinci quasar ambition to look and native instruments these are listed in the form and if you use a form then these are the companies which you can reach out to and just to to give you an overview like you know how does this work simulation form goes to the employers and actually like when you chose the company's i you know look at your submission and some people submit twice or something then i only send one of them but the next step basically is then that your cv is getting emailed per attachment to those employers and then they can choose to answer that email to you that is the how it works today this is a model which is used by most companies but also internally of course this creates an application state at meeting c plus plus which also can you know be altered through the filtered search and currently i do not have like a view on the state for you as a candidate because most companies are just using their own processors and they don't integrate the tooling which i have they may or may not look at that and you know use the graphs maybe for the presentations but right now it does not make sense to have like an a candidate view on your submissions because most companies either will contact you directly or you know that you didn't hear from them then that's gonna be also you know clear why they're not talking to you because i probably found someone else so they're not interested some companies actually talk to everyone and that's nice not all of the companies do this and the submission form creates a light profile of skills field of work region which is continence and the years of experience and companies may filter or search on these if they want to and we as a community get out of the better hiring an easier way to connect to the community for employers so that we can include them but also you know to have less headhunters which need to be hired because companies can't find deaths actually c plus plus deaths which we want to be hired out there and so trying to connect those people and of course yeah my work is you know funded through this which is also nice it's still a win-win situation for the company because the money i take is compared really small cash to what you spend on hiring in bigger companies so being on this platform really really helps you to actually reduce your budget for hiring and as a platform you know that's what i'm working on me superfast as a platform and network for c plus plus and that's it i'm looking for employers to join the next job fair and also want to say thanks to the companies which have joined that already and who join in the past who have supported that who brought us to the point which we are today at that this is a thing and has been for the last two years it's really great and quick reminder eight companies are currently listed at cv upload.meetingcity.com you can go and find your you know fill out the form and then see which of those companies are currently hiring and are interested in you and with that thanks for listening next job fair is may 9th and 10th you can reach out to me via email or anything if you have any questions put them in the chat i'll be answering them in a second and if you want to have more information on the job fair it's available under job fair dot meeting cpu.com and i'll be looking in the chat now i see a comment from simon trough on the remote question we had earlier yeah so that's probably also another thing a remote outside of that primary region is legally complicated for companies that does that is true there's a lot of things time zones legal things and yeah but if you have any questions on the event if you're hiring will there be a breakout room like on who below the event is hosted on hobby lobby so the drop fair will be hosted on hubilo in the launch so this is the kicking officer live streamer then we will be using the launch so yeah yes thank you for for coming everyone if there are more questions about the event or about hiring which we can debate i'm happy to you know have this discussion with you now and a reminder you know next the next c plus online job fair will be on may 9th and 10th and i see someone that's agreeing with someone yeah so if you have any more questions and of course you know you can connect with me later or post some post your questions in the in the comments later i will be putting this also on youtube later so think we're coming to the end here 45 minutes on hiring i think is enough for everyone so thank you for coming i will be ending the stream now what's better once again to speak about this and to see such a worldwide audience that's really nice so see you at the job fair and let me see process online and other places thank you for coming
