hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about five reasons why i think the tesla model x p 100 d is the best luxury suv now not that long ago i hadn't driven any of the tesla's then thanks to a maze i got to try out the tesla model s p 100 d then i ended up buying a tesla model 3 performance and now today thanks to a maze once again for sponsoring this video i am inside of the one that i have not driven the model x p 100 d now i'll get more into the o maze campaign later on in the video but know that they are giving away a model x p 100 d there's a link in the video description oh maze calm / win a tesla if you'd like to check that out now before we get started we need to be able to put ourselves in the shoes of a luxury car buyer so if you're a car enthusiast you like rear-wheel drive manual transmission you know coupes that's wonderful they are great cars and i'm with you however we need to put ourselves in the buyer of a luxury suv if we're going to talk about what is the best luxury suv and i think there's a distinction between a subjectively good luxury suv and an objectively good luxury suv subjective being if you're sitting in the back seat and you want great materials real nice feeling something that emotionally makes you calm relaxed happy all those things and you're sitting in the back seat perhaps a mercedes s-class or you know a rolls-royce is the way to go but if you are sitting in the driver's seat and you want a luxury suv this tesla model x objectively has so many qualities about it that make it a nice luxury vehicle so starting with number one the electric motors and of course we're going to start with the obvious one electric motors this thing has two motors one in the front one in the back all-wheel drive and that is able to accelerate this vehicle tesla just for at least a new update from 2.9 seconds down to 2.8 seconds 0 to 60 time in a 50 500 pound suv absolutely absurd when you put your foot down how much torque this thing can put down so why are electric motors luxurious and so first let's talk about internal combustion engines with luxury vehicles the engineers are trying to get that engine to be very quiet very smooth they want effortless acceleration they don't want it to require anything on the drivers part so you want a quiet interior vibration-free with effortless acceleration and so with an internal combustion engine that's challenging because internal combustion engines are loud they vibrate and so it requires a lot of engineering in order to make them quiet and smooth versus electric motors which are really well balanced so it's rotational mass rather than reciprocating mass like in an engine they're very quiet and there's no shifting there's no transmission in this vehicle it's a single speed and so you don't have you know that roughness of a transmission now i don't think today's transmissions are all that rough but from a luxury standpoint what you're trying to do is take out all of that feeling of the transmission remove all of it and you do that with an electric car because there is no shifting gear so acceleration is always perfectly smooth it's quiet and because it's electric you get instant torque the second you put your foot down you don't wait for shifting or turbo lag or any of those things you get all of it immediately it's one of the really beautiful things about driving an electric car is that what you're doing with your right foot however far it is on that accelerator pedal is exactly what you get in torque and that is a really special thing and it is quite luxurious now before we get into the other four qualities i want to talk about this omae's campaign they are giving away a tesla model x p 100 d so if you make a small donation you are entered to win and you have a chance of winning not only a tesla model x p 100 d but they are including taxes there including shipping and there including $20,000 cash and all donations are going to help support girls who code which is an awesome organization it's developed to help young female students improve their skills in coding learn about coding and prepare them for futures within the world of tech so a cool organization i personally have no idea how to code i did take a fortran class when i was in college but fortran is as irrelevant as me telling you that i learned fortran my wife actually does a bit of coding anyways there is a link in the video description omae's comm slash when a tesla on a small donation for good cause and you have a chance of winning tesla model x p 100 d and $20,000 cash number two y this is a wonderful luxury vehicle and very fitting that there's a large heavy vehicle in front of us is weight and usually i would say weight is a terrible thing because for acceleration for braking for cornering you don't want weight and yet somehow this 5,500 pound vehicle is able to accelerate to 60 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds but the benefit of weight and there's one benefit and i think it works in the world of luxury cars and that is ride comfort because there are certain qualities about having a very heavy vehicle that enable it to have a very good ride quality and you certainly notice that in this very heavy tesla model x now why is that well there's a lot of reasons but for example one example is the fact that you have a very high sprung two unsprung weight ratio meaning the car itself is very heavy the unsprung mass while heavy in comparison to how much sprung master is the vehicle itself versus thinking the unsprung mass being those wheels and tires and some of the suspension because that ratio is so off any little impact on that wheel plays less of a role than if the car were lighter so think about if you had a 2,000 pound car and a hundred pound wheel so that wheel hitting a bump and then sending that hundred pound force up is going to have a much greater effect on that light weight car than it will on this very heavy core the ratio of that weight is so much closer other than as with this vehicle and so you notice all the little bumps more with lighter vehicles because that unsprung mass has a greater effect on the sprung mass itself additionally you're able to tune the suspension differently with a very heavy vehicle as a result of what your payload is going to be and so if you think about you know five people inside of a 3,000 pound car that's a significant increase in the payload on that vehicle percentage-wise if you had five people to this 5,500 pound tesla it's not as big of an impact payload wise and so your suspension tuning you of course want to be able to accommodate the entire range of weight that a car will see and that range is relatively more narrow on a heavy core and so it enables you to dial in that suspension to a much more specific range rather than saying okay we also have to accommodate when the car is fully loaded and in that case with a lightweight core it's probably going to be a bit under damped versus when there's just one person in it in which case it'll probably be a bit over damped a little stiff and so you have that range that you have to accommodate for and with a heavier vehicle you can tune it for a more narrow range and you're also able to have a slightly lower cg from the beginning because you don't have to worry about what is this payload how much is this payload going to compress down the vehicle it'll compress it down less in a vehicle that weighs more than a vehicle that weighs less now number three also fitting that i am behind this truck here spewing out these exhaust fumes and i'm also in the city of los angeles a little bit outside of it so some nice beautiful scenic roads here but number three being that it has a hepa air filtration system and so tesla claims the air inside of this vehicle is the cleanest air inside of any car and clean air of course is a luxury especially if you're in a city like los angeles it also has what they call a bio weapon defense mode and so it uses that filtration system pulls in air and creates a positive pressure on the vehicle itself so you don't have random air seeping in from the different sides from different panels and all that instead you are slowly leaking out positive pressure air and you're taking in air through that filtration system and so that enables you to prevent whatever is on the outside to just seep into the car without going through that filtration system by keeping that positive pressure within the cabin now number four is safety and tesla claims this is the safest suv sold so it has five-star crash test rating very low probability of rolling over thanks to having the battery beneath the car so an extremely low center of gravity and as a result this greatly decreases the probability that the vehicle would roll and so you know what greater luxury then being safe than to decrease the probability of getting injured simply by paying more money so certainly a luxury feature pay to reduce the likelihood that you get injured in the event that you are in a collision and you know many aspects of course safety can be built in to you know a low cost vehicle obviously all manufacturers try their best to do it but if you have more flexibility and money and you know creating that overall structure just based on how much the you can charge the customer ultimately then you can put in things to make that car extremely safe and this is a great example of that having that a very expensive very large battery actually can't help with site impacts you know front impacts it's a part of the structure overall and so while it is extremely pricey to have a hundred kilowatt hour battery pack it can help the safety quite a bit and of course as i mentioned helps to keep that center of gravity low now speaking of the battery that is number five so what greater luxury then to have a full tank every single morning you get up so you plug it in at night every morning you've got two hundred eighty nine miles of range and i'm sure many of you will say but wait a minute you can't go on a long road trip and yes it takes 30 minutes to get 170 miles of range with a tesla supercharger so not ideal versus a gasoline car for road trips but once again put yourself in the shoes of a luxury suv buyer so perhaps it's you know some businessperson taking clients out to lunch it's the executive who's driving from their house to working back in every single morning every single morning they have two hundred and eighty nine miles of range that they can drive that day you know that's five or six hours of driving that's far more than most people will ever drive in a day so it is a luxury to always have a full tank to never have to visit gas stations i mean i think we can all agree that touching gas pumps is gross diesel pumps touching them is gross so if you can avoid doing something gross that would be a luxury so having an electric car not having to touch gasoline pumps like the rest of us commoners that do that that is a luxury so it's a luxury to have a full charge every morning quite cool feature to have that you don't have to visit gas stations and you've always got that full charge so once again a huge thank you to omae's for sponsoring this video and allowing me the opportunity to drive this tesla model x p 100 ii it is just crazy fast something that weighs 5500 pounds and the amount of acceleration then it has when you put your foot down is just wild and you can win a model xp energy there's a link in the video description oh maze calm slash when a tesla texas included shipping included twenty thousand dollars included all with a small donation for a great cause so thank you all so much for watching and if you have any
