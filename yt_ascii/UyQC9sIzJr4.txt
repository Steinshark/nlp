hello everyone and welcome this is not a smart thing to do while driving you should keep both hands on the wheel this is not even my car in fact i sold it a year ago to a good friend of mine well i thought he was a good friend but now he's flipping my car for profit and this video is sponsored by cars and bids an awesome car auction website created by none other than doug demuro hence why i keep saying this now we'll get more into cars and bids later on in the video but this car is for sale right now on cars and bids you can check out the auction in the link in my video description and so let's get into it about this car first off i truly believe that at some point in your life especially if you're a car enthusiast you need to own a miata it is just such an extraordinary vehicle and it proves three really interesting points about cars that you may not otherwise learn if you don't get the experience of driving one now i have been very fortunate and that i have gotten to drive all kinds of different cars out there and because of this i frequently get the question like what's the most fun car you've ever driven or what are the top three cars you've ever driven and no matter what what always comes to mind there's three cars that always come top of mind when i get this question shelby gt350 which is an absolute riot the jaguar f-type svr which is also an absolute riot and this the nd mazda miata just an exceptional driver's car and yet very unlike those other two vehicles i mentioned so three interesting points here first of all if i'm ranking this amongst the great it means power is not everything you don't have to have a ton of horsepower in order for a vehicle to be fun and you know the svr over 500 horsepower the gt350 well over 500 horsepower this stock less than 200 horsepower now yes horsepower is part of the fun hence i supercharged this thing and it makes more power more power is good i do believe that but it is not the most critical it is not the only piece of the pie there's a lot of different elements that can make a car fun to drive and the fact that something like this is so enjoyable while not having that much power means that it's not that critical of an element there are other elements that also play a really big role and how much fun a car is to drive okay number two again looking at the different pieces of the pie sound is not everything the gt350 has a flat plane crank v8 that just screams past 8 000 rpm and it's incredible it is a joy to drive just listening to it the f-type svr was one of the original cars that's just constantly throwing out crackles and pops and barks it sounds so violent when you're driving it you can't help but smile and laugh and this this does nothing for your ears i mean it's like i guess there's an engine i guess you can kind of hear it but it doesn't sound good like it just it sounds like all right it's a four-cylinder engine the end there's nothing thrilling about the sound of miata and yet those two big elements power and sound it doesn't have and i still love driving this thing and that to me you know it makes me optimistic about an electric future because electric cars don't have that sound and a lot of enthusiasts think okay well there's no way they're going to be nearly as fun but if something like this exists which is this raw really enjoyable driving experience and it doesn't have that sound why can't an ev be fun to drive you know and so i think the big challenge for evs really is their weight and that seems like a solvable problem that we can bring the weights down and if we create small lightweight evs there can really be some true driving joy to be found in that segment which leads us to point number 3 and that is modern cars can be lightweight i feel like we are fed two very deceitful statements very frequently by most auto manufacturers the first one being modern cars just have to be heavy because of modern safety standards we're packing it with all this safety gear we're packing it with all this modern technology and that stuff has weight well hello here we are this is a 2016 you know 26 years after the original miata and it's weighing only'2 pounds more and it weighs 150 pounds less than the previous generation and see miata so it can be done you can create a modern lightweight car there are just very few examples and this is probably the best executed example that is sold in america the second deceitful thing that companies do is they say like oh we've got this lightweight package you can put a carbon fiber roof panel on it'll save you three pounds and it costs five thousand dollars and it's like okay great i can save three pounds i spend five grand on a car that already weighs four thousand pounds it's like what is the point i was just looking at a review of a three-door mini cooper on car and driver and the thing weighed 3 000 pounds it's like how does a mini cooper a small three-door mini cooper weigh 3 000 pounds this is just over 2300 pounds stock that is a beautiful thing it's like 500 pounds less than its next competitor you know like maybe the brz family i think a small part of the challenge is that modern tires are really good and modern tires can really hide how much new cars weigh and i love tires and i respect them for doing that but i really do think if more people took the time and gave these cars a chance send one of these things that otherwise wouldn't buy one of these cars you would be so pleasantly surprised at how much of a difference taking out weight provides to the driving experience and how much joy it can provide a car that doesn't sound like anything really a car that doesn't have that much power and yet it's so much fun to drive because it is so lightweight there are very few cars on the road in america that weigh less than this and those that do are not sports cars so i mentioned companies you know offering these silly gimmicky oh we took out weight from our car and now it only weighs 3 800 pounds it's like okay whatever mazda actually did real work this thing doesn't weigh that much and they took real weight out of it they took weight out from the ac system these seats they're kind of like hammocks they kind of have like a net that you can lean back into it's really comfortable it helps you sit a little bit lower which is good for tall drivers it's a well-engineered solution that also pulls out weight from them they've got a wider trunk opening that means less material they've used more high tensile strength steel use a stronger material you can use less of it they've got aluminum body panels all over the place so they put in real effort clever engineering solutions all over this vehicle looked everywhere there you have have weight and tried to minimize it and as a result again you know with a small car small car is certainly an important part of it you're able to create something that doesn't weigh an atrocious amount and i just really believe that if more people got into vehicles like this experienced it felt how nice it is to drive we would have more competitive options in segments like this because of how much of a joy lightweight can provide everything gets better braking acceleration cornering everything gets better now another fun element of this car is simply the visibility you put the top down which yeah i haven't done it's hot outside hey it's 2023 but also you know i wanted the audio to be decent so we've got the top up and i think you know having that top down being able to see everywhere around you it feels more open you're kind of out in the world it makes you happier i also think we just have less road rage if we've all got our top nails we can all actually see each other it's like hey my bad you know no worries it's not this like big giant suv everything's tinted out you can't see anything and you just get super angry when someone cuts you off it's like there's a level of communication here there's a happiness you're out here it's like oh this is great so that is a touch that convertibles have and it's just this combination of lightweight convertible manual transmission rear-wheel drive two-seater it's just this really incredible formula that is just so enjoyable to drive all right well if this car is so great why did i sell it okay before we get on to why i sold it let's take a moment to chat cars and bids and this is an awesome website whether you're buying or selling your car it's a car auction site for modern car enthusiasts anything from the 1980s to today and scrolling through the listings it's very obvious this is geared towards enthusiasts with all the cars you'll see and worth pointing out there are several things i think cars and bids does extremely well they make selling easy they make bidding easy they make financing easy critically they make shipping easy and they do a really good job of disclosing the condition of the vehicles even making inspections easy buying and selling cars is fairly complicated but were i to design a car bidding website and look this is meant as a compliment i have no aspirations true for many aspects of my life i would want it so that you could set up financing and shipping directly through the site which you can do for sellers that want to put fires mines at ease they have an inspection process and it's super detailed but even if that's not included there's a section dedicated to known flaws so you know what you're getting into it's an awesome site so obviously you should go on there and buy this car but shop around while you're on there or list your own cars okay so why did i sell it well three reasons come to mind the first one being and i've said this before but i really don't get attached to my cars and that's not a reason to get rid of it but it just means that i have no desire to hold on to them long term i build no connection to this thing whatsoever it's just an object that happens to be in my life at some point and then it's gone at some point so because of that you know it's like it's easy for me to let go of it the second reason being and this is probably the main reason is that i just wasn't driving it that much and the big reason for that is kind of two elements one i get to drive a lot of different press cars and so i spend time in them and that's fantastic and very lucky on my end and great the other is i have this like mechanical empathy where i don't want to take this car on short trips so i have an electric car i have a crosstrek and i have this and the thing was if i was going on a really short trip you know only a few miles five miles or less or whatever and just take the electric car because this thing would never get up to temperature and it's really not great to romp on it if you're not at operating temperature so i thought okay i'll you know i'll just take the test i'll drive these short distances in the eb hope i'm going long distances if i'm going on a trip or something i'd always take the crosstrek it's very practical you can fit everything do everything so it was only like if there was a medium trip that i needed to make i take the miata but that was just pretty rare and so i didn't put many miles on it it's like i don't really need this thing right and then the third reason being is that i was really done with it as a project so i got it exactly where i wanted to be i think a stock miata is perfectly fine exactly the way it is i did not change the suspension i didn't change the wheels i didn't change the brakes i think they nailed all of that do i think power is good yes so i gave it a supercharger it has more power and i did a few aesthetic mods of course including the yellow rot which i think makes it look really fun but i got this car exactly where i think it is perfect so as a result i didn't want to make any additional changes on it and because of that it's like well i don't really even need it for the channel either like i bought it because i love miatas but then i wasn't driving it and i wasn't really making content with it so it's like i don't really need this thing anymore okay so a very quick run through of all the mods and the costs if you were to buy all the mods and have them professionally installed basically the total amount to recreate what we have here of course it all starts with the edelbrock supercharger kit which i absolutely love this uses the same eaton blower that you'll find on the shelby gt500 it's just you know a little smaller here that's paired with a fab nine tune an awesome shop if you're ever in the detroit area with your miata the car was originally black covered in avery denison dark yellow wrap and on top of that is expel's ultimate plus 10 paint protective film and again huge fan i have these ppfs on all my cars and they hold up really well over the years then there's some smaller stuff like black chrome emblems stubby antenna aluminum pedals and this is all on the mx-5 club with the brembo and bbs package of course the spec to buy because it comes with limited slip diff so recreating this car as it sits with professional installation would likely run around forty thousand dollars but i've also signed my ee logo in an inconspicuous location within the engine bay and can you really put a price on an illustrious youtuber's signed ride i say yes about a dollar for the sharpie no it probably goes without saying but since i'm mildly recognizable on the internet sponsors help me out with most of these parts and the installation of the supercharger was done by myself and charles from humble mechanic charles is a pro i'm more at peace with whiteboards i'm sure at some point i will replace this with something exciting but at the time i just thought i'm done with this as a project i'm ready to move on now just quickly here on closing out i want to give some props to doug demiro and not because you know hey this is sponsored by cars and bids you can make up your own mind on that if that's what you think this is really about but i really do respect what doug did because you know he was already in a very successful place right he didn't need to create cars and bids and yet he did this very public business where it could just as easily go south right like it could have been a total flop right from the beginning but he went for it he got a good team in place he created this thing and it worked and that is just so inspiring to see because you know think of the opposite happening if it didn't go well it's like look super successful youtuber can't even create another successful business and i'm sure he had that fear initially of like if i do this and it goes bust like i may look dumb about what i did but he tried it and even if it hadn't failed it would have been very respectable that he did so it's very impressive not only that he created in the first place but also that it has worked out so well it is a genuinely really cool website it's fun to browse through there's all kinds of cool cars on it i highly recommend checking it out and again if you'd like to buy this car it's listed on there right now you can check out the link in the video description thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below now what i'm gonna do is turn these cameras off put them away put the top down and enjoy one last ride in this miata
