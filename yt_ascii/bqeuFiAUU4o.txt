if you have a democratic style of governance you are interesting people with one of the most awesome and radical of responsibilities and that's saying that you're going to pick the people that are going to make some of the hardest decisions in all of human history if you're going to trust people to vote correctly you have to be able to trust them to have open and honest dialogue with each other whether that's nazis or kkk people or whoever talking you have to believe that your people are going to be able to rise above and make the correct determinations when they hear these types of speeches and if you're so worried that somebody's going to hear a certain political figure and they're going to be completely radicalized instantly then what that tells me is that you don't have enough faith in humans for democracy to be a viable institution which is fine you can be anti-democratic but you i don't think you can be pro-democracy and anti-free speech the following is a conversation with stephen bonnell also known online as destiny he's a video game streamer and political commentator one of the early pioneers of both live streaming in general and live streamed political debate and discourse politically he is a progressive identifying is either left or far left depending on your perspective there are many reasons i wanted to talk to stephen first i just talked to ben shapiro and many people have told me that stephen is the ben shapiro of the left in terms of political perspective and exceptional debate skills second reason is he skillfully defends some nuanced non-standard views at the same time being pro-establishment pro institutions and pro-biden while also being pro-capitalism and pro-free speech third reason is he has been there at the beginning and throughout the meteoric rise of the video game live streaming community in some mainstream circles this community is not taken seriously perhaps because of its demographic distribution skewing young or perhaps because of the sometimes hard style of communication but i think this community should be taken seriously and shown respect millions of young minds tune into live streams like destinies to question and to try to understand what is going on with the world often exploring challenging even controversial ideas the language is sometimes harsher and the humor sometimes meaner than i would prefer but i grandpa lex put on my rain boots and went into the beautiful chaotic muck of online discourse and have so far survived to tell the tale with a smile and even more love in my heart than before on top of all this we were lucky to have molina goranson a popular streamer and world traveler join us at the end of the conversation you can check out her channel on twitch.tv molina and you can check out steven's channel on youtube.com destiny this is the lex freedom podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's destiny i don't know if you watched me watching your yay interview yeah thank you so much i'm so curious when you're navigating a conversation like that are you how intentional is the thought process between like building rapport and pushing and and giving a little like zero zero attention i was watching and thank you so much i was very kind for you to review that conversation it meant a lot that you were complimenting parts on the technical aspects of the conversation but no zero and i'm actually deliberately trying to avoid i think you've called it debate brain which is just another flavor of thinking about like the meta conversation trying to optimize how should this conversation go because i feel like the more you do that the better you get at that the less human connection you have like the less genuinely you're actually sitting there in the moment and listening to the person you're more like calculating what's the right thing to say versus like feeling what is what is that person feeling right now what are they thinking that's what i'm trying to do is like putting myself in their mind and thinking what does the world look like to them what does the world feel like to them and so from that i truly try to listen now i'm also learning especially because rogan and others have been giving me shit for not pushing back it's good sometimes to say from a place of care for the other human being to say stop what did you just say i don't think that's represents who you are and what you really mean or maybe if it does at that time represents who they are i could see a better a better world if they grow into a different direction and try to point that direction out to them it was a really complicated dance between letting somebody share their full story versus letting somebody like essentially i guess like proselytize your audience and it's like okay hold on let's take a minute here but yeah i used to be four or five years ago it was attack attack attack attack attack whatever you said and now i'm leaning way more towards though like okay well tell me how you feel about everything and then we'll go from there so a lot of people like my new approach some older fans will watch and they're like why are you letting this guy just ramble on you know he said like five or six wrong things and you're only gonna call them out on two of them and it's like it's different styles of conversation but you know do you do a lot of research beforehand too depending on the conversation yeah so if we're going to talk like vaccines and stuff yeah that's a ton of reading and stuff that i never thought i'd know going into it if it's a more personal like political philosophy conversation there's not as much you can prepare for just it truly depends on the conversation how much are you actually listening to the other person i'm always listening you have to listen because as soon as you stop listening the quality of everything falls apart the connection disappears the call the conversation disappears but my natural inclination is to just be way more aggressive than normal so i have to constantly remind myself i guess you would call it a meta conversation when you're like okay he's probably saying this because of that or we'll let him go here and then we'll stop later but yeah because my my preferred style of conversation is like i'm gonna talk and the second i say something you disagree with then let's iron it out right like like i think in like syllogisms like okay here's the premise a be good okay premise b okay and then conclusion and then as long as we're both deductively sound we're not crazy no psychosis then we're gonna agree on everything whereas other people like to most people think in stories like narratives like a whole there's a whole like narrative in the individual facts don't matter as much because they'll pick and choose what they want and it's really hard because everybody thinks negative so i have to function in that world but it's frustrating for me sometimes well i've seen you've had a lot of excellent debates one of them i just recently last night watched is a on systemic racism and it's the first time i've seen you completely lose your shit oh shoot who was that against i'm not sure exactly but you were just very frustrated and sorry not lose your shit but you were frustrated constantly because of the thing let's lay out one two three and every time you try to lay it out it would falter i think it had to do with sort of can you use data to make an argument or do you need to use a study that does an interpretation of that data and then there's like this tension between i think this is a behavioral economist that you were talking to and the point is you do this kind of nice layout that the whole point of behavioral economics is says there's more to it than just the data you have to give the context and like do the rich rigorous interpretation in the context of the full human story and then there was like a dance back and forth sometimes use data sometimes not and you're getting really frustrated and shutting down and so that felt like a failure mode i've seen sam harris have similar sticking points like if we can't agree on the terminology we can't go on to me i feel like i'm just sort of the the winkenstein perspective is like i think if you get stuck on any one thing you're just not going to make progress you have to part of the conversation has to be about doing a good dance together versus being dogmatically stuck on the path to truth i think the true challenge is identifying what of those sticking points are important versus what is not important it's like if i'm having an argument with somebody about like jewish representation and media they might it might be like a big conversation and they might say a couple things like i think jewish people you know they tend to help their own or whatever they're saying okay but like for the purpose of the conversation we can keep moving but if they casually drop like you know yeah and i think that's why the holocaust numbers are blown up from like a hundred thousand to six million and that's why i was like okay hold on wait if you think this we have to stop here because this is going to be it's not just a language game in this part if you really believe this fact then the whole rest of the conversation is going to be informed by that belief you know and it has to be something that doesn't bother you personally you have to step outside your own ego so holga's denial is somebody that would bother a lot of people and there's some things just just observing you i feel like when you get really good at conversation you can become a stickler to you might have your favorite terms that really bothers you people don't agree on those terms begs the question you mean raising the question yeah i usually just want if people say stuff i just let it slide yeah you can't because if you fight when you're having a conversation with somebody and you're talking to their audience at the same time because that's really what's happening you never want to come off as over combative or over aggressive because it puts people in like there's there's like a trigger in your brain and this is true of relationships and friendships of persuasive rhetoric or whatever there's a trigger in the brain and as soon as that defensive trigger gets like flipped on everything is over you've lost the ability to persuade because everything becomes a fight at that point yeah well i wanted to talk to you because i heard somewhere that you were referred to as the ben shapiro of the left and since i'm talking with ben as well i wanted to sort of complete spiritually this platonic political philosophy puzzle in my head you are a progressive but a progressive with many non-standard progressive views and you had a heck of a fascinating journey through all of that and like i said i think you argue with passion sometimes with excessive amounts of passion but don't really polite way of saying that almost always with good faith and with rigor with seriousness i asked on your subreddit which is an excellent subreddit shout out to the destiny subreddit so much at least for that particular post what i really loved is when i asked for questions for you they were like holy shit there's adults in there let's all behave yeah like nobody say incest i was like what what's what's going on here but actually the the the questions that rose to the top were really good so somebody said that destiny was speaking of your journey was a conservative in his early teens then he became a libertarian then he became a left-wing social justice warrior then he flirted with socialism and now he is a social democrat liberal i've also heard you refer to yourself as a far left person so to the degree there's truth to that journey can you take me through your evolution through the landscape of political ideologies that you went through so my dad comes from kentucky and my mom is a cuban immigrant cubans are notorious for being very conservative in the united states for historical reasons and for other reasons but my upbringing was a very republican one i grew up listening to rush limbaugh glenn beck michael savage on the radio billy cunningham i think sean hannity a little bit later on like that was like my whole upbringing politically i remember i was writing i'd written like articles for the school journal like in favor of defending the war in iraq and you know defending bush from all the criticism et cetera so that was my upbringing i think once i hit high school college i had my edgy like libertarian-esque high school phase of like reading iran rand of figuring out that like oh my god nothing in life matters except for class and money that's actually the answer to everything and i got the college i became a ron paul fan very big ron paul fan and then from there i kind of work do life life happens at the kind of the lowest point of my life in terms of where i'm working financially everything is like kind of in ruined in my life there's a whole bunch of dumb stuff that's happened probably my most conservative point i don't know what it is about like being poor and thinking like you can work your way out of it you can do whatever it's just my upbringing is always just like if you're not if you're not if you're not having financial success work work work work and then i got into streaming very very lucky break everything just lined up the right time and then as i've progressed through streaming i would say through the years i've gradually fallen more and more to the left especially once my kid turned four five six years old and i started to see like how much different his life was just because of the financial opportunities that i was able to provide for him through no merit of his own and that started to radically change how i viewed the world in a lot of ways so actually let's like lingo on that yeah low point he worked at mcdonald's you worked at a casino you did carpet cleaning what was the the lowest point definitely the carpet cleaning really absolutely why why was it the lowest point that's when you were just flirting with starting streaming my whole life has been a series of lucky breaks really truly i grew up playing a lot of video games but back in my day our day you had to read there's a lot of text on the screen back in my day we used to play they didn't all talk stuck yeah because nowadays everything's voice acted but back then you would read a lot i was a really good reader and a really good vocabulary yeah where'd you actually say that what games are we talking about what what do you mean just reading you're talking about like rpg yeah jrpg so like final fantasy games fantasy stars like all of these like any rpg that would have been on the snes sega playstation these are the things that i'm pause on that okay i just talked to todd howard who's of the elder scrolls fame and the fallout fame and beyond what's your thoughts on elder scrolls why is skyrim the greatest rpg of all time man and i really don't like skyrim or fallout games oh really no not at all why do you hate skyrim yeah so i really like characters and like compelling stories and narratives around those characters and i like to see them kind of like grow and change kind of like a movie or a story so in your like final fantasy games you've got characters there are a lot of like like classical tropes of like a character starts off kind of like edgy angsty all on their own they develop relationships friendships they realize that the life is more about themselves and they do that and i like that that growth that's kind of what you see in all of those old role-playing games i didn't like the open world ones as much because your main character is just like a blank slate never talks it's for you to like project onto but there's not the same like linear narrative of like growth for the camera that's fascinating there's an actual story arc to the character that's more crafted yeah in a beautiful way by the designers of the game yeah that's another one is better or worse i tend towards like i want to hear a compelling story around like a set of characters that like grow and changes again oh that's beautifully put in yeah i i just really loved being able to leave the town you go outside the town and you look outside its nature and the world of possibilities is before you you can do whatever the fuck you want i mean that immensity of just being lost in the world is really immersive for me but yeah you're right whatever attracts you about a world so you were just starting to play video games you go out play the video games that's one of your lucky breaks there's just like a lot of random skills you pick up depending on the type of game you play i played a lot of text-based games on the computer so i was a very fast typer i'm still a very fast typer read a lot you know learned weird kind of math stuff for some of the calculations some of the games i think i'm pretty good at getting information figuring stuff out learning patterns all of that and then that plus the reading and everything of the games meant that i i don't want to say i excelled in school because my grades were pretty bad but i was in like all honors all ap classes or whatever a lot of dual enrollment a lot of ap credit going into college so i did pretty well in school probably better than i should have but it was because i had the game stuff that was like really powering a lot of my brain there while i was trying to sleep through class so yeah so you're able to soak in information integrate it and be quickly take notes generally i think i'm pretty good at that yeah what you do this a lot when you stream your typing stuff is there a system in that note taking and what note what do you use for note taking doesn't matter i use a notepad notepad the original notepad yep notepad.exe not the plus plus not is there genius to the madness behind that or you just don't give a shit no i mean like it's going to depend on the style of conversation if i'm with somebody that is very meticulously organized their thoughts and they're a find a better word here for rambler you can edit that in better word for rambler yeah something that talks a lot a lot i'll start like taking notes bullet points like this this this this this this because there's a style of conversation where i say seven or eight different things and then when you go to respond to everything i said i cut you off immediately and we argue that point but if somebody's gonna do that he's just like hold on you just said these eight things i'm going to respond to every single one i've written them all down and then you can go if you want to go point by point we can but you just said all this and i wrote it down so we're gonna go so what are you actually writing down like a couple words per point they left honestly like there are very few unique conversations in politics like a lot of them are kind of retreading old ground so for having a debate on abortion somebody might say like oh well i believe this thing about viability and i believe this thing about you know when when there are fetus versus a human and i'll just write down like those points so that when i go to respond i kind of have like like note cards like a guiding thing there to keep me centered on my response political discourse is the kind of tree you're walking down i got it and you're like taking just to keep my focus guided so i'm not like running off on a weird tangent or responding to something i didn't say or something yeah what about like doing research it's just is there a system to your note taking because mentally you seem to be one of the most organized people i've listened to so is there is it in your mind or is there a system that's on paper a little of both i feel like the human mind is a beautiful thing if you have interest in an area so like what i'll tell people is let's say there's like a totally new topic that i'm researching i don't know anything and i'll do a couple of these on stream i think they're born people watch it i might open a wikipedia article and i'll read and i hit something i don't know and then i open the next wikipedia article and i'll read into and then i might have like seven tabs open and i'll read and i'll read and i'll read and i'll read a ton of stuff maybe for hour two three four hours of stuff and then by the end you know someone in chat will ask me like do you even remember like this this particular thing and i'll say not really no not too much but what happens is as long as you've seen it once what will happen is like the next day the day after we'll read something else and we're like oh i remember that thing from this thing i remember like vaguely that and then if you see it like a third time you're like oh this makes sense because especially when it comes to oh here's like a little trick on stuff if you're ever reading any news and there's a place that pops up always look at it on a map because so much of history is like on a map it's so important to like know the geography it makes things make so much more sense but yeah once i once i start to see stuff over and over again just because i've like read it a few times stuff will start to kind of connect to my mind and like oh yeah well this makes sense of course these people believe this because of this or of course like this happen here it's because you know that happened there so yeah it's a lot of that if there's like a topic that i'm doing specific research for so like vaccine related stuff is a big one the ukrainian russian conflict is a big one that i'll break out a note i'll probably get like a google doc and i'll just start like writing like an outline of kind of the rough points of everything just to organize is my thoughts around different topics yeah we're just going to go tangent upon a tangent upon a tangent so we'll return to the low point of your life at some point okay always returning from the philosophy to the psychology so you did the ukraine topic one question is what role does us play in this war could they have done something to avoid the war the devil to play in forcing vladimir putin's hand do they have a role to play in de-escalating the war towards a peace agreement and the opposite if it does escalate towards something like the use of a tactical nuclear weapon are they to blame are we to blame oh man somebody sent me an email a while ago with great words there's a specific way to navigate a conversation where you can kind of like contribute to a negative event but you're not really the one responsible for it like the classic example is a woman goes out late at night gets a little bit too drunk and then something happens and it's like well there might have been steps you could have taken to mitigate the risk it's not her fault of what happened because the responsibility rests on the on the agent making the choice right there's a chooser at some point that is choosing to do wrong or evil i don't believe in any of the arguments that say the united states has contributed to russia's position on ukraine or the actions they've taken on ukraine there are several arguments that some people some even political scholars are are putting out there to say that the united states is to blame but i find them completely unconvincing i think that when you ask the question of like what is the united states role or what has our role been i think it's really important for us i don't think we even agree as a country on what our role should be which i think is a hard one because you've got this kind of there's this growing populist movement in the united states it might be the far left in the far right and i think populous tend to have this kind of isolationist view of the world where the united states should just be our own thing we shouldn't be telling anybody what to do we shouldn't be the world police and then kind of more in these like center left center right positions and then across a lot of europe you've got well okay the united states is kind of like the big kid on the block like we're looking to them for guidance and leadership on situations like what's going on in ukraine so insofar as the original question is like what what is like the united states responsibility i think we have a responsibility to ensure the relative like freedom prosperity and stability across europe i think that defending ukraine's sovereignty and right to their borders is a part of that and i don't believe that prior to the invasion in 2822 i don't think the united states was contributing to russia invading that country i know there are arguments given that like the expansion of nato you know has something that's been threatening to russia but the baltics joined and russia didn't do anything about it the invasion to crimea was very clearly a response to the revolution in 2014 the invasion on the borders is clearly a response to ukraine winning that civil war in the southeast and the donbos and russia becoming more aggressive i don't think that you can blame any of that on on nato expansion there's no nato countries that are threatening russia orbiting russia do you think there is a nuclear threat do you think about this do you worry about this that there is a threat of a tactical nuclear weapon being dropped i think that possibility exists either way and i think the responsibility for that is on russia because it can't it just can't be the case that if you have nukes you're allowed to invade countries and take their land because of anything i think that that down the road also increased increases the potential for nuclear problems in the future right because at that point either every single country has to acquire their own nuclear weapons because if you don't russia is going to mess with you or every single country has to join nato and now what we're back at square zero ground zero square one where people like oh well look all these countries joining nato is aggressive towards russia like what are you gonna do yeah you've mentioned that there's a complicated calculus going on with the countries that have they have nuclear weapons and what's our responsibility are you allowed to do anything you want to countries that don't have nuclear weapons that's a really tricky discussion for sure because what is ui supposed to do if russia drops a tactic when you grow weapon there's a set of options none of which are good and it's such a tricky moment right now because the things that biden and other public figures say i feel like has a significant impact on the way this game turns out because i think mutually sure destruction is partially a game of words now i mean i believe in the power of our conversation of leaders talking to each other i feel like you have to have a balance between threat and compromise and like empathy for the needs the geopolitical the economic needs of a nation but also sort of respect and represent your own interests so it's a tricky one like how do you play the how do you play the hand it reminds me of i don't know if you've ever heard in like evolutionary psych evolution or biology there are things called tit for tat strategies it kind of reminds me of that where it's like if like there are a whole bunch of these little biological mechanisms where creatures will develop like socializing like tit for tat if you do something bad to me i'm gonna do something bad for you and then more complicated schemes will come out where it'll be like tit tip for tat or it's like you can make one mistake and then i'm gonna get you if you do a second one or could be tit for tat or they're gonna be tit for a tat tat for there's like all these like back and forths where creatures kind of optimize themselves and yeah i think something the united states did really well in terms of that kind of conversational strategy and i approved of this in the beginning was biden was very clear about setting out like the exact level of u.s involvement for the war we're not going to do a no-fly zone there's not going to be us troops on the ground in ukraine but we are going to send a whole bunch of money and a whole bunch of arms and a whole bunch of intel to them and i thought he did a good job at laying out like the limitation of the os involvement while opening as much as we could in the ways we could help but the yeah that looming threat of some sort of tactical nuclear weapon i think on the table right now is like it's going to be the annihilation of like russian sea forces and everything but you know what happens if it continues to escalate that's like a world that nobody wants to nobody wants to be in yeah so we talked about difficult conversations and again thank you so much for reviewing the yay conversation let me ask you about putin speaking of difficult conversations so if you sit down if i sit down with somebody like vladimir putin or vladimir zielinski what's the right way to have that conversation oh man we can talk about that one we could talk about somebody more well understood through history like some like stalin or hitler somebody like that maybe that's an easier example to illustrate how to handle extremely difficult conversations yeah i mean i can have a really difficult conversation between like two people leaders of countries though you're there's so much that you are representing in that conversation i guess the thing that would be interesting to me would be like what is vladimir putin's interest like what is the genuine interest that he has in the conflict because i think finding out like what is your buy-in or what is your like what is the driving force keeping you here is probably the most important thing i think first zolensky i think it's a it's quite a bit more simpler because he's he's on the defense so he's defending his country and his people for putin i've heard all sorts of things you know dugan has his writings on you know like the east versus the west the collapse of the west and the face of like all of the liberalism and the weird lgbt stuff that they criticize you've got the desire to like return to this like former soviet union-esque thing you've got putin's quotes that the collapse of the soviet union was the biggest geopolitical disaster you know of 20th century and i guess figuring out like what is putin after i'm not actually sure i don't know the answer that question a lot of people write about it but yeah well there's a lot of answers to that question there's a lot of answers that he can give to that question so say i sit down with him for three hours and talk about it i think this is a really interesting distinction because you do do difficult conversations in the space of ideas but also in your stream you have i mean there's a bunch of drama going on there's there's a human psychology is laid out in its full richness before you so to me with leaders i think a part of the conversation has to be about the human psychology sure not like a meta conversation but like really understand what they feel what they fear who they are as a human being like as a family man as a as a person proud of their country as a person with an ego as a person who's been affected if not corrupted by powers all of us can be and likely are so all of that that gives context to then the answers about what do you want in this war because the answers about what you want in this war will be political answers it's like it's like a game that's being played again with words and politicians are incredibly good at playing that game i think the deeper truth comes from understanding the human being from which those words come and i think that's what you do i don't know if you do those kinds of conversations where i've never talk to any country later so no not not a country leader but say a controversial figure or somebody that represents a certain idea don't just talk in the space of ideas or challenge the ideas but understand who is this person how did you come to those ideas oh yeah when i've had there have been a couple of very controversial right-leaning figures so the two obviously the my stream is lauren southern and nick fuentes and those types of conversations initially aren't very political at all yeah it's more like like obviously we believe in very very different things but like beliefs don't happen accidentally so how did you get to where you are those are way more personal conversations that's true now is there things you regret about those conversations where you failed is there things you're proud of what you succeeded for things that i'm proud of i feel like i feel like i'm really good at attempting to understand people without judgment that i think a lot of people feel like they can have conversations with me where they can share a lot and i'm not going to jump down their throat for them having a politically incorrect observation or for them being judgmental to somebody else or having like a feeling that's maybe not something they should have something embarrassed about so i think i do a really good job at that and then by extension of that i've gotten the ability to hear perspective from so many different people that i think i can understand a lot of different perspectives for failures of mine i mean it's always going to be on stream it'll be like i didn't push back hard enough or i didn't know like a certain fact for a conversation these are usually the they're going to be on these like very technical grounds generally i'm pretty happy with like the direction my conversations have gone recently especially over like the past six months so your goal is to de-radicalize the audience of those folks and so that used to be my goal my goal was de-radicalization now i'm kind of hoping that that's just the byproduct so the goal i think is to talk to somebody and to show they believe this because of these reasons and if you want to change people's beliefs we have to talk about the underlying reasons for why they think the things they think it's not enough to just say like that belief is bad because it's like well they believe it for a whole bunch of things that are true and real to them at least so you have to address all the underlying things that they believe before you can change the overlying belief so if i'm having a conversation with somebody it'll be like okay why do you feel this about that that and that okay i understand that maybe like a better way to solve that would be like this or that instead of this thing so to what degree do you have to empathize with the person's world view versus pushback that's that's always the hard one when i'm talking to other people it's almost always me stepping as much inside their bubble as i can i have to like live and breathe their worldview and be able to speak their world view in order to like navigate their thoughts because my world view is i don't i'm not even using as an insult i don't know if i am a little bit autistic or something but when i break apart things i just want to see like study study study fact fact that's how my mind works for everything that's just that's what i like to see like personal stories don't do much for me narratives don't do much for me just show me like the the data and the studies or whatever but for other people i think most brains are more human than that and they tend to see things in more kind of like surreal pictures that are kind of painted and the brush strokes are way broader and you know they don't care about the itty bitty tiny fact so if i'm talking to somebody else and i'm trying to get into their head and i'm trying to change their mind on things i'm going to be stepping into their world and i'm going to try to be working through that framework really good example might be we'll say like when it comes to trans issues for minors okay 16 or 17 year old needs to get on puberty blockers the way that i want that debate to play out is let's look at all the data let's see what are the outcomes let's see what are the processes for getting a medication and then we'll evaluate all of that and then we'll go in whatever like points more favorably but that's wholly unconvincing to most people right so as a parent if i'm having that conversation with another parent the easiest way for me to have that conversation is like hey we both have kids imagine how horrible it would be if we felt like our kids needed help and the government was trying to get between us and and their doctor and that conversation that might be how that talk plays out which i think that's a really good argument because i think there probably are times when the government should get in between but i'll have that conversation because now i'm in a world where they understand what i'm saying i'm resonating with the way that they feel about things and then i can make progress with the way that they're kind of viewing the world because i'm talking in a language they understand so on this particular topic of trans issues is that the reason you were banned from twitch i'm not sure i don't know they just said hate speech but i don't use like slurs or anything so it's hard to know exactly so i think you made the claim that trans women shouldn't compete with cis women in the women's athletics can you make this case and can you still man the case against it i think in your community there's a lot of trans folks who love you and there's a lot who hate you yeah and so if you can walk the tightrope of this conversation to try to steal me on both sides one of the argumentative strategies i say is that like any time you have a conversation you should be able to argue both sides better than anybody else you know so for the for the my side the genuine belief side it feels like overwhelmingly all of the data is showing that trans mostly trans women even after i think three years on some sort of like hrt or you know estrogen stuff they're still maintaining these advantages from their male puberty over cisgender women and if that is the case if we are going to draw these distinctions around our sports between women and men it feels unfair to have a category inside the women's sports that are maintaining advantages that are coming from a male puberty regardless of the amount of time they've spent on hormone replacement therapy so that would be my argument on that side so it's unfair from a performance enhancement aspect so the same way we've been performance performance enhancing drugs that involve increasing of testosterone in that same way would be unfair essentially yeah so what's the case against the key yeah so the case in favor of them competing together is that realistically there's not going to be a transports category realistically trans women aren't going to be competitive with cis men because they've gone through these huge you know like hormone changes by the medication they're taking and that when we look at how sports are kind of done anyway there's a whole bunch of biological differences between people within sports categories that are determining their placement in the professional world so for instance somebody like me is probably never going to go far in the nba because i'm not tall enough i think the average height in the nba don't doubt yourselves don't doubt myself yeah i want to say it's like six six or something they're huge people or you know you look at like michael phelps as a classic example of a guy whose torso is like so long his body is built for swimming and i think there are some trans people that will look at that or somebody advocating for this position they'll look at that they'll go okay realistically the way that michael phelps body processes lactic acid the shape physiologically of his body is going to put him in a level of competition that so many men are never going to reach just because of biology how is it fair that you can have these biological outliers competing in these categories but then when we come to like sports categories with translucentous women you're going to take trans women and say that they can't compete against women can't you also just say that they have some level of biological difference there like is it really going to be that great of a difference than what michael phelps has versus the average swimmer or an nba player has versus like the average height male yeah do you think we're going to get into some tricky ethical territory as we start to be able to through biology and genetics modify the human body absolutely i feel like those things are coming sooner than we want to assume them to the oh man dude the a have you seen the ai art yes that's a of course i'm an ai person oh okay then yeah yeah that's a that's always been like what's gonna happen when when robots can do art better than humans lol like well we'll see in 20 years in 20 years and 20 years and now you have ai art winning competitions and it's funny because robots are essentially the robot behind you by the way the robot behind me oh nice robots are really good careful what you say yeah i got it i'll be careful that's not like one of the chinese ones with a gun on it right oh okay hopefully not we'll see depending on what you say yeah okay robots are really good at showing the limitations of the human mind in categories that we didn't believe we were limited before i i think that humans have this idea intrinsically that we have like some type of like innovative creative drive that is just outside of the bounds of physical understanding and with a sophisticated enough program we see that maybe that's not actually true and that's a really scary thing philosophically to deal with because we feel like we're very special right we own the planet we make computers and the idea that you can start to get these robots that can do things that's like okay you can do math fine okay you can do calculations because it's fine but you can't do art that's the human stuff and then when they start to do that it's like oh shoot and that terrifies you a little bit like a losing the human species losing control of our dominance i don't think it's necessarily losing control of our dominance i mean i guess like a skynet thing could come in at some point but i think i think it more it it brings us to this really fundamental level of like what does it mean to be human what is it that we're good at what should we be doing with technology we never really asked that question in the western world it's always the technology is like normative and that technology equals good and more technology equals better that's been like the default assumption in fact if you ask a lot of people how do you know if civilization has progressed over the past 100 or 200 years they don't say we have better relationships we you know have longer marriages we blah blah they'll say technology has improved we've got crazy phones we've got crazy computers and the idea that more technology might be bad has never even crossed somebody's mind unless it's used for like a really bad thing so well it's interesting we kind of think as more and more automation is happening we're going to get more and more meaning from things like being artists and doing creative pursuits and here's like oh shit if the r if the creative proceeds are also being automated then what are we going to gain meaning from what are the activities from what you'll gain meaning you know my whole life i've been working on artificial intelligence systems there's been different revolutions one of them is is the is the machine learning revolution and it's interesting to build up intuition and destroy that intuition about what is and isn't solvable by machines i think for the longest time i grew up thinking go is not the game will go is not solvable because my understanding of ai systems is ultimately that it's is is fundamentally a search mechanism that is fundamentally going to be brute force there's no shortcuts sure like i try like if it can't solve the traveling salesman problem it's not even going to be able to give you an approximation so most interesting problems are giant travel salesman problem and then so of course it's not gonna be able to solve that and then you then the deep learning revolution made you realize holy shit these large neural networks are the giant number of knobs is able to actually somehow estimate functions that can do a pretty good job of understanding deep representation of a thing whether that's a game of go or whether it's the human natural language or if it's images and video or audio and even actions and different video games and actions of robotics and so on and then you realize with diffusion models and different different generative models you start to realize holy shit it can actually generate not not just interesting representations or interesting manifestations of the representations of forms but it's able to do something that impresses humans in its creativity it's it's beautiful in the way we think of art is beautiful like it surprises us and makes us chuckle it makes us sit back in awe and all those kinds of things and yet the thing that it seems to struggle with the most is the physical world currently so that that's a counterintuitive we humans think that it's it's pretty trivial the being able to pick up a cup being able to like write with a pen like in the physical space would think that's trivial we give ourselves respect for being great artists and great mathematicians and all that kind of stuff and that seems to be much easier than the physical space our bodies are really cool yeah there is a i don't know it's probably asimov or something there's some science fiction writer that had a short story and it was like an alien that had landed on earth and it was describing our bodies from a totally alien perspective and when you think about all the things we can do it's pretty cool we can you know climb through a whole multitude of environments we can exist in a multitude of temperatures we can manipulate things just with our hands and you know the way that we can interact with things around us and yeah we're very capable on like a physical level even though like you said we think about ourselves like oh well human beings have really big brains and we do we're really intelligent as well but yeah our bodies are pretty cool too and it's a fascinating hierarchical biological system like that were made up of a bunch of different like living organisms that all don't know about the big picture of our body and it's all functioning its own little local world and it's doing its thing but together it has a of it forms a super resilient system all of that comes from a very compressed encoding of what makes a human you start with the dna and it builds up from a single cell to a giant organism i mean and because of the dna through the evolution process you can constantly create new humans and new living organisms that adapt to the environment like that resilience to the physical world it seems like running the whole earth over again the whole evolutionary process over again is might be the only way to do it so to create a robot that actually adapts is as resilient to the dynamic world might be a really difficult problem possibly well it's going to say like in a programming environment you can do things on time scales that are impossible in the real world right like the benefit to ai and computers is a computational they can compute so much data so quickly whereas on human timetables we have to wait when you talk about evolution you know it's generation after generation after generation you know maybe in a virtual environment that could be simulated and then those changes could happen a lot quicker with this in a human time scale but you have to look at earth at a quantum as a quantum mechanical system the computation is happening super fast this is a giant computer doing a giant simulation so just because for us humans it's slow there's like trillions of organisms involved in you destiny being you sure but the next iteration of like from human to human even if under the quantum love is a lot of stuff going on you talk about like like changes in dna for instance right like that's happening from a generation a generation time scale like in a virtual environment that could theoretically happen well it already is there's like protein folding like huge cloud computing probably ml stuff that's like working on doing all that stuff and it'll run like trillions and trillions of simulations you know every second and stuff maybe not every second but still slower than the actual protein folding much slower the that's for the problem of solving protein folding to estimate the 3d structure but the actual body does the actual protein folding way faster so like we're the question is can we shortcut the simulation of human evolution try to figure out how to build up an organism without simulating all the details because we have to simulate all the details of biology were screwed we don't have our chair we'd have to put something in a pond and then watch it for that might be the only way to do it sure that's what the universe most likely is it's a kind of simulation created by a teenager in their basement to to try to see what happens it's a it's a computer game that might be the most efficient way to create interesting organisms but within this system is perhaps possible to create other robots that will be of use and will entertain us in a way that other humans entertain us and that's a really interesting of course problem but it's surprising how difficult it has been to create systems that operate in the physical world and operate in that physical world in a way that's safe to humans and interesting to humans because there's also the human factor the human robot interaction to me that's like the most interesting problem to figure out how to do that well and so elon musk and others boston dynamics have worked on legged robots so i i really care about legged robots those are super interesting how to make them such that they're able to operate successfully in a dynamic environment super tricky they're like they're like the dumbest of dogs speaking of which there's a dog barking outside i mean it's it's really tricky to create those kinds of organisms that live in a in the human world then again if more and more of us move into the digital world so you stream a lot like part of who you are exists in the digital space the fact that you have a physical representation also maybe more and more will become not important i hope that's the case because i bought a lot of stock in meta and man it's down met at the company yeah is there some degree like can you can you can you look at yourself like stephen the physical meat vehicle and then the destiny this digital space like digital avatar do you sense that in a certain way you're the digital avatar i've always tried to keep my on-stream personality as genuine as possible so they're one and the same to me i don't really view them as two separate entities so but i mean i always view myself as stephen the real life person my destiny's my online name but no but because so many your social network is established the digital space like so many people know you through the digital space can there be can we swap out another person that looks like you and like an ai system and then that entity known as destiny will continue existing so i mean it must be like there must be some level of sophistication that could emulate a human brain i would imagine right probably the text not there yet but well the question is what's the level of sophistication of the audience that would recognize that something has changed like it's the touring test yeah how hard is it to trick your audience your your large audience of fans that watch your streams that when you swap out in the ai that emulates you that nothing has changed and the question is do you have to really simulate so much of the human brain for that i don't think so probably not and so i mean like you said a lot of political discourses just walking down the tree together so you can probably emulate a lot of that discussion yeah it would depend on if you're doing old data sets and you're training on that and i'm having conversations about abortion and ukrainian vaccines i imagine it could do it for quite a while the only thing that would be weird is when novel issues pop up then you probably need a more sophisticated resemblance of the inner brain right now you have to keep keep training on the internet so how the language models and that's the most incredible breakthroughs is the language models you just have to keep retraining the system on reddit which is actually what a lot of it is trained on it's just hilarious i do think it's really interesting that like kind of like funny problems like the trolley problem that we can kind of work through our normative ethical systems on are now like real questions like if you're driving a tesla and it's on autopilot and you're going to hit somebody but it can swerve and hit somebody else like what what ought the system do like we went very quickly from fun kind of like project in philosophy class too we need to solve this for insurance purposes like as quickly as possible it's kind of interesting to think about well i actually have i'll bring up the trolley problem with you later there's a fascinating version of it that i find hilarious okay let's let's return to your low point oh yeah uh you started playing video games that was a lucky break you you did text-based ones that was a lucky break because you gotten to be pretty good at learning and then you started thinking about going to college and so on what happened next i mean i went to like a prep school so you kind of have to go to college after that's like the point right i was also a millennial they all of us had to go to college that's always what they told us so my life was kind of it's hard to describe i don't really think much of the future i was just kind of enjoying the day-to-day because everything in my life was pretty weird both my parents had moved to florida by the time i was 16 17. i was looking like grandma i was working i had a girlfriend moved out we got a place did college by the time i got into college i had transitioned from working at mcdonald's to i was like working in a casino restaurant basically and i was really good at that job so a high level of patience for drunk people and same people and i was doing music in school because i've really grown to love music and my kind of thought process was my thought process was i can do music as a hobby i guess unless i get really good and maybe i can make money with that but otherwise i love music i'm okay going to school for music getting good at it and then just doing that on the side and then my main job would kind of be this career was building at the casino and basically the trying to balance personal life plus graveyard shift six day hour weeks at a casino and then a full-time music degree was not possible for me and eventually i had to drop school after i think it was like three years and after i dropped school to maintain my casino job after a few months i got fired from my casino job so i'd essentially just thrown away like the past like three or four years of my life why'd you get fired from the casino job i heard there's a story behind that yeah there's a story basically i was just really dumb when it came to understanding corporate politics and i this is funny because the same attitude kind of followed me into the streaming world my thought process has kind of always been that like as long as i'm really good at what i do i should be untouchable if i'm really good you can't do anything to me i don't have to play any dumb games or whatever and at the casino i think i was the youngest it was originally shiftly the supervisor position at the casino and when i started to get my own shifts there were problems that i would run into on graveyard shift because of carryover from the swing shift remember one of these problems was underneath the soda machine they weren't cleaning it properly and fruit flies were showing up and i my the manager came in one morning and she was like hey what's going on with the machine and i was like listen i can't do i can't take everything from swing shift and do everything at grapeshift i can't do this they need to figure out their stuff better or i need more employees it's not possible for me and she's like what did you tell anybody else yeah i complained to the supervisor on the swing shift all the time and she told me if you're not getting the answer that you like then it's your responsibility to email the next person up i was like oh okay that's interesting and some months went on and i ran into more problems jake is on graveyard here's how i don't know if it's everywhere but morning shift is the easiest and that's when you're the most overstaffed because that's when all the vps are in and that's when all the managers are there and everybody blah blah swing shift is the most challenging it's with your highest flow of customers is you're also decently staffed there but there's a lot of stuff going on and graveyard nobody cares at all about you they don't give you any employees you might get swamped you might not who cares make sure it's clean for day shift that's the only thing that matters a quick question of clarification so this is a 24-hour 24-hour diner yeah this is the dining casino oh by the way i had an amazing moment dying in a casino recently it's a special place a dining casino is a place of magic there's a lot of magic there's a lot of other worldly stuff going on there's characters there's and the they had an interaction with the waitress that was the sweetest waitress in the world and it was just like i don't know made me feel less alone on this cruel world of ours so graveyard begins when for me my shift was 10 pm to 6 a.m or sometimes i got called in early so be 8 p.m to 6 a.m that's no love for that shift no especially not trying to do school at the same time absolutely not but yeah basically long story short i ran into a problem with my super where i didn't have enough employees on my shift vps were coming in the morning they're like hey the diner's kind of dirty and i'm like you've cut all my employees past 4 am like on some nights i'm literally cooking and doing front of house like all on my own like i can't do this and my manager pam told me well you got to figure it out and so i remembered her advice so i emailed the vp of food and beverage and i cc'd her and i said i'm not getting the help i need in my restaurant now i didn't know at the time that i was basically completely throwing her under the bus because of that email but i retroactively when i look back on things or retrospectively i see that was the moment that i got like marked for deletion and i didn't really understand it even though i heard terminology for papering somebody out the door but after that point i started to get written up for like a lot of little random things like i'll come like i'd missed one day of work in my three years at the casino and i started to get rid enough for like showing up like one or two minutes late that's kind of weird that's whatever or written up for random ways about filing paperwork and then eventually there came a situation with another employee where they were it's complicated it has to like call that stuff but basically they wanted to come or they wanted to call out and i told them if they called out they were gonna get fired because they were at like 10 points they were at nine points and ten points of firing blah blah blah pam toby you can tell her that she's gonna get a point but you can't tell if she's gonna get fired i don't know what that meant and then i told her that if you call out you're gonna get you know you're fucked you're gonna get fired or you're going to be at 10 points and then i got called in early like three days later and pam was like you inappropriately communicated with an employee because you said the f word in a text message and i'm like really there's no shot and she's like well you also tried to fire the employee and it's like no i told her she was gonna get 10 points she's like well you use the f word i'm like that this is insane and i didn't just because i was such a such a high performing employees like there's no way i'm getting fired and then i did and i was like yeah cash out my 401k and moped for like three months because i had thrown away school for this casino job and then i got fired from this job that like yeah nobody believed i got fired it was just insane so if you look back if you were allowed to not just to look back to your own memory but actually watch yourself like somebody recorded video that whole time do you think you would be surprised you would notice some things like potentially of not having a self-awareness not having like social like a civility and social etiquette that's played in the human relations yeah absolutely so is that is that at the core of it essentially yeah i think so i mean that follows me even to this day there's a lot of i don't know if you're recording or not but when we spoke earlier about like meta conversations i have to think a lot sometimes about meta conversations because the way that i want to drive a conversation will sometimes be way different than what is like the best way to have a conversation whereas i just want to like go really hard on like some itty bitty like some idiosyncrasy or some factor figure whatever but that's not like the human conversation i need to have you know yeah so you got fired slash left that job and then took you to the the job that would be the lowest point yeah because there was a huge downgrade in pay i went from getting like i think at the casino because i worked so much overtime i was getting like 22.50 an hour on all my overtime fifth and this was back in 2008 2009 as like a college student like it's amazing pay i had benefits like everything was good and then the carpet cleaning was like i was probably getting my paycheck like every other week was maybe 1500 bucks or a thousand dollars and i'm working like 13 day stretches like i have every other sunday off and it's so many hours like i have to show up at the shop at like seven or six and then i go home at like eight or nine depending on when my jobs are throughout the day are you doing businesses or residential or what are you doing everything everything are you working for a company that is okay so like there's a schedule thing you have to go to it and so on yeah but so like this is why the schedule would start because sometimes i'd show up at i i think we had to be in the shop at i think it was 7am we show up at the shop at 7am first job might be at eight or nine but that job might be like a one hour job so i might show up at 7am and have a job from 8 30 to 9 30. then my next job might not be from until like say 11. so from 8 30 9 30 i'll do one job and then i'm going to drop from like 11 to 12 or something then i might have like a decent job from like five to eight but like my whole day is destroyed and i'm i'm doing like three smallish jobs so i'm getting like 30 bucks maybe for being in the shop or you know my job for like 10 or 11 hours and it's just like horrible so here's somebody that seems to be extremely good at thinking and conversation and so have a bit of an ego perhaps in in the both the negative and the positive sense of that word was there some aspect of working a mcdonald's and then working at the casino and working for the as a carpet cleaner that was humbling no never i had a the ego burned bright through it all the well or no yeah you can push back on the eagle yeah no i understand i totally get what you mean i had a really close friend growing up whose name was chris and i think we probably met when he was we were like four or five i think he lived behind me and i grew up with him and i'd always been kind of an outsider to the world that i was in once i got to high school for sure because all of those kids were incredibly wealthy you know corvettes and mustangs when they turned 16 it was a prep school and i was doing the they had like a work study program there where you could stay after school from 2 30 to 5 every day to kind of like work to pay for your tuition so i've been working like throughout all of high school i got another job at mcdonald's when i was' worked at the casino like i'd always been doing that kind of work i never really viewed it as like beneath me or anything it's not like i don't have like a family of doctors or lawyers or anything and then me and my other friend chris guy we'd always make fun of everybody else for being kind of like you know like preppy kids and everything so so there was a there's some pride to that sort of hard work yeah i guess a little bit yeah because yeah looking especially my dad like the solution to every problem was just throw more hours of work at it basically so that was always my yeah go-to and i never yeah what was psychologically the low point i think psychologically the low point was that as i'm doing this carpet cleaning job driving around my city there's like this feeling of i guess for a lot of people it's probably college but there's a feeling when you're in high school that everything is like so exciting and the whole world is kind of in front of you and there are a trillion trillion different branching paths of possibilities and you know even through high school you're thinking like am i going to be a doctor or a lawyer or can i join the mba or can i do this or that there's all these things in front of you and when i i especially felt it when i was doing these carpet cleaning jobs and i think it was in the fall i'd be outside some of these houses and i just kind of look around and i'd recognize a lot of these neighborhoods that i drive around with friends in or i'd you know be walking through i ran cross country some of them i'd be running through these neighborhoods and it was just kind of like this feeling of looking around and it was like when i was here in the past this was like kind of like a transitionary phase of my life where i'm doing this and it's so fun and exciting and then i'm going to move on to something else and it's going to be fun and exciting and awesome and then like you know two years later my whole life has collapsed like i'm in a house that i can't afford anymore my ex that i hate is pregnant with my kid and i have no money i've got no upward mobility i failed college i my job is horrible like just every single out like this is like my all of those the wave function had collapsed into one thing and that one thing was the worst thing that it could have possibly been at the time for me yeah like everything was gone and horrible so yeah that was the feeling ahead of the time do you ever gone to play suicide i thought about thinking about it but i've just never been that kind of person so i mean basically as a way to escape from the hardship something that i'm so incredibly lucky i don't know why or how i'm just gonna chalk it up to biology i've always had really high mental baseline i've like depression and all of that there have been a few short stints i've dealt with it past 30 because i did a lot of drugs but other than that my mental baseline is just so high and even in the carpet cleaning days like if you man the videos might still be there i think on my old youtube channel channel where i'll be like playing starcraft when i first started getting into streaming and i'll be calling up customers like this is steve from guaranteed clean we had to move your job back one hour is it okay if i show up instead of 2 30 and then i hang up it's like all right guys we got three more games and it's like let's go like stuff like that so my baseline has always been like really high for mental function so even in the low point there's that you had strength is there is there anything you can give by way of advice from people that for home to wave function collapses as it does for many of us like holy fuck the the world is not full of opportunity and you're kind of a failure like i've i've been there yeah i don't know the it's rough because like i usually ask for compassion from people that i have it better off because like once you're down there like the only reason i say i got lucky but it wasn't even really lucky like or it was lucky but it was more lucky i wasn't just lucky that i got into streaming it was lucky that i was into computers at an early age it was lucky that i played video games at an early age it was lucky that all the tech came up at exactly that right point in time like i was a pretty smart guy but it was definitely a preparation meets opportunity and that opportunity was like at the exact precise moment of my life if anything had gone differently then i would just be cleaning carpets today so so in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics this is like one out of like there's many many stevens that are just still carpet cleaning and they're full of pain and resentment yeah the the one piece of advice that i give and i hate that i have to push back against all these crypto bros and everybody online for decently intelligent people that are successful i've never heard anybody give a contradiction of this maybe you will you can tell me if you disagree i always look at kids in high school and i'm like just try a little bit harder like 30 minutes a night if you don't study just do 30 winches do a little bit more it is you're laying the foundation for the rest of your life and you can't appreciate it in high school and college but oh my god when you get out everything in your life is so much easier you have probably more responsibility over the direction of your life when you're like 13 14 years old than you ever will once you're like 25 and older because this is like when you're determining the foundations that everything's gonna build up yeah 100 so first of all it does seem that the liberating aspect of being young is like anything you learn so working hard at learning something will pay off in like non-linear ways like you said with video games i feel like so like people who are like i hate school all right well fine but find something where you're challenging yourself you're growing you're learning you're learning a skill you're learning about a thing of course you know you could push back and say well there's some trajectories that might not be productive like if you spend the entirety of your teen years playing i don't know league of legends game you have love and hate relationship with no just a hate and hate relationship okay well we'll talk about i think you have a love-hate relationship with hate in general we'll just hit and love okay we'll try to decomplexify that one i think in general just invest in yourself fully with passion it really does pay off but that said also school i feel like doesn't get enough credit like high school in particular middle school and high school because it's general education if i i think if you if you're especially if you're lucky to have good teachers but honestly i haven't mostly the textbooks themselves were good teachers it's a one chance in life you have to really explore a subject fuck grace like getting good grades is attention i would say with actual learning that is true but just get a biology textbook and to explore ideas in biology and allowing yourself to be inspired by the beauty of it yeah i don't know i i think that really really pays off and you never get a chance to do that again and maybe not even textbooks like reading straight up reading i think i think if you read this is a one time in life you get a chance to read really read like read a book a day read you you could really invest you can really grow by reading i mean you know i must all those guys talk about it like it's very very rare that you meet like a dumb person who reads a lot i don't know if that's ever happened in my life yeah dumb or not successful and this and the cool thing is it seems like the reading this like investment the reading you do early on in high school pays off way more than the reading you do later so like the the really influential reading is uh is it did during those high school years because you're basically learning from others the mistakes they've made the solutions to problems you're basically learning the shortcuts to life like whatever the hell you want to do music read from the best people that the music theory like learn music theory learn read biographies about jazz musicians blues musicians see their like see all the mistakes see what they did see the shortcuts if you want to do podcasting read about other podcasts if you want to do stream and read about other streamers physicists and so on and i feel like you figure out all the mistakes and you get the shortcut through life because most people show up to college without having done that and now you get a chance to shortcut your way past them yeah 100 i'm i'm gonna but nobody really teaches you that they're like go to school this from this time to that time that you're shut up you this is just what you do eat your broccoli i think it's like there's two huge problems one is now that i'm older because you know you don't know anything as a kid you can't really criticize as adults as a kid because you're a kid you're ageist if i mean i am super ageless as soon as i get older i get even more ages you there are a lot of people who are arguing i was like man dude you're really 22 archer i can tell every word you say so there's six of like 22 year old notes but that's okay i love that for you yeah no i could just say because you mentioned this so your wife is a fellow streamer molina you mentioned that this is a source of fights for the two of you that and i could just feel that there is truth to what you're saying which is like all right you're saying that because you're 22. just wait until you're 25 and you won't be saying that anymore sure now that is the most annoying thing for people yeah you can't ever say that of course because it's actually usually true because because we do go through phases in life and you can understand that most things are phases so just in general you can say just just wait just wait you won't see this you won't feel this way again i could say that to you you could say that to yourself just wait whatever you're feeling like just wait in five ten years you'll be a different person and you will laugh at the things you take seriously now that that they're causing you pain now all that kind of stuff but people hate hearing that anyway absolutely i think the joke that i always say is that like if i could literally step into a time machine and i could come back out and see myself as a 17 year old and i could say hey i'm literally you from the future you see the time machine and i would look at me and i would see the time machine and i would give myself the best advice in the world to be the most successful person i would ignore all of it even knowing it came for myself like this guy sold out this dude doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about like nah i'll figure it out better like he must have made some that's what i would think is the 17th and i knew it was myself in the future i would just 100 never believe it and knowing that is very frustrating but i keep that in mind when i deal with younger people that's why like i never i always say on stream when i'm talking to like there's been stuff with like sneakos another girl an ice cream called lab like when i see the way the i see the mistakes they're making oftentimes because i've made all all of these mistakes sometimes in the most public and horrible fashion ever but i'm never like a mentor i'm not gonna sit there and like tell you like oh do this or that or that or that because like i don't know if you're gonna listen to me and i don't want to condescend you and you know you figure stuff out i'll be here if you want to talk about it but yeah there was a one of those stories there was a company that didn't work with me because i i was very adamant on defending like very radical notions about language and racial slurs and everything when i was like 22 or whatever and there was a company and they said well we don't want to work with this guy for an event and after they had said that i read an article on my website called the company was gigabyte they make motherboards and i said fuck gigabyte in the ass that was the title to my article and i was like well if they don't want to work with me i'm going to blow them up and never do anything ever with them again and it was just like like looking back at it now obviously as a as an older person like hey you need to pump the brakes and chill you're destroying yourself but yeah as a young person it's like yeah you're 22 of course you think that you can say whatever and do whatever and as long as you're good at what you're doing you've got the whole world behind you and yeah geez well let's go there you have a history of using offensive language like the r word the n-word including the n-word with a hard r calling women bitches talking about rape in a nonchalant way what part of that do you regret and what part of that do you not language is very complicated when it comes to stuff relating to slurs there's been like a whole trajectory of feelings on everything related to language so my for you personally and for the internet as a whole yeah i don't care about the internet almost for me personally in my early 20s i'll say like 20 to 23 i think probably when i first started streaming my feeling is that any word is just a word and if it hurts you that's your fault take responsibility for yourself this probably came from my background of being like a really independent person so that's just kind of like the mind that i had for everything and there are basically they were like a collection of experiences that i had that as i grew i started to realize like okay well i feel differently about some of these words depending on the context and i can see how they can affect other people depending on the context so as i've kind of like grown i think i've developed a more sophisticated understanding of how different words are used and how they affect people whether they like it or not and more importantly whether i like it or not and that words can even if i don't want it to be they can be a vehicle for emboldening certain types of ideas that i don't want to embolden and yeah that's kind of been the whole like growth i've been lucky that in the time that i came up on the internet i was able to learn these lessons because if i was trying to learn those same lessons today i would have been completely destroyed because i had insane views on language like 10 years ago we could talk about the past we could talk about the president let's talk about the past first so how do you deal with the fact that there's videos of you in the past saying the n-word including the n-word with a hard r so generally and once the contest can you give me like yeah your memory what would be the context usually when i lay out this defense it's not because i wouldn't have used the n-word generally whenever i said the n word it was usually an example of like this is something that like a racist person would say i don't think i've ever on the internet i don't think i've ever called anybody like the n word with a hard r not because i wouldn't have but just because it wasn't in my vocabulary i played rts real-time strategy and we use the the f slur for gay people that's the one and i use that one a ton and i've called people that a ton in the past so i should actually just as a small tangent yeah go for it and this is what i'd like to explore with you there's a ruthlessness to the language in the gaming world yeah and there's different communities they have different flavors of language of hate speech essentially and there's also a humor to it which really bothers me in a dark way that i haven't been able to really think through because humor seems to be a kind of catalyst for hate it seems to normalize hate like you say basically it's like lucy case has a lot of edgy things but you take something lucy k says and do it in a non-funny way and do it over and over and over and keep increasing the hatefulness of it the vitriol and somehow you find yourself like alice in wonderland in a world full of hate where there's no good and evil it's all the same in fact the good is to be mocked and the evil is to be celebrated for the humor of it basically not taking the ideas of evil seriously and i don't know what it it reveals something about human nature that you can let go the moral of relativism that can happen when you do that kind of stuff at the same time i'm a fan of dark humor when done well anyway for people who are not familiar i just wanted to mention that some of the worst hate speech that ends in lol happens in gaming communities yeah the and that's where you come from in certain parts a lot of people don't remember this or don't know this because they're younger but way back in the day in the late 90s early mid 2000s of the internet the way that online kind of like shit talk worked was you were just trying to ramp up to the most insanely edgy crazy stuff you could say to like provoke a reaction have you ever heard of something called the aristocrats that it's like a joke the joke oh yeah the joke yeah there's a movie on it yeah okay basically every single like should talk back and forth in the internet was like that like what is the most increasingly depraved and back then you didn't get banned for slurs or anything on any of these chat rooms so it was just like an insane world to walk into and i was fully 100 a part of a product of and a contributor to that world so that probably still goes on on the internet in some way and that probably still goes on the internet you know maybe a more pacified way only end darker parts of the internet i'd say for the most part most well compared to back then compared to 20 years ago the internet is way cleaned up now there are still going to be boards you can go on or parts of the internet where you see that type of humor but not nowhere near as mainstream like back then you could open your mic on xbox live and hear some insane stuff when that first started nowhere near what you'd hear today although there's still elements of escalation that happen that just seems to be part of human nature on the internet the because we don't get the feedback of actually hurting people directly so the the trolling like for the lulls you'll do like whatever like you you will still escalate within the bounds you're just saying that there's more bounds now on reddit there's more bounds and so on so the p you know there's moderators that kind of yell at you that ban you and so on if you cross those bounds but overall that basic human instinct to escalate especially under the veil of anonymity is still there i don't know it's dark it's dark yeah just there's a lot of different ways to look at it and there's different ways you can break that art like for instance like you mentioned dark humor and you say that like like sometimes dark humor is funny and sometimes it's not i think that it's really important to dig into and figure out like why certain things are funny okay give you an example yeah go it's from your subreddit oh boy no that made me laugh and i felt wrong about it oh no so this is nine i already know what this is yeah yeah so this is a trolley problem to me it connects because i i think about the tr it keeps because i worked on autonomous vehicles the trolley problem the philosophical thought experiment kids brought up a lot you know when ai is part of making the decision do i kill three people here or five people here then ai makes that decision how do you do that calculus and this this particular there's a there's a deep so satire that reveals some kind of flaw in society i feel like that's that's what dark humor does successful dark humor does and that was a flaw i feel like certain there's a certain brand of dark humor and i think the reason i think the reasons one is why it's good or or why it is good humor i think it's because i don't think it necessarily reveals a flaw sometimes i feel like it reveals like a kind of virtue i think like if you look at this particular thing can i explain what yeah we're just listening the titles of the reddit post is you know what to pick and it says five people are going to die either way but if you flip the lever the trolley will do a sick fucking loop first and also the top comment is a question saying which i think is also part of the document where that's successful can i get the gender and ethnic backgrounds of the groups first and the top answer is both groups are each comprised of five white orphaned cis male heavy math users who are consistently in and out of drug rehab all who identifies right wing extremists humor is so it's such a sophisticated thing that we engage in humor is like really complicated but i would argue that like hopefully the humor here shows the virtue of like this is obviously horrible but that's kind of why it's funny it's funny because it's such a horrible question to ask like do we kill five people in a boring way or in a really entertaining way and it's like that's really that's really and then when you ask even more like what are the ethnic backgrounds like that's even worse to say that you know so i feel like that's like the type of there's a way that you can engage with dark humor where it's like oof like it's funny because it's so wrong and so typical we all know that it's wrong in taboo and that's kind of where the shared laugh comes from so for me the question that is asking the the diversity question is a sophisticated way of revealing the absurdity of asking about diversity when it's talking about human life oh interesting because the way that i took that was i think it reveals the absurdity of how people will weigh different ethnic backgrounds so differently when it comes to value of human life like i'm actually thinking of that in terms of like a an immigration related question where people are really keen and quick to dehumanize like black or brown people so like the question is like well if five of them are brown and five are white well i know which one i'm gonna you know pull the lever for that's how i read that but it's satirizing that ass yeah exactly yes of course yeah but that's what i mean that that's the flaw to me at least it showed that humanity or social networks that are easy to be outraged and love the outrage and the chaos that twitter and social networks will pull that lever like they would they would always try to maximize the fun and there's like there's a sick aspect to all the atrocities all the tragedies that happen in the world that we kind of always lean towards the the outrageous narrative weaved around it the yeah the the one that leads to sort of the most clicks to the most attention to the most outraged to all the all that kind of so that that's almost like a satire of society when they are faced with tragedy they will maximize trying to think of a word that's not fun but entertainment maximize the entertainment yeah this is a big criticism i give especially to conservative crowds you know left lane appeal everybody doesn't i don't like when people blame the media for the state of the media today i very much believe that everything in society is a feedback loop and that if you're really unhappy with the state of the media i think that the media is a good reflection for what people want to see because there is a room right now in the united states where somebody could start a company where all they do is completely factual reporting they don't have a political slant and they're not giving you these like sensationalist narratives or stories and that media company would fail in two weeks because people don't want to see that generally people really want to see the like show me the guy that really believes in what i say that calls the other guy an idiot the guys that are screaming on tv or on the radio like this is what i really want and people will engage in that and that feedback loop will continue for generations and then all of a sudden people like why is the media so biased why is the media driving so many narratives i was like what do you mean this is exactly what you want to see and that's that's frustrating for me that's one of my big kind of when i defend establishments or when i talk about like the interplay between citizen and and all these institutions we have that the institutions are very much a reflection of the population at least in democratic societies and i think that people very much try to elude the personal responsibility or the country's responsibility to why some of them look the way that they do but that takes us back to the n-word with a hard r sure why for the particular examples that i was giving for the particular conversations that i was having if you're going to have challenging conversations around certain words i think you should probably be able to say them otherwise it feels really ridiculous to me that's why you still believe that for com yes and not like calling people those words but having conversations about those words i would say that i still believe i am but don't you think as you said that using those words actually gives motivation and strength to people who have hate in their hearts i think depending on the context of what's going on i think that that's going to be a big driver in terms of how people are going to perceive or take it so in a conversation about the n-word i don't think i would normally say the n-word we just talk about the word much the same way that like in like say like in a movie like in django the people use the n word should that be censored in that movie or in the context of that movie is it being employed in a way where these aren't good people you're not supposed to like them and that's what the audience walks away with yeah but that context is different than conversation it feels like in conversation you using that word normalizes it and that normalizing that word is going to make it easier for people who use that word in a hateful way to use it same with the f word this the f slur if you use that casually and normalize it in a way that's not hateful you use in a way that's not hateful but you the side effect is that it normalizes it then people who do use it in a hateful way will be more likely to use it therefore mathematically looking at the equation of the number of times the n-word or the f word is used throughout the world it increases the number of times it's used in a hateful way yeah i think the human and you're part of that problem stephen i don't i don't agree i understand i understand the thought process but i don't know if using certain words within different contexts is going to necessarily normalize like the hateful use of that word that is an argument that i've heard people use somebody will say like okay well hold on that should never be used ever because by virtue of you normalizing it even in an inoffensive environment you increase the proclivity for people to use it in a potentially more offensive environment and my argument is always like no i don't think that crossover exists but if you did want to take that argument and maybe you do feel this way i think that you get really problematic when you run into communities that do use certain words that people would say well they should be allowed to do it so for instance if you think that any utterance of the n-word at all is highly problematic it might increase hatred then like the entire rap industry has to dramatically change the way that they engage with the n-word and obviously a lot of people that criticize people's use of the n-word aren't going to turn to rappers and say well you guys can't say it either no it's who i mean it's who uses the n-word that's what it's not so it's not just the word it's the the it it is context dependent but i would say that you as a white person having conversations the context there is the kind that would lead to an increase in hate do you think the n word should be censored in the dictionary no and i believe there's a wikipedia page on it and it's not censored yeah i think it should be in the dictionary i think the context of casual conversation like like i said i just believe that on the internet having humor having fun conversations as you have on your streams that leads to the normalization of the word without any educational value i think i would i think i would agree with that no sorry so there's a difference between absolar and n-word and both i think should not be used in a fun way but the f word was used in the fun way for the longest time for sure and i i'll tell you something that bothers me about your streams not your your streams and basically every other stream is the the casual use of the r word oh the ableism yeah i don't know if it's about the able i don't even know listen it's complicated i'm not like virtue signaling here no it's just ableism isn't a virtue signal i mean like it's a legitimate yeah like i get emails from fans that say like hey like i deal with this particular issue every time you use this word kind of feels like you're attacking me like just like so it's not it's a valid concept yeah it's just something cuts wrong for me like for example i'm not bothered by i am bothered by the excessive use of the word fuck okay but not in the same way the moderate use of the word fuck what is it i'm curious and when somebody calls somebody an r word what is it that what is the feeling that you get that makes you feel bad about it it signals to me that you don't give a damn about people who are struggling in ways that you are not struggling like that that signals to me like about the experience of others do you think that there are other other words also that could convey like a similar feeling to your wife because it feels like you've drawn a pretty special circle around because like i imagine oh this guy's you're an uneducated dumb fucker you're a networker like i think that's what the the whole point with the culture so i'm trying to feel my feeling is a kind of you know i'm a human being that exists in the social context that we're all evolving that language together and just feels wrong like you know the word bitch for example it really bought like a friend on your streams and in general calling a woman a stupid bitch really bothers me but it's not just the word bitch it's context like for example me personally i'm speaking to me personally like badass bitch is is different than stupid bitch way bad bitch or something is different than yeah of course way different sure i think it speaks to a bigger sense of civility and respect for human beings that are not like you that's what that's that's the feeling that i'm bothering so i guess what i'm trying to say here is just because people speak in this kind of way in the gaming world and streams doesn't mean that you like a lot of people look up to you it doesn't mean young people especially doesn't mean that you don't have the responsibility to sort of stand alone from the crowd because you're somebody that values the power of affected discourse and to be effective discourse there's some level of civility so you can be the sort of the beacon of civility in that world versus giving in to the the derogatory words because like yeah you have to you have to lift people out of that world out of the muck of what i would say is like drama and ineffective discourses like i think that's one of your missions right is like to inspire the world through conversation through debate through effective discourse yeah so i guess i'm just calling you out that i i think using our word for me personally as a fan that that believes in your mission it just makes you look ineffective and bad and uninspiring to young people that look up to you because those young people are going to use those words that you're using and they'll do it much less effectively sure this the problem yeah i guess the challenge is always just like finding the line like yeah my my vocabulary shifted dramatically from even even from like two or three years ago i think my vocabulary shifted quite a bit as we've like we've kind of gotten rid of some words and some things are kind of coming out the r word is one that has kind of gone out and come back and gone out and come back that one we've definitely gone back and forth on i know there are different thoughts about it in different communities on the internet this is interesting i'm just telling you yeah for me it cuts and i'm not a social justice warrior type it costs pretty hard like what you're saying is i'm going to lose a subscriber if i'm no it's not no i'm just kidding i know i just i actually have had to empathize harder because i'm like maybe this is not a very good person that's what i feel like if you're so carelessly using that word then maybe you're not actually thinking deeply about the suffering in the world like to be a student of human nature you really have to think about other humans and other experiences that are unlike your own yeah of course and so that's the sense i get but at the same time you're you're also like the grandpa i mean ages who's trying to be cool with the young kids a lot a lot of the reason young kids look up to you is like you also know the language of the internet yeah but i mean it doesn't that's not an excuse to use words we think shouldn't be used i guess the question that i that i would have because it's always a struggle and to some extent it's kind of happened is let's say that like three years ago i would have said i'm no longer saying the artwork that's just i'm just gonna get rid of that in my vocabulary like is there a chance that today we would be having a conversation about like why do you call people dumb fucks like is that really appropriate like does this attack at the core of like somebody's like level of intelligence education opportunities in life like is that where they you know you don't think so i think that's a as the kids say cope do you really think so i think because because the words have been moved in a way where it's like this was okay now it's not this is know so you're standing your ground by using listen you could you you could you could but i think it's better to use those words if you want to defend the ground word stand on to use them rarely and deliberately versus how you currently use them which is to express and emotion like you i'm going to be honest you use our word not when you're at your best true and so that's not that's generally that could be true for a lot of swearing too though but yeah i know what you mean no but like you know that our word is offensive you know and there's a part of it is like the the you tell yourself that like you're still kind of fighting political correctness by using it a little bit when you say it no i don't think so i think i'm trying to think in terms of like where is the virtue where like there's a whole bunch of arguments for why some words are okay some words aren't okay or whatever and i try to like think more along those lines rather than but like there's gonna be like a lot of phrases where like if the r word has come out the conversation is over like i know that like things my brain is shut down the person i'm talking to is but there's like there's a lot of words also in terms of like it like if you ever hear me say like fucking moron in a debate it's like it's done like this conversation is over there's no way that anything productive is happening past that point i think fucking moron is not i think it's ineffective it's not civil but it's not it doesn't bother me in the way is is basically when you speak in a way that i know there's a group that's going to be heard by that not only do i think about the hurt that group experiences i think of you as a lesser intellectual like as a lesser person who's thinking about the world what bothers me the most is just what kind of mindset that inspires and young young people or especially when you're in a public figure and a lot of people look up to you so i definitely don't think sort of this idea the r word is not the battleground of expanding the overton window of discourse okay like i i don't think it'll lead to dumb fuck being canceled two years later unless that word is hurting people's experience which i don't foresee that happening i think legitimately our word and f slur and calling women bitches it's context matters here too like of course but just the way i've heard you use it it is not is from emotion and it's from frustration and it ultimately is rooted in disrespect i don't i think it's ineffective and of course like who gets to say i don't know but i'm saying somebody who would my like i admire effective conversations and i admire great humor dark humor wit to me oftentimes the use of the r word in the way you've used in the way i see the community use it is none of those things it contributes not at all to the humor and so on now i could see it might contribute to the to the camaraderie of that particular group especially when they normalize the use of that word you kind of take some of the edge off but you forget that there's a a large number of other people that don't have the chemistry that don't hear the music of the friendship that you have the relationship you have instead they hear the normalization of a hateful word and it ultimately has an impact that's hateful and then people like me who show up you know i haven't watched much of your stuff it turns me off from like a couple of times your content came came before me like and i listened to it a little bit it turned me off completely i didn't understand how good your heart is i didn't understand how your mission of actually direct do you radicalized people help people like you're and increase the level of good faith discourse in the world i didn't understand any of that because like what i was hearing is pretty rough the the r award type of stuff and i just feel like the benefit cost analysis is heavy on the cost gotcha that's so i just have to sort of call this out okay i think it and i straight up think it's wrong but that's my own that's why do you think it's wrong because it's hurting people without any benefit to you whatsoever when you say hurting people do you mean the person i'm using it at or do you think there's like things like the third group the third third group it's good feedback right i always consider everything especially i respect you a lot you're a really smart guy something that i always kind of like foreign fight over in terms of like language or like who to attack or what to attack or what to do is that it's very hard to draw like what boxes are okay to install people on versus one aren't so for instance if i call somebody like a nazi with a lot of vitriol i am okay with every single nazi being negatively affected by that because that category intrinsically calls upon at some level of more condemnation for me right whereas like if i'm out there i try not to do like image related jokes right i don't want to call you like oh you're a fat fucking loser because there's a lot of people that are fat that are overweight where i don't want them to feel bad i don't want them i'm not trying to call you out or like insult you so there's like a lot of you say cost benefit i like like a lot of collateral damage from a world like that where there's no purpose in doing that so certain words are easy to get rid of they're off the table right epsler and we're like like these are not words you call people because you're there's so much collateral it's not worth it we've got some words where it's like if you have some form of like mental thing it is a bad thing you're not a bad person somebody just using that word could feel like a collateral damage to those people and then there's other categories of words so like if i say that like this person is like they're it's a stupid fucking republican right there's probably some republicans that aren't dumb that i don't want to feel called out by that like are those types of phrases that you think should be completely removed as well or i'm kind of curious so this completely removed just so we're clear yeah i'm not referring to censorship oh no i'm not even talking about i'm just just a person like emotionally like removed is the wrong word though like i care about like i'm not trying to listen to people on the internet saying like you shouldn't say that word that's not good i mean you i'm trying to look to your mind and heart okay we're talking today is you're betraying your gift you're better than this you think it's indicative of like a more flippant thought process where it's like the only way you can say that word is if you're ignoring the hurt and suffering of those people and if you're somebody that says even those people you're ignoring the the state of language because i think you're getting to the point because it's not about a single word it's about like it's music and i just feel like there is it's a strong note that ruins the melody gotcha and i don't think i can say you know you shouldn't use the r word or whatever i'm just speaking to i'm just listening to music and reviewing the the final result it's not necessarily because maybe one use of the word the r word strategically or part of an actual like or when you've built up a camaraderie that's sandwiched in in like some love but then you try to reveal there like because you're talking about a lot of there's a bunch of drama you have a but you have friends with whom you're worrying and stuff and they're all a little bit beautifully insane and you've said that you are becoming more and more insane it's beautiful to watch it's the human condition laid before us wonderful and some of that is swearing and so on so it's a tricky thing but the whole skill of discourse just like it is with dark humor is walking that line i just feel like it's overuse of the r word and i don't want to die in that ground because i don't think it's that that represents like there's certain things like that it feels like it ruins the music and i don't you know it's just saying like a dumb republican or a dumb democrat i don't yeah that ruins it too a little bit depends on how you use it you can be lazy with that yeah you know like even overuse of the word i think bots is what's used for people who don't think or something i don't actually know the definition i'm offended on the on behalf of robots and that might be a compliment soon exactly what i guess bot means you don't think yeah you're like an npc you're just kind of interesting again i'm offended on behalf of npcs i i count myself as one but there's a sense if you say bots too much that you're just dismissing people like everything i say is right and anyone that disagrees with me is a bot that that's lazy too sometimes you're funny sometimes it's effective basically saying a lot of people in the mainstream media or something like that are bots okay that's a little bit of that is effective but too much it becomes ineffective and i'm trying to speak to that yeah and i'm just the reason we're highlighting clear examples like the n-word joe rogan had to contend with that all right yeah i think it's ineffective it makes you less effective at this course i but like like you've talked about many times language is a tricky one it's always hard because you talk about like constructing a melody there's not one melody that sounds good to everyone but there are probably certain notes that like if you got rid of them everybody's still going to like it about as much and you don't really lose anything there's a whole other part of an audience that might be more willing to listen yeah of course and it's not about losing the magic of that melody like you don't want to be vanilla i just feel like there's stuff that doesn't need to be there yeah for sure it's fat but then again you're the other thing that people should understand that might be listening to this you're streaming many hours a day for many years i don't know it's 11 or 12 i think yeah i started in 2010. and so one of the things that people can do is just clip out anything you're going through the full human experience of emotion anger fear frustration all of it so of course there's going to be moments when you're not the best version of yourself anything else to say about the language it's complicated i'm still always trying to figure it out you know there are opinions that i have that have changed throughout the years it's possible that the r word has always been the next one on the chopping block that we're all kind of looking at but people always worried about that treadmill but it's possible in a year or two i'll have a different view on it or i'll have changed away some of the words i use and that yeah it's definitely like a it's always like a work in progress there's always like different communities that feel different ways about different words yeah yeah but you acknowledge that there's people out there that are never going to talk to you they're never gonna think of you as a good man because you use the on n word with the hard r publicly in the past i mean yeah those people exist but i mean there are some people that are beyond my reach which i'm okay with like there's gonna be some people because of things that have been involved or even ideas that i have now that might make them beyond my reach something you said earlier is very true i think the goal is to like identify what are the elements that you can cut out that aren't integral to your message but it could be alienating to more people and those are probably the things that you identify but i think that you can get lost in yourself or lost on the internet or lost in a you know at the outside of yourself if you're trying to appeal to every single person it's just never going to be the case and for i actually i like that i've had the journey that i've had on the internet that you can find me saying and defending a lot of insane stuff 10 years ago because i think it shows like a level of progress and i think i do get a lot of respect and buying to certain communities where it's like i'm not just some random dude telling you that like oh you should shouldn't say you know the f word or the n word like i'm a guy that's been there that's done it that's defended it and you can see my whole past my whole history is laid bare for you to watch every of you know thousands of hours of it but i can show that like there's growth and evolution and change that can happen in a person so yeah and you're honest about that growth it's tricky thing because people just call bring up stuff from your past for sure i i hope we figure out as a civilization a mechanism to clearly say this was this was me two years ago this was me five years ago this i'm a different person and like because twitter doesn't care about that these social mechanisms that bring stuff up doesn't care about that it's like one stupid thing you say it becomes like a scarlet letter and i don't know how to fight that it's tricky to fight that have you ever seen men in black yes when k and j are on the bench and he says person is smart but people are stupid dumb finicky animals or whatever there's something that changes for human dynamics when there is a group of people that make it so hard to control like i think one-on-one anybody can sit across on somebody and admit to some horrible stuff i used to be you know i abused my husband when i was you know 20 and i'm 35 and i see it's wrong or i did this i was addicted to whatever and you know i made these mistakes one-on-one it's always easy but in in group environments that in group out group tribalistic thing of like identifying one thing and then coming to destroy a person's life is like it's such a huge like impulse we have and i think probably when we were like hunter-gatherers in the force probably good because you really want to push weird people out or anything like that but now on the internet when we can hunt for any dissenting opinion and just with ruthless precision destroy somebody's life over it it's pretty scary dynamic i think one of the mechanisms that could fix it is make it super easy for each individual person to analyze all the stupid shit they themselves have said in the past like a full recording because i think people are just honestly paint a very rosy picture to their own brain of of who they have been in the past yeah of course if we can have empathy for the fact that we've said stupid shit or we're drunk the the ridiculous things you say the offensive things you might have said offensive things you might have done i just feel like that would give us the ammunition to have empathy for others that are like okay yeah this guy five years ago said this maybe that doesn't represent them who doesn't represent who they are any more than stuff i said five years ago represents who i am today yeah i feel like technology can actually enable that maybe although you're talking about more more recording and more stuff which people are already wary of but it's a double-edged sword i think there's there is going to be more and more recording we have to figure out how to do that in a way that respects people privacy and gives them ownership of their data and so on i've looked at the search history i've done on google which for most people is available like your google search history and it's fascinating to watch the evolution of a human being like it doesn't seem like the same person it's like a different person for sure it's weird it's also hard too with the internet today i'm gonna be ageist again but like now all of the people are thrown together you know whereas like like i don't want a 27 year old judging they're usually like a 15 or 16 year world like obviously he's in high school like there is that story that came out of the there was a kid that saved the recording of i think it was like some white girl i think that she like got her driver's license and she's like i can drive now and words with the a or whatever his dumb she shouldn't have said it but i think she was like 15 or 16 when she tick tock this or whatever and he held all of that recording until she applied and got accepted to college three years later and then he released it to get her kicked out of college and i'm like damn everything that i had ever said as like a 15 16 year old was like immortalized on the internet my my life wouldn't have even begun because those are insanely high standards to hold people to not that like obviously you shouldn't be saying those you shouldn't be saying certain words or whatever but you have to be able to make mistakes in adolescence like everybody does we all did everybody did it growing up you know why do you think there is so much misogyny in the streaming community and how can you fight it because you've you've shown a lot of interest in fighting it trying to decrease or eliminate misogyny from your community i think it's really difficult i think that eliminating racism is easier than eliminating misogyny because on the internet you mean on anywhere because i think fundamentally i don't think there's that much difference between like white people and black people and brown people and asian people or whatever you know we have different cultures and stuff but at the end of the day we're all people but i think there are differences between men and women like throughout all of you like all of history and time and then even today in every culture and when when real differences do exist it's harder to account for them in a way that can we have conversations with each other without it becoming very gendered in a negative way right negative way of generating something like a misogynistic way of doing it of course it's unclear to me that it's so difficult to to avoid the negative gendering versus the positive because there's a lot of positive to the the tension the dance between the different genders and so on maybe in this particular moment in history it's not but it's not trivial to me that racism is easier to eliminate it's an interesting hypothesis just because there's more biological difference between men and women that means it's harder to eliminate but i don't know if there's a troy i hear this a lot i feel like i've read the story but i need to get a better source if i repeat it everywhere but i've heard that like in the us military for instance they've gotten exceedingly well they do an exceedingly good job at getting different people of different races to integrate and it's like not a huge problem once you're through basic training all the training everything but for a different sex as it still represents a significant problem that the military hasn't figured out and i actually looked like what's the military doing because if you know if something was solvable like can we sleep for four hours a night be healthy if we could i bet the military would know you know so i kind of look sometimes for them to see their integration but it might be that there are other issues there that make it yeah it feels like the military is a very particular country for sure yeah it could be the actual task at hand might bias the difficulty of the process potentially yeah there's been a lot of interesting talk about like women integrating into male groups and how do you do this in a way where everybody is happy with the outcome and there's not like issues i think jordan peterson spoke about this a little bit and then workplace culture speaks about this a bit would you happen to remember i want to say it was like five or ten years ago there was a big tech conference and there were two guys behind a woman and they made a joke about like a usb dongle like dongle was a dick and this woman turned around she tweeted pictures of them spoke about like misogyny and then every that up into a huge ordeal that like yeah there was this there's this interesting phenomenon that and a less misogynistic and more inclusive workplace environment some women might end up feeling worse because in a more misogynistic environment you're thinking like okay that's a woman she doesn't get our humor i'm going to treat her in a very indifferent you know very dispassionate cold way and whatever and then i'm gonna have my my boys over here and then you've got like these environments where they're a little bit more warmer and it's like oh cool we're going to bring this woman into our environment and we're going to make all the same types of like crash jokes we did before and it's actually worse now another woman feels even more otherwise because like oh my god why do you talk like this i think that internet communities especially online ones that do like political debate and video games are very much like big boys clubs so it's not enough to just say you can't be misogynistic to get rid of misogyny there's always going to be an othering effect on women there's a lot of like behaviors that are unintuitive that you have to account for and you've got to try to like push that back and that's just a very very challenging thing to do so like i i like to deal with concrete examples more so here's a concrete example and this is like a recent initiative in my community because i'm trying to like be because misogyny hasn't been fixed anywhere on the internet and i'm curious well there are ways that i can push my community to do this i don't think you should almost ever make a comment on a woman's appearance ever if they're appearing in like some political or professional manner even if it's a positive comment i think it's equally bad to a negative comment it's just never good to do and that's kind of an unintuitive thing because it's like well a woman appears wow she's really cute it seems like a nice comment you're being nice you know she looks cute whatever but it's like it's not at all the point of why she's there and just by saying that you're kind of like authorizing her as like a person to like think she looks good rather than listening to anything she has to say you know well there's a lot of stuff that you're saying and that is a part of massaging it's almost like obvious like any woman will tell you that woman well yeah but they're not in these spaces and a lot of the guys don't know i think what that requires is just empathy you don't need you don't need you need to consider the female experience that's it like you have to either read about or talk with women you learn like the low-hanging food is very easy to learn it feels like just the level of social skill oftentimes in internet communities is quite low i disagree i don't like to say here's the problem with empathy is it's very hard to have empathy for experiences that are so outside of your own it well maybe some people there might be some people that can do it i can't there's a lot of stuff that i had to learn women are half the population but they're women they're totally different they're totally different okay so here here's what we talk about yeah yeah so this is not totally totally so here's an example okay so especially for me my archetype makes up a lot of the internet white man there's never been a point the name of a beautiful woman who might be a dancer what's the backstory from new orleans or from i haven't thought that through yet all right yeah it's ambiguous okay like an open world open world i want you to project whatever wherever you want destiny the dancer to be from that's in your mind okay all right well i'll save that for later tonight yeah okay as a white guy there i don't know if there's ever been a spot that i've been in where i've made been made to feel like i don't belong there just by virtue of who i am i don't i actually don't i it's impossible for me to empathize that because i don't even have that experience if you go back eight nine years one of the big issues that came up was harassment and gaming against women and i was one of the big debaters against that saying that like sure women might get harassment but everybody gets harassment if you're a woman and you're in gaming and you get harassed congratulations you're being treated like a man what you're actually asking for is for us to actually treat you differently you don't want to be insulted you don't want to be treated like a man and that's actually a misogyny is women making that argument you still stand by that is that a problem if i do no i'm just kidding well okay hold on a little it's a little while i disagree with it sure okay that's good you should a little while later i had a friend jessica super cool girl we go to play games she was between jobs and she's like i've got like two months and we're gonna grind cs go and i'm like okay this is awesome let's do it cs go counter-strike global offensive shooter game fps microphones first day we start playing okay hop into our first game obviously she talks everybody's making is that a 12 year old boy why aren't you making sandwiches blah blah blah yeah okay whatever player first game play our second game same jokes third game fourth game by like the fourth or fifth game i was actually starting to feel triggered like every time the game started i was like can you just like talk so we can get over like the stupid fucking jokes it's so fucking stupid and you hear the same fucking joke every single time and it took one day of that experience for me to realize it's not about being insulted it's like this othering feeling that you don't belong and i've never felt that because i'm a white guy like it's just not to be like virtually similar so but like there's just there's no places where it's like you're white you don't belong here you're guy you don't belong here like i've never felt that not inclusion and playing with her there's a different feeling when it's the same types of jokes coming from a group of people to make you feel like you don't belong there where i was like damn this actually feels really bad and it feels bad in a different way where it's like if you call me like nf slur or any other type of swear word or insult like yeah you can call me that but at the end of the day like we're all kind of the same we're all white dudes and we call each other names but like this is a woman and this is not her place and she doesn't belong here kind of the analogy that i would make because i after getting these experiences i've learned this afterwards if i tell you that there's another guy in a room and you need to think of the worst insults ever for that person without ever knowing anything about them or meeting them if i tell you that it's like a white straight guy and you have to write insults you're fucked maybe you can do like school shooter there's not really much you can say at the end of the day but if i tell you it's a woman we could there are so many different jokes you can write if it's a black person so many different racist things we can say are you sure i can come up with a lot of stuff for a white guy in terms of stuff that is just intrinsic to him being a white guy yeah like there's really wait a minute what are you talking about there's a lot the internet has sharpened that sword in terms of like jokes that are targeted at his sex and cells virgin weak some of the anselves virgin maybe yeah that's getting there sure that's for sure that's recent though sorry i'm older on the internet we didn't have those words way back then when i was making these analogies that installing version my day we didn't have generation there were no installs back then none of us had sex we just accepted we were all computer gamers nobody had sex to play video games back then okay people don't remember that there wasn't the big bang theory you were just a loser that was stuck i didn't even know sex exists we had to download sexual pictures and they took two minutes and you didn't even know if you were gonna get the right thing by the time it finished loading but but what i'm saying is they're like okay so you think you agree that like if somebody gives you like a race like a black person who's a woman we can write like very cutting scathing like insults for that person that are very authorizing oh words that would really hurt yeah that are very cutting to the person but like for a white guy it's kind of hard because it's like that's like the default there's not as much other rising of those people yeah so that's kind of the insults you have from white guy the white guy the insults are much harsher so when you start to apply the same kind of harshness to other groups you can make them feel like they really don't belong and that other rising effect is something that's very hard for me i can't really empathize like i've never felt it so i have to intellectualize it and then sympathize with it it's like a whole process i have to go through and then i try to walk other people through that because if you're a white guy on the internet which is a lot of the internet you really don't know what that feels like you've never felt like that before yes so you're now in a leadership position grandpa destiny so that's a lot of people look up to you for that for that sort of pathway to empathy yeah not to otherwise i mean you have felt other eyes in you you mentioned high school people like not being yeah but those were always for things that like it's different to insult somebody for a non-immutable characteristic like okay you think poorly about me because i'm like not enough money or i don't have money but i could get more money and i could change that but it's different for somebody to really attack you for like your gender or attack you for like your race a lot of the attacks that hit the hardest is not about gender it's it's i do think that they're like the way women are attacked on the internet it's the same kind of attacks you would do towards other guys but you go harsher i feel like they're fundamentally different i feel like when we're attacking guys i'm not usually attacking you on like the virtue of you being a guy but like if it's a woman and she's typing something like oh did your boyfriend type that for you or like what are you even doing here like don't you shouldn't you be trying to find a husband or like oh you're like a stupid kind of like ghost died and only fans or no but the stupidity the intelligence aspect is what's attacked yeah but it's so much different like you can call a guy stupid but that's because he's a guy that's being stupid but when you call a woman stupid she's stupid because she's a woman yeah but i honestly think that women are called stupid more than men on the internet but i've got nothing to do like the attack is not gendered it's the gender inspires an increased level of attack i feel like it is gendered i wish we had data on this have you ever heard of the xkcd comics yes it's a really good comic wear and i this is something that i've dealt with a lot in my community okay there's a guy at a board and he fucks up a math equation and it's like wow you suck at math and then the next panel is there's a girl that does it and she fucks it up and it's like wow women suck at math and there's like that feeling that happens where when i bring on i want usernames but they're like youtube people that i've run on that have crazy opinions and when they're men that person is crazy oh my god he said the crazy stuff he's so dumb he's so crazy so stupid but when it's a woman it's like oh my god why do you always bring dumb women here why do so many women on the internet have crazy opinions there's a different like minority character that has to like stand it and like represent like their whole group where like white men don't typically have to speaking of groups versus individuals yes but then what i feel happens is then another person from that group comes another woman comes and people before she says anything will already feel like they're ready with that attack for sure but they're ready for the attack she's a woman they're gonna call her she's stupid because she's not because she said something about just because she's a woman so like the group in their brain accumulates all the negative characteristics of the individuals they've met not the positive the negative and it becomes like this ball of stickiness and then that becomes the bias for their judgment of a new person that comes with white men there's more of a blank slate in terms of bias of how they analyze the person with any any of the minority group they're basically make a judgment based on the negative characteristics of the individuals they met in the past i just that leads to a system where you're just harsher towards minority groups and towards women how do you solve that the first the most important thing for any problem ever is step one is to be aware of it if you're not aware of it then you're hopelessly lost at sea but yeah the first thing i like to say is just like be aware of it like i've had there's a girl that i've had on recently and she says a lot of in my opinion kind of crazy things but people will use her as like this is why women shouldn't be here this is like she's crazy and she's a woman and blah blah blah but i can bring on a guy who's similarly dumb things and he's evaluated on his own merits because it's a guy you know there's never ever ever been a case where i brought a stupid guy on stream and everybody's like this guy makes me hate men this guy makes me hate white people that has never happened but then there's like other women that come on and it's like now i know why installs exist or i totally understand where red pill ideology comes from you know and even if the statements are kind of true when you're making these observations over and over and over and over again it it damages your ability to individually perceive somebody and then two people that make the same statements one can be perceived more harshly just because of that like group bias you've got built up i think there's something about streaming that just brings that out of people like because you have to talk for like seven hours so you're like all right well whatever psychological issues and complexities i i have i'm going to explore that it's magnified magnified and then we'll and then it's as you talked about the memetic uh theory so gerardian like whatever the things that are very similar and you're going to magnify the conflicts that you have and you're going to explore the all the different perspectives on those different conflicts and i mean i don't i don't know if it's just anecdotal but it's nice to have women on stream and i think the dynamic that you guys have is is is wonderful is it's really interesting so yeah it's just a female voice in general i love having women on the podcast the female voice i feel like is under heard on the internet for sure and i would love the internet to be a place where women feel safe to speak all right given that you're like we talked about a progressive with non-standard progressive views so you're very pro-free speech pro-capitalism so given that it's very interesting that you're also pro-establishment and pro institutions so right now if you look at the world there's a significant distrust of institutions at least in sort of public intellectual discourse what is the nature of your support for government and institutions can you make the case for and against them broadly speaking there is a synergistic effect when two humans come together if i can speak very broadly in terms of we'll say utility okay my happiness with one person might be ten the happiness of the person might be ten but when they come together it's like 50 between the two of them there's like the synergistic effect when humans work together that the sum is greater than all the individual parts or whatever there's like an emergent thing that happens there there's a capacity there's a possibility of that yeah a possibility sure things could go really wrong there could be a cannibalistic tribe that all eats each other sure but for the purpose of this there's other failure modes but yes okay sure yeah further for the but well i think broadly speaking you're are you going to be the well actually guy okay if you wanna okay well actually well actually sometimes yeah they're actually good foreign true yeah sometimes things do going but i think broadly speaking the fact that you're sitting here in clothing that you didn't make and i'm sitting here on an airplane that i don't know how to fly or bill like right there's a lot of cool stuff that happens when people come together and they make civilizations and part of that civilization building is the fact that we can specialize and it's the fact that we can offload a bunch of trust onto third parties that we delegate the power to make important decisions about our lives right i don't know anything about how to like build like a combustion engine but i know that when i push the button on my car it's going to drive around and the fumes aren't going to kill me and i can park it in garages and the building's not going to collapse and the only reason all of this works is because i've offloaded a lot of trust under these third-party things and i would say that the pillars of these third-party things that society is built on are roughly speaking institutions so that might be the institution of peer review for scientific articles it might be the institution of voting for government right or the the ability for us to vote in that whole process it might yeah all the fda like all of these institutions and things that they need to exist because we don't have the time or the capability to individually sort through all of our all of these things individually we have to rely on some certain to do it okay so you believe at scale the when we're together we're greater than the sum of our parts that's the case for institutions absolutely what about the inefficiencies of bureaucracy is there some aspect when at scale different dynamics come into play than they do when there's two people together two people that love each other the birds and the bees is there some aspect that leads more to cannibalism at scale so like corruption inefficiencies that due to bureaucracy and so on bureaucracy which is not i hate it when people try to say bureaucracy is government because bureaucracy exists a ton in private environments as well right in businesses and everything bureaucracy introduces its own set of problems but i mean a bureaucracy is necessary because it's coordinating all of the underlying things in order in order to create something that's greater than the sum of its parts right like all of the software developers in the world are useless without being paired with good designers in order to make their products usable by a person and the coordination of those people and the coordination of increasingly more and more things necessitates some level of bureaucracy i think we always say bureaucracy when it's like a bad it's like a slur almost like you're a bureaucrat you're bureaucratic the bureaucracy is slowing everything down it's like sure the bureaucracy slows things down but bureaucracy also gives us things like you know safe medicine and safe water to drink for most of the us or safe buildings to live in or safe cars to drive so so the managers and institution versus like the software developers and the designers the managers is the bureaucracy the the reason bureaucracy is used as a slur is that something about human nature leads to bureaucracy often growing growing indefinitely becoming less and less efficient without a i mean this is what capitalism can come in that capitalism puts a pressure on the bureaucracy not to grow too much because you want the bureaucracy to be useful but not large yeah and to be a certain size yeah of course to be the minimum size to get the job done and so capitalism provides that mechanism government does not always and so that's the criticism of government of institutions where it can grow without a significant mechanism that says there's a cost to bureaucracy that's not being accounted for here we're just paying for the increasing size of government without the benefit yeah government is a special institution because it doesn't have to show itself to be financially viable and we kind of live in a capitalist economy where that's generally the case so government gets its powers from votes from the people which introduces a whole new set of possible positives and possible negatives right having something for instance that gives food or shelter to homeless people maybe you don't want that to have to run at a profit but giving you know an organization that can self-justify its budgets perpetually and definitely growing maybe that's not the best thing yeah we always have to figure out how to do the constraints there but what about the the corrupting nature of power that comes with institutions as well absolutely so then you better pick your your style of institution very carefully i think that the democratic institution we have in the united states today i think works very well but i mean there are other styles of government that have been tried in the past that i think lend themselves more to corruption not to say that by the way there's not corruption in the united states of course there's going to be varying levels of corruption at like all at all levels but you run you run into this interesting problem where authoritarian regimes can act with ruthless precision and swiftness because they don't have to ask any questions they just do do do do and that's it but the problem is is it's an authoritarian regime they're prone to missteps they're slow to respond to changing or evolving needs there's an interesting study that was put out a while ago that showed that like every single famine that happened around the world almost all like 98 of them happen under authoritarian regimes where like freedom of speech is very limited it's very rare for a famine to happen under democracy because press and everything makes the government more responsive to the needs of the people power can corrupt their levels of corruption but you have to have like a system of checks and balances on on all of those different levels to make sure it doesn't run off the rails i guess and do a sick loop-de-loop and you know half the population gets nice call back there's a lot of people that will listen to you say that the democracy in the united states is working pretty damn well and and they will spit out the drink if they're drinking a drink and be very upset can you make the case that they're right and you're wrong can i make the case the steel man there right yeah well the steel man for them is that people have a lot of problems on the day-to-day and when they look and they see what government is doing they might see potholes outside their house homeless people all over their downtown and the united states just approved another x billion amount of dollars for ukraine or they might be living in a city where half the factories are shut down a lot of their people out of work but the president is on the tv talking about how to find jobs for immigrants coming in from mexico and for these people they have problems that exist in their lives there some of them are paying taxes to alleviate these problems and then we listen to the when they listen to the government talk feels like the government is not responding to the needs that they have and then that's one problem then on top of that you've got all of these people working in alternative media they can show you well look at this politician wasting this much money or look at him double speaking here or there look at hillary clinton saying she's got a private position in a public position look at how all of these politicians have family members that are getting rich because of their relationships with people in congress look at the revolve door between capitalist companies and the government how can you look at all of that take into account that the government's not responding to your needs and then really feel like it's a government by the people and for the people yeah this was very good good steel man and good question how can you how can you how can you tell that they're not just politicians that care more about continuously winning the elections versus being running government effectively they should care about winning the elections that's the first misconception a lot of people say if this guy only cares about getting voted in this guy like he doesn't even believe about in a in fracking or abortion he just changed his opinion to get voted in anytime somebody says that you should say that's really good you want them to change their opinion so they get put it in that's the whole point of a democracy you don't want them to be remain obstinate you don't want them to say i'm not changing my opinion no matter what the people want you want them to evolve and adopt new opinions based on what the population their constituents are voting for yeah but the cynical take is that they're the cert on the surface they're changing their opinion but that there's a boys club where boys means the elite that under in the smoke filled rooms in secret they're actually have their own agenda and they're following that agenda and they're just saying anything publicly duplicate the public based on whatever the the the new trends are so this is yeah i understand somebody asked me this question and it flipped i i'0 completely i was a bernie sanders supporter in 2016 and my my single issue voting thing was lobbying i thought that lobbying the government was corrupt they weren't responding to people it was completely destroyed my faith in government everything and i had one question posed to me by a conservative that used to come home ice cream and chat with me and he said and then he asked me can you think of any any popular opinion that the american public has that the government is unresponsive to is there some big piece of legislation or policy or whatever that people want that the government isn't doing they asked me that i couldn't think of a single good answer i'm like oh geez this is a good answer there's drugs there's not drugs legalization of drugs yeah go for it all right well shoot you're doing the joe rogan thing you're pushing back because i brought up weed go ahead i'm sorry i have become meme [laughter] no because people bring up okay okay there's no issues there's no issues that the government is not representing of the public so here's the issue so somebody will bring up like well what about the legalization of drugs okay the first issue people have is one they look at national polling yeah very few things are decided on a national level so that's the first huge mistake arguably a lot of blm made mistakes in this arena where they're saying like why isn't the government doing anything about policing federal government can't do anything about policing that's going to be your sometimes any of your state government some of your local city government the people that like elect like your chief of police your police commissioner that's coming from your mayor right so you've got people looking one at the wrong parts of the government to even figure out the solution to the problem two oftentimes for polling the questions are vague enough that you can pull very high when you get into the weeds on things no pun intended you start to realize like oh shoot this is more complicated i thought i don't know the numbers in particular for legalization of of marijuana but this is what i'm going to guess is the case if you pull and you say should we legalize marijuana that number might pull at like 65 70 percent but that's including people that are in favor of medical marijuana if you were to pull like should we legalize should we decriminalize recreational use of marijuana that never might drop to like 52 and then if you pull like should we completely legalize not just completely legalize recreationalism that never mind dropped like 40 there's like all these different ways you can pull around issues where people like oh no we broadly agree on this topic when you really figure well do you do we really agree or is it just like broad consensus around a thing that's never going to show up like in a piece of legislation a really good example one example i do know is socialized health care i think if you pull there's a time a few years ago where if you pull america do you think every american citizen should have access to like free health care i think that answer that pulled like 74 yes but when you asked should the government be the sole provider of health care it dropped to like 26 percent dropped 50 points and you could see it was both asking questions about single-payer but the way that it was asked was so different that even if you all it looks like there's consensus there's not nearly as much consensus as people think around certain ideas you're right you're right you're right that polls the way you ask the polls really matters but when you ask should the government be in charge of a thing that also biases the answer right that like because there's such a negative experience with government creating a.gov site that runs the thing but sometimes sometimes i think if you dig in if you have a one-hour conversation with each individual citizen sure i think you will understand that yes there is support for socialized medicine like it's not the argument has to be made though yeah what do you mean like if you just ask a conservative like what about single-payer they're gonna tell you no you might be able to build up to an argument for it but you're gonna have to make the case for it no but i thought we're talking about the feeling deep inside your mind and heart does the government represent that oh so it's not like some shallow surface layer public opinion does the government effectively represent what the people want not a shallow survey but a deeply what they want i'm not actually that familiar with the debates over health care but let's maybe look at an easier one maybe you'll say it's harder war war is a really good example where the government was very responsive i think to the people you think so so iraq afghanistan the government didn't manipulate public opinion there's an argument to be made that they did in terms of like wmd and everything but after 9 11 were you in the united states after 9 11 after 9 11. dude i legit seems accusatory like what were you and then just checking okay all right cool i have evidence and oh sure witnesses no okay all right i'm very defensive right now it's very strange looking look into it alex yeah i think after 9 11 we could have gone to country we could have gone to war with any country in the world we would have we were ready because all of america was like oh my god and they pointed to iraq and you know the reasons for the wmds was kind of dumb but i don't think we even needed wmds to go to iraq we could have just said you know saddam hussein was giving medical aid to taliban al-qaeda iraq let's go and we would have gone for it but post iraq iraq was for a while popular and then became obviously deeply unpopular iraq and afghanistan and i think you could see that influence other foreign policy that the united states had for instance we opted more towards like drone warfare than troops on the ground for places like yemen we opted more towards like kind of like sending money and help instead of boots on the ground for places like syria and i think that a lot of that was kind of in response to how unpopular the iraq stuff had became and when you looked at a lot of elections afterwards even for obama like one of the defining characteristics of a lot of campaigns were like i'm going to close guantanamo bay i'm going to get us out of foreign wars even up to trump i'm going to i'm you know i'm not going to stop doing all this weird stuff in the middle east but they didn't still withdraw from a guest then they didn't withdraw but they definitely like tapered off and weren't like as aggressively pushing those types of conflicts because they knew it was unpopular but i think if you also consider perfect information or or good information if you ask a lot of people are you okay spending this amount of money money for this purpose so military conflict in iraq and afghanistan i think almost from the very beginning they would say no after 9 11 i feel like maybe like a few days after 9 11 like i remember what was it well there's there's some memes and so on yes but the nature of the public support for the war was there public support in 2003 which is when the invasion happened i feel like initially there was a lot i remember seeing it on but then i also lived in a republican household and i was not very like media savvy at the time i don't know if the nature of that public support had to do with wmds or with 911 because the weird came about wmds but i wonder what what is the name if you were to pull people and let's say hypothetically there was above 50 support for the war what would be the nature of that support and due to what degrees the government actually representing the will of the people versus some complex mechanism like the military-industrial complex is manipulating the narrative that's controlling public opinion and then there's the media that gets a lot of attention by being divided and how they're shaping the narrative through the mechanism of division so what there's a lot of complicated things yes it's not just like the people and then the government and that's yeah for sure i agree that there are going to be different elements at play and how much of those elements that lead us astray can be attributed to the largeness of the different systems so and the different institutions like the the media institutions and government the institutions that have a monopoly on violence let's put it this way which is what one way to define government sure it's complicated there's definitely different institutions at play i but i think that like all i would say is like in reference to my original point when there becomes like broad consensus around a thing i think the government will usually follow it's not going to fight it's going to follow more often than not but i think that a lot of times i think americans think that there's more consensus around certain issues and there actually are so like a really good example we're on that warp point too what caused like the lowest dip in biden's approval rating i'm pretty sure it was right after we pulled out of afghanistan which i think if i would have asked people like a year before like let's assume that we could pull out of afghanistan the government's probably going to collapse after we leave because they just don't have the will to fight they don't have the support they don't whatever they're just not going to work but like no americans are going to die there might be a couple other people but like no america's gonna die we're gonna say would you support that i think broadly speaking i think i think like more than 60 or 70 of americans are like yeah that would be fine but then when it actually plays it on tv when we see the people hang on to the planes when we see like helicopter embassy some of the quotes from politicians well now it's like oh my god this was horrible and it was so botched and it was so like it could have gone so much better well could it have gone better like maybe maybe not but i mean it seems like you can have consensus around its own opinion but the way that things play out and the way that people actually feel it's actually way way way more complicated and there's not usually this broad consensus opinion when all right yeah go ahead i'd like to believe that i mean just to leave my cars out on the table i have faith in the power of effective government i just have a lot of concern about what happens as institutions grow in size for sure and i just have a lot of worry about the natural corrupting influence on the individuals and on the system as a whole like the the boys club nature of it i don't know there must be a better term but basically they they agreed to the game and they play the game and there's a generational aspect momentum to the game and they more and more stop being responsive to the people that they represent i just feel like there is that mechanism and i think the nice thing democracy elections are resistance to that natural human mechanism also the balances of power is a resistance to that mechanism in some ways the media that reveals the bullshit of politicians is also a resistance to that mechanism it's it's hard to be full of shit as a politician because people try to catch you on it so there's a honesty method there that keeps you honest it's to some degree but it still feels like it still feels like politicians are going to politician yeah they definitely play their games that is true but there's probably always going to be that meta narrative over like governance that just develops as like you have to form relationships and play games to play get legislation passed and everything the all the only reason why i don't like it when people attack institutions is because one institutions are incredibly important arguably paramount no they are to keeping society running and two i think sometimes when we shift the blame onto institutions too much i think that we lose sight of what the real problems are so for instance in the united states today people might be very critical of the government not getting much done but then everybody turns their eyes to the government for being ineffective but what i would argue is i would say the government is actually incredibly effective and it's showcasing the will of the american people really well right now which is we are historically more divided than we have ever been and if i were to just look at the people and i would say we have a historic divide that is getting like rapidly blown apart by things like the internet and the media right if that exists well what would i expect the government to look like i wouldn't expect the government to be governing very fast i would expect that government to show that legitimate divide in people do you think that divide we have a perception of a large divide between left and right do you think that's a real divide this in this country narrow the language what do you mean by real divide do you think there is that divide in ideology that there's a large number of people that believe a certain set of policies and the different set of policies i think that's the perception of the on on twitter no i think there is a large divide in terms of belief i don't think that's very much divided between any people in terms of like what they like on the most fundamental levels want in terms like human beings but in terms of like democrat risk republican right now i think there is a huge divide in terms of the direction they want to see the country go and what they believe really and what they even believe is reality right unfortunately that's where we've gotten to can i just speak about the mechanism of the left and right here maybe on the memetic ratherly aspect is there some aspect to the left on which you're part of that attacks their own for ideological impurity more than the right does is it the bigotry of small differences there's a name there's a concept where when you're near somebody who is very slightly different than you you want to destroy but when you're with something that's way different than you you don't i think the left does it but i think the right does it too i didn't realize until i started dipping more into conservative communities but oh my god the people from the daily wire and the people from turning point and the america first all the all these different groups of people hate each other and they fight each other so much they hire and fire sometimes employees they talk smack about each other i think there's a lot of political division between both sides i think that the left just kind of gets highlighted more because it's like the internet and a lot of the internet spaces have a lot of left-leaning people so you see like the crazy communists and the crazy progressives and the crazy center-left liberals and the crazy blah blah blah whereas like a lot of the right-leaning people have kind of been pushed off of the main areas of the internet now interesting my sense was that it's hard to exist on the center left but maybe because i just don't have the full spectrum view of the political divide it felt like central lots is a difficult position to occupy yeah i would definitely say so yeah i don't know if it's that difficult to be center right it's very difficult to be center right i think actually maybe even more difficult because the center right person might be somebody who's like conservative but not a fan of trump and you're like over like look like liz cheney right you've had politicians that are just like they didn't back the trump stuff and now they're gone or you might be like center right but like you don't think the election was stolen and now you're like half the republican party is looking you're like you're crazy you know that's true yeah that's true i think there's a ben shapiro who i'm talking with i think he publicly spoke against trump right he did initially but i feel like he softened his language up on him pretty significantly but so there's a significant pressure to kind of coverage out to a certain kind of messaging which the whole republican party is feeling right now geez that two years from now that election is going to be insane it's just hard okay so to generalize it's hard to be in the center it feels like for sure center and then like do like a random walk among the policies around that i don't know what that mechanism is i mean it makes people like me not feel good being in the center it seems like people are just not nice to people in the center like the the public the twitter machine is not nice to people who are open-minded in the center is that there's some truth to that two reasons for that one is because i think a lot of people that market themselves as center are legitimately spineless cowards and deserve to be called out like like i've never killed the man but today might be my first i don't know there i'll take over like i told you i'll take over your stream with the ai is that guy going to be streaming the best okay gotcha gotcha gotcha gotcha lots of guys lots of gotchas okay guys okay gotcha okay and decrease the amount which already is a pretty low level of emotion just decrease it completely when people are screaming at you and accusing stuff just remain calm absolutely emotionless the gaslighter strategy yeah okay so what we're talking about so i i don't i don't even i don't ever identify center anything because it's got such a bad reputation because fuck that i stand center with the spine it's called being open-minded and it's not central left and right those are just labels here's a really good quote my mom said to me when i was really young she said stevie don't ever let your mind be so open that your brain falls out and that's what i find that a lot of center people do that's not what she told me last night so why are you like this i'm sorry okay i'm glad i can glad i can bring that i'm glad you feel like it's a safe space like i said before non-judgmental if you want to talk about fucking my mom you know what you're totally within your rights i didn't say that you said that i support that she's a beautiful woman her husband probably wouldn't be too happy about it but you know i didn't say there's any sexual relations i it was just that having a conversation with her you projected that that says more by you than me anyway go ahead about spineless center there are some aspects to that which is like amorphous to me center means you you think freely about each individual policy without being stuck to a case some idea yeah but a lot of people don't do that they call themselves centrist but then they're just they're anti-establishment essentially on everything i don't know your position on like vaccines or anything but like i've met a lot of like free and open thinkers who are like you know what i'm open to everything and it's an experimental vaccine and i'm gonna eat hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin because that's what the institutions are telling me not to take and i think fauci got too much money from that company and these are but i'm an open thinker and i'm and they what what open thinker because i'm an mit what do you think about position of vaccines is exactly i hear a lot of crazy things from a lot of people okay you might be from mit but i know you're from the internet okay people from the internet are weird and crazy so yeah well i who knows i don't like arrogance and i have criticized scientists during covet a lot of people but scientists included having arrogance which is fair but and that's and i think there's a lot of good criticism to be made of different scientific and medical establishments over a lot of stuff but nobody can make those good criticisms because they're too like obsessed over like just trying to have the anti-establishment answer and that is what is upsetting me the most like i think there are good conversations to be had about a lot of stuff related to how we handle the coronavirus you know we're lockdowns effective was there enough data to support the huge measures we took you know why didn't we have the option to show i was infected a month ago why do i need to be vaccinated why wasn't that option everything in the united states i don't think it was there are really good questions to be asked there but all the people asking the questions are also trying to tell you that ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies are the way to go for everything and the vaccine is evil and it's going to turn you gay like the frogs and it's like jesus like you can there's like no place to reasonably criticize from because all of the people that are criticizing aren't doing it with an open mind or you know they're not reading studies that do anything they're saying like i do my own research which means they listen to whatever the last game joe rogan said and now they're parroting that opinion easy no yeah the last guy on joe rook i'm not sure we're working okay that robert malone guy on joe rogan got me real fast that's one guest people see him as like the father of mrna technology he published one paper okay what do you mean people which people think that joe rogan fans i get like i run into these people i start arguing when they start studying me what about i'm a joe rogan fan and i appreciate the vaccine that's good i'm glad you do but there's definitely sorry also but you said there's a type there's a type what's the type what's the type of joe rogan fan anti-establishment i think that's not joe rogan that's a that's a general public discourse there's a default anti-establishment on the on the right and the left that's the default easy thing to go to i think joe rogan fans are definitely a certain type of anti-establishment though like i could guess to joe rogan fell like if i were to do general population versus joe rogan fan who do you think is more likely to be anti-vaccine do you have data on this are you just guessing yeah just guessing yeah i think you are actually judging i am i think you're judging because i think you're also the beautiful thing about podcasting this could be similar streaming is there's a large number of people that just listen like what what does it mean to be a joe rogan fan i don't think you just listen i think people listen and absorb the information i would say that joe rogan fanbase is as divided in the vaccine as the general public gotcha man i'm gonna look for pulling data on that i'm sure somebody's got to have done it out there but no but you're you're basically revealing the fact they have no data you're using your own judgment for sure based on how he's had conversations about how his experience with the coronavirus and then based on the guests that have come on that have talked and echoed a lot of like anti-vax talking points and been completely unchallenged and then based on statements he's made about like myocarditis and the vaccine and everything as well yeah so the it's the level of challenge and not that he's doing well yeah and then what his true positions are and then the types of guests he typically chooses to bring on to talk about the vaccines yeah okay but that represents somehow a deep anti-establishment feeling versus just the vaccine i mean i've seen the vaccine and other things being a thing that broke people in front of virus that whole one or two years broke a lot of people there's a lot of emotion and emotion quickly solidified into an opinion that almost had nothing to do with like re like thinking through and updating your knowledge and so on you just made up a made up your mind yeah but i think a lot of it comes from that anti-social place like what the vaccine represents the ultimate of establishment it was a huge private company backed by a huge public government and there's fouchy and there's biden and there's pfizer and there's all these countries locking us up in our homes telling us to do a thing like the vaccine was like the ultimate like submission tool to like show you that the government owns you not only you have to get injected once it's a series and then you got to get boosters and it's like they're trying to keep you under their thumb and it's that's the control i feel like that vaccine became like the ultimate rallying cry between like do you support are you a sellout that is going to believe whatever the government tells the sheep to take or are you going to be like the guy that stands against the crowd and gets fired from his job and pulls his kids from school because they're not going to let the evil fouchy medicine you know jab them in the arm and the funny thing is the crowd that stands against the institution is not larger than the crowd of sheep there's like one sheep standing there charm yeah or it feels that way sometimes sheep well okay what's the defensive institutions how do you regain the trust of institutions like first of all do you think that there's ways in which who cdc failed and do you think there's criticism towards pfizer and the big pharma companies that's deserve it the hamptons it's the pharma companies i'm not sure for cdc and who so here's a criticism that i have of all of academia and i feel it stronger stronger every day i don't think it's enough to be a researcher or to be correct about issues academia needs to increase its ability to communicate it is just an an unbelievable unmitigated failure that academics are unwilling to wade into the complicated topics that exist today because other people are you know first you call me spineless and then you call me a bad communicator but no look you're here you're doing it so you get props for me okay good job but there are like so many but i'm sure you've i'm sure that you must have heard another fellow academic a fellow colleague expressed some amount of frustration about like and there's specific discipline they know something to be true and they know that like a lot of the messaging is like wrong or bad in the public about it but they're never going to step out and say anything because either one they're very measured and careful with their take which they feel is incompatible with what people want to hear or two they're really worried that they might be incorrect so they're going to be cautious while everybody else is going out in like hardcore and they also don't have the supportive institutions for them to go out on a limb yeah so like to take risks for example i've heard that with lab league theory i've had a lot of biologists biologists friends they're like yeah it's obviously leaked from a lab like early on oh maybe okay we can fight over this one but sorry guys we can fight over this like they okay i should sort of backstep and say like that's like you talk about shooting the shed you haven't really investigated but it's your gut like this doesn't make any sense there would never say that publicly of course mostly because you're saying like what they would all say is like we want to see data yeah which would be good which is fine so they're going with like like this is too many coincidence in the same place that's the the logic but they don't want to say anything because there's no data you need to have evidence you need to have actual evidence to say one way or the other there's that but there's also just like you said i mean if effective effective communication you're a fan of sean carroll yes he's like one of the only people in this whole planet that i like besides you i love sean this is any time sean carroll is brought up as evidenced there's a smile that comes over your face i love of like joy yeah of like a little kid thinking about santa claus okay i love sean carol too i love sean carroll because there i hate this divide between like you're either stem or you're like philosophy arts and all that other stuff and the two worlds kind of across and i love that it was so good at physics but like explores and pays attention to all of the like sociological stuff too it's so rare to find that quality in a person he's legit one of the really really special minds but you don't have to be a sean carl you can be just a little better at educating another person in the in the medical in the health space is somebody named andrew huberman a friend of mine from stanford he's an incredible educator there's the kind of process in science that you should call like review or survey papers where you basically summarize all that's going on integrate it and like draw wisdom from it and also project like where's the discipline head and and andrew does that basically on all these sub-components of the different stuff going on in in neuroscience and biology and neurobiology all that he's able to he does a podcast called huberman lab where he just summarizes on and is able to explain like what does that actually mean for your for your life in terms of protocols of how to make your life better i feel like people should be able to do that more and more but with viral virology and oh boy that's a tricky one that's a really tricky one i wish that people could have honest conversations like i attack a lot of people that do the lab league theory stuff but truly we should be able to have that conversation publicly it just it always feels like the people that are having the conversation don't ever really want to have the conversation they're not being honest like like i'm a guy that like does his own research and it's so boring reading studies and a lot of it i can only do abstracts and like i like it's so much work but i'll never ever say that about myself i'm a guy that does his own research because every time i hear somebody say that they don't do any research when they say they do their own research with immunities they've seen one podcast and their opinion on this podcast is that definitely not mine because it was mine i wouldn't be criticizing anything they say but yeah so like lab leak is another one where it's like well how do you know it's lap league how do i know it's lab leak because fauci lied and hunter biden laptop okay come on you haven't engaged with it at all there's really interesting interesting research that shows us a really strong study that shows that there's like a high degree of certainty that it came from the wet markets very very high degree of certainty and there was an article that came out recently where it's like senate concludes that virus actually came from the wuhan virology lab or whatever and that whole article if you actually read it it never says that in the article i don't know why they tweeted it with that headline but yeah it's to back up i'm sorry i think we should have good you should be sorry yeah i'm not sorry actually i get to ramble here okay i'm here for a long time i rescind my apology okay i actually rescind my apology we should be able to have challenging conversations about things but you gotta man be well read on both sides not not this like i do my own research so i don't believe anything that fauci says like come on dude do you think you can do better than that not you personally but gotcha how does that feel it feels all right so people who don't know feel understood that's the catchphrase gotcha through all tragedy and triumph through all the roller coaster of life your response to it is gotcha yeah it's well actually let me jump to that before i continue to with political discourse psychologically you are in a lot of heated debates and you're usually super calm under fire until you're not sometimes you lose your temper completely very rarely but that's like your opinion man let me ask you about your psychology what are psychologically your strengths and weaknesses that you're self-aware about i think i'm very non-judgmental so i can entertain a lot of different thoughts without agreeing with them or condoning them i think that's a really big benefit to me for whatever reason i seem to be like pretty calm in dealing with annoying people it's why i got promoted at the casino so fast i could deal with like drunks or whatever like it just didn't affect me that much what percent of the population is annoying depends on how you're engaging with them most people aren't really annoying ever but they're doing like political debate how what percentage is annoying i guess it depends on who i'm debating and what the topic is well i guess i'm trying to point out the fact that sometimes you can say that reveals something about you if you think a large percent of people are annoying well i would say working graveyard shift when alcohol is involved that percentage of people goes very very high or to be more fair actually it's not a high percentage truly but if you're a server one bad customer can ruin the rest your shift so you only need like one or two people acting in that manner to just like totally throw you off and you're able to at least these days not allow that one customer to throw you off quote unquote yeah very much like a i noticed especially after having a son there's something about like six-year-old kids or whatever where it's like if they get mad they're never gonna be mad for that long like they'll move on like that's my mentality i'm like a six-year-old kid like i might be mad about something but i'll get over in like 30 minutes or an hour like yeah i'm pretty good about not carrying that through it's very rare that i'll like hold a grudge against anybody or like be angry about something or really disaffected by something over the long term it almost never happens to me what are your weaknesses psychologically i should say i still have a problem with projecting i think we all probably do but like my mind onto others it's like if i understand this and i've said this you should understand it and if you're not you're dumb that's like an issue that i i still have that where i project too much what about like holding grudges and stuff like that i'd never hold grudges i'm like the least grudgy person ever it's kind of a me and my community because anybody can always like come back as long as they're acting different yeah what about this as long as they're acting differently i mean all right the reason why i say that is because so for instance nobody likes this but i have a strong stance on apologies and then i hate them i don't ever want to hear an apology i don't care about them ever they don't mean anything to me if you did something bad as long as you've like fixed the behavior and you're not doing that thing then we're generally chill it's like there's been a lot of people that have been involved in weird stuff with me but then like they they go off they do their thing and they come back and it's like okay cool as long as you don't do it again like we're fine like it's all good i'm sorry you feel that way it's not your fault steven it's not your fault okay gotcha you've said plenty of negative stuff positive stuff and negative stuff about hassan yeah this is my podcast i get to get you to force you to say positive things what do you love oh i'm all about love let's go back to grilling me on the r word stuff where you're gonna make me compliment hassan this is gonna be a harder conversation than that all right you're there's we're going to get you to feel emotions okay so he's another for people who don't know he's another popular political streamer i think you had as the kids call it a bridge burning over bernie sanders i don't know my research is very limited on this sure but what do you respect and love most about hassan he puts in a lot of work when he was like growing his stream from 2 000 concord viewers to 15 000 he was streaming like it was like 12 hours a day like every single day so that was that we're gonna get a lot of work he does seem to be pretty good at networking and like socializing and making the correct friends and connections to continue to build his business what about him as a political thinker i know you don't think i leave him on that on that regardless that's not fair i honestly want to push back on that because okay i have zero respect for him as a political thinker oh there's not going to be almost anything so i will say i i admire the fact that through no actual capability or ability of his own he manages to wind up at some of the correct answers just because he's towing the lines that is good job for him on that he's got a lot of correct opinions just he has no idea why so i think that's undeserved i think that's too harsh man okay the reason i bring that up is i feel like there is a deep grudge in there somehow so you're the the father now so since you're so old the grandfather of the uh political debate on stream on live stream political debater so there could be some grudge about that split that happened or not enough credit given all that kind of stuff i just i just think he's somebody that has a left-leaning ideology that's different than yours he was a bernie supporter right and i guess you were not can you can you explain to me where the division is he exemplifies everything that i absolutely hate about which is what which is shallow engagement heavily ideologically driven and you're not ideologically different absolutely not absolutely that's that's what we're talking about like the free thinker in the real meaning of that word yeah so the way let me let me qualify your thinking let me qualify what i mean when i say that i spent a lot of time unfortunate time delving into the boring world of philosophy i spent a lot of time thinking about like what are my ethical positions how do i feel about myself like people around me and how that relates to the world around me and then from all of these positions i think you might have used the phrase first principles earlier from these kind of like first principles out of that is where all of my political positions are built out of like full stop so if you ask me a question like how do you feel about like the right to own a firearm or how do you feel about social health care like we can walk through well this is how i feel about it as like a thing from the government this is where the government gets its power this is ethically how groups of people are supposed to function this is morally how we relate to each other and personally this is how i feel like i'll be able to do every single political belief back there it's not like i'm telling you like if i were to ask hassan what do you feel about this political topic he's going to tell me what progressives are supposed to say i don't know what he thinks about i don't know don't you think that's a cynical take why is he just because his views coincide with the mainstream narrative mainstream viewpoints of progressive things because this i mean why does that mean he's not thinking because it's engagement with every subject is incredibly shallow 100 predictable like i could write like a i could probably program a script to like give you every single potential answer you could have to any single question you could give again i think that's pretty cynical take okay it could be the case that his brain perfectly aligns with every single manner but i don't know if you know it is perfectly aligns because i think you're just taking a very select just like streamers do of each other a very select slice that represents the perfect alignment as opposed to looking at a person struggling with ideas and thinking through ideas and then giving them a pass like a lot of people like i give you a pass on just the fact that you say a lot of crazy shit on stream for drama like which is i don't say things for drama it might be dramatic but i mean you've evolved as a fish evolves legs you've evolved a mechanism about which creates controversy sure that you could say it's not intention but it happens i think okay sure the extremists kind of learn that kind of thing and so i'm sure hassan does the same kind of stuff and so like underneath it there's still thinking being that's that's contending with political ideas you don't think so does a really good job at hiding it there are other political figures that i really don't like that i wouldn't say the same thing about so like i don't know if you have vosh right in there i'm like okay if that's a person that watched he also split out of my community and grew up to something i know he hates me and he's an anti-fan community and they all have hey tell me something you love about what my shit i can tell you a lot of things about vosh i think vosh legitimately thinks through a lot of his political positions i admire or did admire that he has like his own like positions he would take someone's contrary to people further left than him he's got some positions that don't fit his ideology kind of at all like he's his own independent thinker rhetorically he's very effective he was willing to sit down and do research for like his baits and everything he would spend a lot of time practicing like his rhetorical effectiveness and navigating conversations he intentionally purposefully built like a community that exemplified his values yeah i've got a lot i don't we're we are completely split and hate each other now but like i have a lot why why first of all hate is a strong what why the hate okay i don't hate him but he hates me because we had a couple of really big debates what happened well one had to do with whether or not you should live your values and can you give me the story that's a charitable interpretation i always give charitable interpretation you don't you don't absolutely do you don't wait seven five minutes ago you talking about hassan everything i said about sound is true there is no steel man there okay not charitable i'm sorry if you can if you can prove me wrong i would love for you to do it okay i'm using my gut instinct usually when somebody feels strongly about another person in that way it's not coming from a place of data and reason is coming from a place of emotion it's coming from a place of resentment and grudge and all that kind of stuff yeah there's deep there's emotions deep in there so the gotcha is hiding the the gotcha is is a surface of an iceberg and there's a deep ocean underneath that you yourself have not explored i disagree but i understand my love is actually a doorway the young lavasadory for you to explore the depths get into that ocean to find my fish my pre-evolved form yeah i understand why you think the way you do and you should you shouldn't believe me and i understand that because if somebody told me the same thing i think you probably just really don't like this person for a reason or two i understand what you think that way okay the reality is though for any political person that i disagree with like i can give them a fair shake it's one of the few things i think i do exceedingly well on my stream even with hassan there's been drama that he's been involved in and i've like very when i'm involved in drama he'll always throw me under the bus but when he's involved in stuff i'll always like oh like i think his son was right here or i think that he meant this there was a there was a thing that came up once we're on well ice cream fail he was getting roasted because he referred to somebody he used the expression shit skin to refer to somebody's like the way they looked and i have only ever heard that in the context of 4chan people talking about like indians or like black people like it's a racial thing but i could tell the context and everything that he was saying he was insulting some guy i think it was kind of like ncel version whatever he was going for like acne skin i think that's what he meant when he said it and there were a whole bunch of people that were insulting like oh my god did he just say racist term and i was like no i don't think he was racist i think he was like he was just reaching for words and that's what came out so like that's an example of me being sure but okay but didn't you criticize him for something i i was trying to like googled why the hell you guys split out because i thought your friends you should be i feel like you criticized them over something and i'm okay this is very vague memory but you criticize them over something and i felt that criticism wasn't charitable was it pete buda church stuff yeah pete booty yes yes yes yes yeah so i've said this a million times but there's no amount of context or no amount of nuances is ever acceptable people i don't think hassan is homophobic but i think the comments made about pete booty judge were really homophone that's what he said right yeah and there were a lot of people making a lot of comments that made me really uncomfortable about pete buddha judge that was insane to me spurred by the comments of hassan no but it was an environment of progressives all the progressives were attacking pete and i felt like his gayness became like the subject yeah why why throw hassan under the bus for that because he was jumping along with all of those types of like insults you don't think you've done the same kind of stuff if i do call me out and i'll probably that's what the r award was about that's a good call out yeah no but like your friend like you should privately tell them right like hey well no by then we were sworn enemies so so that wasn't the reason no no it was over at kamala harris videos sworn enemies yeah he hates me what am i supposed i listen for all of these people i will accept them back into my life if they ever want to come back in at any point in time but usually they're the ones if they correct themselves right no not i'm not expecting anybody here's so here's the deal with vashina son these are like the three we're the three guys online none of us will talk to each other hassan because he won't give clout to anybody and vosh because he thinks i'm bad faith and then neither of them will talk to me because they both hate me you guys should go like on a camping trip together it's like broke back mountain but three-way and just like rejoin refine yeah for each other honestly just from the internet perspective for me as a just stepping into this world there's some aspect to which you have a responsibility i hate that word you have another word you have an opportunity i i wish you guys would kind of be the beacon of like forgiveness and friendship and like camaraderie and that yeah i agree and even if we disagree it would be really good content yeah shit talk like friends shit talk sure versus not like the fact that you guys don't talk to each other like i would love for you to shit talk publicly with the camaraderie always there like there's love in the in the beginning love in the end but you beat the shit out of each other in the middle and that's what live streaming is for the political discourses that's that's great political discourse versus i think what underlies is some jealousy and so on with this you get this many i just want to make sure you're clearly everybody has to your audience yeah i'm sure you have flaws and i'm just not i mean in this dynamic hard to find you know because i'm your only flaws you're too modest yeah so what why did you guys split up because i i would love it honestly just let me just put that idea out there for you guys to to make up and so yeah it's out there of course everybody talks me vash anna son it's crazy that like the three largest like political debate left-lining people online like can't do any type of content or collaboration at all it's so stupid what was the reason you guys split up the the kamala harris so hassan's entry into kind of like the twitch political debate world was and i think 2018 i think he did a debate with charlie kirk and he reached out to me to kind of like review that debate to like go on to go over it on stream and he came on we went over it and then we kind of friendship developed we hung out of real life i think when i came to la i think i slept on his couch we played with his dog we were like kind of friends and as time went on and he was a little bit more he was farther left than he let on so like i was a social democrat he was a social democrat but back in those days like 2018 when people said they were a social democrat they really met socialists but they just didn't want to say it so he was farther left than me and we had a lot of deep divides in our approach to politics whereas like i was very much like a first principal this is my whole political position and he was very much kind of like a this is like the political ideology i'm involved in and this is kind of like the field that i kind of like navigate in so there were a couple instances where these divides would be laid very bare one was when i it was either him or the young turks i think it was him there was a shooting in a neighborhood where very young black child gets killed by a white shooter and they did a video about like hate crimes and how hate crimes are on the rise between races and white people are evil and blah blah blah not that but like white people committing hate crimes against black people and i remember saying gentleman was like hey we don't have all the data yet for this it feels really bad to make videos about this beforehand because it's the same type of shit that happens at airports you know is there a thing going on was it a brown person are they muslim it's islamic extremism we see this played out so many times in recent history probably not a good idea to jump to conclusions and he's like well no you don't understand like it's not that big a deal whatever and obviously as the story goes tale as old as time the data comes out it was just an errant shot there was like gang violence shot goes out of nowhere hits a kid in the car it wasn't like a hate crime like i was trying to kill a kid but yeah we basically we bump up against a few kind of political disagreements like this and an annoying thing is happening in my community where hassan is like the series political figure because he's from the young turks and i'm just kind of like i do politics but i also game and anytime i criticize a song like destiny you need to be more respectful he does this full time if you're going to bring criticisms you need to be like really well read and researched because he's got a you know more serious whatever which i thought was ridiculous so by the way if people don't know he worked at the young turks which is like the largest left-leaning youtube channel probably at least at the time yeah so finally he did a video on we skip ahead to some more minor disciplines he does a video on kamala harris he calls it kamala harris and it's like seven or eight horrible things about kamala harris and i'm like okay i know at least one or two of these things are not fully accurate so i'm gonna do all the research i'm going to have all the sources we're gonna have a long conversation about it so that now when i provide criticism to him it's not going to be like this horrible like just me saying something flippantly or whatever it's going to be like substantial criticism so i was on a plane ride jfk to orlando whatever flying to sweden to visit my wife and on the plane i review all the video all the data do all the research and i read everything i was like okay i get to my my wife's dad's house and i'm at the table we're having a conversation like hey we should talk about the kamala harris stuff and he's like okay well let's do it and we go over it and i'll leave to the audience to watch the video enough people say this i feel pretty confident in this i was pretty reasonable pretty measured pretty calm the whole time and think he started to get increasingly irritated that i was levying like more and more serious criticisms at like the quality of work that he did probably because he felt a little bit intimidated i think by my willingness to like dive through political stuff there'd been a couple of awkward blobs where like on there's like a show called the raj royale where sometimes politics would come up and his son would kind of try to explain something and there was another person one time on the show that made the joke it's like instead of hassan taking 10 minutes to explain this contestant he just come here and explain it in 30 seconds and he like exploded that he got so fucking mad at that so yeah i think that when i made that kind of call-out or critique of him over the kamal harris stuff he's probably feeling like increasingly irritated threatened agitated and then that's kind of what began the huge split so you don't think you were a dick at all i don't think so in that conversation especially given that like at that point because this is still 20' or 20 this might be 2019 i'm still known at that point as being very aggressive towards conservatives oh gosh yeah so and with lefties is what i call them i think i'm being very gentle like my conversation will start with conservatives like you're a fucking dude you're so dumbled like that's how i'm like doing something with him i'm like well don't you think that like this is like a little bit of like an inconsistent presentation about like i feel like i'm being honest but i always leave to the audience so they can go and watch that kamala video kamala harris video destiny assan if they think that i was being doing that but a lot of people watching said i was being pretty gentle so well let me say as a new fan of this space i hope you guys make up and i hope you guys fight it out in the space of discourse and ideas me too and also with the empathy understanding what the strength of the other person is what their buttons are and you know there's like an unspoken rule that you don't press the buttons that you don't need to unless you're doing it mutually and it's fun because you know it's on the piece each other off so yeah that's kind of like what friends do you don't cross a certain line but then other than that you fight it out okay let's step back one other super interesting aspect of your world view is your big supporter of biden can you explain what you love about biden do you love biden more than sean carroll or less sean carol's just like in another world of gosh admiration i feel like i'm culturally appropriating you by saying gotcha now but it's so convenient it's an easy word you're just i know we're on the same wavelength okay we're synchronizing that's good i mean it is really interesting because even the people that support biden usually don't say they love sort of they don't support it strongly you know ideologically philosophically the reason why i like biden is because he's really committed to this bringing the left and right together which is something we so desperately need in the country and his you know statements over and over again of like i'm not a the democrat president or the republican president i'm the president of the united states his desire to bring republicans together to work on things like the infrastructure bill that's so incredibly needed and i have a huge amount of respect and admiration for him for trying to push through on that message do you think then it's unfortunate that he made that comment about maga mega republicans yeah i mean i forget what the comment was but it's mega republicans are not good people kind of there i watched the full video and he's right there is this toxic aspect and it's hard to call out because they're always going to spend like oh he hits our republicans he's not if you watch the quote he's very specifically calling out like this this group of people that think that the election was fraudulent is it clear it is what he meant by we can bring it up all right this is oh no oh did i remember watching our stream it was like if you said it yeah that's bad you're probably like youtube maggot republicans biden but like it feels like it's pretty clear he's talking about the people that are like election denying too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal donald trump and the maggie republicans represented extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic i want to be very clear listen to this question clear up front foreign not every republican not even the majority republicans are maggie republicans not every republican embraces their extreme ideology i know because i've been able to work with these mainstream republicans but there's no question that the republican party today is dominated driven and intimidated by donald trump and the maggie republicans and that is a threat to this country i disagree with that man he didn't clearly say extremist ideology he didn't say the people that doubt the validity of the election i mean that's donald trump no but there's that's all the candidates that donald trump is supporting how many what is it like 40 50 how many candidates right now that are mega candidates are electioned no but there's you know 80 million or whatever people voted for donald trump you could say that's the mega republicans so it to me it sounded like he was referring to not even the majority i mean that that's one nice helpful clarifying statement but it's basically there's the mainstream republicans and then there's those that voted for donald trump that's the way i heard it okay and it's like so maybe you should have done a better job at clarifying but yeah i feel like there's like a clear there is a huge problem with this group of americans i think like the election is stolen i feel like that's what he's trying to no matter if that's what he meant even flirting with that line is not a person who's bringing people together i feel like the extending a hand to the like most i've worked with republicans in congress not all but not even a majority of republicans are like this no but why say not the majority of republicans that like to say like we are like we're one country we believe the same thing so like focus on the uniting part versus saying he does before and after that was 50 seconds okay but that you never know the point is you never say something like that listen like that you you've spoken about the bosnia speech which is your favorite of his yeah i went back to and listened to it before i move to that just on this it's really hard for him to call out that group of like election deniers i think without it always feeling well why call them out because it's arguably one of the most destructive forces that exists in this country today did it destroy anything they were trying to did it though it didn't did it so does that mean we don't call it out we wait till next time because calling it out is giving fuel to the division like the people that doubted the validity of the election that's anger that's frustration with the other side you heal that as opposed to saying all those people that believed that at any time are idiots they're un-american i mean they don't think the election was real i don't know if biden has the heirs of these people at all i don't know what he can do for there's people that believe the same thing on the in 2016 with the russian hacking right there's this down hold on yes that is a super not fair comparison there are definitely the mainstream democrat opinion was that russian intrusion in terms of like social media and stuff happen but there was never a claim that like the election was stolen no main or at least i don't know of any mainstream democrat that supported that donald trump is not just saying there was interference donald trump is literally saying the election was literally stolen that vote boxes were ballot boxes were hidden that vote tallies were manipulated that i think the claim is there's a huge gulf of difference between the two so you can attack donald trump for that yeah i believe it's not the words of a uniter to attack people that believe that you could argue maybe it's okay but especially not being super clear about that about who you're referring to when you say bag of republicans okay because maga is a hat and a slogan that refers to whatever the number is 70 million people whoever that voted for donald trump like if all the republicans are consider this mega republicans what percentage of them do you think believe the election was stolen i feel like that number is i don't have the palm but i feel your number is like probably more than 70 percent what's what's america republican maybe i'm not like trump like a trump supporting we're probably a mega republican they're there for trump what's the difference between somebody that voted for trump and mega republican and america republican so my mom is a mega republican if trump ran independently and desantis ran under the republican ticket my mom would vote for trump she'll follow him to the end of the earth that's like a mega republican i think it's easy to mistake that distinction in these kinds of political speeches because to me anybody who voted for trump can easily in the cut in the context of the speech be interpreted as a matter of republican gotcha i understand what you're saying maybe he could have been more clear but like i think in listening to that like i think it's pretty obvious who he's talking about but i guess if you have an emotional response to it i can understand the emotional response but there's a lot of people i don't have an emotional response i just don't like i think i'm with what is it michelle obama they go low we go high meaning like to me a uniter doesn't participate in derision sure unite or might not but a leader has to be able to accurately assess the situation before him and make people aware of what's going on you mean all the impeachment trials all the censoring from social media all of that didn't do the job that's not his job i don't know that mechanism his job is to inspire a nation to unite a nation how can he do that when half the people don't believe that he was even legitimately elected like i think he's done a good job at working on legislation and doing stuff that hopefully benefits all americans but i think it's important to recognize that like there is a contingent of americans that don't even believe like this is plenty of people that recognize that and are fighting that and are constantly screaming that from the rooftops his job is to be the inspiring figure that makes the majority of americans be proud for him to be a president of of the nation they love and that's what the united aspect is is you remind people that we are one and we love this country will have the ideas that it represents who does that in other parts of that speech it's like a 20 minute speech isn't it but that's a fuck up you just don't participate in that division anyway i i understand i understand i just wanted to push back on the saying one of the strength is that he's he's uniting but yes that that is an ideal that is a goal is a great one and he is one that espoused that goal for a long time do you think what else does it so from policy perspective and so on i thought the way he's handled ukraine and everything thus far has been almost perfect i think he did a really good job at the political maneuvering and bringing other countries into the fold at establishing clearly like what our mission was in relation to ukraine i thought he did a good job there i admire him for pulling out of afghanistan even it was a little bit rough around the edges like we got out and we're gone no american lives are lost the domestic policy he's passed more major legislation than i think anybody thought possible the green energy stuff for the last bill the infrastructure bill a lot of the coronavirus relief i thought was really good especially the expansion of the child tax credit so from a policy perspective for an end domestic i think he's been successful rhetorically i think he's generally been above board in terms of like not attacking people being too divisive he's trying to bring people together and work on them what do you think about the sort of popular in the media criticism of his mental decline do you think he's experiencing no he's not a guy what do you think i mean i do yeah maybe a little bit but he's still doing a good job so you know not from a speech perspective you mean from a policy perspective yeah i'm analyzing it as a job yeah from speech perspective maybe not the greatest but yeah i mean he's definitely what is he like 80 81 how old is he i lose track after so many years yeah but you did say that he's probably going to run in 2024 and he's probably going to win did i say that that he's probably gonna win no way did i say that somewhere he's probably gonna run okay who knows who will win but i think i feel like the incumbent advantage is so strong you're really gonna throw that away like it's not like one or two times in history in the us right where like the non-income the parties put somebody else up yeah i mean the the concern is like the just the age and the the the the mental decline just the the wear and tear of the campaign all that kind of stuff all the speech you have to make the debates and all that kind of stuff yeah so you see what happens what the least excited i mean two years when i was a long time and his current mental state yeah he could run and do it he could do a passable job in two years man i don't know i've seen videos of bill clinton recently he's looking pretty rough you know if biden is looking a lot more rough worse for wearing two years then maybe they actually do have to dig out another person for run ionas foreign what do you think about trump when he won in 2016 i think is when you came to fruition politically speaking so what do you think has winning the 2016 election represents so for me trump the end the reason why i got into politics was trump was like this new epistemic force in american politics that like you'd kind of have to like flirt with facts before even if you wanted to be non-factual he super didn't care lying was like a first language to him just like in speaking in terms of like the the way that he used language to just say to you what he felt like you needed to hear to support him and not care at all about what is going on about yeah that that's that's what trump represented to me in terms of like things that i cared about he also represents a lot more obviously that there was this undercurrent of american opinion that a lot of people didn't know still existed and it did he got elected that the overton window was misidentified by even a large amount of the republican party that populism was a lot more popular than a lot of people figured you know yeah there's a lot of it i guess he representing do you think trump should have been banned from twitter can make the case for and against it so you're a big supporter for free speech yeah so the case in favor of do you think he should be brought back as elon yeah because if he gets brought back it's a higher chance that i'll be brought back so i'm supporting that all the way thank you elon unban my account so because you called me weak spine i'm gonna have to message elon okay at omni destiny it was a verified twitter account omni destiny yeah no i'm just kidding why'd you get banned from twitter destiny i don't know i'll add that to elon i saw that there was a screenshot of you referring to the rape of somebody okay that was on an older twitter account and that was a bad tweet you have multiple twitter accounts so you're trying to go around the bands that you keep getting okay hold on you're slandering me a lot right now okay let's get the facts straight okay i don't even remember why my first chicago banned but it was a wild account i tweeted some wildly inappropriate things you regret i don't like that word i'm gonna give the answer to most people get but it's like i don't regret it because i learned a lot so i'm glad i had the bad experiences why don't you like the word for good i think if we look at where we are how do you feel about determinism i believe in hard the hardest of determinism that's who i am okay so sure who i am today is the culmination of everything that's occurred in the past i believe you speaking of sergeant trump i believe in you speaking about regret is a nice way to communicate that in this deterministic world you've analyzed the acts of the past and you're no longer that person yeah of course for sure that's what that's what regret usually means okay thanks for giving me the human explanation okay true so in that sense there's a lot of things i've done that i regret oh you're what are you you're not human you're a bot npc is my preferred okay all right i wish i would have been smart enough at the time to not have to have had made those mistakes okay there you go good job but yeah obviously really dumb really crazy off the wall tweets but that account got bad but then i made another account called i can't believe i'm giving you a history my twitter accounts but another account called omni destiny it's an honor and that was my i got verified i was cool they let me have that account because originally abandoned i said appeal and i was like oh let me have one more and back then twitter was cool and they're like okay go for it and that account lasted for a long time and i don't actually know 100 why that account got banned i believe that the tweet that showed up in the final i got banned for hate speech and it was because i was there was a picture that i tweeted with three different alt writers that are kind of like neo-nazi people and they were all like mixed race people and i said like the new alt-right looks like a disney channel original movie in terms of racial composition and somehow that got flagged for instigating violence against minorities i think and i think that's a tweet that got me banned because i think that's what showed up in the final report but i don't know maybe there were other reasons because nobody ever communicates but ever since that account went under it's just been renovating ever since so a ban evading ever since so all my new accounts have around just get banned because they finally figured out it's me and then they benefit there's like one dude at twitter hq who's like constantly looking for my new accounts and they get me yeah yeah anyway yeah so post trump world but do you think okay i mean this oh should it be banned oh you asked me to make both cases should he be banned i mean damn dude when you're tweeting out shit that's arguably leading stuff like january 6th i can understand why because it's like what else is this wild dude go to tweet out like is he gonna start instigating other violent events so i'm sympathetic towards the like okay well he can't just be here saying stuff like this that's insane we're gonna ban him instigating yeah your instagram violence in the physical world yeah like if i would have tweet stuff like that i would get banned probably on the flip side this is the president of the united states it seems like he's like doing presidential decree by social media sometimes like is it really right that one public or private i should say one private company can like erase the president of the united states words from the eyes of a lot of americans that are using these social media feeds and one big one which i for sure am against is the permanent ban yeah i don't like that i hate that even in my community if somebody comes back every like a year like i mean did you just compare yourself to the president of the united states i've not got myself to twitter banning the president united states let me put it this way if i ban donald trump in my chat room i don't ban him in a year a year yeah what's the process for on banning donald trump what would he have to do usually people send me an email they're like listen i did this stuff i'm sorry i was dumb i'll give them another chance but a year what if they send an email a month later usually i'll learn better that's actually my i banned pretty quickly my community but if you ever asked softy okay i usually let them back yeah i'm very well because i used to be the worst type of internet person and i think i'm a little bit better than i used to be so not that you're older yeah now that i've matured yeah of course age bestows a wisdom that just can't be gotten any other way what's your sense in general is there something interesting you could say about your view on free speech it seems like one of those terms it's also over overused to mean a lot of different things what does it mean to you if you have a democratic style of governance you are interesting people with one of the most awesome and radical of responsibilities and that's saying that you're going to pick the people that are going to make some of the hardest decisions in all of human history if you're going to trust people to vote correctly you have to be able to trust them to have open and honest dialogue with each other whether that's nazis or kkk people or whoever talking you have to believe that your people are going to be able to rise above and make the correct determinations when they hear these types of speeches and if you're so worried that somebody's going to hear a certain political figure and they're going to be completely radicalized instantly then what that tells me is that you don't have enough faith in humans for democracy to be a viable institution which is fine you can be anti-democratic but you i don't think you can be pro-democracy and anti-free speech within reason so what's the within reason so i mean do not you can't post like child porn or something on twitter where people try to get you on that stuff or like direct calls to violence are probably not you shouldn't be tweeting out like we're gonna meet up tomorrow go bomb blah blah blah so do you think it's okay to allow racism and anti-semitism and hate speech hate speech yes because that's can be very broadly defined i can understand there being some basic rules of like no slurs on like a platform that gets into like acceptable forms of moderation or like excessive harassment and bullying i can understand but past that when the when the moderation becomes ideological i get a little bit nervous because you know for for there's a whole other yeah there's of course it's all a gray area but when it feels like ideology has seeped into the censorship not good yeah which it's so fascinating to think especially now that elon bought twitter how did you engineer a system that prevents ideology from seeping in and nevertheless is able to create a platform that has healthy conversations because if you have one guy who's just screaming nonsense non-stop it it has this effect where the quiet voices at the back of the room are silenced yeah so like that that's what you usually don't talk about like if you let one annoying loud person in that's actually censoring the voice of a lot of people that would like to speak but they don't get a chance that's one of the things especially around like trans discourse i have to constantly do that like reminder for my audiences of like when i'm dealing with these types of people on the internet a lot of them might seem really crazy a lot of these types of people might seem insane but like in the real world outside of like the crazy twitter activist world like the vast majority of people you're meeting from lgbt communities are like the coolest normalist people all they want is to like write to live their life and the way they want to and to be like unobstructed and like yeah but people will get this impression of like an online activist like a vegan or lgbt person or whatever and then they think that every single person in real life is like that and it's a really negative stereotype and then even the other people in that group oh is maria coming over oh yeah know that's her okay molina just joined us what were we talking about was it interesting you were saying that you were going to talk to elon about getting at omni destiny the verified twitter account on ban i said that's so it sounds like a lot that's so gracious of you i can't believe you would do that for me and then you admitted that you tried to evade the ban multiple times which i'm sure would be very looked upon you know i heard that in norway in their prison system they don't actually punish you for trying to escape jail because that's like the natural human thing to do hug you what do they i don't know if they but they don't punish you because of course you're trying to be free that's all i'm trying to be on twitter i'm just trying to be free oh that's the natural human yeah that's the natural hair of course it's the benefit you're not a destructive force you're just no i'm a positive i'm a force for good that's why all my accounts only get banned for bad new vanishing i don't get banned for doing bad things on a progressive show i'm like far left i love like progressive classes this is what you criticize hassan for being i show them from a place of first principles not from a mindless ai echoing kind of thing you know okay see your free thinking bot yeah exactly all right cool well i'm sure we'll return to some politics that was beautiful malia can you tell us about yourself you also a fellow streamer your story i stream and i started streaming because i met him basically kind of but i don't do the politics i do like travels or talk about relationships talk to my audience basically you're from that part of the world right sweden yeah so did you escape from prison and they didn't that was norway that's different i actually really i've been to sweden a bunch of times i love it there's a tech sector there that's really like flourishing where did you go which city i went to stockholm i think i gave a few lectures there there's a vibrant tech sector it was cool and people are super nice yeah we're friendly we're not like very deep like we don't really have much deep conversation it's like a meta oh there's not many intellectuals that come from sweden we don't really speak very highly ourselves but kind of like just chill all the time we don't make a scene we don't we're just like there's a you know do you know what the name for that is there's a specific name for it yeah the login yeah yeah oh there's a philosophy behind it when you're part of like sweden or norway you like you don't talk too highly of yourself because it's seen as kind of like rude like think of like america except the exact opposite you don't even really want to like you don't want to make yourself into a victim too much you don't want to be too much of anything you're just like sticking to the to the group don't make a big scene about yourself but that said you came here and you were you put yourself in front of the camera and became a streamer do you understand how weird that is for my friends in sweden i just didn't talk about myself and just like make a big deal about myself for hours every day was that like terrifying did you have anxiety about that no because i don't see them but then i come back and i'm like oh so what do you feel like when you're actually streaming you feel like you're just alone in a room one-on-one type thing no i see i see chad i'm thinking oh they're like little fairies they're not really real they're just like out there i don't know what they look like i just see little names and they're just cute colors you know you're talking to little fairies inside your hands is that how you feel about chat they're demons for me they're demons okay my annivers are they so is chad a source of stress or happiness like is there no for me that's a source of happiness i've been very intentional with like the construction of my community so i'm really happy with where it's at how are you able to actually have deep political discourse while playing a video game at the same time i have a really good chat room in terms of like the way that people engage in conversations like i was one of the earliest people to embrace the philosophy of like i am in total control of what people watch me think that like i have a high level of responsibility for how they conduct themselves and then if i conduct myself in a certain way i can expect a certain level of conduct from them and for the most part it's like worked pretty well for the past you know nine or ten years yeah what about the actual playing of the game and you're able to paralyze the brain like oh like it seems like factorial seems like a super complex game yeah i don't actually think that's possible i don't think multitasking for human brain is possible if you see me playing a game usually what's happening is the conversation is like i've had it a million times so i'm not thinking about it i've automated that or if the conversation is very challenging then if you watch me if you really watch what's happening again i'm probably just running around in circles because i have to think about the conversation okay because with factorial it looks like a lot of stuff is going on sometimes yeah so like it's hard for a person who hasn't played the game to detect that you're not actually love is like you're super intelligent can multitask or does it come off as like he's not interested in this conversation at all yeah yeah there's a coolness to it like when you're not paying attention like if if you're looking elsewhere like you're checking your phone you're too cool for this conversation there's a sense like that yeah the reality is though is if you watch it was easier to see in minecraft because in minecraft when there was a challenging conversation if you watch me play i'm literally just running around and jumping in circles because i have to think about the conversation 100 i can't do a complicated task and think about the conversation or like that people always joke in my chat like oh no the notepad came out if it's a really challenging conversation i'll get rid of the game and i'll bring out a notepad and i'll start writing stuff down to keep track of what's going on yeah so what kind of stuff do you stream so advice you talk about yeah like either i talk to chat or i travel around basically like could have a conversations or we like go to countries i've been to like italy i was gonna live like one and a half months just like traveling around alone going to cities like having like my camera with me and like streaming for hours where's the where's the coolest place you've been to ever it's probably new zealand new zealand i think so yeah after it's probably going to be italy i think because they're like history and also both history because new zealand is also been beautiful it does both natural beauty and historical beauty yeah yeah for sure i think i just really like the like the polynesian sort of culture i think is very interesting like the ocean people and it's just really beautiful people are very relaxed chill they're very far away which is interesting as well because whenever they talk about politics or they talk about just like the world it feels really far away so where is home for you is austin home yeah we travel we've lived in a lot of different places and traveled around yeah so that's what you think of home is like i think so yeah i mean if if they're gonna be a place it's probably gonna be like my childhood places probably yeah like my old country house or something like that we don't have it anymore but like that's that's like home for me i guess so how'd you guys meet each other you're currently married yes to each other yeah yeah to each other yeah all right cool how'd you guys meet i was watching his youtube stuff like 2018 i think like because it was the swedish election around that time and i was interested in politics and then i think he said in one of his videos that he had an instagram and that he needed people to stop dming him that wasn't cutie pie's and then i messaged him and said am i a cutie pie and the europe pie in like two minutes and then that that's when i was in new zealand and i guess you wanted to escape america or like your life for a little bit and where were you mentally there look because we've talked to this timeline where it's 2018. was it'19 where is the low point or says that was way early low point carpet cleaning that was like two thousand 2010. oh okay 2018 was probably your peak what do you like now is my peak what do you mean that was my pick why would you say that no nobody ever admits being past their prime just just well i mean my promise okay it was around it was probably around the time where you were getting a lot of lefties through your community and you were really like thinking about that they would go too far maybe that was i think that was still when hassan and vosh were both in my community exactly so i would say if it feels like there was not really like much issues when it comes to like to your stuff or like your work stuff back then oh suddenly we didn't talk about is it like there were no politics on twitch i exclusively inhabited that place for like two years because nobody else did it because it was a really toxic environment for politics so for a couple of years as it grew like the i kind of grew the whole space because it wasn't nobody was doing it yet what did that look like you're having like political debates political discourse yeah mainly like going into youtube people to try to argue with them or just doing politics on stream like reading stories researching stuff talking about stuff but there's not like other people on twitch to debate about politics because there was no politics it was yeah was there a debate in the space of communism socialism social democrats kind of like this are you trying to outline your own position during that time i think it was mainly me fighting against conservatives because it was like trump stuff and then it was coming off the back of like there was this movie called gamergate and there was all this anti-sjw stuff on the internet and i was like the sjw like the progressor that was fighting on the progressive side of things so i think that's what i was known for but i was fighting with people off of twitch because on twitch there weren't very many political discussions happening so you were holding the sjw flag yeah to what to what degree do you still hold it like what's the best what's the steel man case for sjw i mean like i'm still very much that sjw from 2018 2019 but the positions have moved so much farther left that i don't know some people may not call me that anymore i'm not sure it depends on who i'm talking to because basically what is a social justice worry like being sensitive to the experience of others yeah being sensitive and empathetic towards the experience of others and then trying to build a better world that like suits as many different types of people as possible while being like aware of like their names okay so you guys might from your perspective is that does she she is she telling lies is it accurate no it's pretty accurate okay when did you guys actually meet i flew out in 2019 like in february yeah basically there was like weird stuff happening in la i just come off of kind of a weird not kind of sort of relationship and i just wanted to like go away for a while another company reached out to me and they had like a fun streaming device and they said they'd sponsor a trip if i went somewhere and i was like oh well i know this person i know a couple people in new zealand i'm only it was one of them it's like i'll go to new zealand new zealand it'll be fun and yeah i did that for two weeks do you guys believe in love hey i feel like you're you lack the gotcha got us into this i'm not sure to disagree to what you have human emotions i have quite a few okay from your perspective when did you when did you fall in love with millions the minute i saw her i don't know we our first two weeks together were a lot of fun we had a lot of chemistry in person i was kind of shocked that i wasn't thinking about it because it was like we spent like a week together and you said i really want to tell you something and you realize i don't remember you were like stalling that for the longest time i think she was oh he said that like i love you no he basically just said like i really like you and it never really happens that's what he said and i was like no and i thought hey i thought so let's tell ryan we said trump getting banned from twitter is that what we were talking about before oh yeah hey you agree with me coming on here of course i'm gonna be doing this how long so how long did that take two weeks you said well that took like a week no i don't know i think it was just like the thing is my mind process is like information so quickly two weeks to somebody like you is actually like years for me so oh like me yeah so there was like a lot of like factorial type of strategic thinking yeah going on i was seeing like all the events like doctor strange or whatever and the avengers when he's like singing to all the future you saw me you just saw the future yeah yeah you're doing like some game theoretic simulation of all the possible outcomes exactly okay but no yeah it was probably pretty soon i realized that we had a lot of chemistry yeah i think before i left after my two weeks there i was like we need to make sure you get like a ticket to come visit me in the united states because it'll be fun and everything and then yeah i kind of decided that last minute too it was like really like five hours before your flight back we kind of realized because because it was kind of like men is just like a one-time thing and then that was it they were like oh no this is a lot of fun we should probably hang out again oh so you realized you would miss each other yeah yeah the melancholy side of love okay when did you fall in love with dude i thought he like hated me i don't know i thought not hated me she still thinks i hate it but no no i i remember like what he said that he really liked me i was kind of a little shocked about that because i i don't know there was a lot of like random things happening in new zealand it was a lot of fun but it was definitely like very interesting like things that happened because i i was like around a lot of other people as well so i thought he might have had like a really bad time but when he said that i was thinking about it more and then we spent like more time together like a week after that and then it felt like that was more like real and i think when he was about to leave i kind of realized like no i really like him did you guys ever say love to each other like i love you yeah of course yeah okay all right i wasn't sure why would you ask that what has you said before because i haven't i haven't i don't think i've heard you speak the only time i've heard stephen talk about love is when you're like criticizing the the red pill community saying they don't ever talk about love and relationships almost all the time i'm giving criticism to people like i said i'm kind of stepping in i'm very disconnected from my own emotional experience because i'm trying to talk with him there so it's pretty rare that i'll talk about what is your own emotional experience exactly highly blunted i guess there's a lot okay what does that mean i mean what's the what's deep in there i are you is this just who you are genetically or are you running from something i think i have a pretty good understanding myself a lot of people make that accusation to me but i don't think i am okay this is just who you are that's just who i am yeah okay there's not childhood stuff like drama it's all sorted done you figured it all out yeah in your old age as i grow every year i figure out more and more he did mention i think i heard this somewhere that this is a source of fights for the two of you the h thing i felt the ageism throughout this whole conversation he's basically he's saying that he gambles like with time he's just like i think she will be good later and then just like it's like an investment yeah yeah that's like what he's doing when this treasury bond matures i'm gonna be able to capture what do you think so far is the stocks going up or it's tumultuous it's like bitcoins yeah i like bitcoin crypto mill all right if you guys don't mind one interesting aspect of your relationship is you're in an open relationship what's that like from a game theoretic simulation perspective what went into that calculation and like how does that like how that started or how did that started sure the only relationships i've ever done has been open relationships since i was like in high school because i didn't really understand like why wouldn't you be able to like do other things with other people but then just like have your main partner basically so what what is an open relationship generally speaking that means you have one main partner not a monogamous relationship like you're somehow allowed like in different ways you can see other people sexually sexually but like there is one main okay or it doesn't have to be that for some people but like i think it's probably easier and we probably don't really have time or the energy for like more than like one person to like really like what about like emotional it's really complicated there's a lot of complicated stuff going on under the hood there yeah i think broadly speaking you've got like polyamorous relationships and you've got like open relationships where polyamorous is like oh i've got like three different girlfriends and we all hang out or sometimes even live together or three boyfriends whatever and then you've got like open relationships which is like oh you know like you can basically hook up with other people and then you've got like your main relationship and that's it i think ours is probably somewhere in the middle of that to where like we've got like long-term friends some of them we hook up with and that's kind of how we yeah it's a delicate dance that explodes every six months on itself if it doesn't explode you guys fight over it we fight over some things yeah i think it's mostly because a lot of people can't handle it and they they agree to something and then they realize that they're way too cool and then they get really obsessed and they think that they can like get in there and then it gets really dramatic have you figured it out like i feel like we figure out things more and more like when it comes to like what's a good person for us to hang out and what's not a good person for us to hang out with or like i probably have more opinions on like who he hangs out with because he likes the fucking psychos yeah so you you like the song you like the not like the crazy ones like the baby trap sort of women that's the that's the ones and i don't remember that because that affects me that affects your game theoretically yeah right you like to surround yourself like in general you've talked about with crazy people i say crazy and i really shouldn't it's a humorous way it's like yeah they're very unstable very can be unstable but people that are very unique like when i meet this person that's like not boring yeah not boring yeah and you said that you're progressively becoming not boring yourself no i think i'm pretty stable i don't let them affect me much but so you don't think they affect your no if i've said that i've said a joke i think i've like i've got my stuff like really well figured out it's what allows me to engage with people like this so easily because i can engage i can make them feel seen and heard and then if it gets insane i can cut off and i can be chill like very few things affect me in the long term you guys experience jealousy usually like whenever i feel like he's not spending the like the amount of time that i'm asking for and he spends it on his video games or his stream or like he sees someone else like more than he sees me or something like that that would like not be good because then it affects like our relationship do you have a good sense of like is it literally time or is it the energy put into the it's probably like if like if he's with me that like the attention in the time like when he hangs out with me and then there's also probably at a time so if i feel like something else is distracting too much like it could be work or it could be a friend or it could be anything like if i feel like it starts to take away from like me then i'm having an issue with it i don't think he really cares much i guess the only jealousy you experience is probably when you feel like like if i get upset about him seeing someone too much and then i go see someone more and then he's like why can't i go see my friend more like as much as you so like that's the sort of like thing that we're trying to navigate on i guess i think we we we are like diametrically opposed sometimes in terms of how we view like engagement with people or engagement with the world sometimes so like on her end of the spectrum like a perfect week for her might be like being in a cabin watching like fireflies at night going hiking every morning going swimming at the beach because it's like you're taking in like the grandeur of nature you're like connected with yourself you're like very at peace everything is like chill and cool there's the wind the feeling of nature everything that's like her peak living experience i like being present yeah and like my peak experiences are like people trying to destroy my life like the challenge of like navigating a really complicated discussion like you know several different dramatic offense unfolding that my in my career like these things are like very i like the stress and the action and the entertainment and everything's like very cool for me someone we're together she generally wants me to be like more chill but if i don't feel like i'm being like stimulated a lot then it's easy for like my mind to wander somewhere else or yeah that's kind of the issue yeah we have a very different way of like engaging with them so how can you find happiness and stillness i feel like if you're just like aware of it and we're trying our best like whenever we like we're supposed to do this one thing so let's say that we want to go to new york and i'm like we should just like go out and do this one specific thing we try to find something that he enjoys doing like now that we're in texas we can go shooting or do something fun that he enjoys then we can do it and then i think like just like for me also to be aware that like when he spends a lot of time on crazy people it's not because he like loves them or wants to be with them it's just because he likes being like having having his life destroyed like you said which i don't really do this is a completely different thing so like for me to like understand more like how he's thinking because it's so different from mine and for him to understand how i'm thinking about things and like what i prioritize in my life i think that's like how we navigate but i think it's good i think the differences can be good like when we're finding a way yeah well i think you're you're relatable like i always tell people that like if you're dating me for like more than a few years like you get like a an award like a war zone that you've survived absolutely you're like a veteran you get a medals and stuff and it's always like i think there's probably been like six different i don't think she says it anymore but they're like six different times in our relationship where she's like is it always like this is this extra yeah and like every next year isn't the beginning of about like you were lying about that yeah you were not you were like no it's just like right now i'm having a huge argument online about seeing the n-word in private and it's just gonna be like this and i'm gonna be streaming 24 hours a day and i'm like we're like when are you gonna come to bed it's been a week i did playing league come into into this i'm clean of league like six months right now yeah what what do you hate about legal aid i never humans well speaking of which i my participation in league involved on the robot side good because i think that's an improvement because uh both with starcraft 2 and and league of legends because open ai and deepmind both participating in creating bots and those i was a professional speaker of two players so i remember when the ai started to play it's interesting the types of restrictions that you would have to put on like a gaming robot to make it like functional and not totally unfair to the other side yeah to make a human-like yeah was that interesting to you to see ai be able to play those video games i think in some ways people think things are more complicated than they actually are and i think video games is one of those things where really oh my god there's like a million possibilities at every second and who knows and it's like no there's like three or four things going at any point in time and i'm willing to bet that like an ai could probably solve some of these games like pretty easily especially if there are no constraints on how they can learn yeah can i talk to you about relationships yeah we already have so yeah i know but more generally speaking we didn't get a chance to talk about the the red pill community well first of all what is the replica community the manosphere in general i'd love to get both of your opinions on this sure i i know i know you're probably not as opinionated on that phone what do you think i am that like probably not as you like as much as you but i i do have opinions yeah you do okay i usually don't like speak out too much on it because i feel like there's like a language barrier i that's why i don't really do politics because this is my second language yeah that's right you have to know the a little bit like you know how to use you have to use derogatory terms every other sentence yeah so they understand you right exactly yeah i need like a good like you need to be able to like speak really well for people to take your seriously i think and like that's the thing like if i if i don't have like the words and i don't have the like i can't pronounce things correctly yeah i'm searching for words like stupid essentially that's how people view it yeah tell me about it i have a podcast people listen to and i mumble and they yeah wait is here what's your first language russian oh okay but i speak both languages horribly i'm just not i'm not like there's definitely a big disconnect between my brain and my mouth module like i'm not able to generate the thoughts efficiently like the things you're able to do like speak like that i'm not it's very very tough plus there's a huge amount of anxiety and social interaction that i have which makes speaking even harder yeah yeah yeah it's tough i understand gotcha okay it makes sense yeah the the gotcha is both a symbol of compassion and derision at once i'm just letting you know i understand what you're saying i'm just gonna sit there and stare at you confirm no you have to say like yeah get it like yeah yeah i get it yeah no it's so it's so short i got you say say a longer sentence but that means the same thing i understand you yeah that's good that's like not chills you know you get chills yeah you understand me yeah it feels good yeah i hear you i hear you and like if you just like hold the other person's hand that's even better you gotta put in some emotion there okay show that you have some what do you think about it gotcha what do you think about red pill what what sorry what what is it first of all for people i don't know yeah the red pill community obviously it's the matrix reference the red pill that you take is when you realize what dating standards and norms really are in the world that men are providers and have to become some great thing to hunt and attract you know the woman who are just kind of there floating around looking for people to give them the most resources and it's like coming to a realization of what the world of dating really is broken away from the hollywood standards and the romantic stuff that they try to sell you and you know stories so there was kind of maybe you can kind of educate me on this but red pill used to be associated with just maybe anti-establishment views i don't know maybe maybe a republican conservative viewpoint people yeah right yeah they use red pill a lot in like different communities like when you say the red pill community yeah that usually means dating the dating thing but a lot of people say oh trump voters the red pill are you red pilled on like politics whatever people say stuff like that yeah okay cool and then there's like the manosphere that's all the similar type of stuff and andrew tate is somebody that represents kind of the figurehead of the manosphere of like the red pill stuff yeah i would say so i'm pretty sure yeah okay all right cool so what are some ideas that they represent and what do you think about them i think they do a good job at speaking to disaffected young men who feel like the rest of the world has kind of left them behind or isn't willing to speak to them and they do identify some true and real problems feels like on the left we have a really hard time doing like self-improvement or telling people how to better themselves we focus too much on like structural or systemic issues rather than what can an individual do to uplift or empower themselves and it also feels like they do a good job at speaking to some of the positive aspects of masculinity that it's okay to be like strong and brave and a soldier and a warrior and provide for your family and blah blah blah types of like those are like positive messages like self-improvement and everything that come from the red pill community what's the negative i think the analysis on how men and women interact is a way to transactional all of like the romanticism and love and chemistry has totally sucked out of it everything is very like sex based like how do you basically have sex with the most amount of women possible and that's going to make you happy and then i think people's motivation sometimes are just spoken about in such a shallow derogatory way that i don't think is always reflective of reality like a woman only wants you because you make six figures and you're tall and a guy only wants you because he wants to have sex with you like it feels like there's a lot of that going on a lot yeah and that misses some fundamental aspect about relationships yeah about meaningful relationships and so on i don't think i've never heard red pill people ever ever talk about like meaningful relationships it's always just how to get in one or how to have sex really malware bothers you about some of that philosophy i feel like people that are like are like pill people i feel like their solution is something that they work out like where it work out it works out for some people people that makes a lot of money is like really successful in that sort of way but it's not going to help most men out there so i feel like it's just like a pointless like speech to give to these like really lost guys and they really do believe that they can like they can become successful they can get money and like and when they get all these things they can get girls but most of them is not gonna achieve that ever to get the money part or become successful just become a billionaire you know like and you'll get all the girls and which is true but not everyone can do that so i feel like when these guys are speaking to these men and there's like we just care about these men out there you know they need to hear this it doesn't really help a lot of them and it doesn't inspire them to develop compassion toes the opposite sex which is probably something required to have that is for a relationship and also like they they seem to complain a lot about women like only wanting men that have money and that's tall and that's muscular whatever you know all those things and but they complain about that but that's like also kind of what they're trying to make the men try to do for themselves so they kind of like fall into the same sort of behavior and it seems like they're kind of unaware of that as well they're just playing a part of the game instead of trying to find a woman that doesn't look for those things and that are looking for not those things yeah i actually would love to have like straight up data on people in that world versus not in that world how often they get laid yeah like literally so i think for sure people in that world have fewer meaningful long-term relationships that are fulfilling they actually help them succeed in life that help them be happy and content and all that kind of stuff but just even the straight up the the shallow goal of getting laid i wonder because it's very possible that like just the the roughness with which they treat intellectually women that might lead to lower success not higher success it's very adversarial which i think is always disappointing anything that talks about men and women i think it's good to acknowledge differences but when it becomes like adversarial especially when you talk about sex sex is something that men are getting and it's something that women are giving and that type of like trade-off and the way they talk about it is like yeah it sets people against each other in a really toxic way i think how do you talk to people from that world from the red pill world like would you would you ever talk to like somebody like andrew tate oh yeah if i had a chance to i've been on the fresh and fit podcast three times and then i've got a friend sneako who's like very red pill that stuff if i'm trying to talk to them usually the it's kind of like approaching it like a scared cat the first thing you have to do is like be very gentle and say like i understand your issues i understand your complaints i know that you're i'm scary because you think i'm gonna say like toxic masculinity and feminism and all these scary words at you so the first thing is always to recognize it like a lot of what they talk about there are like true aspects to what they're talking about that people on the left won't recognize so i think it's good to acknowledge those things that like men and women are kind of different we do look for different things in general when it comes to relationships it's okay to say that it's not there's nothing bad there and then it'll usually be like once i've got your trust and i'm in your bubble like let's talk about the things that you want and maybe like some of the strategies that you're employing aren't necessarily going to get you some of the things that you want so for instance if you're really worried about like shallow girls like ruining your life like molina said it's probably not best to build your entire world view around trying to get shallow girls that are going to ruin your life like if your way of attracting a girl is to go to the gym get a whole bunch of money and try to like flaunt your wealth as much as possible you're going to be attracting the very same type of women that you're here like decrying on your stream you think we've talked about that on the boat because like you probably want to have a woman that's going to be there if you lose your job if it's still there length that cares about the things that's not just your job yeah it's more stable and also i don't help you become a great man great like grow like i feel like a great friendship and a partnership like it helps you make you a better person some of the most successful people i know i mean they have families and there's clearly a dynamic there that's like that makes them they wouldn't be that without they're not an island yeah yeah and the kids actually a big part of that too like for most people if you're like a good parent they make you step up somehow in life you have to take responsibility for getting your shit together and excelling in ways that i guess the philosophy of the red bull does not quite get to that's always an interesting i think i've asked that a couple times where it's like would you let your daughter date andrew tate and it's always funny to watch them kind of like squirm around those answers sometimes but see if they if they don't have a daughter like i you know i don't have a daughter i think your whole philosophy changes once you have a daughter sure like they can they know that what they're answering they feel a little bit weird about it it's funny to watch them like they even they know it's like ah fuck you know well they they might say like i i want my daughter to date like a high value male to the degree that he's a high value male yes but like i don't think you'll feel that way the definition of high value change is completely certainly the stereotypical measures the value contribute to the calculation but it's so much more than that i think on the chemistry of the whole thing is is bigger you've also mentioned about body count you guys both have a high body count his body count matter or depends like like you said it's low in some people's eyes it's high in other people's eyes does body count matter in relationships it's the past matter yeah well the past matters i don't think body count not to me i don't really care not just as it is no yeah i mean the past does yeah well the past is who you are right like somebody tells me like they have a 200 body count and they're 16. something's probably going on there that's not good i was thinking about that you're like because it could be like really young people that are having some sort of like mental yeah it's going on or somebody's like yeah 45 and they've like never had sex before there's probably something going on right so i could be indicative but if somebody's like in their 20s and they've had sex with you know 100 people or 50 people whatever it's you know whatever there's more experience which can be good sure okay so that that just represents you're like sexually open and so it doesn't really necessarily mean any kind of not necessarily it could though the number alone doesn't mean anything yeah okay well you could meet a guy that's like i just really really like wanna fuck a lot of people because it makes me so cool like okay you can be someone like that which is like the body count doesn't matter but like where it comes from like yeah like why why have you slept with the people you slept with yes does it hurt like the romantic aspect the relationship knowing that there's a lot of people in the past i don't know not for us no is it part of the relationship fundamentally romantic for us yeah i understand okay what you come up with such a cold person no i was just in my head thinking and i wanted to just say gotcha right there it's so judgmental i think when it comes to the sex thing there's always like the way that i explain it is and i understand like i have to say this because i don't advocate for what i do for everybody or what she does for everybody because obviously there's a whole bunch of natural feelings of jealousy that pop up for a lot of people but when people ask me you know it's always like oh like isn't this like horrible that you guys are doing this and you don't love each other from my perspective i can have sex with like any person and it can be sex like that's not like a special thing between two people in my eyes it's like anybody can have sex but there are like certain activities and ways you can spend time with each other where you're like carving out these like precious little moments in time with a certain person that can do things that are special to that person and those are the kind of like events that i remember more than anything else so like the idea of like like oh wow i had sex with a person that was so special doesn't mean as much as like you know us traveling to like new zealand or sharing some special moment doing like some really fun activity or event or whatever that's usually how i like it i am so a shared intimate moment yeah i kind of agree but i can definitely connect the romance with sex boring i'm curious if she's a woman say that's where the red pill is right that's exactly we've also talked about misogyny which is you're clearly the embodiment of that what were you saying so there's some there's a connection between romance and yeah i think it is because i think sex could be a lot of things right it's it's some sort of bonding i'd say in some way they say that you really like bdsm you kind of like you become submissive to someone or you take control over someone it's like in a very bonding like intimate moment i'd say and that's romantic the intimacy is amazing i i think it is if you can show yourself as really submissive or like weak when you have like absolutely no control over yourself and you let someone else do it or you are the one being that like you are the dominant for someone i think that's a really like intimate thing because you show like the weakest part of yourself kind of i just feel like i personally to me some component romantic but to me this is not judging to others to me maybe it's how i was brought up the romance increases if the number of intimate interactions are limited to one person like for me for some reason spreading it out decreases like exponentially the the feeling of romance you feel or that i don't know what that could be just like sort of having grown up in the soviet union there's a kind of there's the fairy tale stories and you're kind of maybe living through them yeah i mean i think what you're saying is like really normal like most people probably feel that way yeah but but because you guys are able to successfully not do that i just want to question my own understanding of it you know like like why is that why is that why am i being very jealous for no reason like maybe you can maximize the number of intimate experiences if you just open up and let go of the jealousy essentially i think i feel like in sweden like in scandinavia we're extremely just sexually open like in general we we're not like super religious either we're very like relaxed we don't like we don't feel bad about ourselves like it's just like a different sort of thing and i would say like it's we're more progressive when it comes to feminism and stuff so it's more common they will meet women with a higher body count than like when i meet like american girls all of them i have like vaginous smell like super suppressed like sexually and yeah like what did you just use they have like issues to like they can't relax during sex so it just hurts for them isn't that what it's called yeah so like i meet so many girls that are having like a lot of issues with sex and they have like a very low body count because they just can't relax or they yeah and it's probably and usually they come from like a very religious background so they have just been told like you cannot wear that you cannot be like that you can't like you know and like where i grew up it was not like that at all but you see it as more like a casual thing so then you can just maximize the awesomeness of the experience yeah i guess exactly and i think the important thing i think for everybody to realize is there's always pros and cons to everything like my lifestyle like obviously i get to have a lot of fun experiences that's like a huge pro and that's super cool and if you're like a more monogamy brained person you're not going to get those experiences but if you're a monogamy brain person like when you're sharing that special moment of time with somebody else like that moment can be really really really special because now it's the thing that you're showing yourself and opening yourself up to another person and they're only trusting you to do that and that's like a really special thing that only the two of you are sharing with each other so i mean like there's always like pros and cons to everything like i think we both would say like like doing an open relationship is probably not like we would not recommend it yeah i don't think we would no yeah recently fasted for three days and i ate a chicken breast at the end of that and it was like the most delicious food i've ever eaten so like there's some aspect of fasting and scarcity and so on that like you have to figure out what for your own psyche what works the best it's good to be a little bored or like not do something or like work because you can just enjoy the time when you're doing something really fun it's more fun otherwise you're just gonna get numb in general with everything yeah yeah i personally just never get bored like i guess the boring thing is exciting to me the just like you're like me because everything i like is boring i gotta ask you we talked about massaging in the in the he's trying to battle it out on the internet what's what's your what's your sense as a woman but the level of massaging and the internet and the streaming community and how to fight it for me because i get i guess i get it every single day somehow like because i haven't online like i have a chat that goes that's live right and but i have like mods moderating that all the time so i don't really need to see much of it i think it's just pretty annoying because you get to like see it all the time and become like background noise yeah a little bit and it's like the same commons over and over again but it's usually for me i don't personally care that much i understand that other people do especially when it comes into like when there's like a lot of sexism and stuff and when there's a lot of like men not taking women seriously like i definitely get that and i used to get that even more like a few years ago with my accent and everything and like i used to be blonde as well like a few months ago so i feel like people wouldn't take me seriously because of that that's a bit annoying but i i feel like it's pretty easy to like see through when someone acts that way and for me personally i don't really care but it's a bit annoying like being online and like getting stuff every single day i would say like the probably the worst thing is when you feel like you put in a lot of effort into some sort of work everyone is just going to say you just got that because you're a woman and you're attractive and that's that's probably like the worst thing is there a way to fight that you think yeah i don't think you can i think it just comes up all the time i just like it is what it is i guess you just gotta keep doing whatever you do and like not let it like emotionally control you somehow i think having more women in those spaces is always good it's probably good yeah like a lot of the guys you can tell online don't bring on the worst ones then stuff she just did it she did the misogyny thing by having some bad women on she's saying all women see you well you you know it's true right simply i disagree with you and i'm older than both of you and therefore wiser right so okay bye and we're older than i think yeah we've got combined age or it could be it could be the same thing as like also the age thing in like the woman thing a lot of people think that i'm just copying every single thing that he says which i think has been annoying as well so i can never really like a sonic character of that one yeah which has a bit annoying too much you know it was about the defunding police and love and respect which you both have had for a time and have lost in i would like you to regain it let's try to increase not decrease the amount of love in the space what do you think about some of the harshness of this of his language which we talked about our word in the past when he used n-word all that kind of stuff what are you used to do i mean no like what do you think about it like do you give them advice to not speak a certain way no like a little more civility i was just trying to get a second opinion on this second opinion about army people not internet people are way more extreme than yeah no that's not true okay so okay so here's thing for me okay i was not online until three years ago at all like i would watch youtube that's pretty much all i would do i wouldn't do anything else really i didn't grew up playing video games or anything so i'm like extremely new to everything so when i came into this world and i started seeing clips from him in the past i don't think i really had much of an opinion because it just sounded like it was just a different like words that we're using but it didn't mean anything that's what it feels it was just like if you're saying the r word it's because you just want to call someone stupid but you want to like do it a little bit more like but it's not like it didn't feel like it was like a it's not like racist more like you know it's not agreement on this side here all right so like if he was saying the f word because it was just like a word to like insult someone and he was like i don't think he was ever i don't think he were ever homophobic back in the day or anything like that but i think it was just like a way to express yourself maybe back then i don't know i didn't do it there's no videos of me or anything because i wasn't even online back then but yeah so my case was i i definitely don't think stephen is homophobic or race or any of those obviously so there's a good heart there and a good mind i was just saying he just likes being mean i think well there is some you lose yourself and forget the bigger picture that he's pushing for more effective discourse on the internet he's like an inspiration to a lot of people especially now of like how you can use effective conversation to make for better world to radicalize people and so on and then you lose some of that power by losing yourself in in like the language just more language of emotion versus effective communication but it's a gray area i would say like something that is probably recently done in that case because it's been joking about women a lot like it's women's fault they're bad like it's just it's been like a lot of jokes when it comes to misogyny i guess in your community and i think it's actually turned people a little bit that way that's why we've done the research yes so that's i guess that's actually true because i don't think it was pretty i don't think it was clear enough i don't think it actually was i think you did that mistake but i think back then i was even saying like hey you should probably not like you should probably you probably should not do that because it actually is pretty hard for me because whenever i come into his commuter like his chat people are just gonna spam it's like a woman moment it's a woman moment whenever i say something and it's kind of like yeah it's getting pretty annoying as i said it's just annoying when you see it every single day and there you go wisdom from somebody younger than you wisdom can come from all kinds of people yeah of course just sometimes it's very limited quantities and learn something from anybody what advice would you give to young people the both of you that you have both audiences where young people look up to you in general if you were to give advice to somebody in high school like how to create a life they can be proud of what would you say the most important thing that i've learned is to view people as different and not better or worse and when uv people is different instead of better or worse you learn that there's almost something that you can learn from anybody like being open and empathetic towards other people's experiences nobody does anything by random choice like there's always reasons why people act the way they do and as long as you're willing to kind of like be open and receptive to the lived experiences of other people you're going to be able to gather information and create like a more cohesive and better view of the world than any of your peers will do you have any kind of advice you can give to young folks i have something that i see especially in america a lot is that a lot of people kind of get told what to do early on like in high school they're supposed to become this thing like education wise like they're supposed to like become a doctor or this thing or whatever and then they kind of just like give up on things that they're actually passionate about so i think a lot of teenagers get really confused they get an education and then they get that job and they hate everything and they think that when they're when they're reaching the job when they're reaching like the journey they're going to get happy that's like where the happiness is going to be but then when they get to there they just hate everything and then they go become really depressed and i've seen this so much like i've seen this all the time and it's it's pretty sad to me to see so many people that are just wasting time and then they just get really confused and i don't know it's the same thing with relationships too no one really knows what they want anymore i feel like everyone is just kind of doing whatever like society is saying or the parents are saying or their friends are saying they're never really doing anything that's super meaningful anymore and like they don't so what i would say is like try to find something that are that's that is important to you it could be anything really like some sort of passion maybe like your friends maybe like like what matters to you like figuring those things out i think is really important and that comes from being able to listen to like some inner voice it's just not gonna come from elsewhere it's really hard because you're living the life and like there's things happening around you and people tell you what to do and what not to do and you know no one really has like their own opinions everyone is just kind of like listening to the the cooler thing or you know except even if he seems to stand on his own yeah i'd say so and like a hashtag like something i realized too like because we just went to twitchcon and we were talking to a lot of streamers it was interesting i i thought it was interesting because the the few people that i feel like i that seemed really cool and that i look up to like in the streaming world all of them wants to quit streaming all them wants to do it no one wants like no one likes it and they're so successful like they are around successful people they they're working every single day they're working hard they're making so much money and everyone is just complaining and like they're complaining about like not being able to see their partner or you know because they need to live somewhere else because and i see these things and they seem extremely unhappy and but it's so hard for them to just cut all these successful stuff off because that's like what you you know learn to do and that's like supposed to be like your happiness but it isn't everyone is really unhappy yeah there's something about maybe assuming is different but you do folks to have interacted with a few and even in podcasting space people become obsessed about the views and numbers and subscribers and stuff like that so i turned i never talk about that i i don't pay attention to that i feel like that's a drug that destroys your mind your your mind is an artist the ability to create really unique things also your mind in terms of the anxiety the ups and downs of the attention mechanism and then also being just if it's something that you make is not popular but it meant a lot to you you will think of it less yes because it's not popular yeah that's a really dangerous thing and because everyone around you is reinforcing like i'll get messages like wow this thing got this many views or something great job it's like no you don't get it like that's not that's not everyone is enforcing this like this language of views and likes and so on and it's it's correlated of course because truly impactful things will get a lot of attention often but it's not on the individual local scale like temporarily is it's it can really fuck with your mind and i see that in the creators they become addicts to the algorithm lost and chasing views like we know friends that yes we know cool people and then they start streaming and eventually they go they're like chasing the dragon of like and they change like they're yeah it's like really and there's like this is something i've always said that like one of the biggest blessings and biggest curses of humanity is we are very good at acclimating like you can become paralyzed you can have all sorts of horrible things happen to you and you'll get used to it and you'll be okay you're gonna have like a good baseline but it works the other way too and that you can get more and more and more and more and you acclimate to it almost immediately there's like this is a phenomenon that i bet it happens in the youtube world but i know what happens in the steering world where you're streaming 1000 viewers every day huge event happens and you blow up and you got like 15 000 viewers for a day or two and then it starts to go down and down and down and down and down and then after all the drama started off you're at like 3 000 concurrent viewers now in the macro you went from one thousand to three thousand that feels awesome but you actually feel like shit the whole time because you're remembering when you had 10 or 15 000 and now everything feels horrible and you'll see people climb over time like fuck like but whatever that one huge stream i had like i've never like been able to and it's like dude you're doing great what's yeah that happens a lot there's so many people that we know that we find super super cool they're passionate about things they have so much interest and then they just get like so addicted to these numbers and like all the everything is just ruined like all the cool things about them is ruined because they stop doing the things that they actually like to do something else that gives the more viewers more money and it's really sad to see yeah that that temporary sacrifice that seems temporary is that it it actually destroys you like for one time making a choice because i come across those choices often like i can do this you can kind of know what's going to be popular and not and you have to ask yourself that question like is this gonna sacrifice because if people are sacrificing like intimate relationships they're sacrificing time with their family their sex sacrifice in time with things that they feel good about and that they like and that's something i kind of realized last year because i was working so much and i was just grinding and grinding grinding but because it was kind of new for me and then new year's came by and i was like wait what did i even do like the entire year like i traveled to a bunch of places but nothing actually really meant anything to me because i felt like i was just working the entire time i felt like i was just numb through the through the entire year and it was really scary like i rented a like a super pretty house like for a week with my dad and my sister because i wanted to spend time with them but the entire time i was just streaming and i actually didn't ever like calm down and just like chill with them and i like that's like time i'll never get back i don't i don't give a shit about the money that i made that week but i lost the time and like that is really important to me and i yeah and a lot of people are doing that and i feel like you as you said like you can definitely see that in like artists for sure i feel like if you look at like artists like back in the 60s or 70s i feel like things were just so much better back then and it feels like they were actually making music that meant something to them they were actually making art and i feel like today everything is just kind of like whatever is cool whatever sells whatever you know sounds in a certain way everything is kind of the same thing and everything that is very artistic and very cool is actually not that popular at all and that's kind of sad i think yeah of course there's now bigger mechanisms and platforms to spread stuff music so as long as you could be content with not being popular i think you can still create yeah but not like when people get a little popular they get addicted to that so fast yeah it's weird yeah you have been somewhat good at least from my outside of perspective because i think you i can at least imagine you making choices that could make you more popular and you don't seem to make those choices sabotage but it is very intentional like you said like and i made that choice at every single stage of my life one is because from the perspective of being a carpet cleaner my life is way better than that was or ever would have been so i'm already doing way better than i ever thought somebody like me ever could be but then two i super love my job every time i wake up every time i fly to a place to a podcast every time i get to talk to really cool people like every single part of my job i super like if it's something i don't like i just cut it off because i don't care because i'm already making plenty of money doing what i do and why would i ever wake up and not like what i'm doing when i kind of like what i'm doing how do you guys find through that given that you love it and you sometimes maybe lose yourself in the drug of it how do you find like work life balance together inside a relationship like time for each other i don't at all so i'm not a good person to ask what do you love more male or effect factor factor is a really good game that's like not a fair comparison okay you're talking about one of the best cleanest games best support ever made cleanest code base like yeah this is yeah it's more factorial time for me starting to understand where the massaging comes from by the way is is the is factor legit a really good game yeah of course yeah if you're like do you enjoy programming of course that's all i do that's all that's okay do you got like a programming is is the game in itself that i enjoy probably more than anything else but yeah it's very much a game like that like if you're into stuff like that like you can lose hundreds of hours like very quickly to like you have a problem and then you think of a solution and then you iterate on that over and over and over again in larger larger schemes sometimes you got to redesign stuff sometimes you get like it's very much like that kind of game this is essentially building a factory like what on a foreign planet or something like that it's basically it's like a bunch of you're trying to automate different problems so that you can build bigger things so that you can automate bigger problems so you can build bigger things and automate bigger problems so it's more complicated than like a city building game like some city type of thing i wouldn't say it's more complicated it's more like it's like factorial is like a game of like logic like strictly like logic like it's almost like you're building a circuit or something yes yeah there's like their circuitry and you've got your an orgs or gates you like there's stuff like that it's very much like that like the enemies in the game like what they're like try to bite you and you can get guns and shoot and kill them but as i saw there's like shooting going on yeah but that's like a mine it's just another problem to solve in the game basically yeah okay all right so you see what we do there we just started talking about the game as we're trying oh my god that's like a game okay that's that's horrible anyway is there is that basically the struggle not stop struggle how to get human like intimate human time i feel like it was like a little bit more in the past i feel like it's been better lately but i think it's because when we started dating i wasn't streaming and i kind of just like gave up like my trip in new zealand i gave up like like i left sweden so i was just like in la which i hate i hate la i don't like it late at all it's hard to make friends that are like real that are into the same stuff as you it's it was just really hard for me to connect with anyone especially also like being a european and like being around americans was very strange so the only thing i had when i came here was him and i and i didn't expect the situation because yeah because we had we had like two weeks of hanging out and like he would be in his computer sometimes and like do emails and stuff but i wasn't thinking that he would stream like 12 hours a day and it was pretty like it was pretty intense like in the beginning of it as well and i realized it was really hard to like get attention and get time because his like love meter would be like full if i was just in the house and that's just kind of like the way he is and for me back then when i didn't have anything else to do was kind of like a it was kind of crazy for me i feel like right now because i do work as well and i have things going from for me and i have other friends now that i made i feel like it's a lot easier because and and i can definitely like enjoy just like being in separate rooms and just like hear him in the background is really nice i can i i can sit and paint and like in my room and i will do that for hours while i'm just like hearing a scream in the background it's kind of like comforting that he's he's just there and it feels nice i like it because to you that's the sound of happiness yes because i know he's right there yeah it's nice and then we'll come in and check on me sometimes and it's it's kind of like it's actually very comforting it's very nice i like it yeah i think that's kind of what a relationship is like you do fun things together you know you share moments together but also just like having someone like around you is really really nice and i think that's probably maybe it's me growing up maybe that's what it is and like i start liking like the kind of i feel like we're like an old couple like we're like 80 and we're just like around we don't really have to talk much it's it's nice that fills you your love meter i need both i mean okay you met you're making it sound like that i'm like craving like i haven't said anything i'm not saying anything i ever said a single thing i know exactly what you're thinking so much judging going on there's no judgment no but like we i think i think whenever we do plan something out like if we if we go on a trip like every other month or once a month i feel like usually like that's enough as long as he's not playing victoria the entire time like if i feel like he's going on these trips with me and he's not like doing things for me or he's done he's not interested in like spending time or like being present with me then i feel like i just feel like i'm just wasting time right now and then i get kind of disappointed but otherwise i think this like this is fun i think this is like spending time together because we're like doing something together yeah it's fun yeah my love meter is full it's my social life we like to we like to think about it that way that like i need like a little bit more of like this one thing like quality time and he needs like almost zero quality time but like let's say that we took away like physical touch you would probably not be very happy so you need physical touch so it's not just factoria huh no i'm a very kindly person yeah like cuddly and then you're like i guess like acts of service like if i do something for you get really happy like hot chocolate yeah like if i give him hot chocolate in the morning he gets really happy so the actual it's not the hot chocolate it's the giving of the hot chocolate no it's just the hot chocolate but if she gives it to me i didn't have to get away is it just physical touch to you like that's really nice all right well if you have to choose between factoria and the drama or political discourse we probably political discourse probably my calling but i am a good factorial player like what role exactly does factorio play in your streaming life oh well right now it's just usually there are like these games that i play in the background as i have conversation because it's hard for me to just sit on the computer just talk and not like be playing a game at the same time so it's just something to keep me kind of like occupied you know some people buy like little like widget things i guess yeah that's what yours yeah basically yeah it's like minecraft or factorial for me all right well my
