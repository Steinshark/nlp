when we talk about conmen from the past normally they're met with disdain disgust there's a sense that all these people need to be put behind bars but every now and then a scammer comes along who really captures the imagination who shows us the foolishness of our biases and how easy it is to trick us and it almost delights us in a weird way one such example is frank abagnale he was the guy featured in catch me if you can the movie and the whole idea is that he spent his life sort of faking being an airline pilot an attorney a doctor but he did it in such a way that seemed perhaps to not be for money but for the sheer thrill of getting away with it and because of that he's become something of an icon and even has moved on from his scammer ways into something more respectable and that latter type of scammer is what i'm interested in today because the person we're talking about today is a scammer yes but he also when i review his files i can't help but find myself fascinated by this person fascinated by the doctor of love but the teen later told police he'd never attended medical school i don't appreciate your tone if you could stop recording please i will lie like that ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and today we're talking about the man myth the legend the doctor of love himself malachi love robinson dodge that this is him right here guys you may have you may know him you may not but he was featured on the local news a while back as a young con man let's take a listen an alleged fraud of such audacity such tenacity that it boggles the mind it involves an' year old babyface kid who's accused of masquerading as a doctor police say treating patients out of his own clinic that's right dr malachi love robinson or dr love as we'll be calling him throughout the rest of this piece was a 19 year old kid who faked being a doctor and set up a private practice and was treating patients he has a lab coat and a stethoscope but police say this baby-faced physician doesn't have an md are you a fraud because it seems like everything you're saying to me is invasive i don't appreciate your tone gosh i love that you get caught and you go i don't appreciate your tone actually i don't like when you say that but let's set the stage okay let's back it up before we get into the heated confrontation dr love didn't start by being confronted on being a doctor he actually had practice he had dreams of being a doctor for a fake doctor dreams of being a fake doctor for a long time ever since he was 17 he sort of roamed the halls it sounds like of various medical places pretending and just sort of like walking around with a lab coat on the police report says he was walking around the halls in a doctor's code i believe it said department of anesthesiology on it witnesses reporting he'd been roaming the hospital halls for a month dude how does anybody mistake this guy for a doctor i like the serious expression though dude this guy's committed to the character this story was broadcast everywhere like i'm some insane maniac nobody else is faking being being a doctor at least we can say you're a one of one that's one thing you'll notice actually about malachi is that he has a tremendous amount of confidence that belies his young teenage years and that's something that i find fascinating i think most people find fascinating about scammers is they typically have an above average ability to bs their way through situations that they have no idea about i'm sure malachi has never been on the local news before or definitely not the national news before but he bses his way through it like a pro didn't snatch out a baby i didn't do any of that police snapped this picture of the lab coat in his car on one lapel the title anesthesiologist on the other his name oh that's a bad luck bud that's where you get in trouble i think probably if he had walked through with just a lab coat he probably wouldn't have gotten in trouble but now that you fake your credentials that's the problem hospital did not press charges claiming in a statement the individual never had contact with any hospital patients and did not gain access to any patient care areas now by the way i'll be skipping through this because there's a full report on this great investigative reporting by abc news you can go check it out it's called florida teen accused of posing as a doctor denies diagnosing patients i want to skip to the part where they actually go into his clinic where he was his private practice and show you what he was doing this this kid is unbelievable attempting to pass as a medical doctor this time in his very own clinic this is the new birthing life medical center so he doesn't know that this girl walking with him like is an undercover reporter labor law posters up on the wall so that way you know they are visible to the public all right this is dude what oh my gosh he goes hey look labor laws that means i'm legit so that way you know they are visible to the public and she goes you're following the law and she knows that he's faking being a doctor and he thinks he's getting away with this that's unbelievable all right of course that was after he removed his lab coat and stethoscope and when you peel back the tape the sign on the door has his name and those two crucial letters no doctor love no you gotta learn bud now this case gets more serious when we learn of accusations that dr love was not merely playing doctor he was actually acting as a doctor and treating patients for money he was immediately confronted on this 86 year old woman police say he treated her recently for severe stomach pain and charged her nearly 3 500 dollars what services did you provide in exchange for that money i can tell you this accusations are merely accusations hey dude don't ever start a question with another like a statement that has nothing to do with the question i'm sure that's how brian rose answers any kind of questions accusations are just accusations and services you'd have to define that whether she paid for me to just show up that's up to her what this kid is unreal he's a legend he never never defeated never defeated at the bs game he's saying i didn't even give her services she paid me 3 500 to show up she was so happy to see my face denying the fact that she paid you 3 500 or so correct no i am denying that are you a fraud i don't appreciate your tone i don't appreciate the way you're portraying this interview to actually be and then a moment we didn't expect i don't know where you're seeing this information from but it is inaccurate i'm sorry i'm gonna have to cut this in this interview short wow that is unbelievable look at that his outrage about getting called out truthfully dude he's 19. the kid could be a hollywood star actor star this is such a power play i don't i don't even know what to think of this i don't know where you're seeing this information from but it is inaccurate i'm sorry i'm going to have to cut this in this interview short he has said this may not cut his medical career short saying he hopes to open another look at that he hits him with this kid's a star dude normally people would be walking out with their head duck like low this kid is going like you'll be hearing from my lawyers dude so here's the thing he goes to jail for this now he gets talked to in jail he served like a three-year stint he really gave a compelling message to inside addition here behind that deception as a kid you know i think it was always been my dream you know to be a physician i guess the bigger picture was seeing the smiles you know people thinking that you are something that you're not he sounds pretty compelling huh like he he really is remorseful for what he did and that he really just deep down wanted to be a doctor all along well he got out recently and unfortunately ladies and gentlemen he is once again in the news dr love is re-arrested in palm beach county i regret to inform you guys in january 2020 according to the police under the name alex robinson he got a job with the united states of freight a shipping brokerage based in delray beach delray police say he stole more than 10 thousand dollars from the company by diverting payments to the company into his own bank account now this is the problem with scammers of all kind because once you scam by pretending to be a quack you can never go back it's an old saying and this is unfortunately the sad part of of scamming is i think for for some people it's just it's just a disease they can't they can't help it they have to they're pathological liars but for me at least dr love represents one of the most interesting figures in scamming not because what i think he did was right i think it's incredibly dangerous to fake being a doctor but because his motivations were so different than your average guru it wasn't to get a lambo it wasn't to teach a bunch of 15 year olds how to drop ship for him it was about being seen like he was in a position of authority and he was helping you regardless of whether he could actually help you or not and i think the fact that he's convinced and tricked so many people along the way is a testament to our human fragility when it comes to trust we're so quick to trust other people if they have the right thing on if they have the right coat on it's an old saying that if you put a construction outfit on you carry a clipboard you can get into any job site in the world and unfortunately examples like this are reminders that we need to be careful and check our human biases and that ladies and gentlemen is where our story ends with dr love robinson once again committing another form of fraud but going down in my heart as one of the most lovable and hilarious scammers i think when he gets out he should try acting anyway that's it thanks for watching see you in the next one wake up and smell the coffee
