time for a serious chat boys and girls about your money a lot of you guys don't have a lot of it and you are being taken advantage of by these financial outlets who are irresponsibly promoting to you worthless things for clicks surprise surprise i know i know we're all shocked listen guys i want to have a serious conversation with you guys based on some things that i've been seeing not only with a squid game crypto which went of course could put after all these mainstream outlets reported on it endlessly breathlessly saying about how much it was going up in value i want to talk to you guys about just more than just squid game crypto i want to talk to you guys about the endless reporting of meme coins and pitching of meme coins to you things like dogecoin shiba inu floki inu choose your flavor of dog general coins with no actual foundational value but who are driven entirely or almost entirely by marketing hype where the only way the price goes up is if we tell enough of our friends and try to get them to fomo in and the whole thing's built on like fear of missing out and you know greater full theory we've not only seen the explosion of these types of cryptocurrencies not only in the number of them but in the value of them but we've also seen and this is kind of surprising these things go mainstream with mainstream outlets whether it's youtubers or like actual papers reporting on them seriously and it's a joke and actually it led to one of my favorite things ever which is patrick boyle you guys might know as the former hedge fund manager we interviewed a while back watching him sort of break down while talking about these coins you can tell he's about to cry i mean we're very close to to breaking this man's spirit watch him as he explains one of these meme coins and what's happening and just sort of feel the pain of somebody who's spent their whole life trying to understand something seeing it get to this point these adverts are supposed to drum up enthusiasm around flocky new coin the article goes on to say the branding campaign aims to legitimize the coin and increase confidence of the average consumer the group's head of marketing who identified himself by the alias sabre said you get a lot of scam artists in this game yeah so that's what's going on in the world of finance right now a man using the alias sabre a name most likely stolen from a comic book villain is warning us against scam artists while pitching his elon musk dog themed currency he's been quoted in the financial times a serious newspaper you can almost see his soul breaking can't you you almost see a single deer going down buried in british sarcasm the article continues flocky enu can splash out on pricey advertising because like some other meme coins it imposes a marketing fee of four percent on buyers that fee is used for onboarding influencers and to further develop and grow the flocky ecosystem i guess at least they're onboarding influencers if there's one thing that can be counted upon to legitimize a new form of money it's youtubers and instagramers because after all this is finance in 2021. so there you go guys at least we got that beautiful reaction from our boy patrick boyle go subscribe to his channel he does like common sense investing but yeah there there it is he's talking about one of the big financial papers the financial times just reporting on this like absolute coin and you're just like what has happened what how did we get to this place i mean it's one thing for these cryptocurrencies to do promotional campaigns like this built on nothing but fomo like miss doge get floki it's literally selling fear missing out that's like the pitch right it's one thing to have that but to have serious newspapers serious financial educators right taking this these cryptos seriously is absolutely insane so i guess this is my way of saying like be careful of all these videos talking about sheba e new millionaires and dogecoin millionaires and floki e new millionaires and all this kind of stuff because these guys are selling you nothing but hype fomo all this nonsense and it's like how did we get to this point right how how is this what like financial youtube is financial twitter's about financial articles are being written about these things and it's like look i'm not saying like don't cover these topics because they're in the mainstream like everybody's gonna talk about them to some extent but you have to talk about them in the context of like oh yeah these are basically ponzi schemes right like we all know these are ponzi schemes but a lot of the people who talk about this they are just to get clicks they're talking not about why it's like a basically a ponzi scheme and why it's relying on just greater full theory instead they go oh it's up 2 000 oh it's up 10 000 could this be the next you know huge coin or something like that when you're just pushing a glorified like ponzi coin i mean so many of these coins have no underlying fundamentals and are literally built purely on marketing how can you do that to your fans like push them knowingly into that i mean literally if that's all finance is at this point we might as well be telling people to go get lottery tickets we might as well be telling people you know just yeah go bet on such and such lottery ticket i hear their numbers are crazy today even though you know it's a losing game these meme coins have always been a losing game for most people because they're built on nothing developers take a huge cut early adopters take most of it right if you're finding out about it now you're late so yeah i'm just basically putting this out as a psa to my audience to anybody who watches my channel be careful of this kind of like hype based news of like the next shiba inu facebook sends the price of this minor bitcoin rival soaring 300 percent to 6 billion like this kind of writing is trash you're gonna get wrecked on this kind of writing or at least just realize like this is just the same as basically buying lottery tickets i mean you might as well buy lottery tickets if you listen to this kind of thing this article which is from forbes compares shiba inu a meme coin to bitcoin okay i guess that's where we're at these days oh and then it mentioned squid game crypto which this is before of course the crash talking about it soaring even higher despite a raft of serious warnings geez dude like why is it all about you know how much percent is it up when what it should be about is like hey don't invest in a ponzi coin hey maybe that's not a good idea right so frustrating like again these are financial outlets like they're supposed to be like about financial education it's so strange to watch this like turn of events now real quick i just wanted to jump in here steven from the future here i realized i wanted to make the caveat that i'm not talking about anyone that covers finance ever talking about these things is scamming you or whatever i'm specifically talking about people who pitch these things as legitimate financial investments it's perfectly fine to make fun of this stuff it's perfectly fine to commentate on how crazy it is that this stuff has gone viral i'm specifically talking about the financial people who are basically talking about this in the way you talk about any kind of investment talking about this is a way to get rich or this is a way that you're somehow going to make a bunch of money that i think is scummy just talking about it i think it's fine fair game whatever okay disclosure over i'm just in awe that this is what personal finance has become is like the discussion of meme coins it's just it's so bizarre and while i don't have his sense of british wit i share his sort of like dread over it because here's the thing i know these things seem like they last forever so you go oh gotta get in the bubble while i still can they eventually pop and then people just get wrecked and all of these outlets articles people they'll cover you getting wrecked but they're not they're not gonna cover the cost dude and unlike them who usually can afford this kind of thing who usually are making money on top of this kind of thing you guys can't like most of the people who are getting targeted with these types of cryptocurrencies they don't have a bunch of spare money like it's talking to my barber my barber is invested in dogecoin whatever and you're just kind of like you know you know they don't have a ton of discretionary income we are targeting like masses of regular people with not a ton of discretionary income and we are selling them worthless coins that are built on ponzinomics i don't know seems wrong to me but then again here i am maybe it's a little boomer of me not to understand the genius of meme coin economics dude maybe it'll be different this time i know we've been through so many speculative bubbles and every one of them has popped but maybe floki enu is the new one you know maybe they're going to be the exception but i don't think so anyways stay safe with your money out there guys a lot of stupid stupid reports going out there they're getting people wrecked and i just i just want you guys to be safe with your money and stay away from articles like this that are just click baiting and trying to sell you like meme coin garbage anyways that rant over thanks for watching [music] but things will be different if i was balling
