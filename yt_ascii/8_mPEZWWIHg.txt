hello there and today i'm gonna be showing you seven absolutely insane absolutely insane coding tools that i bet you don't know about yet i'm about to show you how you can find amazing styles really easily how you can automate your react development with pre-built components and many other things to replace boring everyday tasks that you're probably doing in your computer every single day including one tool that i think is so revolutionary i think it's gonna completely transform the way we use our computers in general like how about this if after watching this video none of these tools were new to you in any way i'm gonna give you permission to dislike this video it's not easy for me to say and in return if you did find something interesting in this video you have to hit the like button is that a deal okay let's do it i've got some dates to montron while we watch this video i encourage you to grab something as well like a coffee or a snack or whatever and let's start nerding out about our programming tools our first tool is called figma this is for those of you who like me hate doing css figma is essentially this design tool that allows you to do things like design and diagrams for your app but the way that i really use figma and the way that is used in the programming industry is to find styles for your apps essentially the way this works is you've got these designs that have been designed by someone and then by clicking on different areas you can view things like the exact colors and you can even extract the entire styles as css then you can simply just copy and paste into your app i think it's absolutely sick there's tons and tons of these available in here and you can sort them by free if you don't want to pay for them and then essentially just find insane styles because as a developer you're not supposed to be a designer leave the designing for the designers and spend more time coding less time designing okay so continuing on the theme of of being lazy as developers you have something called a react suite what this is is basically a library of pre-built react components that you can just copy paste in your let's say i'm building this amazing app right here and i wanted to have a nav bar so i can just go out here and react to it and look for a nav bar that i can simply like copy paste and now we have a number let's say we want to add a button so we just copy this button component then change it a bit we style it and then like there's so many of these like let's say we want to add like a calendar view we can just find this component in here and stick it in our app and with literally no coding we've got this amazing starter code now obviously this is not something that you can use to build an entire application but these are pre-built components that you can like stitch together to build whatever you want to build and then modify them from there okay so if you're into data science and you like using python and you like playing around with data and things like this you want to listen very carefully this one because we've got this app called quadratic who are also the sponsor of today's video what this is is essentially a combination of excel with python we've got this data set in here of pricing data for apartments in dubai whereas normally in excel it allows you to input excel functions with quadratic you can add python functions and the most useful functions for you to know more about are this function called cell which allows you to access is a specific cell of cells where you can input two cells the opposite basically returns a pandas data frame of the range of cells from the first one to the second one and the really cool thing is that we've got this ai assistant built into the application again if you're a dumbass like me and you don't know how to work with pandas you can just ask the ai assistant to help you which i did here and i managed to get this function where i can count the number of areas that would be within my budget let's say my budget is 1500 and then i can combine this by actually making this dynamic by allowing me to change the budget on this cell right here and then i use the cell function to just access the budget data in my function if you are someone who loves working with data like i think this is the future i'm super super excited about where it's going to go i highly recommend you go check it out at quadratic hq.com which you can also find below in the description thank you for quite writing for sponsoring this video and introducing me to this pretty amazing tool okay so for the next one back-end developers listen up usually whenever you want to build a backend usually what you have to do is go and actually also build a front end like a full front end that caused the back end just to test it out which can be really tedious because then you have to remember like oh how do you use this fetch function again and like and it's going to be errors it's gonna be cores like all these pieces that you have to get to work together it's a whole mess if you're trying to like just test out your back end so using this app called postman you can essentially automate this process and just send client requests directly from a postman so i've got a very simple node.js server running right here and then all i have to do is insert a postman input the port where my server is running and the end point is going to send the request to that endpoint without me having to manually build out the whole client is going to show the response and then inside of my server i can see like yes it works and then if you want to include query parameters or a body insider request you can also just simply do that inside of postman run and just having to manually build everything in your client i think it's pretty cool i use it all the time for my backend development i want to app number five which is going to be especially relevant for those of you who are still learning to code and you sort of want to take notes but you sort of think like ah taking notice tbs is boring i don't like doing it well i have a solution for you what if i told you that there's now a way to write out your notes automatically using ai there is it's called notion ai so i'm talking about notion a bunch in my previous videos i'm actually building like a fully fledged notion template specifically for programmers stay tuned for that but anyway let's say you have this note in here you can't be bothered to like write it out because this is working we don't want to be doing work do we once you sign up to notion ai what you can do is just click the space button it's gonna open this ai prompt for you this is allows you to for example we want to tell it to summarize web development or explain web development for us and it's just gonna literally do it for us we're gonna write you essentially a whole article about web development and you're not satisfied away you can either tell it to do it again or you can just tell it to keep writing what else can we do let's say we want to learn about http requests and we want to at the same time learn about it and summarize it so we can just tell roshanaya just please summarize this video request for us and it's gonna write this entire articles for us with code snippets like in between because in notion you can write code as well and then let's say you already have existing course notes or something like that and you would like to summarize it you can go to those notes and ask notion ai to basically summarize the entire page for you and last but not least you can even use it to literally translate entire page into spanish and it just keeps going yeah i don't know why you want to do that but if you do then there you go you can do it i feel like going forward pretty much every single piece of software is going to have some sort of an ai like writer thing built into it just like the next thing that we're talking about which is a brand new way to use your terminal and this one is absolutely incredible so we all know that as programmers we usually want to use the terminal over like the gui but at the same time like let's be honest we can never really remember all the commands but learning all this command is effort i like the terminal window is really looks like freaking 1995 it's not something that we really want to be using but now we have a solution it's called warp these guys have essentially done is completely rebuilt the terminal for us it's a much more visual much more like 2023 kind of terminal for example have autocomplete built in let's say we go cd and then flick through the different folders and essentially navigate to wherever you want and then it's gonna basically be built using these blocks where we have these blocks of commands and then we can do different things for this block so we can click on here we can copy the commands we can copy a path create a permanent link and then as you would expect we have warp ai that is a complete lifesaver for me because i can never remember the terminal commands myself so i can just ask will pay out okay how do i do this and it's just going to give you a command for it that you can either copy or simply directly input into your command line window and then we've got this command palette which is basically similar to the command palette of like visual studio code it's essentially like a code editor built into the terminal window that's like the best way that i have to describe this i basically add a lot of color and the last thing that i really love about this is you can change the theme or you have all these different themes you can make it white you can make like really hacky looking whatever like yeah basically just make your terminal look like less 1995 basically so i think this is absolutely sick and i genuinely believe that once this becomes more mainstream like no one's basically going to be using the normal tone like why would you use the normal terminal anymore after something like this make the terminal great again last but not least we have something that you probably know about unless you've been living under an absolute rock which is obviously charge ebt but i bet that if you're using char dbt you're not using it in the right way whenever i'm building something new i basically never create like skeletons from my apps myself anymore okay so here it's giving me this video player but let's say what i actually wanted is something like a youtube video player where it gives me a youtube video to watch and then i can ask charitivity to modify please give me a youtube video player instead and then it's gonna do that i'm gonna test if it works me as the human i am the architect i'm the one like giving the instructions i'm the boss and then judge ability is basically just gonna be my free employee that actually does the coding for me so going forward there's less and less need for you to be the kind of coder who just like memorizes a bunch of stuff which is amazing because it allows us to spend our time on more creative things and in general that's what technology does it allows us humans to work on more creative tasks and look at that it works it finds an internet coder video for us and even randomizes to down every refresh there's a different into the make code video showing up and all of this came from judgbt but it doesn't mean that i have now been replaced because i still had to have the idea of building this absolutely ridiculously amazing app that's gonna like make me a billionaire we have to come up with the ideas we have to come up with the requirements but now we can literally just do everything like 100 times faster because we don't have to spend the time coding everything from scratch and using all of these tools using via components automating or styling your data science everything we can massively speed up our workflows as developers i'm curious tell me in the comments how many of these did you already know about and also tell me what are your favorite coding tools let's help each other here let's all write our favorite coding tools that we don't think the rest of the commenters are gonna be aware of and i'm gonna be pinning my favorite comment with a favorite tool but the truth of it is that this is not enough for you as a program there's a whole other set of tools that you really really need as program if you want to find out what all the physical tools that i use in my own personal software engineer life you absolutely need to watch this video right here if you find nothing useful in this video you can dislike it but i bet you're gonna find something so watch it now
