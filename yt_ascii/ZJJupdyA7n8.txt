god bless actors i i don't always get along with them i think for the reason for those reasons you know when i you it feels like it's about them and what they want and they're the they're the instrument well they're the stars you know well you know it kind of goes along with the territory i mean people in media people in politics people in entertainment they tilt towards narcissism and i'm not saying that in an insulting way i mean every personality constellation has associated vices know and if you're if you're going to want to be on camera if you're going to be want to be around people that's one of the things that tilts you in the direction of it sort of being about you and and if you're a charismatic personality and you're an actor you're going to attract people around you who facilitate that development let's say and so it's it's part and parcel of the territory but you're not really temperamentally like that oh i cultivated my narcissism okay yeah yeah no i definitely found that part within me that was the character of vince and i and i you know c you know they say actors get lost in their characters right yeah and i did and how long did onaj run 10 years right right yeah so that's a very major chunk of time oh yeah yeah well so walk me through that so you got your plane ticket you went out ta what happened then got the part when my manager found out that i got the part he walked into the room and i and i had no place to stay i had no car so i'm in his office checking my email again and he he walks in and he was the first person to call me vince he's like vince and i knew i got the part and i hung my head because i knew that it was going to totally change my life in ways that i didn't know if i really wanted and i knew that i was going to have to commit to this cuz he used to tell me it's like you don't even know what you don't know like you're going to have access and women and money all these things because he was you know managing other famous people so he understood and he's like you you don't even know you want it but when you get it you'll know you want it you know you'll know it's great and it was going to change my life and because it's a commitment when you audition for something like that you have to sign a six-year contract right right so you're already committed before they even give you the role and it did it changed my life entirely and i had to learn to be that celebrity or my own version my own expression of that celebrity and then with the success of the show and the popularity of the characters and people would come up to me and you know instant approval instant you walk into a room and you know yay you know you get that attention that the that just acceptance had that happened to you at all before i mean you'd had some success as a as a as an actor before that but not not not like that oh totally different yeah i mean and you were so you were about 28 you said when this 28 27 28 okay so you're not a kid when this happened so that's something so all right so now you have what in you said instant accessibility instant approval mh right tell me about the character that you played and how that tangled up into that yeah so vince is a celebrity who's you know very very nonchalant and you know the the whole the whole theme is if this doesn't work out if all the fame and fortune doesn't work out i can always move back to queens so it was like a perfect talk about typ cast right i mean all the characters have that's very strange we're all new york kids and you know and our and we we were all very well-cast you know but i think that's partly they were writing the character to reflect me oh yeah okay and partly that was the character that was because that's fun trying to distinguish your actual life from your role it was more fun to blur the lines because you start to acques to people's wanting you to be the character oh do shots with us right like yeah okay i'll you know do some shots with these guys and i'm i like people so yeah and then you know then there's the the the pitfalls and the the women and the and the you know and i started to believe that that was the way it's supposed to be right you mean supposed to be meaning that success yeah vince gets all the girls and the money and the power and the fame and and that was appropriate and good and as as his star rose my star rose and it just became easier and easier to say yes to the indulgences and i got really good at it whereas before i was leery of it yeah you get you know you allow yourself to enjoy it you know very easily becomes easy to say yes what especially when it's justified well you're the celebrity of course you know you get you get the accolades you must know a little bit about

under some degree of of obscurity till i was about 50 you know 53 54 so you know i i was already fairly cemented into place by the time i that's right yeah right right and you know i i have a very tight family and a very tight network of friends and so that's also made a substantial difference to me i don't know what it would have been like to have encountered that sort of thing when i was much younger i mean i probably would have been wild especially if i would have done it before i quit drinking so i quit drinking when i was about 25 26 something like that you know and that straightens out your life pretty radically but i was pretty wild you know when i was drinking so right so so i you know growing up in new york there's a little bit of nihilism godless you know and th this was now the overlay of my my e my ego which was see you know i am the man i you know i got the part and people are you know approval approving of me yeah so it just yeah well it's a very difficult thing i mean i don't know exactly how it is that you can resist part of being socialized is to pay attention to what others think of you right i mean that's part of being in the loop for accepting social feedback and normally you know you're not carried around on the should shoulders of others constantly but you found yourself in that situation essentially it's like it isn't obvious to me how people can withstand that i've talked to russell brand a little bit about that because he was spectacularly successful and also you know what would you say in the market for whatever repetitive urges might make themselves manifest and so you know he's talked to me a little bit about that and he paid to i would say a relatively heavy price for that he and i might have been friends if we weren't competing for the same chicks aha did you know him in did you know him in la we cross paths a few times uhuh all right so now you're in now now so this is very interesting you resisted this and now you're now you you were spending your primary amount of time in la when when when entourage was 6 eight months a year and then i go back to new york and by the way you didn't have a house in la i had a house but that i stayed when i was there yeah yeah okay okay i kept my new york address and i got mail there and my bills there so pay taxes there so so funny enough like i you you should you should check out i actually made a documentary so i simultaneously while i'm on this ride and i'm finding more and more excuses to indulge and enjoy the lifestyle i was maintaining a sense of my goodness by doing environment mental work and starting charities and making documentaries and i still had a band the whole time in fact the band really got popular after that even though we might not have deserved it otherwise so i i still had my other life which kept me feeling like i was not not swept up in that thing right right but not really recognizing how much i really was you know captured okay so then so why not be captured like i mean you were successful you got the part the part was successful the the the series was successful and you have these things that are laid at your feet so what's the problem with indulging [music]
