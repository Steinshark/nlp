so hello everybody i'm really excited to be back here with richard rowland to continue the universal history if you have not seen our first video it has really taken off and also just sparked so much discussion he's now flooded with emails he tells me of all these people who want to ask about everything from universal history to psychedelic since i'm really happy that that's happening because richard is a very interesting person and i'm looking forward to kind of continuing this conversation as we move forward so richard so richard what what is it that you wanted us to talk about today so now that we've laid out the idea of of universal history and tried to establish the idea that the the way that they thought about history in the ancient and the medieval mind that that that way of thinking about history and of reading history still has value and meaning to us what i thought that we could do would be to take a a closer look at one of the main patterns that i see within western history within the whole medieval project and by western i mean i mean the whole medieval christian world you know so including byzantium and that and uh so i thought what i thought we could do is take a closer look at this one of the main patterns that manifest itself kind of over and over again and that really helps us to navigate the moment that we're in right now and that's the pattern of christ and antichrist so this actually starts i want to i want to start with kind of a deep poll here that maybe a lot of our listeners won't be familiar with and that is a guy named mithridates vi of pontus so mithridates is a super interesting guy he he ruled over the kingdom of pontus and over much of anatolia again so this is a guy he's from the east he's specifically from anatolia which seems to keep coming up for some reason and he's actually a descendant of both alexander the great and also of cyrus so he basically he basically understood himself his understanding was that he was the inheritor of both east and west of both greece and persia right so he's living you know anatolia is the space that's sort of like on the border between these two worlds and so he understood himself as as having an inherited both of these things and and he has a lot of let's say messianic features about his life there was a comet in the sky that was seen when he was born and all this other stuff so he's he's a really interesting figure and when he's quite young i think about 10 years old or so his mother actually tries to kill him along with along with his father and kills his father but mithridates escapes and he spent the next 10 or 15 years kind of on the run in hiding and he's traveling around to all these different these different tribes and these different kind of wild groups that are on the edge of anatolian civilization and he's making alliances he's learning how to lead he's learning how to fight he's learning how to poison his nickname is the poison king because he just poisoned so many people this is in the first century bc is my understanding right yes that's right yeah yeah and so he he also he also uh one of the things he's really famous for was developing basically like a universal antidote and we don't know if he really succeeded in doing it or not there's there's kind of like conflicting you could say conflicting evidence but the thing that he's famous for is developing something called mithridatum is what it's usually called now named after him and it's the idea of basically he's got a small amount of every single poison in it and so you take a dose of this every day and you build up and you know you build up an immunity to iocan powder for those of us who are you know princess bride fans so so mithridates you know he did that he had he had this dose that was like all these herbs and small amounts of poisons and stuff and he took it every day and he lived a really long time so i don't know what's going on there i'm pretty sure that i'm pretty sure like from a modern scientific standpoint taking a little bit of arsenic every day is maybe not the best thing to do and and nobody really knows what was in it no one knows yeah it's it's a lost formula yeah yeah it's a loss formula but during the middle ages actually the whole lot of people tried to re like figure it out it was like the philosopher's stone of poison it really yeah yeah or yeah so anyway so he comes back poisons his mom and takes over takes over the kingdom and becomes the worst enemy that the roman republic had fought since hannibal barca and basically he just becomes he's he's considered one of the three great enemies by the romans themselves who always respected their enemies greatly he was considered along with pirus and with hannibal one of the three great enemies of the roman republic he's eventually defeated by pompey the great and dies according to according to history dies by suicide of course the story there is pretty fun it's that he he tried to poison himself and it didn't work because theoretically he was immune to it he was also just an enormous man like physically enormous very powerfully built so maybe maybe you know who knows but anyway so eventually he either stabbed himself or he had one of the slaves slaves stabbed him but they when he died because he'd been such a nuisance to the roman empire when he died there were legends which began to arise almost immediately after his death that he hadn't actually died these legends that he had actually gone he had a hit a wife who was like one of his wives was like the city and amazon warrior and so he had even like at one point had this like group group of amazons like as his bodyguard he rolled with i mean yeah like gaddafi yeah yeah or or like wakanda or something yeah yeah yeah yeah he's a fascinating guy all the stuff that i'm saying by the way there's a really fun book called the poison king the life and legend of mithridates rome's deadliest enemy and it's by adrienne adrian mare and you can you can find it on amazon and audible and places like that it's it's a really fascinating piece of history but anyway so one of the legends is that actually he goes north with these sybians you know these these amazons to scandinavia and that he is the origin of the gothic people who come back for revenge against rome a couple of hundred years later interesting yeah so or i'm more than a couple hundred but but and so all the way into the time like when when rome starts dealing with the really serious barbarian invasions one of the beliefs that they had in rome was that this was mithridates coming back and and actually they identified mithridates with odin and they and so it was actually a like a pre-christian you hemorrhaging of odin where they identified this this figure from their past with the this this very fierce warrior god but who's also i mean odin's not just a warrior god he's a he's a trickster figure like he's always tricking people into things which is very much like mithridates and his the way that he did things so so you have so you had this idea then that let's say the pattern and this is where the pattern of of it's it's both the pattern of christ and of antichrist right the idea that you have a principality that is cut off but then it reappears somewhere else unexpected later on and so mithridates is kind of the type of this and one of the really interesting things that happens later in roman history after nero's death is that a lot of this gets transferred to nero so when nero dies and this is in i mean we talked about the sibling oracles last year right this is in the sibling oracles nero the resurrection of nero or the resurrection of nero yeah and the idea is that nero didn't really die but that he actually escaped and he went to persia so it's always these it's always from the east right so he he he escapes and he goes to persia and then he's going to come back basically as this antichrist figure as as god's instrument of judgment against the romans that's how it is in the sibling oracles so there's this idea that that that nero you know again the idea of the principality being cut off and disappearing and coming back now i said this is the this is the pattern of both christ and antichrist because of course within the hebrew tradition you have the idea of the stump or the root of jesus yeah right so the idea you know in this is in the prophecy of isaiah so that's in like the 700s bc that the the line of david the line of jesse is going to be cut off right and so a lot of times our like our king james translations is the root of jesse but it's the hebrew the word in hebrew is really the word for a stump and so the idea that the the line of jesse like a tree will be cut off and it'll be just completely obliterated and then in a time that's unexpected that's unlooked for they're going to start being these shoots that come up and that's of course you know that's that's the the church understands that as the focus and as christ so that's the that's the kind of basic pattern that we can establish and so by the time we get to the book of revelation we see this pattern both in christ and in the figure of antichrist right so you've done your you've done a really great video on the the what you call the system of a beast is that what it's called yeah i'm really waiting for part two i'm very excited it's becoming the most complicated thing i've ever written i'm trying to write this this video on the mark of the beast and explaining what a mark is to people it's so deep that it's i struggle to do it in a way that won't be just go over people's heads yeah like it just just kind of not seem like what i want to make it seem like so it's coming i worked on it last night very late at night good good i'm glad to hear that i'm really i'm really looking forward to it so so in the book of revelation right you have both this pattern of of antichrist right the the little horn and daniel and the you know all that stuff right so it's the idea of a principality that get gets cut off and then it comes back again later yeah but then also ultimately that's also the pattern of christ you know and so you know it's it's not hard to understand the antichrist is being sort of like the dark mirror of christ so if christ is the master pattern the antichrist is the inversion of that somehow yeah but what i think a lot of people don't understand or what they get really hung up on is you know you've got you've got people who want to go and do just a purely historical reading of revelation until they say they'll say oh well this antichrist figure here the beast or whatever that's a nero it's only narrow it's just nero you know and the christians mistakenly believed that he was going to come back you know and and he never did and so there you can see revelation is bunk yeah that's man yeah i mean it's silly because like you said there are so many versions of this pattern and it has to do with the it does have to do with something like the scapegoat it has to do with something like the the enemy or the evil that is cast out but goes and wanders in the desert let's say yeah but that this wandering can end that this thing can come back because those remainders never get dealt with there's an ancient scandinavian story about what is the demon cert i think is he's called where he comes to to to kind of attack the world and judge the world on a chariot made of everybody's fingernails and this is the most this is the best image of what this is about it's like you clip these little things off these remainders of your body your hair your fingernails all these remainders and those have a power i talked about this in the video i did actually sorry i realized it's a patron only video on the symbolism of of the inverted pentagram or talk about how that was that was such a good video the idea that black magic is about understanding the power of these remainders and how if we see the world that because we understand that that the world has it as a totality that anything you cut off it has a power it has a possibility of returning in revenge let's say you know i don't did you this is a totally random question but did you ever read a book by terry pratchett called the hogfather i have it someone send it to me and i have it but i haven't read it yet it's a fun book it's one of my favorite books it's it's kind of like fantasy but it's also satire and everything but like a major part of the plot revolves around collecting all of the discarded teeth of children so that they can so that they can do you know do some magic like something nefarious right but it's you know so they have to like infiltrate the tooth fairy's castle and all this different stuff and it's anyway it's it's a it's a kind of a funny story but also like it's it's one of those stories that has these moments of symbolic intuition that are just like a little just like a little too on the nose yeah but there are many you know there there are many versions of this story the problem of the castaway is the problem of the remainder like it's funny because talking about santa claus the entire story of rudolph the red-nosed reindeer the one the tv show that's what it's about right yeah the the land of misfit toys yeah this idea of these castaways that that continue to kind of exist in the margins and at some point you know when the walls break down they return it's the same with gog and magog you know the idea of putting these things out of the world and then they they're returning and so the the idea of the of the antichrist is obviously in christianity it's a way to deal with this it's a way to understand that this is inevitable that as christ comes he casts a shadow and that shadow gets kind of put out of the world but it's going to it has to return for things to become complete and the story kind of has to be resolved in a way that will encompass all of it together and so that's why when i you know when i talk to people about the image of the the new jerusalem as being something like that as being something like the the or the the crown of thorns as the crown of thorns as being an image of trying to resolve the problem of the of these remainders that come in the fall that this this problem of cutting off aspects of reality and pushing them to the outside i really love just as a kind of a side note i really love thorns as a you know in that we see in the genesis story and of course ultimately in the crown that christ has on his head as a as a symbol of the fall as a symbol of chaos because the thing with a thorn bush is that it's something that literally has too many points yeah and this is the i mean this is i mean literally it's got too many points and this is the i mean that's the world that we live in today you know it's a world where there's there's too much everything is vying for significance like everything is is disorganized there's no real hierarchy of information of knowledge of attention and just everything i mean just the news cycle twitter things like this where everything is basically constantly coming into our our our our view and saying i'm the most important thing give me your attention i just had a at a totally unprecedented rate exactly too many points and so but there's an idea there's a sense in which this is part of the process it's as if it really is the mystery one of the mysteries of christ which is that as this multiplicity gets filled up in a way that sometimes is is like sometimes a scandal in a way it's almost as if for christ all of this is coming together you can't totally discern what's going on until finally this whole thing gets caught up together into a final into a final revelation you know the image that christ says that scandal must happen i always come back to that image you know but woe to those by who it happens but the scandal is part of the revelation of christ so the spoiler is that you know jesus wins right spoilers yeah but in a way that might be very surprising to us like that's the thing that's the thing yeah so so you've got something like a book of revelation where here's this this antichrist figure this beast figure that is clearly nero yeah okay and it would be useless to deny that right because we know you know you can read all the things that the early church wrote about him and that even like non-christian sources wrote about nero like it wasn't just christians who believe that nero might come back as this really negative force right the pagans believe that too you know so it's so you have this figure that's clearly nero i would say it's coming back right now that's what i think well okay but you say that i don't know if you saw this but i think it's the british museum is it just opened this exhibit about why maybe nero was actually not such a bad guy it's inevitable like i mean i when i saw that i was like well of course what else what else could have happened this week you know you know it's very hard to surprise me at this point so so here's that here's the inversion that we're dealing with right now is that is that everyone hates constantine you know basically i mean except for us you know like you me and dr mario you know like i had a great exchange with him it's really fun and and i'm actually really glad that you guys recorded your video before he saw our video yeah because because it was just like this independent confirmation like like the thing is like he knows so much more detail than i do about about constantinople itself and and so for instance i knew about the palladium being taken to rome i had no idea that the constantine brought it or had one made or whatever in constantinople but but like that that really like takes that troy connection we were talking about makes it brings in it is in a way like he wanted it to not be troy but troy at the same time like he wanted to to create something that was both connected to the ancient but totally new at the same time yeah so i loved i loved that video it was great but you know everyone everyone hates constantine so but even as we're hating on constantine you know they were talking about taking on statue of him in york as part of i don't know if they ever actually did it but back when like you know america was tearing down all the confederate monuments and things like this in england they were they were doing something similar and one of the things that they were talking about was was you know there's this con this this statue of constantine in new york which i think is actually my cover photo on facebook right now yeah i saw it there yeah yeah but they were there so they were talking about like taking it down i don't know if they did or not i hope they didn't but so even as they're like trying to get rid of constantine they're saying hey but maybe nero wasn't such a bad guy i mean like if you think about what's going on right now yeah it's very much it's it's exactly the pattern of antichrist right yeah and there's but it's the pattern of nero is really powerful like in terms of if you want to look at if you want to understand what's happening now because one of the things people struggle to understand is how what we notice around us right now is a weird a weird mix of ultimate decadence and tyranny on the horizon and and people think well how like how is that possible how can you have both extreme degeneracy and tyranny at the same time but if you want to understand that look at nero and you can see how that plays itself out yeah yeah adequate and how nero imposed his degeneracy on others nero's you know like his desire to do that is because a lot of people think like well just let people be degenerate like does it it doesn't matter but that's not how it plays out it ends up coming into a point of tyranny where nero was imposing his all his darkness on the people around him and the people submitted to him i see you're an artist i was just thinking about about this the other day like what is the significance of the fact that nero thought of himself as an artist like that's what he saw himself as doing i mean if we you know the the story about his death is that his last words were something like how great an artist the world is losing you know something like that right so what's this i mean what is it you mean in the world where okay 20 years ago the idea the things that we're seeing the u.s president do would have been completely unimaginable now when bill clinton went on the arsenio hall show and played his saxophone the world went crazy this was like the massive scandal like how can the president be involved in this entertainment world and now it is taken completely for granted donald trump was a wrestling villain like donald trump was donald trump has so much of nero like not all the aspects of nero but he has certain aspects of nero in him like there are even some people who are afraid he's gonna come back exactly or want him to come back because some people at the time of nero wanted him to come back too yeah yeah so he i don't think i don't think donald trump is like it's totally nero but i think that there are elements of nero popping up like the idea of the entertainment president the idea of the the the president as a spectacle you know all of this is becoming almost taken for granted we we think this is completely abnormal but it's taken it's completely taken for granted yeah so yeah so the beast barack obama went to work for netflix yeah right like this is something which in any i mean it was started even with ronald reagan like the idea that that an actor could become president you know tell the the founding fathers that they would have just laughed in your face well tell me i mean tell anyone i mean like even even pagan rome despised actors like actors were the lowest they're the they're the lowest level of society like they're under prostitutes as far as respectability goes in the ancient world and so when when you have somebody like it wasn't just it was just it wasn't just nero like there was some decadence leading up to up to near so for instance during the reign of tiberius caesar according to i think it's tacitus one of the historians i'm pretty sure it's tacitus he talks about the riots and the street fights that broke out in rome during the reign of tiberius over these rival troops of dancers because there was like one troop of dancers that some of the aristocracy backed and there was one troop of dancers that the emperor really liked and people are having fights like riots in the street over these different things and and tacitus saw this i think rightly as a sign of as a sign of the decadence and the sort of the impending you know problems in roman society because you had people actors and dancers and those are sort of the same thing in you know at this time in history who who are supposed to be on the very bottom strata of society and now suddenly they're driving policy and they're driving intrigue and they're driving politics and basically like if you had an actor driving politics you know it's the same thing with like somebody like uh what's his name joaquin phoenix's character in in gladiator yeah commodus commodus who really did fight in the in the arena like that's a thing he historically did in fact one of the things that communist did i just have to go on a little tiny commodus rant here i'm very sorry one of the things that commodus did is that he would he would get a bunch of crippled war veterans together and he would tie them all up like 10 or 10 or 15 of them tie them up in a big bundle in the middle of the arena of course they're crippled they're hobbled they can't walk and then he would dress as hercules and like the lion-skinned cape and everything and take a club and and beat them to death one by one in the arena for his own amusement and the amusement of people around i mean these are crippled war veterans who can't fight back right and and he would say what he would say was that he was hercules slaying the giants yeah that was that was what he yeah so so i think you're absolutely right like this this idea of like a celebrity like an actor a an entertainer an artist then you know suddenly becoming like the the highest thing like the principality that's now driving things like that's that's definitely part of the pattern of antichrist and it's really i don't know it's really interesting to watch what's going on right now on both sides like you know in in america right now republican or democrat like you the same pattern is is go is happening yeah yeah it's a circus so the beast in revelation decided to kind of get us back on track a little bit yeah but the the beast in revelation is nero right but he's also more than just nero right this is something we talked about in our previous video reality lays itself out in these fractal patterns right so that you know these patterns that we have happening over and over and over again and what the the you know what's good so what's going on in revelation is is taking taking history and recent history that the history that you know especially like the recent pain of persecution and of you know wondering okay where is god in all of this pain that's going on around you right which is a very frequently asked question you know and and then taking taking history and looking at history really through the lens of the liturgy and i i'm you're probably aware of this but there are there are now quite a quite a number of biblical scholars and and also some people who have done a sort of more mystical read of of actually looking at the structure of ancient christian liturgy and then reading the book of revelation through that structure and so you actually see you know there's this moment you know where where john eats the book right and that sort of corresponds to you know so there's that's where it corresponds to the the you know the moment of communion and the liturgy so the idea is that you get this one vision of history that's like before communion and then the whole thing is recapitulated again but it's it's through the eyes of like through through the sacramental lens so you actually sort of get this view of history twice and you know i'm not a i'm not a revelation scholar i don't know how much there is or isn't to that i think it's very interesting but but i think that on a certain like symbolic sense or a sense of you know the patterns that we find in the book of revelation i think there's there's definitely something true about that so it's basically so what revelation is doing then it's taking it's taking history but it's it's saying there's something more going on here than just history yeah right something is something more is going on here than just the things that happened yesterday you know that the things that happened yesterday actually participate in this cosmic pattern the end of which is that the new jerusalem will descend right yeah so you can you can sort of take comfort in the final in the final victory of christ and so we have so we have these two patterns so we have the pattern of antichrist which also appears as a kind of mock resurrection or as a resurrection we see it in script in revelation itself as the idea of the fatally wounded beast that returns to prove the power of the of the beast and so you can see that almost like as a mock resurrection we saw it in the storm nero we see it as this the return of this this evil figure whether it be cert in the ancient in those kind of ancient cosmologies whether it be the unleashing of gog and magog at the end of the world all of this is part of how when you come to the end of things that which has been rejected will reign again it will show itself because it has been cast out to the edge of the world and so when you get there it's like you know you're traveling there waiting for you exactly it's like you're traveling you're traveling towards the end and you keep you push these things back right you push other things back because they're not part of the world like they're not they're not conducive to the existence of the world but then at some point you reach the end where there's more of that which you rejected than that which where you came from and so you end up in the in the circus and and you know the freak show all of this kind of stuff that that chariot of the world exactly and so so the idea of this this idea of the return of antichrist or the appearance of this at the end of the world makes sense even in terms of any normal any normal process of the development of any story or any cycle or any you know any anything that that exists and so then you so you have this pattern of antichrist but then there's a bigger pattern or there's something which there's a mystery which which flips it back you know and like which defeats antichrist or uses antichrist against itself or swallows antichrist you know there's it's hard to sometimes completely understand it but it's as if you know when you reach the end all these things even the scandals even the breakdown all of this then suddenly gets brought together and it makes sense in the whole so maybe maybe a good example of this that that we can give people to sort of like key into on a narrative level would be the arthurian material which is really important for english-speaking people even though ironically like most arthurian material actually comes from france but it's it's funny like in in the middle ages they basically considered there there were three kinds of stories or three cycles of stories that were worth telling and retelling there was the matter of britain which is written mostly by french people there's the matter in matter of france which is written mostly by italians and then there's and then there's of course the matter of rome which is like the old greco-roman yeah the ancient the yeah the ancient stuff the ancient mythology right and basic and and people realized that there was a high degree of fiction involved in these things like they weren't naive they just didn't really like but that didn't bother them no yeah exactly yeah and the matter of rome also included alexander which is yeah matter of included alexander yeah yeah so to talk a little bit last time we talked about the idea that that britain is founded by trojan exiles and that constantine kind of comes out of this and if you read jeffrey of monmouth he has this idea that there's this cons there's this idea in the the genealogies that he presents for constantine and ultimately for arthur where the the the proper line keeps getting lost and that survives somewhere else so it was like there was a so the idea is you have like here's the king this guy's the the rifle king of britain but then he dies and all of his kids get killed except for the youngest son who was in france at the time so he survives and he comes back right so it's the idea of the principality that gets cut off and then resurfaces and it happens over and over again until until eventually arthur kind of comes about and so arthur has multiple iterations of this pattern of the like the messianic pattern in his in his lineage already and so this idea so the idea is that this line of romance of these the idea of roman british trojans eventually produces via this repeated pattern it produces uther pendragon and of course his is more famous than arthur and i just have to point out here that if somebody says you know starts talking you know a few a few years ago like maybe 100 years ago there was this huge search for the historical king arthur and every every few decades like that becomes a thing again i think the most recent time was like in the early 2000s where that was like a really big focus in academia but if somebody if somebody talks about the historical art king arthur being a survival of a roman british general or something like that they're not really contradicting the legendary material and they're not really saying anything very important about it right because the whole story of arthur is the story of the seed falling to earth being lost and then shooting up again in kind of this unexpected place you and and of course in the case of arthur something you said in our previous video is that england is the edge of the world yeah right so so so we have the seed falling to earth being lost and then shooting up again on the margin of the western of the margin of the roman world and of course you know this is the this is the messianic pattern right again going back to the idea of the stump of jesse which is the springing up again of the long lost davidic kingdom once again on the margin of the roman empire and then he becomes the pantokrator you know the idea is that christ becomes something beyond the roman emperor himself which nonetheless contains the idea of the roman emperor which is by the way one of the things that happens in in some of the arthurian stories arthur actually is sort of acknowledged as as like the emperor and it's that's in mallory and some other places yeah there's some there's some versions where they actually take rome yeah yeah so which is amazing if the if the story of arthur contains christ we shouldn't be surprised that it also contains antichrist right that there's something and and this actually begins it with with arthur's birth that there's something ambiguous and even kind of sinister sort of left-handed about the parentage of arthur himself so in the very early legends uther pendragon is is actually himself a shape-shifter so he he he changes shapes and uses those powers to beget an illegitimate child on on princess e grain of cornwall and in the later this is later amended that he did this with the help of merlin who we probably just need a whole video to talk about maybe merlin because and i know you've done some in the past but he's a he's a very interesting figure so by the time of mallory's la mort d'arthur the idea of illegitimacy is actually removed from the story it's clarified that okay yes uther did rape egrain but when arthur was conceived it was already after they've been legitimately married so like they have to sort of clarify that arthur is actually a legitimate son and therefore it's okay for him to be king and all this stuff but the problem here of illegitimacy that exists in the seed of the arthurian story is never fully removed it just gets trans transferred to these other characters in arthur's immediate circle so the story of arthur that develops particularly in the francophone world and again most of the stories that we remember as as the arthurian legends like lancelot guinevere the holy grail all that stuff come from french authors yeah yeah there are these really intricate patterns of you could say sexual deviancy in these stories right which include things like incest adultery cuckolding and i think that these stories are difficult they're they're problematic i hate that word problematic i should i shouldn't use that but they're they're difficult they're difficult to sort of like look at and respond to and you know to the point that when i was a when i was a kid i wasn't actually allowed to read the arthurian stuff and it wasn't it wasn't really because my parents like had read it themselves i don't think but they just they just sort of knew that like there was some adultery and some other stuff happening and so i wasn't actually allowed you know i mean i read them anyway you know i read i read howard pyles the boyzone king arthur which actually doesn't have any of that in it you know it's kind of sanitized and just really fell in love with the arthurian stories as a as a as a kid but i think that people who have been paying attention to your videos recently especially and and this is the this is the little lil nas x or i don't even know how to say his name but this the little nas x king arthur connection that that all of your viewers have been waiting for here okay i think that if people go back and watch that video that you made on little nas x and juan division talking about talking about the pattern of witchcraft right and and you know sexual deviancy and all and the way that all relates to each other that you will actually be able to understand something really profound about the arthurian story and that is that you know in the most popular versions of the arthurian legend arthur's relationship with his queen guinevere is sterile right and there's no biological cause given for this in fact it's it doesn't appear to be like a problem with arthur right he he does actually sire a son due to a case of sort of accidental incest with his with his half-sister more gauze and and this this character more gauze you know is the queen of orkney she's really interesting because she's she's from an island in the middle of the sea right this you know orkney is this basically a rock in the middle of you know the north sea so she's from an island in the middle of the sea you can think about the the symbolic implications there and then and and she is she's also the sister of morgan le fay you know who's this and and like her she's associated particularly particularly in the later literature both more gauze and morgan le faye are associated with witchcraft so the point that eventually the two of them are combined into a single character so in most modern retelling to the story they combine these two characters because there's this sort of sense there's this intuition that they're a little redundant and morgaz is herself she's unfaithful to her own husband multiple times and all four of her sons including mordred who is arthur's you know bastard child yeah they're portrayed in the francophone arthurian material and this includes gawain right who is who is actually like a great dude in the british story like he's the he's the original king arthur's best knight and then he eventually gets replaced by lancelot in the french versions of of the arthurian material and when he's french you know right because he's because because yeah yeah because lancelot is french and and and so when he does then suddenly all of these guys from the orkneys which if you're french that's the the literal edge of the world right they become they're they're portrayed as being uncouth dangerous capable of both great loyalty but also great harm like they're they're deeply loyal until they think you've betrayed them even if they're wrong and then they stab you in the back yeah they are in other words sort of you could say shifty characters like the sea right and so and so this doesn't like i said this includes gawain and although even in the in the british versions and this is still in in mallory gawain gawain has powers that are cyclical they that they he becomes stronger or weaker with the cycle of the movement of the sun across the sky so like he's he's strongest at noon and he's weakest at night so there's something even even in his british origins there's something like cyclical and kind of wave-like about about him but the second reason for arthur's lack of a legitimate heir is that he is cuckolded by by guinevere and lancelot right so guinevere carries on an also sterile affair with with lancelot who has an illegitimate son of his own right so again the problem is not lance a lot lancelot can totally have kids and lancelot's illegitimate son is galahad who is like the the only like the only really pure righteous virginal knight in the in the you know in the later arthurian versions of the legend so in the and so what we can see there is kind of this perpetuation of that uther to arthur fractal pattern of you have like a wicked father or like a a maybe not so much wicked but just like a shifty father who begets this this totally righteous son right that has to do like just to help people understand also so we in order to understand this we always have to remember that this is happening on the edge of the world right the arthurian stories are about how it's almost like how can there be resurrection or how can the seed be planted in unrighteousness and and and come up in righteousness like how is that possible like how does the world end and start again and so the the those all these irregular patterns that you see all the sexual deviancy all the incest all of this has to do with the problem of dealing with this and and it was a way for these french authors to sort of take their own take what's going on in their own society and then place it on the edge so they can deal with it i think a little bit yeah but it's also it's also it's also trying to deal with the mystery like the mystery of of something of resurrection or the mystery of the you know this is one of the strangest and most difficult mysteries that you find in scripture which is the the mystery of the levite the idea of how resurrection comes out of death through a a through a a taboo act you know and so right the incest of the leverage is the is justified but it in any other situation the leverage is actually you know the idea of taking your brother's wife is completely a sin like it's a sin it's a taboo it's a it's a it's a it's it's unacceptable because it breaks it it breaks the laws of causality it breaks the laws of natural causality it's like if you marry if you have a child with your with your brother's wife than that child like what is he to you he's because he's a confused identity because he has he has he has multiple sources and is that your nephew or is that your son exactly and so that's that's the problem of incest is that it actually breaks the world apart in in confusion but so with the idea so you can understand that that's kind of what's happening on the edge of the world all this confusion all this breakdown but in that darkness you know you could almost say like despite that darkness then a seed appears in that darkness that becomes the the seed for the future world you know and so it's it's very mysterious it's a mysterious pattern and it's a dangerous it's a dangerous pattern if you take it the wrong way yeah but it's it's also it's also very much a christian pattern so so this the the thing that's really interesting to me about mordred right so so arthur's illegitimate son it's his nephew but it's his son yeah and by the way there's that that pattern that basic pattern of accidental incest followed by a character who is your nephew but then ends up killing you that's actually also in scandinavian legends in fact it's alluded to in beowulf that's alluded to in this very so almost every time in medieval literature when somebody when the text makes makes a point of of saying and so and so was so-and-so's nephew and he succeeded him that's a way of saying that some something happened there like it's it's it's it's like a you know it's like a nice way of saying yeah something happened here that shouldn't have happened but so in in the sort of the final version of the arthurian legend mordred it's mordred himself who rats on lancelot and gwynevere he's the one that reveals the adulterous affair of his aunt who sort of been his mother right but of his aunt and king arthur's best knight which what's what's interesting is and and t.h white in his in his retelling of the story he really suggests that arthur probably knew this was going on the whole time i mean how sort of how could you not know right but exposing the sin publicly in this way like uncovering the nakedness right forces arthur to confront it and the resulting fallout destroys the destroy society destroys the round table so the sterility of arthur's marriage and the way that it brings about the downfall of his kingdom which is kind of the symbolic end you could say of the trojan roman british line after that it's the saxons who come in you know aka the english right they take over but i think that this this this pattern is actually foreshadowed in the legend of excalibur right the the sword you know you know arthur's legendary sort and so in the version that mallory has there are two different swords there's the sword and the stone but that's not that one yeah that one actually breaks in battle and so he's given excalibur as a replacement by the lady of the lake and again there's this idea there's this feminine presence in the water which is very which is related to like there are all these like sort of troublesome feminine characters in the arthurian legend and they're all tied to like bodies of water in some way so but in this case it's a positive presence right so the feminine presence in the water and she gives arthur the gift but what most people don't remember is that in the main version of the story in mallory it's not one gift it's two gifts there's the gift of the sword and anybody injured with a sword well like the sword makes wounds that can't be healed okay and that's what the sword does but there's also a second gift and the second gift is the scabbard and in the legend if you wear the scabbard any injury that you're dealt will heal right and so it's so basically there's this this in the get there's the capacity to both wound and and to heal and of course the the in mallory the the scabbard which of course the the word for scabbard in latin is i'll let people go look it up but it's it's it's a sexual word like where do you put a sword right yeah early on in his career arthur is tricked out of the scabbard the possession of the scabbard which is the proper resting place for his sword by morgan le fay so morgan le faye actually tricks him out of a scabbard steals it and throws it into a lake and so arthur for the rest of his life he has the sword but he doesn't have a proper resting place for the sword hence the sterility of hence the sterility right and so so the idea is that if you think about the way that that more gauze and morgan lafaye are often sort of conflated as the same character and so morgause is or where morgan le faye is the witch that steals arthur's seed right so arthur has this bastard child it makes it impossible for him to bear a legitimate heir and note that by the way we've now come full circle all the way back from the greek princess that gave giant birth to the giant albion right this idea that you had you had an improper union with a principality that results in the creation of this monstrous child and so the resulting illegitimate heir of mortred manifest here as antichrist and of course the arthurian legend ends with this apocalyptic battle you know cam laden when where where mordred and arthur injure each other arthur kills his son and then arthur is himself mortally wounded yeah and what maybe a lot of people don't know is that in the middle english litter of mort arthur mordred is wielding another one of arthur's sword and the sword that he's wielding is the sword clarend which is which which is arthur's sword of peace it's not supposed to be used in war it's only supposed to be used to knight people and for other ceremonies but it's never supposed to be drawn at violence and you can think about in going back to the the apocalypse the the promise of peace that's associated with the beast with the antichrist that this is what people believe he's going to bring he's going to bring peace so i think that arthur's death and and it's notable that the most famous versions of his story are always called the death of arthur you never called that there's no story called the life of king arthur you know there's the death of arthur and and arthur's death involves two movements that that involve magical women in the sea and the first is the return of the sword so when mallory arthur instructs one of his knights to return excalibur to the lady of the lake of course it takes three tries the sword is beautiful he doesn't want to throw it away but he eventually casts it into the lake where the lady catches it and it returns to the place that it came from and the second is the passage of arthur himself and this is to me one of the most mysterious things in medieval literature is that arthur is taken away to avalon to the island of apples to be healed of his wound and he's taken away by three magical queens one of whom is morgan le faye like what's going on there why has she switched sides what is happening and and so in in in mallory you know to finish the story out gwenevere and lancelot end their lives the only only with the only happy ending that you could have in a story like this which is they they both become monks they both become monastics and they they end their lives lancelot as a hermit and guinevere as the abbess of the monastery they take monastic vows and they become holy they repent right and so in this way you can see the sterility of arthur's reign is transformed into the holiness of consecrated celibacy so there's this resurrection that actually kind of takes place there and arthur himself continues to participate in this same pattern which gives him birth so he becomes the once and future king which is almost the very last lines of the death of arthur the lord arthur is you know here lies arthur the once and future king so there's this idea that arthur is going to return to britain one day you know in the eschaton right he becomes the once and future king he becomes the seed that falls to earth or goes over the sea you know to the margin so he's going to spring up in that unlooked fourth place and i think it's the the fact that it's not just the antichrist that's on the margin but it's also the messiah the messianic figure that goes to the margin so that when you reach there you hit the antichrist first but then christ is also there right there he's he's filled all things with himself yeah that's the image of christ moving from east to west that you find in scripture like that you know like like lightning the moving from east to west that you know that it's this is this is the the hardest thing is to understand so for example like you said you know why is morgan lafey there or why is morgan le faye part of those that bring arthur into this hidden place you know for him to return yeah and i think that this is this is this is of course the this is these are attempts to try to deal with this problem like to deal with the problem of the end and to deal with the problem of you know how is it that how is it that things can start again without re-encompassing even let's say the dark elements of the story you know it's it's it's difficult because you know the this is this is like the final this is the final image is is the idea that somehow all of these things will participate in right in the eschaton in some transformed way and it's hard to totally understand it we can see it like we can have a little glimpse of it i think and the conversion of rome is a place where we can have a glimpse of it you know where as rome was antichrist was the you know rome destroyed the temple rome persecuted christians you know the emperors did all of that but then in a strange turn you know from diocletian who was also this persecuted and persecuting emperor to to constantine who kind of changed all kind of flip the story but also reuse the elements of the story right we have a sense that you know there's a puritan sense that we always kind of have in our mind which is that that christ brings a kind of purity where all the things are going to be cast aside and right and and there'll be something new but that that new has to be nonetheless made out of the the gathering in of of everything together and so there's like a destruction and a recreation but that return to potential and that bringing together of a new body has to be made out of that which was there before and so what's the difference this is this is a question that i have like i'm not sure you can even answer that what's the difference between the demon cert who gathers the fingernails of all the fallen to create a chariot on which to destroy the world what's the difference between that and the resurrection of the dead like there's a difference of course there's a difference there has to be and and but the fact that they look like each other the fact that they look like each other makes it difficult i think makes you understand why in scripture there's a sense in which even christians will be duped by antichrist right because it's going to look like the resurrection he says even if it were possible he would deceive even if it were possible the elect right it's the idea that a lot of people and of course this is why you know saint john in his his his letter to his spiritual children he he's warning his his his you know you know you know there there are many antichrists will come into the world you know that's what he tells that's what he tells them he's saying listen these antichrist figures are going to pop up and people are going to say oh there's christ oh there's christ oh there's christ right and that every time somebody says that you have to just be still because like what i mean when christ like people will know there won't be any ambiguity about it right so this is this is interesting to me because one is i think that it's the difficulty and telling the difference between these two things that is why some christians get hung up on the idea of universalism because you know there is this the sense in which all the margins are accounted for and but there's also the sense in which like there will be some things that will be outside the walls of the city and sort of like perpetually eternally forever outside the walls of the city some things can't be integrated yeah one of the images of the new jerusalem in revelation it says that that all the glories of all the nations will be gathered into the new jerusalem it's like that's a beautiful way of understanding it's like all that which is glorious of all the stories yeah will be gathered into that final image but like but then there's also things that won't be gathered in like you know there are aspects which will that that will but it's hard to understand it because okay so here's another image it also says that there will be no ocean right no no more c no more c yeah that means that there's no remainder yeah so i don't totally understand it i mean obviously obviously i can't understand it but it's like this image of on the one hand this image of the new jerusalem because there are these images where it says like out that there are things that are outside like when the dogs and there's all these images of what is outside of the jew jerusalem but but then but then there's also this image that there's nothing remaining these two contradictory images are difficult to for me to reconcile that's why revelation is so difficult to think about yeah so so this this idea of you know the principality who's cut off and returns right obviously you have arthur is is the example that most people who are listening this video are going to be really familiar with yeah but i just want to point out that in the middle ages this pattern manifests itself in places other than britain so for instance there are there are stories about the idea that charlemagne is going to come back really i didn't know i had no idea yeah there are stories the stories about the return of either charlemagne or frederick ii the holy roman emperor frederick ii the idea that you know in the final showdown with the enemies of christianity right in other words basically the final showdown with islam that charlemagne or frederick will return to lead the armies of the christians in kind of one final battle in denmark it's actually not a king it's one of charlemagne's paladins oger the dame or holgar donsk who is the he's the one that's going to return and he's and there's a 16th century century legend about him actually conquering all of the countries from jerusalem at the center of the world all the way to paradise in the east so the idea is that he went all the way from the center to the margin and basically converted all of them to the christian faith and so then the idea is that he's going to he's going to he's he's sleeping now he's slumbering right and that he's going to come back and rescue denmark which is on the edge of the world right he's going to come back and rescue denmark and it's in its hour of need kind of at the end of time in your video with dr mario you talked about the the the you know the marble emperor right this idea that that constantine paleologus that he you know who dies in battle with the turks you know you know not all of the last the not all the byzantine emperors in the in the waning days of the empire were like awesome people let's just say but there's a reason why things wane yeah yeah there's a reason why things the reason they were in decline at that point yeah but the last guy i mean he goes out the way that you're supposed to go out right he you know at least from a at least from a the perspective of a germanic philologist right you're supposed to you're supposed to die facing the enemy right but there's this legend you know that that he he didn't die that he was basically like turned into marble by an angel and buried beneath the gate of constantinople and that one day he'll awaken and he'll return you know yeah there are these stories they're crazy stories about the fall of constantinople about how all the all the the priests and the people serving the that they were serving the liturgy during the attack and that all the priests and the people actually kind of entered into the walls without finishing the the liturgy without reaching the the point of communion and that you know at the end they will come out and serve the last liturgy and wait but it's a it's a it's very romantic but it also it also is a testimony to the the pattern of this resurgence of light the resurgence of of the pattern itself that how as the pattern breaks down there is in that breakdown a promise that it's going to return inevitably because it's what holds the world together so in that in that kind of in that legend i think there's there's something particular about the the the very byzantine insistence the very christian insistence that there is something liturgical to the to the pattern of the world right so that so you can think about this idea that we find i think that i think that this is in saint nicholas kovaci loss in his the life in christ but i could be wrong but there's this idea that we find in the fathers that communion is the eschaton right that that in in some sense and like this is why and i know that you've recently had a conversation with eugene but alaskan which i'm really i'm really excited to see but in in his book in laura's which i think is a really important book for where we are right now you know one of the things that one of the main themes in loras is that a lot of people are anticipating the end of the world because they're approaching the end of the sixth millennium since the creation of the world according to their the byzantine reckoning and so a lot of people are anticipating the end of the world and but there's this one point where where one of the priests in the book basically says listen you don't know when the world is going to end but you have a pretty good idea of when you're going to die so prepare for that right like like i know as a as a matter of fixed certainty that sometime in the next 50 or 60 years i'm going to die like you know that's that's a you know bit you could bank on it you know and so so but but there's there's this there's the sense that you know that's kind of related to that that you know when you take communion you know even if you're you know in some some cities you know some cultures in the middle ages you know a lot of people only only commute at easter and christmas or or only at easter you know but but this this idea that communion is the well this is insane maximus there we go this in his ecclesias ecclesiastical mystico mr gogy mr goji he he talks about this idea you know that the that every part of the liturgy corresponds to a moment in history of salvation and that the for instance the dismissal of the catechumens is the last judgment right and that so what's beyond that which is the eucharist it's the liturgy of the faithful you know is the that's the eschaton that's the that's the the life of of god the life of the trinity the life of the age to come so you've got to you've got to prepare yourself for that that you know don't worry about like when is jesus coming back you know like we know that jesus is coming to my mouth like this sunday so get ready you know confess and prepare yourself but the so this idea then that the liturgy is interrupted in the fall of cancer's constantinople and that it's going to be finished one day that's yeah it's it's the eschaton itself right like that is the like that's that's a very true pattern like that's a that idea would have made really deep intuitive sense to people in the middle ages you know you know even if it's like really fabulous or like difficult to get your you know like no one's treating it like as a historical you know fact or something like that but it's but it's but there is a sense in which the liturgy was interrupted but it's okay but it but it is going to finish you know like it it will so maybe tell us about i could have i think tell us about the last emperor the virgin that's found in the apocalypse that's that's what i was getting to and i think that we could get to the end of this and then just sort of tease ethiopia and then maybe come back and and talk about it in another video yeah so this is in again this is the apocalypse of pseudomethodius so there's this idea that that we have in the in the apocalypse of the pseudo of pseudomethodius the two ideas that are really important one is the coming of the antichrist right and of course the apocalypse of pseudomethodius is really dealing with the rise of islam and why is you know jesus has already come and the empire converted so why are we losing like what's going on you know but what's really interesting is that the the the the actual antichrist himself does not come from islam in in the apocalypse of methodist that he follows the church fathers in saying that the antichrist is going to come from the tribe of dan that he's going to basically he's going to be one of these for in other words from one of these israelite tribes that was wiped out that vanished but is going to again resurface at the end right and so he talks about the antichrist and he says this man is born at corazon and will be raised at the sata and will rule at capernaum and corazon will be glad because he was born in her and beseda because he was raised in her and capernaum because he will have ruled in hers he's quoting old testament prophecies and he says for this reason in the gospel the lord three times past the sentence of woe saying woe unto thee corazon woe unto thee the seda and unto thee capernaum if thou has been exalted unto heaven thou shalt be brought down to hell so these are the places where christ did like most of his earthly ministry and those are the places where the antichrist is going to manifest in the last days so that's one pattern this pattern of antichrist the other pattern that we see coming up here at the end of the apocalypse of pseudomethodist is the idea of the last king of the romans that's how he's referred to in this the in the in the the the latin version of the text he's called the the rex romanov you know so the king of the romans so in other words the last roman emperor and there's this idea that the last roman emperor survives like sort of hidden that the lion of the emperors sort of survives hidden within the nation of ethiopia and that in the last days the last roman emperor manifest himself and he he rules over sort of like one last moment of christian revival of christian conquests over their enemies of roman conquest over their enemies because there's the same thing by this time before the antichrist comes and that when the antichrist comes this is what it says it says the king the in other words the last roman emperor will take the crown from his head so take the crown off of his head and he will place it on the cross and then he will spread out his hands to the heaven and deliver the kingdom of the christians to god and then the cross will be taken up into heaven along with the king's crown so this is a prophecy and this is a long time this is written several centuries before the fall of the roman emperor the empire right that it prophesized that there's a day coming when the king's crown so the roman empire will still sort of exist but only christ will be will only have christ as an emperor because the earthly emperor empire will have been brought to an end yeah and it's almost like it's the end but it's the resolution yeah within that end right right it's it's becoming fully what it was supposed to be in its end at the same time and an interesting manifestation of this is when you know in the orthodox church we put our bishops in the partially in the garb of the byzantine emperors yeah right the the the sacos the yeah you know the the main investment of the bishop is that it's not originally an episcopal investment it's a it's an imperial vestment you know even even charlemagne when he was coronated he he sent off to byzantium to get one because he wanted to associate himself so he was he was when charlemagne was crowned he was coronated in the garb of a byzantine emperor yeah very deliberate yeah well i know that he really wanted to see himself as the continuation of the byzantine empire yeah you know in his succession he's this he's like the the he's the he succeeds irene's dead husband basically right so when we when we put our our bishops in this garb one of the things that we're sort of saying by that is that the the kingdom continues but now it's totally vested in christ right and of course the bishop is just like the icon the living icon you know of christ within the community of of christians so it says that it says that when this happens that the the cross will be taken up into heaven along with the king's crown because the cross in which our lord jesus christ was hanged for the sake of the common salvation of all across itself will commence to appear before him at his coming as a refutation of of the treachery of unbelievers and the prophecy of david will be fulfilled which says in the last days ethiopia shall stretch out her hands unto god because from the sea of the sons of jesus the daughter of full the king of ethiopia these last will stretch out their hands to god so again there's this idea that the last roman emperor somehow survive or endured in ethiopia manifested in the last days and then the kingdom it and then hands the kingdom over to christ yeah and it makes sense in terms of the role of ethiopia we'll talk about it in another the cosmic role of ethiopia seems to be in this this universal story for sure and so and so you know and then from that point the story goes kind of the place that you would expect it to go which is the antichrist rules over mankind in the absence of the of the true roman emperor things get really bad the the faithful are persecuted and then christ returns and the rights just shine forever as stars in in in the world which is which is how which is how it ends so it's a it's a really beautiful you could sort of say extension of revelation like there's nothing in the which by the way one of the things that you you'd get a kick out of is that early on in the apocalypse we get the the origin of dog-headed men like which which son of know where they're descended from so just just tease that out there for people who want to go looking for it yeah exactly but there there's we can guess yeah but the i really love the apocalypse of pseudomethodius because it it really functions as an extension of revelation like there's nothing in it that doesn't that's not that's incompatible like that the two sort of map onto each other really really well and what the apocalypse is doing is it's trying to a pseudo-methodist is doing is it's trying to clarify what's the role of rome it's trying to clarify when the roman empire falls and this is you know hundreds of years before it falls you know but when the roman empire falls is christianity invalidated does it cease to exist and the answer is no that that that basically this pattern that we see first see in in the apocalypse of saint john and that we see foreshadowed in alexander in constantine in nero like all these patterns that they continue to work themselves out in a way that is consistent with the the ultimate victory of jesus christ right the the coming the sign of the coming of the son of man as the as as the text says yeah and there's also a sense in which rome persists you know even today people think that's a funny idea but you know the ideal of rome is still continued on you know whether it is in the two-headed eagle that that ended up in the austro-hungarian empire or the same two-headed eagle that ended up in the russian the russian empire the the they've saw themselves as a continuation of rome whether historians like that or not or whether they think it's legitimate or not it it means that the rome had not yet passed and in a way rome hasn't yet passed it we're on the i would say we're very close to the end of rome in a in a in a bigger scale because it's like the idea of rome is kind of has a this weird last glimmer in a in the unified europe but it's a kind of strange perverted you know fragmented version of it but it the idea of rome is still is still there and it's still it's not completely dead so can i throw one last idea at you go for it and then we'll we'll then we'll have another conversation yeah so sarah nicholas ii the last russian caesar right there's a there's a like it's it's to the point where it's you know maybe sort of a meme of like these these young guys who convert to orthodoxy and then just develop the biggest possible man crush on tsar nicholas the second like i don't know if you've noticed this oh yeah well you see it in your facial hair yeah we don't even have to ask them because they start to sport the hair the same facial hair star nicholas yeah so so that what's really interesting to me here is that i think that this is really this is that same pattern manifesting itself that the the seed is cut off right and then it springs up again in what's the most unlikely place in the world for a for the veneration of a russian emperor to to spring up i would say west virginia you know like you know i would say texas like like you know you there's you know in america we have we have multiple layers of you know we don't like we don't like kings you know but also like we don't like russians and so you know for for the the veneration of like the last russian emperor to spring up in such a surprisingly strong way you know the devotion you know to the to the royal family it's also because everybody knows that there's a relationship between britain and russia right in terms of that final emperor like that the connection is so strong that one of them became a saint it's like it's it's so so so it's that's one of our family saints that's my daughter is named after saint elizabeth and so it's not a it's not a it's not as far again just like the idea of troy and arthur and constantine and arthur you know in these surprising joining together the the the connection between the extreme east and the extreme west or the you know these two extremes of the world in the in the character of tsar nicholas is something which i think is playing in narrative function as well and and that's i mean so in our last episode you famously said that america is the of babylon so but we're also and i stand by that i know i know it's fine one of the things that's i i'm going to try to have a conversation i think with paul vander clay about why why did the medieval model why did we lose it like what happened why did that transition happen and one of the things that people don't always understand is that one of the things that brings about the end of the medieval model is the discovery of the new world that there is such an influx of resources gold and other things from the new world like we can't even understand how how much it just destroyed the traditional trade networks and economy economic things that were kind of holding western europe together but but basically you know but america is the is the sort of it is the end it's the it's the in one sense like it's the ultimate margin yeah right especially especially california california yeah that's exactly what i was getting to california seattle right that these are they're they're it's as far west as you can go like it's the end yeah you can't go you can't go west any farther after that it's east yeah exactly and but there's something also interesting like if you look at california it's an interesting it's interesting how you can see some of the seeds how can i say this like it's california also has a microcosmic form like structure and it has it has aspects of it which is actually the most like traditional right you know most spiritually alive place and also the worst degeneracy that you can ever where was the same spot where was father sarah from that's right he's in california he's like as you know like as sort of like hardcore traditionalist as you could sort of possibly imagine right and and yeah cause because it's but it's it's the same thing it's you get to the edge you get to the end of the world and all that's left is the remainder you know so so king arthur will land you know on the west coast yeah somewhere in california i wouldn't i wouldn't be like totally surprised if that happened honestly i i'm but anyway i think that sarah nicholas is i think that he is manifesting he's manifesting this pattern and that's why like i don't really mind like i'm i'm happy to see you know a lot of a lot of these these guys like they know intuitively like in their hearts they need a king you know and you know of course then ultimately that's christ but then to also to also like have this deep love for kind of like the last emperor who is who is manifesting again you know as a saint he's manifesting again in in the the most unlikely of places yeah i think is i think that's that's another way that we see this pattern kind of playing out in the orthodox church right now and i and i do think it's actually ultimately a beautiful thing yeah i think so too all right well look we i think this problem might have been the longest conversation that i've had in the in i probably on my channel how long was it i don't know like an hour and a half maybe which is totally cool i didn't even i didn't even notice that it was it was great and so next next next conversation we will definitely go into all the mysteries of ethiopia and i'm looking forward to that definitely so thanks everybody for your time and your energy and richard go ahead and plug again all the things you're involved in because yeah stuff the big thing is of course i'm on the admin school podcast if you want to hear me talk tolkien i'm actually pretty excited about this next episode that'll be coming out on the 10th of june because i had dr lisa kudris back on to talk about marian figures in tolkien's legendarium and this is the the like i'm always nervous about talking about the mother of god because i feel like she's the sort of like you just can't talk about her you have to you have to venerate an icon i don't know what else to say and yet i keep finding myself places where i'm where where i am talking about her so this is like the most marion thing that i've ever done on the internet and i'm pretty excited about this episode we're we are also still working on getting a website up for a book that i want to publish and hopefully you'll be contributing to it and some other people will be contributing to contributing to it's called finding the golden key essays on a toward our recovery of the sacramental imagination and it's kind of i'm hoping it's going to be sort of a nexus for this project of re-enchantment that we've all kind of been involved in so look for that i'm hoping the website will go up in the next week or two and you'll be able to people will be able to actually submit abstracts for essays to be included in the volume so all right everybody so stay tuned and and we'll definitely be back with some some other surprising and wondrous wonderful
