i went up for to bletch about the first time for a meeting in 2003 so it's quite a while ago now and i was there representing this group called bcs women the british computer society women's group so i was going up there representing them and i didn't really know much about bletchley park on the way there in my head i kind of thought maybe it was like 50 old blokes kind of wearing tweed jackets smoking pipes and doing the times crossword on the side and maybe a bit of code breaking so that was kind of my idea and i think in those days everyone kind of thought that's that's what went on there i found out on the first trip that more than 10 000 people worked there which was a shock and that more than half them were women and being a woman in computing i was really interested in that so i ran an oral history project after that to capture the memories of the women that worked there hms pembroke 5 was just an umbrella word to cover the activities that took place at bletchley park and so at the launch of that i actually found out that bletchley park were having financial difficulties so that's the first time i'd been aware of that and then i was up at a reception just after that at bletchley park and that's actually the first time i did a proper tour of the whole site that's when i saw that you know the hearts that looked like they were falling down you know it's like hot sticks with a blue tarpaulin over it and had a proper tour with someone who who'd worked there during the second world war and you know he was telling us about all the major code breaking achievements in each of the huts and and i just thought well and this place might close you know it was said that the work that was done there shortened the war by approximately two years 11 million people a year were dying and i just thought it's ridiculous you know we've got to do something about it you're a computer scientist by trade aren't you what did it matter to you about some code breakers and people solving problems well i suppose it's all kind of geeky and techy and i definitely am a geek and you know i've got a degree in computing and a phd in software engineering so i guess i really am a geek right and so there's a very strong connection with the kind of all the the maths to start with you know there's loads of maths in computing and the maths in sort of cryptography and stuff so you know i loved it from from the geeky aspect but also the you know the human point of view and the fact that all these people work there so it kind of had both for me really and and of course the fact that it was about 8 000 women and and young women as well so i didn't find that out till later but they were mainly like between' and 23 the women so you know thousands of young women you know and some young men and a few old men all together you know doing this code breaking and you know and kind of trying to to save millions of lives it's just an incredible story by the time it got to 2008 which is when i started the campaign i was head of department at university of westminster so i was head of a computer science department and you know i found out that bletchley park might have to close because they didn't have enough money and i just thought i've got to do something about this so i emailed all the other heads and professors of computing in the country and asked them to sign a petition which was on the government website at the time and and in those days you could look at the names of the people that were signing so you know i sent this email out and then a few hours later i thought i'll see if anyone signed it and i looked at the petition there's all these famous professors of computing from the uk and i was like oh my goodness all these professors you know think the same as me we've got to do something about it so that really gave me confidence to to then take it further so what we did was we wrote a letter to the time so that was signed by 97 heads and professors and also i contacted all the journalists that i knew which in those days was only about four luckily one of them was rory keflan jones from the bbc he got back in touch with me and then got me on bbc news the next week and so july 2008 i was on bbc news saying i'm ashamed to be british we've got to say bletchley park and that went across the world which was amazing but then i noticed that you know a few weeks later i just thought well what can i do now because i've made a big splash but like nothing much is happening so it wasn't until a few months after that i started using twitter and social media and then realized quite quickly the potential of using particularly twitter for kind of finding people that are interested in the same subject and creating a social media campaign bletchley park is now quite quite a visitors attraction isn't it i mean how does it feel have you been back since much and tell me about that i've probably been there i've probably been to bletchley park i don't know 50 100 times now but i have to say every time i go i see something different and find out something new so it's a very exciting place to visit for me you know even now and you know so there's bletchley park on one side which is all the history and the cryptography stuff then there's of course the national museum of computing which is on site there too both equally amazing attractions and yeah there's just so much there to see i've you know i've probably been back like i said about 50 times and you know there's all the code breaking huts there there's stuff about the women that work there there's the rebuild of turing's bomb machine which is incredible if you get a chance to see that working at the museum of computing they've got colossus working you know just these amazing machines which had to be rebuilt because of course they were all destroyed at the end of world war ii so there's some incredible attractions there and i think the site is about 26 acres so you know it's a really large site with something for everyone so the campaign took about three years so we started with traditional media and social media about six months in and it took about another two and a half years after that for the director of bletchley park to actually say that bletchley park wasn't you know it wasn't ever going to close and that it was safe because they got 4.1 million heritage lottery funding which of course you know substantially helped with the renovation so so the book is the story i've written the story of the campaign what we did using social media so it's kind of a primer in in how to use social media in a campaign too but then that's also intercut with the story of the women that work there of the enigma and touring and you know all the things that you've probably heard about would like to know more about that that story's in there too so what's next then have you got any more plans to bring back any more british institutions of computing well i mean actually my focus now is techmum so you know the stuff that i'm doing now which is all about teaching mums to be more confident and to understand technology so we've got a program which is stuff like basic i.t skills through to app design and web design social media staying safe online and a bit of coding in python because i love getting the mums having a go at python programming too and the program's running in london dublin essex and and now in nottingham too here we are at bletchley park but in a part of the bletchley park site that's the national museum of computing in the uk and they've had the sense to have the sighting here for the rebuild of the colossus machine
