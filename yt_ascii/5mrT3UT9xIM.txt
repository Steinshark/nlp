well guys another day another influencer scam this time from none other than logan paul yes that's right folks i also thought he had enough money from boxing with floyd mayweather to where he wouldn't need to promote an outright scam but he did anyways let's go to the board and check it out ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla the internet detective and today we're talking about the logang guys you forget about this guy he's been doing making big waves making fights making bank but not enough bank because he's recently endorsed a crypto coin called dink doink i'm doing the same thing as you holding my doink now dink doink is one of many tokens with zero actual usefulness instead like every other ponzi token it's built off nothing but marketing hype a few celebrity shout outs and the eventual sell-off that's gonna happen and here's the honorable logan paul to promote his ponzi scheme what up dink doing telegram it's me logan paul now i know what you're thinking logan what the are you doing here i'm doing the same thing as you holding my doink that's what i'm doing this is a point i believe in y'all actually this is something okay dude this is something everyone's been doing lately they think like to themselves maybe if i run a ponzi scheme ironically it will be forgiven right like maybe if we just lean into the fact that everyone knows it's a scam i can then scam and it's okay because hey guys we're being ironic about the fact that it's a coin no self-awareness doesn't save you congratulations you're a piece of trash who knows you're a piece of trash good good job buddy good job it's my favorite one to be honest ding dong is so much more than a meme coin it's a multimedia coin cartoon meets crypto it's the blockchain baby in in in cartoon fun comedy format i'm gonna be doing an episode myself soon okay so he promotes it he says there's gonna be that's a big thing there's gonna be cartoons involved but it looks like they're trying to rip off the the south park style and in general he presents himself as like an interested but unaffiliated investor in this coin saying this is the dumbest most ridiculous coin i've ever seen and that's why i'm all in but it turns out this is incredibly misleading because logan paul is far from just a guy who found out about this coin like anyone else because in a podcast with the dink doing ceo he said that logan paul created the thing we might as well you know be be honest about how this came about i was chilling with logan and and we were like what's the stupidest name we could think of for like a coin right what's the weirdest name we could think of for like a little mascot that's like a dumb spring we're like dink joint oh my god his name's dink doink and it just came alive like logan designed the character on his phone on snapchat so you design it and then you go wow this is the coolest thing i've ever seen it's your thing like what you don't think you should mention the fact that you designed the thing that you're the guy who designed the whole like mascot idea i mean take credit for your idea if you thought of it take credit but i think he doesn't want to because obviously it looks bad if you're pumping your own little ponzi coin you created and it's not just logan paul the whole gang's here the whole impulsive gangs here look at this it's disgusting promoting this to your fans hey guys what's up it's me mike here to send some love and camaraderie to the dink doing telegram team i know you guys have been busting your ass to make sure that the hottest newest coin how is this not parody how are you able to look at yourself in the mirror and not be embarrassed by this performance here wha what what am i watching 2021 is dink doink with the hottest functionality and all of the most built-in techniques tactics and capabilities it's funny because he's like saying it like he's being sarcastic but there is no turn in this video where he's like i'm just joking guys i wouldn't promote upon he's like trying to ironically do it but also he's serious dink doink is cleared to be the hottest  coin ever here's their other buddy okay you've got all-star cast of logan paul universe a dwarf mama here to tell you each and every one of you is beautiful you know why you know why because y'all are part y'all are making me rich i got in early and you're pumping my bags that's how this works guys they get in early you pump up their bags they sell it off of one of the greatest if not the greatest coin of all time of all time i love how they all pretend like this isn't their little house's idea they were all sitting in the house they thought of this idea and they have some other guy launch it who's like an unknown this guy jake he's not very well known but they actually are the ones who thought of and they promote it like it's not their thing dink doink is going to the moon you don't believe me you don't have to you can just be naive and dumb it's all good i don't think we're the naive dumb ones here okay but y'all the community we're not naive we're not dumb  family oh hey you're not even dumb if you believe that that you're a a family right when they sell off they're going to be your family try calling them and going hey i lost the house i'm on dink doing see what this guy mister were family says to you then oh my god this is such a disingenuous little scheme created by the low gang unbelievable even the founder was asked about like dude why is this even a coin in the first place and he could hardly answer it you know as you well know there's over ten thousand cryptos out there right now what makes your project different from the countless amounts of bses that launch every day pay attention good question what a great question thanks for that question specifically because it's like the most important question right i've never been asked that question this is actually my first podcast okay dude what is this answer the stalling hey that's such a great question really great question and i'm going to answer that question this is my first podcast ever guy you don't have it thanks for that question specifically because it's like the most important question right i've never been asked that question this is actually my first podcast okay as dink doing so okay i have a really good answer to it all right it's been 30 seconds get to the answer logan paul wanted more money that's ding ding ding hey you got yourself an answer baby that's your answer logan paul wanted more money but sorry go ahead i'm i'm doing this for for a very specific purpose and dink doing on its face is a funny cartoon and it's a meme and it's a community having fun on twitter and it's social media stars tweeting about it every week and you know that's what it is on its face what happens with the social media stars stop tweeting about it by the way you ever ask yourself that you got a few people to tweet while it makes the money what happens when this thing inevitably loses steam it went from going up to going down and what goes up must come down so if you guys made a million dollars off this you've taken a million dollars from your fans congratulations you've reinvented a ponzi game great job guys you know you brought up bitcoin earlier and and what's going on with elon and those two communities now in sort of a coral and i find the crypto space in this moment to be at at its most important moment it's ever had where community turns into need at some point to move forward we have the technology we have the attention we have the passion we have everything except a useful coin that people actually want to use so you're gonna solve that by creating dink doink except a unified community the need of cryptocurrency is a unified community you're saying and your solution to a fractured community with too many coins is to create another coin this is the dumbest thing i've ever seen and the only explanation is a blatant cash grab this coin has no usefulness outside of a few celebrities talking about it and it's supposed to be like about comedy and fun but really at the end of the day this is just an investment a very bad investment that is clearly going to enrich a few people at the cost of everyone else and the last thing i want to show you to prove that is the fact that 80 of the these coins are currently owned by the top 100 wallets okay guys if you want to buy dink doink you can go check out who owns all the coins and right now the top 100 holders of whom you can be certain logan paul and the gang or some of them own 80 of this thing and you're telling me that this is gonna revolutionize and change the world no i don't think so it's just another scam from another celebrity influencer who's pretending to be ironically doing it it's embarrassing logan paul designed this whole thing he needs to actually stand by this coin instead of pretending to be some outside sort of oh i think it's a fun coin you designed it duh you know don't be like that these influencers need to pay for this stuff it's so disgusting they use their fans like piggy banks and i for one am tired of it anyways that's basically it i hope you enjoyed this little review of dink doink the new scam coin logan paul's been promoting thanks for watching and i'll see you next lost time wake up you smell the coffee
