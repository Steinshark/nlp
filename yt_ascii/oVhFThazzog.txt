you've already seen the god of computers well this this is gore the god butcher it's the first server from ek with two epic milan cpus seven gpus and it's all water cooled by ek water blocks this one only has five gpus five gpus well that's still pretty impressive let's crack it open and let's crack open this message from our sponsor hetzner hetzner offers high performance cloud servers for a great price and they're currently offering free setup fees for all ax dedicated root servers with amd ryzen cpus for a limited time only learn more at the link down below [music] i haven't even seen pictures of this so step one is to crack it open with my trusty jerry rig everything knife can confirm these are very sharp by the way as exciting as the packing materials are though the contents are much more so because this is one of the few of these ek servers in existence and it's actually a prototype so very few people on earth have ever seen one of these whoa have they done their own chassis or do you even know anything about this i know quite a bit but i don't know what that is four power cables the plot thickens and this i actually don't know what this is that looks like vga to hdmi but there's also usb it's got a set of server rails here clearly it's intended to be rack mounted if the hope was that there were a lot of heavy accessories we could take out one by one and the machine wouldn't be that heavy i guess that's dead yep well let's lift it i can barely get my fingers under the foam up we go oh my god it's so slippery because it is very slippery are you good yep okay hold on i'm not good i'm not good this is not wait okay i'm good what the hell i mean i know it's water cooled but how much water is in it here just to give you guys some idea how heavy it is it makes bad sound what the hell is xeno-wolf motherboard i've never even heard of xeno wolf but you know they're serious because it's w-u-l-f they actually make servers they have for a bit and like water-cooled workstations xeno-wolf does yeah and so now they're like teaming up with ek to make a server with them i do not recognize this chassis but that doesn't mean that it isn't an off-the-shelf design it could very well be and at the back count them one two three four five gpus no idea what kind they are yet four power supplies each of the 1200 watt variety to be clear it doesn't actually consume almost 5 000 watts of power it's this is for redundancy but it can draw three thousand so only one of them is redundant then two can be redundant but then you're like really pushing is pretty much the only one hey screwdriver alex soon hopefully geez very soon though for real prepare to be wowed are they wowed i haven't seen it yet i haven't either are they are they wowed though what the hell the hell oh she's beautiful that's a lot of water cooling holy crap balls what are we even looking at here this appears to be a completely machined delrin custom reservoir as much as we love the look of acrylic it's not the most durable material and this is much more likely to stand up to 5 10 15 years of deployment got not one but two windows in it i guess we could use oh no this is the fill port well what are the windows for oh you know what i bet it's so that you can have it in either orientation and you can see a fluid level ah makes sense oh sick i love this thing it has dual d5 pumps again if you wanted to play something for 5 10 15 years that's what you want my single d5 lasted me i believe it was either 12 or 13 years not bad yeah those things are freaking bulletproof and this this is really cool this seems to be some kind of distribution manifold we've got our pump going oh i love this cable management or i should say tubing management brace here and it's not just the parts and material choices it's design choices look at how close the spacing of these hex head bolts are there is absolutely no way that this o-ring could come out of the groove you could probably get away with like maybe a hundred and fifty percent this spacing on a consumer product so lana's i have noticed something yes is it what you're going to tell me about that green board back there because that is trippy look at this there is like raw ass soldered contacts for the 24 pin and the 8 pin power connectors on this weird pcb back here what it does is it takes the interface of these power supplies which you can see right here is basically just a gigantic ground a gigantic 12 volt and then all the other voltages that you need and converts it into something that a standard motherboard can use it's something that i have thought about before that i've theory crafted something that i've wanted actually to build for ourselves but i've never seen it in existence and i've certainly never seen it in a commercial machine it's just exposed too which is fine in a completely enclosed machine it's only 12 volt you can't hurt yourself with 12 volt dc i mean you could maybe start a fire you'd have to try pretty hard okay what were you going to tell me about sorry were you going to show me how these are quick disconnects and that's super cool because it means that you could actually swap out a cpu just like that boom swap out cpu or even cooler more than that all of this water cooling yeah is a single unit shut up that you can just take out all at once shut up so i kind of want to do that i mean i can't see any reason why not to yeah oh my god is this whole thing the radiator i don't think i've seen a rad this thick since the fesser company there's three of them in there actually three radiators three and they're low fin density and made out of aluminum isn't aluminum they're like budget crap they said it works better they tested both of them and they also say that like if you had copper in here you can't touch the gpus because they're just holding a lot of heat in whereas these aluminum ones it just gets rid of it immediately well i don't want to speculate anymore on that ooh temp sensors both at the inlet and outlet that's really really important because that'll tell our control board over here if we have some kind of a failure of our fans for example if our inlet and our outlet are the same temperature that might mean there's an issue with the cooling system i see two thumb screws here and here is this something to do with oh oh they're not even thumb screws you just so i think we might need to take this off and it comes out the front alex i do not see an obvious way for this whole thing to come out are you sure you're not mistaken i also don't see an obvious way but i am not mistaken but let's put it down and have it facing out this way so you have no evidence that you are not mistaken no i talked to one of the guys that helped design this yesterday he designed it yesterday i think the whole thing just slides yeah i think we need to put it down first you keep wanting to put it down alex live a little look at him he's all sweaty he's all stressed out i am the opposite of stressed right now crap just put it down it was a very short distance drop i'm trying to put a god damn it we don't even know how much this costs it's probably like 70 grand it's only got like 512 gigs of ram in it and i don't even see any storage alex oh this is as good as it gets this is milan x with like the 3d v cache 9 000 each for the cpus they said that there might be two screws that we need to undo might be what do you mean might be i thought you said they designed it yesterday they should remember well but they didn't remember if they put them in for shipping or not okay i found this little pull tab whoa oh we did it what the trip is going on here holy frag oh wow there's your cooling right there buddy this is like freaking the size of a cooler for a small vehicle oh yeah most of the parts are automotive what is the deal with the flow layout of these radiators because i remember corsair telling me in no uncertain terms that stacking radiators like this does not work and yet it appears that ek is doing just that if you put your pumps in series the flow rate is identical but the head pressure doubles if you put them in parallel the flow rate doubles but the head pressure is identical is my understanding that makes sense okay so we want higher flow rate i guess because we've actually got a very wide water cooling system thanks to this manifold so we're coming out of the two pumps into the ends we go out from here we come back into here then on the one side we go into this rad and back to the reservoir and on the other side we go into these two rads the one that there's three three in the stack we go to these two radiators which are running in parallel and then they come together here so the radiators that get no they all get the same temperature water it looks like well i like it oh also this fan controller is insane it has actual processing on board right that does ai stuff to optimize the fans based off of water temperature cpu temperature and stuff the usb connector is not usb it's just pure serial i2c bus stuff so this cannot interact with your system right so it's not an attack vector or anything like that cool but what you can do is connect wi-fi and bluetooth to this so you can monitor your system from like anywhere you want without connecting your actual system to the internet not even the ipmi just right this module that's pretty cool this is some funky tubing that they're using for these really tight bends here check this out there's actually two different kinds of tubing in this system and to be clear both of them are extremely non-porous style tubing so you're not going to get a ton of evaporative water loss through the tubing but then there's also this one which seems to be ribbed in such a way that it allows it to bend at 90 degrees in a super tight space like that i've never seen a tube that holds its shape like that yeah like that is it possible that they've put some something inside the tubing like some kind of inner skeleton to keep it from being able to collapse it doesn't really feel like it no it really doesn't that's wild here's a better look at our pumps while we've got it out and this is cool ah this is the power interface that i was referring to before so you slide it back into the chassis it clips into here or doesn't even clip it just slides onto here and boom this whole module is powered by this weird intermediary board that i was talking about before you can actually see from here the raw leads are coming off of this first intermediary board back here that the power supply slots into those are soldered to this board then everything that goes to the motherboard or gpus is using standard pc power connectors like this they did say i think it's right here there will be a spot for hot-swappable ssds in the future but they don't have that done because it's a low priority low priority yeah this ain't a storage server i guess that's as good a time as any to discuss what the crap this thing actually is for rendering mostly lots of rendering machine vision that sort of stuff machine learning big hollywood studios would render like animated films on something like this they said that something like many of these they said this server alone can do like frames per second of animations shut up yeah they were getting like three to 400 frames per minute in i think was redshift if you lack the context that's a lot it wasn't that long ago that we were talking about seconds per frame and it wasn't even that long before that that we were talking minutes per frame this will never stop tripping me out the way that nvidia's reference design for this professional grade card just has like soldered freaking connector power connector wires running into the back of the board like this well and they still have the like the big fan cutout thing yeah even though it uses a completely different cooler from the consumer grade 30 90 and 3090 ti reference boards i'm sorry i meant this uses the same board as the 3080 class cards not the 30 90. the 30 90s taller one thing they did mention is that they want to create their own custom envy link connector so it normally comes with like two slot spacing but then they can't fit five or seven gpus in a server right so they want the single slot one and they're just getting nvidia's blessing to be like good luck can we make it it seems like it's gonna happen really okay nvidia can be very easy to work with there's one thing that could be a little bit tricky for us to plug back in alex what's up i accidentally ripped out this usb cable and i have no idea where it goes oh it's possible that it's down here that would be really bad it's mangled oh yeah whoops oops sorry ak more like sorry us it's not like we're sending this back to them good luck getting it back ek in fairness to us ek told us this thing did they use the word hot swappable well not hot swappable okay but what's with this quick swap quick swappable something fails you can just pull the whole thing out chuck a new one in power connector quick disconnects you're good to go well then it wasn't entirely unreasonable of us to think that that meant we could pull the thing out without also removing a cross brace and a gpu and a usb cable and before you say it no you're not expected to remove it from the other side because it's actually cable managed into everything else here so we were wrong but they were wrong too that's the closest you're getting to an admission of fault from me all right let's put it okay let's put it back together one cool thing about this system not that it would ever matter for a real world deployment is that the cooling system will work the same regardless of whether the top panel is on because it's all in this just self-contained unit here this thing is wild i will tame you jk i like you wild power supplies are loud three and four wow yeah i believe these are 6400 rpm fans they're going to put 7 200 in the final one they don't need to run it that fast that's just what they're getting one thing that is unique about this one is ours came with windows 10. normally it will come with linux or windows server but they were like you guys are going to want windows 10. that's fair i guess they don't want me to break it in under an hour task manager alrighty that's a lot of course that's a lot of ram oh that's a lot of a6000 gpus so we've got a whopping 512 gigs of system memory then another like almost two 250 on the gpus also you should check out xvision xvision this is their fan controller thing okay so we can monitor our fan rpm here they're only at seventeen hundred and they do excuse me pardon over six thousand this isn't the kind of thing i would recommend during a windows update but it's probably fine it has at least one power supply worth of redundancy so what we're gonna do is we're gonna unplug the power supplies one at a time and plug them into our power meter see no problem there he's happy i swear we have better power monitoring stuff coming not just coming actually purchased and in the lab we just don't know how to use it yet they're sending someone up to train us okay so what's on the agenda here well i did a couple benchmarks on this and realized that i had just absolutely no context for what it was doing so i brought over this beauty right here 12 900k 3080 ti it's a nice gaming right about as fast as like a mortal could have so we're gonna drag race them yeah i fully benchmark it already we don't want to wait for this to finish but ouch let's do blender on our origin system this took one minute and 30 seconds holy crap it's taking longer than i thought it went yeah no this isn't right yeah that was no oh wait' seconds it's done oh i know what happened alex we read it as minutes but it was seconds remaining it was working just fine how's our power consumption about a thousand watts nine hundred thousand around there i hear the fans kicking in now yeah one thing the kamino does have going for it was it was a lot quieter than this that's mostly because of the power supplies yeah and i was gonna say that feels like a bit of a choice that they made yeah wait holy crap alex it was cpu rendering and it still went that fast oh i specifically told it gpu i don't know what its problem is but let's have a look at what gpu performance looks like [laughter] under eight seconds the really wild thing though is that that cpu run was not only fast but we were drawing 900 to a thousand watts on gpus especially five of them that's very reasonable on cpus these things are freaking hungry all right let's have a look at what power consumption looks like in gpu rendering okay i'm going okay the render's over did you catch it only five minutes in five seconds five sec five point eight three seconds i think i briefly saw 1100 watts we need a longer render here okay well do a classroom so that took our test pc three minutes and 37 seconds three minutes 37 seconds all right you better look quick at the power consumption because it might disappear this one's all cpu rendering looking like it'll be about 40. shaving three minutes off your render isn't too bad yeah a little bit wow those cores though yep on cpu it was 41 seconds can we run it in gpu probably holy crap that was an eleventh second classroom render we're gonna have to go harder i wanna see gooseberry holy sh that was a one minute gooseberry and most of that time was just loading in all the assets and preparing to render do it again building optics acceleration structure blah blah blah we're up to 40 seconds now the gpus have not even kicked in yet they are doing nothing boom here we go okay we've got 15 seconds to look at this 250 watts on that gpu 260 on that one what's overall power consumption quick alex look look you got three seconds it's done under a minute we had 1700 watts i didn't miss it 1700 watts this is like a multi-minute benchmark on even high-end machines what do you want me to do now solidworks visualize we can do more later when we want to really see it this is just to compare to the origin pc got it which did this which is ridiculous settings in three minutes 51 seconds okay can i start it yep and this should hit all of our gpus and all of our cpus at once time remaining three minutes two minutes three minutes wait is this not going to be faster oh i hear some fans going we got over 2 000 watts there one minute 19 seconds so it is a third the time is it possible that having the cpu in the mix is actually slowing it down we've seen that in blender before with really fast gpu setups we can try it the really wild thing to me is that the kinds of productions that can afford one of these afford many of them like it is worth it if you're rendering out like full movies in super high detail and to be clear you're not rendering them once if you were then you could just wait you are rendering again and again and again and again and looking and reviewing and tweaking and to be clear the software we're using for rendering right now is not for like a feature film or a production this is more for mechanical design one minute fifteen so no no it was one minute nineteen left wait yeah it's faster slightly improved it okay okay what's next we can do v-ray all right v-ray which one do you want cuda so on our origin system we got a score of 2520 yeah to be clear we're not hating on origin systems that's very fast very fast it's just not fluid works powered by xeno wolf fast it's just an order of magnitude less money i want to see the power consumption right now what are we at holy crap we're over a thousand watts on each one we're at 2300 watts this would blow the breaker if we had the whole thing plugged into one north american 120 volt circuit 82.90 yeah it's quite a bit faster see you later buddy not bang for the buck faster makes you wonder why they don't just buy an army of gaming pcs they're gonna have a cluster anyway i would trust this to work way more all right new test i want to see the cpu one okay i had enabled cpu for this is that right yeah the maximum temperature we've hit on any of our gpus is under 45 degrees that is ludicrous all right just under' 000 to beat that's a bit more a little bit more it turns out two epic milans are about 472 percent faster than 12900k i'm kind of curious i want to submit this score and just see how we compare so the most anyone's ever gotten in the test is 109 000 and i believe what we just did yes was the fastest that those processors have ever gone in v-ray we like absolutely killed and that comes down to cooling yeah yep these three are us i did it yesterday too oh my goodness what's faster then 77 63s are faster in v-ray yeah it seems like it oh you know what i wonder if it's overclockable or something what's the asus rs 700a rendertron was this just some asus engineer just like dinking around or something it kind of seems like it kind of looks that way the fastest intel cpu has ever gone in this is 62 000. i think you mean the fastest two intel cpus yeah the fastest two intel cpus the fastest four intel cpus has ever gone is even slower that does it for performance it's freaking fast but i still want to know where we end up for thermals well with performance there is one more thing i tested the two of these in gaming oh i only needed one game yeah it turns out the gaming system is way faster for gaming yeah shadow of the tomb raider got 209 fps this thing got 128 absolutely slaughtered these gpus they don't boost up and suck back power the way that the gaming ones do and unfortunately games can't leverage the fact that there are five of them so they just get left in the dust also cpus the one in there 1200k five gigahertz not that gigahertz matters but these are much slower because there's like 64 cores i want to see something that actually takes a bit i want to know how hot these things get oh it's hot back here oh yeah it's not like hot pot though oh wait hold on hold on it is true that it does not feel hot to the touch is that just because there's so much radiator removing heat though the tubes also don't feel hot to the touch you say that like they're cheating well no i just mean like their explanation for it doesn't make any sense there is one kind of stupid thing that i want to test while we're doing this yeah if their load balancing is good they they told me that you can just rip out a power supply during a render they're simulating a failure yeah so if it was to just like ah yeah i didn't enjoy that but it's fine you did yeah i kind of did it's fine yeah it's totally fine it dropped down to about 650 700 watts where we dropped one of the power supplies and on the squid that has two power supplies we're up to 1550 which is still well under the peak capacity of those two units combined i'm very sorry mr server but okay and it's immediately back all right i was really thinking we might see some higher gpu temperatures after a while but they are not doing that we're at 46 degrees on the hottest gpu and the cpus are sitting at 60. and you can see they're not going up anymore that's freaking it this is like perfect cat bed temperature right now and this is like the perfect segue to our sponsor grammarly so much time can be
