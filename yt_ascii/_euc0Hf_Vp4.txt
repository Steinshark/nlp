variable refresh rate or vrr has been one of the coolest pieces of tech to grace our pcs over the past decade before vrr you could have really ugly screen tearing even with a high-end graphics card but vrr has largely eliminated this problem for gamers with recent hardware however there's been a lot of confusion over what exactly vrr does and how it works so let's get right down to explaining it the basic premise of vrr is rather simple it matches up your monitor's refresh rate or how many times per second it's showing you a new image with the frame rate of your graphics card traditionally monitors would run at one constant refresh rate say 60 times per second or 60 htz but your gpus frame rate would swing considerably depending on how hard it had to work to render the action in the game you're playing at that moment this mismatch would often result in tearing where your monitor would essentially try to display multiple frames at once because the gpu has feded a new frame in the middle of a refresh cycle the historical solution to this problem was to use a feature called vertical sync or vsync which would lock your graphics card's frame rate to your monitor's refresh rate however if your gpu's frame rate falls below your monitor's refresh rate vertical sync can cause stuttering as the gpu isn't finished rendering the next frame yet vrr adjusts what your monitor is doing instead making it a very attractive solution while it is still possible to get tearing if your frame rate exceeds your monitor's maximum refresh rate this can typically be solved by setting an fps cap in your game settings but not all vrr is created equal as there are several different kinds of vrr buying for your attention there's vasa adaptive sync which is an open source flavor of vr that works on a driver level amd has free sync which is really just adaptive sync that amd has tested and put their stamp of approval on then there's nvidia who has a group group of solutions under the g-sync umbrella g-sync on its own is a proprietary solution consisting of extra nvidia hardware built into the monitor to handle vr processing the term gsync compatible on the other hand refers to an adaptive sync screen without extra nvidia hardware on the display but that was tested by nvidia to confirm it works well similar to amd's freesync at the top of the nvidia food chain is g-sync ultimate which includes fancier monitor ers with better hdr support along with that special nvidia hardware built-in compatibility is better than it used to be and that newer gsync displays that have the extra hardware can now work with non- envidia graphics cards even though this wasn't always the case and the various flavors of adaptive sync should work on most modern gpus oh and vrr is part of the hdmi 2.1 spec and works similarly to adaptive sync which is more of a display port thing still with me great will'll tell you whether spending extra money on a g-sync monitor is worth it right

nexo at the link below to go what vrr can be susceptible to motion blur or ghosting although this problem is not unique to vrr the issue is that displays can have a harder time compensating for it when vrr is enabled you see pixels have what's called a transition time to change from one shade of gray to another and even though we use color monitors we're talking about shades of gray because the actual light usually passes through a color filter to create the final image that you see anyhow pixels are driven a certain amount so that they'll transition in a way that looks correct when your refresh rate is changing so often with vr you'll also have to change the amount that you drive the pixels and this can be tricky if you don't do it or don't do it right blurring or artifacting can occur vrr displays compensate for this by driving pixels a different amount or overdriving them depending on refresh rate determining the correct amount of overdrive requires extra processing and larger lookup tables which store the correct values the display should be using which brings us back to g-sync monitors with g-sync hardware inside tend to do a better job with this extra processing and give you an image with less motion blur that's why the extra hardware now of course we're not endorsing nvidia or telling you to go out and spend extra money on a g-sync monitor if you care more about preventing screen tearing and ghosting blur isn't something typically notice you might be completely happy with an adaptive sync monitor that'll cost you less money now if you'll excuse me i got to tear out of here so thanks for watching guys if you like this video you might also like our video on pixel cleaning how how does your oled not burn in what does that setting do what is it check it
