there are plenty of products out there that promise to make your tech experience more reliable more powerful or more just high quality and much gooder in general and while many of them do exactly that there's still plenty of snake oil out there that's about as effective as those supplements they sell on late night television so let's go through three kinds of straight up useless tech you really should be avoiding i'm sure number one we'll get a big eye roll from a lot of you before we even get into details we're talking about fake audiophile gear to be clear we're not trying to pick on folks who are serious about sound higher quality headphones amplifiers and dax do make a real difference in audio quality but unfortunately there are many products that sound cool without actually sounding cool it's a pun two particularly egregious examples made the news in late 2021 an audiophile network switch and an audiophile ssd the switch manufactured by synergistic research costs 2600 us dollars and claims to improve your audio quality by smoothing out electrical noise unfortunately because switches only handle digital bits ones and zeros there's no benefit to spending all that money to reduce interference as the signal either goes through perfectly or it doesn't at all in the event of a failed transmission the switch would just try again and fetch the correct data which has no impact on audio quality it's a similar story with the ssd which you can immediately tell looks quite different from your normal m.2 storage device it comes with a real tech controller possibly to imply improved sound quality along with a couple of chunky capacitors that look like they belong inside an amplifier and even an expensive oscillator meant for higher end scientific equipment very fancy but again nothing is going to improve the inherent quality of a song stored on discrete bits or give it a special natural feeling as the developer claims the only thing this ssd will improve is the manufacturer's bank account whenever it goes on sale speaking of ssds let's move on and talk about ssd water cooling yeah you might have noticed that many motherboards these days include small passive heat sinks for m.2 ssds and some ssds even come with their own you know fair enough ssds do get hot and it's a positive for them to receive adequate cooling but the key word here is adequate you see ssds only suffer performance and endurance problems when they're facing temperature extremes either hot or cold fortunately you can usually keep your ssd in an acceptable temperature range simply by ensuring your case has good airflow and isn't being choked by dust or a scorned lover and yeah you might want a little heatsink on there if you're dealing with warm ambient temperatures but this hasn't stopped some manufacturers from creating water blocks specifically for ssds and while there's nothing wrong with putting one on your drive for some extra glam it's almost certainly going to do nothing to improve the speed or lifespan of your ssd over a passive cooler or just a fan that's pointing at it so don't bother spending the money and the hassle to water cool your ssd there are plenty of other components in your rig that could benefit from water cooling instead we'll talk about one more piece of useless tech right after this message from our sponsor freshbooks freshbooks is

no credit card required at freshbooks.com techwiki finally let's talk about one kind of item you may have been tempted to buy during the gpu shortage low end graphics cards you know the ones like the nvidia gt730 that take up one slot might have one dinky little fan and don't even have an x anywhere in the name seriously though the only real reason to get one of these guys is if you need an extra video out and even then it's cheaper just to get a usb to hdmi dongle but what's really egregious is that you often see these cards marketed as a way to run graphically intensive modern games not only is the actual performance you get incredibly weak but in some ways it's even worse than integrated graphics and they're typically not much cheaper than buying something a tier higher that can actually give you a respectable gameplay experience the kicker is that nvidia has sometimes rebadged very old low end gpus to make them seem newer the gt430 and the gt730 are actually the same chip yet you can still buy the gt730 now despite the fact the gpu is 11 years old it should be going into fifth grade have you seen a piece of tech that would function better as a paperweight let us know down in the comments and you might see it in a follow-up episode now if you'll excuse me i'm off to buy an overclockable power supply really just want to crank it up yeah get get the vroom vrooms going you know
