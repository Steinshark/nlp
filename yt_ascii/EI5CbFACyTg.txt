so huawei has just announced the mate 40 pro it's the most powerful phone they've made by an absolute landslide but it's also super confusing okay the unboxing experience hasn't really shifted too much from standard huawei fare but you will notice this new circular ring on the front that'll make more sense in a minute you've got the smartphone on top you've got an insert with a sim ejector tool and a clear case oh look at the size of that camera cut out there's a usbc cable a pair of earpods but not earpods and this is interesting a 66 watt charger a single watt more powerful than oppo in oneplus is 65. now when i pick the phone up for the first time i had two immediate observations one good lord it's big it's thankfully a little shorter and narrower than the note 20 ultra but this is a chunky boy we haven't been given exact specifications yet but it's definitely heavier the second thing though is that i absolutely love the finish dare i say that for me this might just be the prettiest phone i've ever used to put it into samsung terms it takes the kind of crazy colors of the galaxy note 10 and fuses it with the more sophisticated matte finish of the note 20 ultra when i first got it i was just sat here like okay i can see red blue oh there's purple there's a bit of green it's everything and that would also kind of explain why for the mate 40 pro overseas you only get two models black and this this is all the colors and just generally it's a nice smooth feeling phone there's not a single sharp edge to be found on it anywhere a cool little red power button too also just when you thought you'd seen every possible way to design a smartphone camera module here's another one they call it the space ring i call it the camera donut but you can kind of see where they're coming from it's got a very alien ufo type aesthetic to it but i'm still not sure if i think it looks futuristic i can't help but feel like flip it upside down and this is an ipod scroll wheel but there is a major perk of having a camera ring this wide and central and that's the fact that it prevents the phone wobbling oh and if you are enjoying the video by the way a sub to the channel would be cherished i'm kind of running out of words there is just as much action happening on the front you're looking at a 6.76 inch oled horizon display with a resolution that sits somewhere in between full hd and quad hd it's a good screen it's got a 90 hertz refresh rate really quite stellar colors but most notably this 88 degree curvature it's so steep that from the front you can't really see the sides it looks like the display just falls off the edges and that these buttons are actually just mounted on the screen for me this is an aesthetic positive but at the same time it's kind of a practicality negative because it doesn't matter which angle you look at the screen from some part of it will look distorted you look from the sides and the front looks off you look from the front the sides look off you have this green tin to a noticeable discoloration plus if you just compare this to the mate 30 pro from last year which had this nice uniform bezel that kind of followed the display around the sides the bezel here kind of tries to cut the corner a bit it doesn't look as good and you have got this massive camera hole punch too but i will say on that note that what's in it is worth the visual distraction anyways there's a bit of a an elephant in the room you probably don't need telling that huawei right now as a company is in a bit of a pickle their phones don't have google services no google maps no google play store huawei can't sell in the us at all it's not good news and what makes it so much more of a shame is that i've been using this huawei mate 40 pro for a few days now and there's just some really cool stuff here i don't remember this but last year with the mate 30 pro huawei fixed auto rotate most phones always just had a standard feature where if you're holding a phone in portrait your content is displayed in portrait if you're holding it in landscape the content is the landscape but that's not ideal because every now and again you might want to be able to lie down but keep your content still in portrait orientation so huawei started using the face scanner on their phones to see which way your face was and just always match it why am i telling you this well it's because this year i would say that huawei has taken that further and they've fixed always-on displays most phones nowadays have an option to keep this low power consumption screen on at all times just to keep you posted with the time and notifications but if we're always managing to use the face scanner to now be able to only show you the screen when you look at the phone they're calling it eyes on display and i couldn't believe how well it works like the first time i tried it i remember i just burst into this massive grin because it's cool tech and it's not a gimmick the phone's running mui 11 based on android 10 and i really like how it handles guest accounts you just pull down tap here and that's it you can just hand the phone to someone else without worrying that they're going to look through your stuff and this multi-window mode is it's one of the few things that's made me really miss using an android as my main phone we've got both a 3d face scanner and an in-display fingerprint scanner so you could choose how to unlock your phone and the battery life is fantastic the capacity is four thousand four hundred million powers which is about average for today's day and age but the software is so aggressive on apps running in the background that for the last two full days i've been using it i'm finishing the day on like 35 left and finally as you probably expected huawei's brought their a-game to the camera this is a meaty setup its main camera completely nukes the iphone 12 pro in most situations it's got that nice big sensor to get a crispy foreground background separation the front camera still isn't as natural looking as i'd like it to be but it's very detailed almost too detailed and with this phone part of the reason we've got that chunky hole punch is that there's also an ultra wide front camera and it's not an afterthought like you might expect it to be this is a really high quality super detailed lens plus five times optical zoom which means you can get crisp shots all the way up to ten sometimes fifteen times magnification in fact weirdly the only thing that i wasn't really impressed by was the phone's night mode and i didn't expect to be saying that because a couple of years ago huawei was so far ahead of the competition at taking photos in the dark it was funny and this phone's still great at it but i just think it's one of those cases where the competition's caught up but yeah you get the idea i mean there is a lot to like here however the mate 40 pro is super confusing it's got a pretty standard eight gigabytes of ram a fairly generous 256 gigs of storage but also this is the first phone in the world to be powered by the new kirin 9000 chip and that in itself is the first chip that is both five nanometer and has a 5g modem baked inside of it for better efficiency so that's great right i ran a couple of benchmarks the gaming performance is coming out at like 60 percent better than last year that's huge an ai performance something like three times greater even just when playing games this phone can play standoff too on maximum settings with eight times anti-aliasing and 16 times anisotropic filtering at an uninterrupted 60 fps for those of you who didn't get that it's fast but see huawei's chipset business is in trouble i mentioned earlier that because of the us ban from this point on unless something changes they're probably not going to be able to make any more flagship chips so it sounds like what huawei's done is stockpiled they produced as many of these kirin 9000s as they could before the restrictions came in current estimates say they've got about eight to ten million chips which might sound like a lot but when you think about the scale of a company like huawei it's not huawei sold 12 million mate 30 pros within a few months last year so what they're going to do here honestly i don't know that is the golden question maybe there's a bigger plan maybe they're waiting to tell people we should wait and see what huawei has to say before drawing conclusions but the way i see this happening is either they severely restrict the countries they're selling it in to focus on their core markets or they just have really limited stock now that doesn't sound too bad but it's not just the mate 40 pro that we've got to worry about what about the next phone because as far as we can see right now if huawei can't build flagship chips in the future they can't make flagship phones in the future if we're always pumping millions of dollars into trying to build their own app ecosystem and it is super impressive that the app gallery has something like 360 percent year-on-year growth they've got petal surge to find new applications that aren't on their store great they're even building their own huawei produced maps application that's incredible but it's just that if this is the last flagship that huawei can sell to the west how can this ecosystem actually sustain itself how does huawei actually get new users onto it like even if i buy a mate 40 pro now and enter the huawei ecosystem if there's not going to be a mate 60 pro in two years time when i want to upgrade from that then surely i'm just going to leave the ecosystem they'd have to start buying chips from other companies they've already applied for a license to work with qualcomm but that seems unlikely mediatek maybe but if huawei works with mediatek and starts using mediatek chips their phones are going to be well behind in performance probably the best example of how i feel about this phone is my experience with the speakers this phone has a cracking set of dual speakers audio comes out the bottom and the top at the same time and there's so much sound separation it wraps around you but then i remembered i can't enjoy them on youtube which would be kind of my default go-to because this phone doesn't have google apps so i went to the app gallery to try and find an app that could stream the video i wanted in full quality the first one just says not available yet the rest weren't what i was looking for so then i went to huawei's own video app and it just says content not available i was really hoping that this ecosystem would mature faster than it has done so yeah exceptional phone super exciting hardware really unfortunate situation if you enjoyed this video do consider subscribing that'll be fantastic my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one you
