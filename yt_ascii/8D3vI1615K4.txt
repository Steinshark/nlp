actually happened and i'm about to die that would i didn't die yes next up is fidget spinner versus finger and i thought this was clickbait like the rest but as you can see there's so many people just getting their finger chopped off and cutting their finger open i'm starting to think this might not be clickbait like how could this happen to so many different people just i don't know so i'm going to you know get one good nose pick in before i sentence my finger to death because for all i know i may never see this finger again all right boys i'm going to miss you finger up next we have whatever
