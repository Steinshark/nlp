ladies and gentlemen history has seen many different types of chess prodigies but here in 2024 we have a chess prodigy emerging who is so special and so unique and so fascinating that i simply cannot stop making videos about this man his name is tyler 1 it's just tyler there's no like number one on his passport or anything not that i've checked tyler one is a very very famous league of legends content creator streamer also just in general player bodybuilder and most recently a father he became a father and congratulations to him and his partner i don't know if they're engaged married but her name is michaela but more impressively than becoming a father recently tyler one crossed 1900 r it on ch.com now that might be meaningless to some of you why why what's so impressive about 1900 right well my friends tyler 1 less than one year ago in fact 10 months ago was rated 199 at the bottom left hand side of your screen right next to that little zero yeah his rating was 199 rather than making good chess moves he was eating the chess pieces he's now rated 1900 in fact he's rated 1960 as his peak he has played over 10 ,000 chess games he has done over 20,000 puzzles he has a higher puzzles rating on chess.com than hikaru pure dedication that doesn't mean that if hikaru didn't also do more puzzles he would have a higher rating i'm just saying tyler one's dedication to the game is terrifying and in this video i'm going to show you three games that he played recently how he crossed 1900 how he hit his peak at 1960 and the highest win he's ever gotten against a 2,139 rated chess player man less than a year ago did not know how to play the game he was made fun of because he just yelled a lot and lost all his pieces now he yells a lot and wins all of his opponent's pieces so i'm actually going to do this backwards i'm actually going to do this backwards and i'm going to do this backwards because he beat a 21100 when he was 1787 and it's actually insane the way that he does this right like the way he has spammed the elo ladder by playing the exact same opening every single time he plays this opening known as the cow that's what he plays and i'm going to turn down well i think my sounds were a bit out of whack i was doing a chess lesson as part of my road to gm series i will be uploading that in a few days so tyler one plays this opening where the knights go behind the dn pawns it's very solid it's passive it gives the opponent a little bit of an advantage according to the computer but for most human beings going up the rating ladder it's very difficult to exploit and he likes it because it's systematic he seems like a very system based player like he will kind of follow the rules and the structure and that's what he does and and the good thing about this opening is that it doesn't give him any weaknesses so you can't really cheese him right which is a thing that beginners suffer with a lot so we have knight to g3 knight c6 and here his opponent played the move h5 which is the most principled way of challenging the cow because you moved you know the cow out to the edge of the highway and now it has to be forced back into its stable but tyler has learned over time that it's good to challenge this with the move h4 the dr back of this move is that you weaken the g4 square but okay black takes over the entire center right can you even blame him and we have bishop e2 targeting the pawn on h5 which black's defends with e4 and now tyler likes to play like this he likes to play e4 okay what he likes to do is he because he's moved these two pawns like this he wants to win a little bit of equity in the center of the board and it's a difficult decision for black a lot of people here they don't know what to do like a lot of people just take out of inertia some people push but that gives tyler this square and potential f4 stuff and his opponent keeps the tension now tyler plays bishop f3 tyler is like the master of making moves with a piece that go one square that do not make a lot of weaknesses and that just sort of you know he's like the tennis player that returns every shot but doesn't challenge you at all so ultimately it's death by a thousand cuts like you you you know you'll just do something dumb and and and and and overexerting and then you will lose okay so bishop h6 also you're going to spend more time like tyler plays very fast his time management is very very good good and you know knight b3 just very straightforward we're going to trade the bishops here takes now he takes with a queen right and now he's worse but he's worse here if and only if black defends this pawn by pushing to d4 and if you take then queen a5 check wins the knight so basically black is defending the pawn tactically instead of that black goes here and you know tyler plays queen g5 which is not the best move because black can get out of the way and kick out the queen probably a better move would have been let's just say short castles or pawn takes on d5 apparently but again the the without the engine tyler's games are very human and exploiting his mistakes is really only possible frankly it's not possible by anybody not magnus or hikaru would not be able to defeat him make no mistake but it's only exploitable by a chess master really like not a 2100 on chess.com but like if i played tyler i you know maybe i'll check him to a match once he gets to like 2000 the point is that like exploiting these ideas it takes a lot of controlling the game controlling the pace of the game like here you know black plays d4 which is a very good move and now this move a3 now you ask me i just look at that and i say that's a free pawn all right like bishop takes b3 i mean it to me this is just a very clear free pawn and then you can't castle this way because it's illegal you castle this way i'm not going to take this pawn but i will probably take a second pawn in the center right my king is a little bit weak but i i'll commit my king at some point when the queen leaves but in this position black plays a5 so black doesn't take the knight tyler castles the knight is still hanging by the way but now after a4 night2 now now this is definitely a a lot of free stuff but instead of taking that black castles again so again tyler's just kind of like he's worse but exploiting his mistakes is actually surprisingly challenging and his opponents don't really do a great job of that which means he's not really worse it's like that saying right if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it doesn't make a sound if tyler one makes a mistake but his opponents are not strong enough to exploit the micro nuances of the position is he even worse no he has bicep bonus knight c4 takes takes and now one move here you probably don't want to make anymore is this because you already castled your king there right why would we do that well finally his opponent does that he does that and and now tyler's position comes alive so he's going to play rook b1 at some point he could play it now but he waits a little bit he takes his biggest think of the game 49 seconds that might have been because he was moving his daughter around he did say that his daughter sleeps on his chest and then he plays a lot of chess on his phone while that happened so very adorable but but he could have played rook b1 okay thanks for you know queen g7 now rook f8 and by the way the best move in this position is just losing this pawn completely for black like the best move here according to the computer is queen c3 i mean no i wouldn't play queen c3 like queen c3 doesn't even make sense i don't the idea of queen c3 is to play knight f8 and try to trap the queen so i i mean it literally doesn't make sense so rook f8 and now white is better because white goes no no no no no because white is supposed to go for an attack like tyler should have went here rook b5 you know rook b6 rook b1 w like he should have gone for an attack he didn't he sacrifices the knight for some reason that's a really bad move i mean it's it's just not like it's not the position is not demanding a sacrifice and and the way you avoid stuff like this is like yeah you got to think do i have two more attacking pieces than the defending side i no no he doesn't they're over here but how does black exploit this by playing queen b6 queen c7 like that's the only way the and somehow tyler has this ridiculous ability to make his opponents make practically difficult choices and his opponent doesn't you know his opponent just takes the pawn because he doesn't sense the danger now bishop f7 and now there is a lot of danger the danger is coming from from from all three sides from that side from the left side and from the center and now black has to play knight to d8 protecting against the check protecting the pawn he doesn't and with two very natural moves as a followup bishop b6 and rook b1 the game is over because you cannot stop the attack on b7 you don't believe me knight d8 white to play bishop d5 this is an unstoppable attack on the black king it's over it's literally made the only thing that you can do with black is give up the queen because if you move the queen anywhere i don't take with the bishop although i will probably win if i do that but i have to be a little bit careful rook b7 is game over because it's mate and anywhere the king moves it's force made either in one or in two and tyler wins he beats a 2100 like what how is this even possible i mean his ability to control the game i mean i understand the engine is saying it's minus three but i guarantee if i put you in black's position and this and you didn't know it was minus three you might lose half the games which means it's not minus three but because the computer's like well obviously you just playen like the computer knows that you got to come back i'm not even sure like a 2300 rapid player would find queen b6 probably after thinking but with time pressure you know and instead you're going to be like there's no it's and all of a sudden you're just straight up mated like boom dude beat a 2100 dude beat a top point 1% chess player and he didn't know how to play chess a year ago it's insane it's completely nuts now this was 1787 all right a couple of big things happened in 1787 like the constitution of america was signed or whatever i think right that was when they got rid of the articles of confederation i don't know i i got a five on my ap us history test but i hated school you got to do well though cuz listen you don't do well in school you're going to become a you know a chess streamer or league of legends streamer or something the d3 d5 here's the game the game that tyler beat uh cross 1900 he beat an'80 i know it's a little bit less impressive but to be honest this you know this this 2100 did not i wouldn't say this 2100 played like a 2100 maybe they played like a' 1900 i'm doing a game review and game review says black played like a 6'50 which is sorry and tyler played like an'00 right so now we're going to take a look at this game knight2 knight f6 a3 and look i mean again the thing about this opening is like there's no weaknesses but what tyler does is he slowly builds up and then he starts playing in the center right he just slowly brings out his pieces brings out his pawns position locks up and the engine again says black is better like in the first 10 to 15 moves because tyler is playing the cow which is inherently an opening that is not groundbreaking are particularly strong you're going to be at a disadvantage that's how it works knight e5 knight f3 knight g4 and he just plays solidly he doesn't make too many mistakes and he spots tactics when they exist like knight takes d4 so the knight is there the bishop is there he's just very good at like oh if take take bishop g4 knight g4 queen g4 i just win a pawn completely right 100% right but at this level people are are going to play zishan zooks so for example he took on d4 his opponent is is like well i could take the knight but then i'm going to lose my knight so this knight can't take anything let me play knight f2 which is the best move that's called the desperado or or as vichan zuk they're different things but it's the same thing in between taking the knight you take the pawn because you attack the queen now white probably has to go here or try to desperado himself and that's what tyler does he counterattacks the queen so he spends a little time he spends 30 seconds now the best move was to take the knight on f2 but he goes here and he blunders his queen gets taken and now he's losing like he he's losing now we got to figure out why why is he losing i mean it doesn't make sense right well if you follow the capture chain black gets a queen we get a queen they get a free bishop we get a rook they get the knight so they have a they took a bishop and a knight for the rook which is just very good for the side that gets the two pieces however the knight that ends up over here is going to get trapped now if some of you are having trouble visualizing this that's okay you're not good enough i'm not trying to insult you this is a skill that you develop by playing 10,000 games it's a visualization skill and even tyler himself got it wrong unless his idea was that the knight is trapped it's trapped but it's not winnable it's kind of one of these weird moments where the bishop goes here and it's just protecting it indefinitely and you you actually just cannot win it so yeah there's not much you can do okay so tyler blunders that he should have taken the knight fine and you know dus clears and we have this position and but look at the time one of tyler's greatest strengths is the fact that he plays fast and even if he sometimes plays poorly like in this game where you know poorly in the previous game is not the same as poorly in this game poorly in this game is you know he made a simple mistake he should have just taken the night but because he's up five minutes dude good luck winning this position with 3 minutes on the clock you know what i mean like he makes things practically difficult for people time management very useful skill he plays rook b1 here's the problem if you take this after bishop takes and rook takes you are still worse and on top of that in this position the only way for black to really cause any problems is to give a check force the king to move let's say to f1 give up the knight for the pawn and then play knight g4 so it actually turns out that this whole time tyler's a genius because he gets the two pieces back and now it's equal now the position's equal and black is down 5 minutes so tyler saw all of that he basically saw that he would lose the bishop the knight would be trapped and yeah the best way for the opponent to take advantage was to win a pawn at least and then do this and he didn't do that and for a second game in a row he gets out of practical difficulties by playing relatively straightforward and sensible chess and black has 2 and a half minutes to win this game it's not win another thing i don't know who taught this man end games like i don't know if he got secret lessons from magnus carlson dude in this position let me tell you something right now this is actually fascinating if i gave this position to 100 people rated 2,000 rapid so that's not a lot of you statistically but a good amount of you are like 1,800 1900 2000 rapit on shell.com i'm willing to bet less than 25% of you less than one out of every four would play king to f2 you just wouldn't do it now you're going to sit there and argue with me you're going to be like what do you of course i would no you wouldn't you're lying to yourself you would play a move like b4 or rook d2 like you would try to you know break out of the king f2 and king e3 are the top moves of the engine like t there is there is a little bit of something that is an innate ability of a person to play the game of chess bringing the king to the center why is it okay right now number one it's the end game but there's no queens you are able to bring the king to the center because of a lack of firepower on the opponent's side if the opponent had a dark squared bishop you wouldn't do this if the opponent had a queen you wouldn't do this if the opponent had a knight that could attack the king you wouldn't do this but the king is safe tyler sees that he sees the inability of the pieces to target the king which is all chess is if you're good at spotting what your opponent wants to do you have a level of empathy right for the opponent's thoughts and plans and ideas you're going to put the king on e3 because it will also prepare this move g6 b4 and now he implements that game plan his opponent also goes for pawn play but one of these pawn plays is not like the other this is not good pawn play you're walking into a very well protected spot meanwhile white just got an open file right which he uses immediately and he wins upon pawn and now he's winning he's also winning cuz he's at five minutes i mean it was always going to be basically impossible for black to play this position tyler beat this'80 the way i would like if you dro me into this position where white is slightly worse white is slightly worse here because the bishop is probably worse than this bishop the pawn structure is bad and the knight is bad the knight does not have a lot of mobility so black is going to take over the d4 square like again if i'm playing here i play knight e5 and i probably play knight c6 knight d4 i play knight c6 knight d4 but b4 is on the way i mean like you're not going to stop this move right and but he does this exactly the way i would i mean you make a weakness you win the pawn and then here i mean as long as you don't blender a fork you're going to win the game i might play e5 bishop f3 right and what does tyler play okay he takes on f5 i mean there's nothing wrong with this but now i play bishop f3 he does it pinning the knight rook d6 and now maybe like king d2 just get out of the way just get out of the way of everything maybe bishop d5 che and he plays bishop d5 and then he brings the knight dude straight up has the ser he brings the knight because it's the worst piece all his pieces are good he doesn't try to to force his way here he's keeping the tension a lot of you would just chop the knight you know you would chop the knight you would you would but but no no no just bring the knight and now he rushes but okay black has 12 seconds i mean at this point you could have violent diarrhea and you would win the game so he does this he puts the knight he blunders because black has 4 seconds all right he he blunders a deflection but black doesn't have enough time to convert it and lose his on time right black would play rook d6 but if he didn't blunder this he would have you know put a pawn on g3 good to control the dark squares because black has a light squ bishop then he would play 19 d4 d5 he just wins i mean it's it's it's actually ridiculous like the the the ability of him to just control the game just control the game this how he broke 1900 yeah yeah now he's a rare breed you can't most of you would not be able to get away with this you would not be able to get away with playing a subpar op system based opening like you wouldn't have the patience he's different he really is something is wired differently in the brain i mean it it it he's able to do 30,000 reps of something right chess puzzles games most people can't do that admittedly you know if you're working like a certain type of job or if you go to school like may maybe you don't have enough time right profession and lifestyle and everything is a little bit different but just as a human being he's just built different like the ability to to study and all this now don't go anywhere because this is the game that he won to cross his highest rating of all time okay this is the game that he wanton to cross 1960 so we have e4 right we got the we got the vintage we got the cow now he plays the the expedited cow he doesn't put the knight on d7 he plays knight here and then he puts the other knight on d7 so white plays h3 useless move right like if you're going to do anything you should obviously the best way to attack the the cow is to target the flank because the knight is not supposed to stand there but okay he doesn't do that e5 now now tyler attacks the center and now from the opening the position is equal position's equal and in the cow you're going to play for a couple of different pawn breaks right you're you're probably going to play for f5 going to be a little difficult to achieve that but you'll probably trade off the knight so let's see what happens b6 you don't need to do that it weakens the light squares a little bit but fine now he puts the knight on c5 and he's going to win one of the bishops he's either going to win the bishop on b3 i mean d3 or the dark sc bishop we have check we have block black goes back white goes back i mean just just terrible just just a waste of time i mean this is just not good and now tyler takes the that was always his plan and guess what guess what remember how i told you he's going to have difficulty playing f5 because white has so much layering on that square yeah well knight c5 bishop b5 bishop d7 ne he takes now he plays f5 now black is just much better just straight up much better like no questions asked why white is jammed right black has a piece ready to attack white is black is just threatening to open up the position here black is the only one with a light squared bishop black is going to open up the file black is is going to put the queen on a6 or trade some pieces over here bring in the queen like let's see let's see queen c2 right now before he commits this pawn he should be a little patient but okay i don't blame f4 and now rook c8 and he just has a lot more space the computer prefers this position because it likes to keep the option open of taking it doesn't want to do it now it wants to keep the fine white doesn't have many moves queen b3 that move doesn't do anything now tyler continues to make progress on the side of the board he has more pieces and on the side of the board he has more space right he's done this a million times takes takes now the white king can't castle this way and if the white king castle is this way very quickly you bust open the position f3 that's it you're either guaranteed to win a knight or you are guaranteed to open up the king and once you open up the king it doesn't matter if the king takes back or not i mean queen f6 queen g6 white resigns queen f3 like white resigns so knight g1 oh man now that's actually a very creative move and the point is that white wants to play knight f3 if white gets to play knight f3 like let's say you don't know how to make progress right like you you you're like oh man i got to bring my queen okay knight f3 queen h6 let's say i take the bishop right you actually run out of pieces pretty quickly you black only has one move in this position that maintains the advantage only one move maintains the advantage and this man this mad man finds it queen g5 just queen g5 targets the pawn and that's it i mean it's it's game over because if knight f3 queen g2 was a fork on everything if you play rook h2 this is brutal and you lose the rook i mean it's it's nuts if king f1 which is probably white's best move i sacrifice anyway now i don't know if tyler would have played this move he might have you know seen knight f3 coming and he would have played like queen h5 and he still has the advantage but his opponent panics plays g4 and g4 on pant you lose this by the way it's like still okay which is kind of insane but tyler sacrifices this which is one of the best moves the best move was to take on f2 but he sacrifices like this right white plays knight f3 and now he bulldozes he finds the idea to sacrifice on f2 queen f3 was a bit better but he takes here and he gives a check and in this position king e2 is the best move check and then he's guaranteed to win the rook so the best way for white to defend himself here is not to go to d1 it's to go here here here lose the rook and come back to f2 so basically the king has to move in a triangle the king has to go there there there again for the third time in this in today's video i'm showing you what he is making his opponent find the only line that keeps this position and it's just not possible instead of that the opponent goes like this and tyler has a lot of experience with lifting look he's got plenty of experience with rook lifting too this is basically picking up your fist to threaten your brother or sister i mean whoever you're fighting with and tyler's got a brother so picks up his fist he's like i'm going to punch you unless you drop the toy the toy is dropped rook g6 is an unstoppable checkmate i mean the king is completely covered he will be covered on the hr g file the queen is out of the game it's just like he's just destroying people he just completely destroys people i mean it is it is unbelievable like in the last 90 days or like let's even say 30 days his win rate is not even like it's it's it's it's it's it's 49% win rate 40 49 and 47 with white it's 50 46 with black is 4749 he just grinds non-stop like he just grinds non-stop he he wins and loses wins and loses wins and loses like if you go to his profile he's won 3,000 games and he lost 2850 he has won 170 more games than he's lost and that's literally all you need to get better that is literally all you need you need to win a little bit more than you lose and that is the way you improve at chess but most human beings don't like losing 48% of the time if we did anything in life that failed 45 to 49% of the time we would hate it chess is no different but he doesn't care he just grinds and grinds and grinds it's incredible absolutely incredible stuff so i will continue to give you updates and yeah i mean listen a lot of there's a handful of you that have gotten this far in chess as well 2100 2200 i see you guys on like social media on twitter you guys are like well why is that impressive i got to 2200 you're unique if you are looking at tyler 1 and saying why is that impressive i got to 2200 in a year you are unique congratulations i mean you either cheated and you're a scumbag or you are unique you are actually very smart you you clearly have a ability to absorb like a sponge you could probably go use this skill in in many walks of life but you are unique 99.999999999% of people are not like you they play chess for a little bit they dabble they go in and out they don't really you know and so you are special so is tyler one and that is the purpose of today's video and yeah i mean listen i hope i hope i can travel down to where he lives one day and play him in an over theboard match i think it would be cool so this is an open invitation if tyler watches this video on his stream if any of you are tyler one subscribers and he's streaming at some point send him this and i'll fly down to i'll babysit if he needs i i'll clean the pool and we can do a a chess and weightlifting collab hey i deadlifted 255 for one and i weigh 160 lbs so i'm learning from him he's not really learning from me but you know it is what it is get out of here
