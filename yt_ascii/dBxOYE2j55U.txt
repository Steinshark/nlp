- this egg is the most
liked instagram picture. it is also on track to become the most retweeted tweet. it's time the egg gang begins
its conquest of youtube. our goal is to make this the second most liked
non-music video on youtube. pewdiepie currently has the most liked non-music video on youtube, and we don't want to steal
a title from our king, that would be treason. so, our goal is to be
the second most liked non-music video on youtube, which means we need 4.6 million likes. so, smash that like button. and now that we have that out of the way, it's time for the egg olympics. we have seven contestants and seven games. if you lose a game, you are
kicked out of the egg olympics, and you get pelted by eggs. last one in the egg
olympics wins 10 grand. our first competition of the egg olympics is a staring contest. whoever stares at this egg, for the least amount of time loses, the other six people then
proceed to the next game. and go. the first competition of the egg olympics. who can stare at an egg the longest? oh, oh, wait. - oh! - and go. - you're at a minute, 50. - everyone agrees that you- - chandler, guy. - 1:58. go. - no, you can't wear your hat like that. - no, take it off. - man. - don't blink, don't blink. - dude, your eyes are so wide. - oh, man, what am i at? - oh.
