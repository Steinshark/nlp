hello and welcome back to yet another python tutorial you know as programmers learning something like this that's pretty hard obviously takes a lot of time so we don't always have time to put into the other also very important areas of life like dating for example where is dating mostly nowadays it's in places like tinder but what if i told you that we could use python to literally find dates for you automatically that is exactly what we're doing in this video we are going to be using a python library called selenium to essentially create a bot to swipe and find matches for you automatically we're also going to be able to message all of your matches so you don't need to spend time like figuring out what to say and like well like swiping on tinder even if you don't care about using tinder this project is really going to be amazing for you because you are going to learn how to do web scraping on python which is a really awesome and interesting thing to have and as i always say the best way to learn things is to build something interesting and we are going to see if i can actually get a date automatically using python so if you're excited for that before we start go down there and hit the like button down below in the description it's completely free to do and it is all i ask from you in return for me creating these videos for you to watch for free so here is a picture of a cute puppy i say thank you and a sign of appreciation for you hitting that like button okay open up your favorite code file and it is time to find some love using python we only have to install two things we have to install the selenium python library which allows you to access essentially a web browser simply through your python code automatically and then we need to install this thing called a chrome driver which allows us to do these things in chrome if you want to follow exactly what we do here download the chrome driver and we'll be using chrome you're going to select the latest stable release and then whatever operating system you have basically download that then unzip it i'm not going to do it because i've already done it you're gonna go into the root directory of your computer if you're on a mac you're basically gonna go here and you're gonna go command shift period to show the hidden files in your main folder and then you're gonna find this folder called user and then local and bin and you're basically going to move this chrome driver file which you downloaded before in to this specific folder right here and the only other thing you need to do is to open your code file and go pip install selenium now we can start coding by going from the linum importer driver and then we'll also import sleep from time and in a second you'll see exactly what we're going to create a class called tinderbot and we're going to create an init function this init function is what's going to automatically run whenever you initialize an instance of the sustainable cloud we're going to initialize a driver with a self.driver equals driver which we just imported dot chrome essentially this is going to initialize a chrome driver which we can now control using our python code and then we're going to start off with a function called open tinder this is a test we're first going to open up the tinder website by going self.driver.get and now when we run this tinderbot.i we should open up a chrome window pretty cool and now we can start doing things with it so let me just show you exactly the workflow that we want to do first we want to be able to click this login button then we want to go to login with facebook and then we want to automatically first click off this window right here by clicking this button right here then enter our email and our password to log into tinder that's the first step if you go right here on this window and you right click on whichever element you want your code to click and call inspect it's gonna show you the code for the html element that we wanted to find the way we do that is we go copy full xpath first we're gonna sleep for two seconds simply because it takes time for the browser to load simply because of internet speeds it goes self.driver find element and there's multiple ways in which you can find this element i found the easiest way to do this is just by export and then copy the xpath which we just got from the page and then now we have this login button which we found this login button saved as this variable right here in python and the way we click it here we go login dot click so let's see if this actually works or if i've made any errors wouldn't be surprised if i have and now we go here and look at that it automatically i didn't do anything it's automatically gone out there and clicked the button for us and now the basically all we're gonna be doing is finding the things that we wanna do and then adding them to a code file sequentially like this like again we're gonna go inspect on this login with facebook button before we do this you need to go to your facebook settings and disable third i think it's no multi-factor authentication you would do that you would go to this button again copy full xpath go back to your code file actually we are going to define a separate function for this which is facebook login basically we're just doing the same thing we're saving the login with facebook button as a variable we're using the xpath which we copied and then we're clicking it to see what happens but the thing that most people struggle the most when learning to code is focusing on your work and being motivated to start working each day and one of the methods that i found most effective in solving these problems is having a productivity system and a schedule so that every day you have everything organized and you know exactly what you need to do after this you of course need the right system and one excellent option is today sponsor sun summer so summer allows you to organize everything you need to do today in one place from tasks meetings emails and more you're going to assign tasks to a given day but you can also set the time that you think it will take you to do them and then assign them to specific times of the day then for example if i determine that i won't be able to finish some of my tasks today i can just move them around easily like this using your dashboard and then to keep track of your time once you're done you can set the amount of time that the task actually took to complete so that in the future for similar tasks you can plan accordingly because as we all know things tend to take longer than we anticipated i think it's a really cool app and you should check it out and you can do so by clicking the link down below in the first line of the description thanks awesome summer for sponsoring this video and now back to the video before doing this we are again sleeping for i think one second should be fine and then we are running this facebook login and we'll see if that works i think it's opening up it's clicked on that and it's clicked on the facebook button and we open up this window right here this is now introduced a problem because it opens up this second window but it doesn't work because actually what our code is still doing it's focused on this main tinder window right here so what we want to do is focus on the new facebook pop-up that has popped up basically i'm just going to paste the code here and explain to you what it does so again we're sleeping for two seconds here just to let it load before we do anything then we need to access the new window that we just opened and luckily in our driver we have this object called window handles the base window right here which is the tinder window that's the first one so that'll be the first one in the list as the second element of this list we will have the facebook pop-up window and then we're gonna use self.driver.switch2.window and then put the window that we want to switch to as an argument this now switches our driver to the new facebook pop-up window so that we can access it and as you can see we get this annoying allow the cookies from facebook blah blah blah pop up on top of this pop-up but this is actually part of the same pop-up window i hope that makes sense so we can actually just again go here inspect by the button element copy copy pull xpath go back to a code put the xbox here and then click it which will essentially then click this button right here to only allows essential cookies and then we can actually start entering our details and for this and we want to do here is create a separate file called logindetails.pi inside of here you want to create two variables so essentially you want to copy down your facebook email and your facebook password into this separate file right here and then in your main function this will import the email and password to you so that you don't have to show it in your actual code then in your facebook login function you would enter these lines right here we're gonna find the email field and the passwords inspect blah blah blah you already know how to do this okay same the login button which is this one which you want to click off to enter your details and the way you enter details into these text fields using python is by going email field dot send underscore keys and the same one for the password field and then after that we finally switch to the main window to get back to the main tinder window from a pop-up so let's run a code right here it's going to open up the pop-up it's going to close essentially switch back to the tinder window voila we have now logged into tinder using a python code how cool is that you find it that cool hit the like button down below and let's keep going now this next thing that happens at least for me is that there's these two annoying pop-ups up here this this one which we want to click out of and then this one we want the right into our code a way to get rid of this pop-up so we can just minimize that and once you run that you already know how to do this i'm not gonna bore you with all the details and essentially sometimes i found that these pop-ups weren't actually showing up but then when it was finding it it was sort of failing so that's why i put this inside of these try accept block so this is for the first pop-up we try to find this allow location button if we find it we click it we click out of the notification if we don't find it essentially if the pop-up doesn't pop up for some reason the program is not going to crash because we have this accept block where we just essentially print no location pop-up and we do the same thing for the notifications pop-up the next thing we want to do is figure out how to actually like these profiles right here so essentially again we want to find this like right swipe button right here inspect find next part blah blah blah you already know how to do this essentially tell the program to just keep swiping right okay editing me here i actually ended up running into a lot of issues trying to do the liking by actually selecting the like button i thought i just cut straight into the part when later on in the video i was going to fix this by doing in a different way so in the next section if you see some code which we haven't done yet just don't worry about it another way to like a person on tinder is just to click the right arrow key as you can see right here down here if you just select that and you keep pressing the right arrow key it's just gonna keep liking right and it turned out that when you do this you don't even need to click out of this pop-up when these pop-ups come up the like machine behind it would just keep on going so this is the crucial change i made in the right swipe function i would just select the whole document between the whole body documents export and then and then keys dot arrow right to access that you need to add this one more import line you can actually send just key presses in your window the way we ended up doing the auto swipe function is that we create an infinite loop essentially every time we first sleep for i think four seconds is excessive two seconds is probably fine and then we try to right swipe which we do in the way that we just described then if that doesn't work that means that there must be a match and then we've created this close match function where we've found the x part of the button that you need to click to close out of a match to allow to keep swiping and then essentially it's just going to keep running and it's going to keep swiping and swiping and swiping at the end of the video i actually show you this in action it's pretty cool and next challenge is to figure out because you know when you're as attractive as me you get all these matches right here and i don't have time to message all of them individually and no one's got time for that basically what we're gonna do is simply message all of them and then out of those the ones who actually end up replying we can actually invest some time into so to do that is actually not as simple because we essentially somehow need to be able to loop over all of these matches right here the way we would do that is we first need to find this parent element where all of these matches are located and then we need to find each of these match boxes right here and add them into a list that we can then loop over basically the element where all of these are stored i believe it's this one right here and then inside of that these actual boxes of matches are of these nested divs and then inside of these we have these a element with links to all of your matches there's some things that we have in common here for example all of these have the class of match list item it turns out that in python and selenium you don't have to use xpath which is unique to every single element what we can also do is find elements by putting an s there using class name basically using this we can find all the tags with the class of match list item which will be all of your matches but there's a caveat here because this will also give you this box right here which is the like sent and this one which is all your likes you'll find that this one also has an href of my life so we can basically differentiate out of this so the way i've done this is essentially go all the matches i'm just printing it to test it then when when we want to go and message these matches what we want to do is get this href tag over here and open this one because this is actually the window where you'll be able to message someone for profile in match profiles if the href of the tag is this my likes one we ignore it because that's not one of the matches but if it is not these message links list we will then append the profile dot get underscore attribute of the href which is the link that we will then want to access and then we will create this in yet another function called send messages to matches and then for all of these links we're going to create this self.send message function so we'll define this function def send message first we will need to get a new window with the same way as we opened tinder up here in the beginning so we'll just copy that so self.driver.get and instead of this maintenance link so for all of these links in this links list we're running this function right here first we're opening the window what you will see is that there is this text box which we will first need to find again using inspect we found just like this and after that if you remember from the past how we actually input text into a text area dot send keys and then we need to send off a very intelligent high response rate message to send to all of our matches basically so hi all we have to do find this send button copy full xpath just like that and when you run this function when you run all of this it's going to automatically send this highly valuable amazing opening message to all of your matches now the moment of truth let's try this thing [music] [applause] [music] what am i doing oh my god you know i didn't actually try this part beforehand because i didn't want to like send all my messages but literally oh my god well it's it's working voila amazing we've now sent all of these messages just using python now all that's missing is my sex appeal so if you enjoyed this video a like down below would be highly appreciated if you enjoyed this video you would probably actually enjoy some of my other python tutorials you might want to check out this video for three very simple ideas for python automation projects that you can literally build in like 15 minutes or this one for a slightly more complex project as always follow me on instagram the handle is right there or follow my second channel because of my second channel i'm actually going to be focusing a lot more on the life side of being a software engineer and a youtuber at the same time and sort of life in london because i've just moved to london with that i'll see you next time [music] you
