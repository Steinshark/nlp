[music] hey what's up mkbhd here this is the new oneplus 10t and it's the most generic oneplus phone of all time so while i'm not reviewing this phone this is my first impressions i have had it for about a week and a half but i also was busy winning club ultimate frisbee world championship for the past eight days in the middle of ohio with the new york club team pony anyway typically the t phone for oneplus is just taking whatever their latest and greatest was and giving it a spec bump across the board to just make it a little bit faster in every way sort of like what the s used to be for the iphone but this isn't a direct sequel we have the oneplus 10 pro in january looks pretty similar but that was 8.99 when it launched now it's 7.99 so just keep this in the back your head as you're watching this this isn't a 10 t pro it's just the 10 t and so it launches at 6.49 so on one hand now we know okay this is a lower price we know to expect some things to be cut some shortcuts to be taken to get to this price here but on the other hand some of the shortcuts that they took are downright head scratchers to me so the oneplus 10 pro from january had the snapdragon 8 gen 1 chip and up to 12 gigs of ram so this 10 t has a new snapdragon 8 plus gen 1 and up to 16 gigs of ram great so there's a spec bump a reason to get this phone cool and they're nearly the same size but last year's phone had 120 hertz display curved pretty dramatically over the edges this 10t is flat it also has a thousand hertz touch sample rate and gets a little bit brighter it is also adaptive instead of ltpo and it's 1080 instead of 1440. this all makes complete sense i mean ltpo and especially 1440p are sort of reserved for the highest end of phones so at this price 1080p oled 120hz adaptive refresh rate it's good it's got the fingerprint reader under the display it's got the hole punch in the top middle no surprises here design wise though the 10 pro was a satin soft touch black that i really liked with a dark satin metal rails that was kind of sick actually the 10t here has a new black textured back called moonstone black it's got these little dashes or lines through it and then instead of dark rails it has sort of normal generic chrome ones for their new 360 antenna system and instead of a camera shelf it's more of a smoothed out camera slope up to the shelf which i actually kind of do like but i liked it first on an oppo phone that came out a while ago so now it feels even more like another oppo phone again adding to the list of reasons why it feels a bit more generic then you might also remember oneplus signed this big three year deal 100 plus million dollar deal with hasselblad for their cameras which would let them borrow maybe some color science or some image processing and the oneplus 10 pro was a part of that in january it had the hasselblad branding on the back and even a hasselblad themed camera app well less than two years later this oneplus 10t doesn't have any hasselblad stuff anywhere there's no hasselblad camera app there's no hasselblad branding on the back of the phone and as far as i can tell it doesn't appear to use any of that new color science or image processing either now is that because the cheaper phone isn't worthy of the new hasselblad sauce like it's not it's not expensive enough to get that or is it just because you stopped caring about it i don't really know i guess i feel like if you've already paid for it you should just put it in all your phones but it's not here and then you might have also noticed that this is the first one plus phone ever made that doesn't have the alert slider literally one of my favorite features of any oneplus phone that they've had for years the three-way volume slider that lets you quickly switch between sound on and vibration and silent it is now gone from the oneplus 10t and they gave their reason for it you know it takes up more space than you would think inside the phone the board has to come across and we saved that extra space and gave you a little more battery blah blah blah you can still do that stuff with software i actually believe you but like just think about identity for a second can you actually imagine the iphone dropping the mute switch because apple wants to save some space and prioritize something else inside the phone i literally can't picture an iphone not having a mute switch like sure you can always do it with software yes but that i would bet anyone a million dollars right now that the next five years of iphones will all have a mute switch because it's just such a part of the iphone's design so you know a new one plus phone coming out and not having an alert slider it might be kind of minor to some people who have never bought a oneplus phone before or never even followed or cared about the oneplus stuff but to people who have this is kind of sad that it's not here just more generic points for this phone the 10 pro had a standard camera an ultra wide and a telephoto plus an led flash with some text in the middle we talked about how that was kind of dumb text but it was there to no one's surprise that text is all gone and in true generic fashion they've moved to a sony imx 766 sensor for the primary which is the same one that was in the nothing phone and the zenfone 9 and the rog phone 6 and a bunch of others it also has a 12 megapixel ultrawide camera and a 2 megapixel macro camera more generic points now probably the biggest feature headlining this phone like the one that gets emphasized the most from oneplus when they tell me about this phone is the battery so it's a 4 800 milliamp hour dual cell battery which is slightly smaller than the 10 pros 5000 milliamp hours but it now charges with oppo's supervooc technology at a crazy fast a crazy fast 125 watts it actually comes with this brick in the box which says 160 watts on it but the phone peaks at 125 watts here in the us and that's good for 1 to 100 in literally 20 minutes it's insane like it really is truly incredibly convenient i did a whole video all about fast charging pretty recently but with this one i got it down to 20 doing some demos plugged it in for 30 seconds and it got up to 22 and then i let it go for another three minutes and it got to 32 just easy so i guess that does feel like oneplus even though it's opposed superview charging they've always emphasized fast charging here but they also didn't put wireless charging in this phone so you know you get the peace of mind of having fast charging but you lose the convenience of wireless charging even more generic points the funny thing is despite my disappointment i bet this is a perfectly fine phone for a lot of people decent screen high-end chip lots of ram pretty smooth performance from my first impressions decent cameras and an oxygen os that's more like color os than ever before that's actually what a lot of people are looking for at 650 bucks and hey it's even getting four years of software updates and i guess that's the point which is this phone is more generic than ever before which to me or someone who's familiar with the oneplus story and the history of the brand and all that is pretty disappointing but that also means by definition that this phone appeals to more people than ever before so this goes right in line with what i talked about in my what happened to oneplus video if you haven't already watched it i'll make it the first link below like button because you should definitely watch that video but yeah i remember i tweeted a couple days ago when we first got some of the specs of this phone that it seems like a new oneplus phone without an alert slider feels like them just completely giving up on their identity and it was funny so many of the replies were like actually it feels like a couple years ago when carl pay left that's when they gave up on their identity and other people were like actually no the oneplus 7 pro was the last good phone they ever made then it went downhill some people were like the oneplus 3 was the last time they ever made a good phone and then every phone since then was just trash but at the end of the day this is just my first impression and the moral of this story for me is don't be a fan of the company be a fan of the product the individual product and if you look at this on the market today this phone is fine i'm sure it's fine everything about this phone it's all right nothing too crazy about it and that's what they're intending to do with the sort of remnants of what oneplus is there's a lot of other good phones out there for the price and i highly encourage checking them out again this sort of sweet spot of 600 dollars which is like a lot to spend on a phone but also sort of right in the middle now considering you have thousand dollar flagships there's a lot of competition there i just reviewed the zenfone 9 incredible phone for the price i really like it and so a lot of comparables but hey when you're familiar with oneplus this phone is just feeling more generic than ever before either way that's been it thanks for watching catch you guys in the next one peace
