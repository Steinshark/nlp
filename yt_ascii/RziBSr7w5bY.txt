ladies and gentlemen this video is being recorded in february of 2024 and it seems like every other week at this point news comes out about ai that will potentially put millions of people out of a job and absolutely set on fire and burn to the ground many multi-billion and potentially trillion dollar industries but there is a haven where ai does not threaten our existence and that haven is chess in the chess world we have embraced our ai overlords for quite some time and in today's video i will be playing in ai and not just any ai i will be playing my ai clone on chess.com you can play it by the way also 100% free i'll put a link in the description in case you're interested i made a video about this a long time ago but that was version one and i've been told by chess.com staff they have improved my bot it has now copied my playing style more accurately and it even plays my openings so now i'm not just playing a robot with a face i'm really going to play my ai clone before we jump into the games today i'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video better help folks i know it's february already but your new year's resolutions still matter so why don't we work on ourselves and

thanks sponsored gotham my friends it is time for the rematch the entire world has been waiting for many many moons ago i played against the gotham chess bot on chess.com when it first came out and we fought to two draws back then i was wearing a galaxy space hoodie as you can see from the avatar i sadly do not have that hoodie anymore but i'm wearing a equally colorful one right now and since this bot was launched in 2020 2021 they have told me that they have made multiple improvements to it it plays like me now it plays my openings so we will see and we will see if they also improve my voice lines because the last time that i played against this bot it definitely did not talk like me first game i will play with the black pieces here we go gotham chess plays e4 and say says i have some time between streams let's get oh that's what i said like years ago i have some time between streams look i've got the bot dialogue there all right this is very trippy gotham chess versus gotham chess i don't want to play you know what i've been playing scandinavian recently right so i feel like i should play scandinavian i'm going to play scandinavian against my bot oh you have a threat no dummy it's move one no nobody has a i guess it kind of has a a threat or whatever and then he said let's get this started all right we're playing scandinav queen takes d5 let me lower the volume a little bit i've i've had to turn it back up chess is hard oh yeah they program my bot to just say chess is hard that's all it says and i don't even say that i got beef with whoever decided you know what whatever all right so this is actually what i play against the scandinavian that that is my general opening so let's play bishop g4 now of course i'm gonna play bishop e2 and knight c6 i'll probably castle or play knight c3 yeah and this is a very aggressive system so we're we're we're all castled up probably knight c3 h3 okay kind of want to go for this i i kind of want to go for that i i can't i can't lie maybe i will let's play h3 h5 we're getting real aggressive here now in this position queen f5 or queen d7 are both okay i'm thinking queen f5 and there's a line here take take yeah so the computer is smart and and doesn't doesn't lose immediately there's a variation there where you can take take and then there's a massive attack going toward the white position now after d3 i mean knight f6 looks good e6 looks quite strong as well e5 is always nice but i kind of feel like i should go e6 to make sure that my king is never getting checked so maybe i'll play e6 i'm going to try to attack my bot let's see will my bot perish under the pressure bishop b3 is a logical move i always want to sacrifice here i'm not doing it right now cuz i don't have sufficient backup you need two more attacking pieces than they have defenders which is why i'm not rushing with that move i really don't see anything wrong with bishop d6 just bringing the bishop out targeting the the king yeah my opponent plays knight e4 opponent bot the bot opponent it's a good move i think now i'm you know i'm i'm starting to like worry that i've left my piece there a little bit too long and i should probably get a move on but maybe not maybe it's maybe it's okay so how about knight f6 just to bring just another piece to the party and okay of course it's it's going to oh did i blunder why did my is my bot insane what is my bot doing take yes but wait my plan so my plan when i played knight f6 was take take take take knight is hanging and then i put my queen over here and if knight h2 i play queen e5 targeting the knight and then if the knight takes i have knight takes and if if bishop takes i have mate but if queen e5 and my opponent plays g3 i can go back to h5 threatening the knight and then i win so is my bot stupid or am i stupid other question is do i take with the rook or the pawn because i like having backup on the h file but i also like having the pressure so let's go here right now i'm down a piece oh there's knight g5 uhoh oh i got too arrogant oh my i thought my bot was stupid i mean it is it's me but you know wait a minute but maybe it's not over maybe it's not over hold on a second i guess oh maybe it is over oh i might have messed this up real bad all right hold on queen e5 is still made here queen d5 f3 queen e5 back bishop f4 queen shck help me what is happening i also just like this move but i'm not sure it actually creates much of a threat on anything but let's go here i'm defending f7 i'm bringing another piece into the attack oh if that move works i'm cooked oh man if that works i'm in trouble boys and girls i don't want to take on pant i definitely don't want to do that all right let's go knight d5 we're still trying here queen c1 i mean listen knowing me and knowing my bot i'm going to do something dumb pretty soon like we're we're not far away from the something dumb happening in this game all right so let's just let's just relax all right i think i'm i'm i'm okay all right the bot is those are smart moves that it's making it's making some good decisions it's trying to get rid of my pieces and i'm trying to checkmate it maybe f6 but then i'm going to lose this night i can't can't lose this knight i can't let the c file open but i also don't think i can play a passive move so maybe we play knight takes e3 and then play knight d4 and then we just kind of hope for the best in this position but yeah the bot has done a nice job here oh the king is running oh the bot is brave oh the bot is way more brave than i could have ever been oh i'm in trouble and now it's going to put its kn right there but again i'm playing myself well how would i beat myself fork check how would i defeat myself in a game of chess huh fork i guess there is this though or that but it's giving me it's giving me the rook is it going to argue i'm not a good endgame player oh it's not giving me the rook because after take take it's going to fork me again oh boy all right i still think it's going to mess up i mean i know myself and if this is me in ai form i'm going to do something dumb we are we are not far from it happening let me throw in this check just to confuse my bot a little bit you're just going to attack my king no dinner first i don't know why that's one of my voice lines i've never said that sentence in my life that that is some like gemini ai attempt at trying to you know he's too easy from here let's start a new game shut up gotham god no wonder people hate me rook b6 defending m i'm just down a full piece i mean i'm not even i'm not even putting up a fight anymore night here can i maybe i don't know check i mean i'm i'm going for something what what i just hung a night what why did i do that why did they make me so stupid i would never play night takes f7 i would find a different unique way to lose this game but knight takes f7 how stupid do they think i am that's ridiculous now white is still much better but i told you it was just a matter of time and now i'm black is actually kind of back in the game i'm defending myself i mean i'm i'm i'm only down a pawn now and i feel like there's more to come now how do i survive rook f8 maybe rook f8 i got to be careful i can't lose my knight in the center of the board oh all right let's stretch out g5 looks kind of creative to try to potentially lose lose that pawn to open up the g file i might go for that that doesn't that doesn't look completely stupid maybe i'll play king b8 just get the king off of any checking squares that's a good move all right that that also makes sense maybe now i sack the pawn i really want to sack the pawn i don't know for what like i don't know why i'm trying to beat my bot a clean pawn down maybe i bring my rook but again i got to be careful about this move a3 knight f5 take take the bot is going to try to trade queen's with me what do i do do i do i attack and come back do i play g5 do i play rook g8 what do i play there's a lot of possibilities here and none of them look that bad let's just make sure we can't get back rank mated how about that when you don't know what to do just make sure you're not getting back rank mated my opponent also doesn't really know what to do stupid gotham bot knight c2 targeting the rook rook is going to come up we're going to make another another draw against gotham bot that's so crazy am i actually going to draw this guy down a piece is that is that how bad my bot is i mean i'm bad i lost the piece this bot really is like me no way right oh oh it doesn't repeat holy sh wow okay wait a minute no we we might be back in business it's just the it's just a stamina competition with this guy all right knight of five wait a minute i'm i'm i might win i'm telling yall right now i'm not i'm not going to mess around anymore no more mr nice guy i mean i i haven't been being nice to the bot at all but all right we're just doing a little night rodeo here rook h7 maybe i'm losing i don't even know i i i got so complacent with with the position i just thought hopefully the bot blunders queen g6 oh i'm not even sure that's a blunder because bishop takes f5 take take queen f5 all right let's do this yeah and now queen oh is there rook g7 there might have been rook takes g7 there but my bot is garbage so he didn't see it so i can go take take and we just go into a rook end game oh boy oh boy another rook end game against gotham b but i really want to win i want to win but i guess i can't win i guess it's not possible maybe it is possible trust myself i'm going for it i'm i'm tired of drawing my own butt what the what is that that's a horrible move i'm just winning now i think what sh no way i got to be winning there's there's no chance check and i and i'm going to maybe i should have went there but i don't know rook d3 how is this not winning if i play rook takes is there like a back rank mate with rook queen f8 this is unbelievable rook d1 queeny i got to have a win i'm going for it i don't trust my own bot i'm going for it no no no no no no no no no no no there's no way wait it's just giving me a rook wait my own bot is giving me a rook what is this that's a rook i mean it's going to take my rook but then i'm going to play here and i'm going to win what ah i'm the best i've defeated i yes rook d4 now i got to just make sure this is queen e1 check and i can also play rook f4 but if i go here i'm just getting to the back rank oh my god i'm winning it's completely winning oh you trash butt yes yes i don't need my queen anymore he is like me he is like me oh my goodness he's exactly like me i'm going to take all your pawns you absolute clown i'm going to take the most important ones yay you think you get a promotion you think let me let me let me let me check you first clown yeah now let me go here actually i'll check you again no i'm not going to check you again i'm scared king takes it's over i have no idea how i'll getting back to this in shut up no you won't i got a queen and a pawn you're dead yeah absolutely dead you got nothing check push pawn boom you got no chance absolutely no chance now we win this game by bringing the king or just pushing we just take away all of the squares it's over now we play we we bring the king i'm just going to bring the king i'm going to bring the king right there watch this boom boom boom and i'm putting the king right there and anywhere the rook moves i i i got to win the rook now check i have to i have to have something here that wins the rook check king g2 queen d5 all right the bot's trying to not lose the rook but it will and if it doesn't lose the rook that's it there we go there we go we're going to beat the bot we're going to beat the bot ai isn't as good as humans and chess just kidding just my bot just my butt oh yes give me the checks i'm going to make a rook by the way yes sir yes sir boom oh yeah now we're just going to pre-move out the rest of the game oh yes all right check and check let's just make sure we don't stalemate anybody and now i don't even want to give this trash ass b a rematch but i will i will i will oh yeah i gotta i got to get a game with white i got to see if he actually plays caro khan and i love how he has nothing to say we buried gotham chess's ego is what we did that's what we we did oh yeah oh yeah all right all right all right all right all right all right all right all right new game i don't want to be too arrogant i was dead lost in that game that was horrendous why did my bot just lose a night anyway i have some time to play ch in between streams that's crazy can can my bot doesn't even say danger levels or sacrifice the rook actually i don't know if it says sacrifice the rook all right if it doesn't play carl conor i'm quitting good man good man oh yes oh yes okay now do you think we can beat my bot with the alien gambit i didn't want to play the alien gambit against my bot i kind of wanted to say like if if i have one chess game one and i'm playing e4 and aliens have a death beam pointed at planet earth in the words of max kellerman i want iguodala well in my words i love the caro this is such a pure and innocent voice line it's like a 5-year-old i love the cowan i want for cow by the way just so you know i learned the caron when i was like 19 i was a grown adult i was not like a child i played e4 you know i played a lot of openings my life but caran was not one of them anyway if i had one opening and my opponent my aliens played the caran i would play advance or fantasy but i am very curious if if my bot can withstand the alien gam again it's a bot so probably it will play perfectly but let's see also i play bishop f5 more than i play knight f6 so that might kind of be a buzz kill oh oh yeah oh that's it oh gg gg gg alien game against my bot incredible i'm going to cry uh-huh now we know bishop d3 castles is the idea now let's see how how long will my bot play perfectly what the what is that i've never seen that move in my life oh my god and and again i'm playing a robot so i have no idea did gotham already make a mistake can i take and then the only move is well there's king g8 and then maybe there's bishop c4 knight d5 queen de h that looks oh my goodness i mean that looks terrible for black but i don't want to you know what i mean i don't want to go all in like yet because i i don't want to oh my goodness this is so absurd take take take king g8 a bishop c4 knight d5 i really don't have a winning move in that position because if i bring my queen out anywhere there's knight f6 maybe queen f3 knight f6 queen d3 i'm trying to go there there might be rook h6 defending everything that's unbelievable if this actually works yeah but i guess it i guess it must work all right i'm going to c i'm not going to sacrifice everything yet i've never seen this move in my life but it's a bot you know okay now it can't move the eon so i'm always looking at h4 as well it's another possibility but let's just put the rook on the open file i mean this is just improving the position 101 oh god gotham bot just gave away a pawn gotham bot just played e6 which is a move that is not possible that's bad if that's actually possible i might be in trouble but it i guess the idea is knight c5 so okay what do we play here c4 or c3 let's play c3 solid maybe load up a cannon i can sack also have h4 h49 e5 take take looks pretty good to me let's play h4 let's try to open up that king oh you have a threat yes i do uhoh gotham bot is mad take take the h files opening now i'm going for it i mean we're this we're in this deep let's go for it oh lord this is terrifying knight takes g5 targeting the pawn on e6 my king's going to f1 all right now gotham bot is going to try to play queen h5 i got to be ready i don't want to trade the queens so what do i do what do i do i can play kn oh man bishop e2 the bot is going to go queen g six i can play g3 to try to block but then then i'm going to have to trade queens which i'm i'm not a fan of i don't want to trade the queens queen f3 queen h5 maybe f4 f4 bishop back to e2 i mean that just looks insane that looks deranged why would anybody play chess like that i could just come back oh guys i'm scared guys i'm scared i'm playing knight e4 i don't know i don't know i'm playing knight e4 i'm going to try to get my rook into the attack i'm going to play rook e4 and put my rook right there okay rook g4 check what's the idea oh the king's running queen f3 the king's running the king's running back to the home this is crazy so g3 now or king f1 like i'm mated queen h1 is m so i got a i do i have a tactic do i have like a bishop move g3 rook g8 am i cooked am i cooked will i have to trade the queens that would be so sad do is there just oh is there e5 oh no no is there queen f6 oh did i get mated no oh i got too arrogant but it's my bot he's terrible he just lost the game up a whole piece what if i just continue the oh i can't even take oh i can't even take all right i'm going to resign but but it's not over because i played a stupid opening on purpose alien gambit is not good when you're playing against the bot what about is g5 one of the best moves by the way it's not but it's one of the setups and yeah i just got okay so i'm going to play the carocon again against mr gotham bot and this time i'm going to play what i really wanted to play i'm going to play the fantasy i'm going to see if i can beat my own bot in the fantasy variation if i had one game against the carl conan i would probably play the fantasy all right here we go knight f3 playing the mainline fantasy that is that is one of the moves i'm going to play the setup with pawn to c3 and the bishop here what is that what did i blunder is this like a gambit what but don't i get like a huge what what is going on knight f6 what about e5 am i stupid the knight can't move anywhere if queen e7 i can take the boys and girls i can't tell what's happening in this what what i also feel like i can castle just get like a huge attack but now i just take back and i'm defending right queen b4 i have knight b2 knight d2 wait this is just crushing for white how do i only know one opening but my bot doesn't know the opening well i guess the idea is castles here take queen c5 check king h1 and then it takes my which kind of makes sense which which which kind of makes sense but wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute castles knight e5 also i don't have to castle i can play knight c3 or bishop f4 so what if i just play knight c3 where's the bot moving like i just have massive development holy crap it sacked to piece what what it's just down a piece what is my oh it got me you said watch yourself oh my god the pot is out for revenge oh this is really bad oh this is embarrassing i i did not even oh i did not even god playing playing and and streaming and and talking out loud is so so difficult i did not even see that i mean that is embarrassing that's embarrassing of course i should play like oh good lord okay oh my but i know it's my bot so it's probably going to do something stupid but now i can't castle now i'm behind in development now i can't castle that's bad all right that's bad it's time for a comeback all right right it's time for a comeback the bot is going to develop and then it's going to try to castle what do i want do i want to keep trying to attack do i want to keep trying to create threats what do i want let's go here i'm thinking b3 then it's going to probably going to go back to e6 yeah i'm in a little trouble i can't i can't lie i don't see i don't see the way forward losing that pawn was was not intelligent by me maybe i can sacrifice the pawn and put pressure on the file but seems aggressive maybe again black is going to consolidate very quickly so i need to do something wow i need to do something a little bit not so spicy and probably just slow play the position build up and attack a little bit at a time let's go here i'm gambiing this pawn i want it to be taken oh look at my bot smarter than me long castle still gambiing this pawn okay now i think i'm going to cook now i think i'm going to be in good shape don't exactly know why or how or what the plan is but i feel like with the opening of this position i should be pretty happy queen f5 looks really good if knight g6 i take queen f5 looks really good wait a minute that's just crushing no yeah now i go right here black can't castle or do i play king b1 no i can't play king b1 because then black castles stupid maybe check first this looks pretty good for me i mean black can't castle now yeah oh yeah this looks pretty good i like what we got going on here king b1 rook d6 i can i can take and black hand castle period cu the king moved at which point maybe then i'll play king b1 but then the king might walk over maybe now i'll play king b1 check yeah let's play king b1 now oo this looks bad now's my moment now's my moment how am i going to get a winning position right now now is my moment i have to seize the moment if i take take a3 queen can't go to d6 because of rook d1 queen can't go to c5 because of b4 oh that looks really good i think this is my moment i don't want to get tunnel vision but i think i'm about to cook my bot and i'm about to put to i think this is the move i think this is the move if queen g4 i take the knight wait what it's l what what it's losing i just take the queen i'm i'm going to win a piece i don't even have to take the queen i can back up and take the knight and keep my queen on the board oh lord oh my gosh i'm completely winning i'm completely winning oh i'm so scared queen e2 this is crazy queen e2 king c7 rook d3 it's over i just win i'm winning it's over oh my god i'm completely winning the fantasy is op oh this is nuts i just go b4 now i just go b4 it's going to go queen f5 tricky tricky tricky scumbag bot maybe king a2 first set up the threat maybe give a check maybe give a check that's what i'm going to do i'm going to give a check so now the ball can't go queen f5 and i'm going b4 in the next move i'm going b4 it's going to give me a check i'm play rook d1 it can't stop me i'm completely winning i'm completely winning it's over b4 it can't it can't it's going to lose his bishop it's over it's completely panicking i completely didn't see that move but that's fine that's fine i'm still winning i'm still winning i can send this to an end game if i want should i or should i keep my queen on the board queen f7 or queen d no queen d7 is bad still winning but queen d7 rook d8 i can play take take take king c7 knight d5 discovered check and then i can try to win that end game oh my goodness oh my goodness i'm spoiled for choice or do i just try to win the end game with the i'm i'm going to do this and i'm going to put my rook right here he said i don't need my queen anymore that's what that's what that's what i just said and now i can just play knight to e4 and i don't know how it's going to protect that pawn it's not going to protect that pawn music to my ears now i'm just going to be a full piece up i can also play knight d6 let me just take this i am just up a full knight all right it got that whatever i don't care oh boy now i am a pretty decent defender but let's try to convert this position as seamlessly as possible knight d6 will send us to an endgame cleanly up a bishop there we go we are just up a bishop this should be a walk in the park h4 or we start bringing our king let's bring up our king it's very important to bring the king up in the end game check i come back and block i do this i don't have to play this dance but bishop d4 targeting the pawn don't want to let all the pawns start coming up the board so i should be a little bit careful but yeah now we can just play h4 we're now two squares closer to promotion two squares did i say two two qu what even is a qu squares and now we're going to just try to win this end game and by try i mean absolutely succeed because it is hopeless for black rookie three trading the rooks going to go here can i trap the rook by the way kind of want to trap the rook rookie five and it's over uhoh i should protect this yeah i don't know why i'm trying to make this more exciting but i guess that's just my playing style all right now it's easy now we can give a check i still need to be precise though because those pawns are coming so let's play rook all the way down push this pawn to h6 push the pawn defended by the bishop let's take so the pawn is on h6 it's got good support and now we will just target these pawns like this rook a8 i think it's over rook a7 a4 h7 a3 uhoh can i run my king out of this little territory maybe that's the plan maybe that's the move that would be insane if i screwed this up that would be completely crazy that'd be nuts what what am i doing rook here a4 maybe i can give a check let's just run the king i just need it i just need this that's all i need i just need the escort of the targeting my bishop do i depart the diagonal i guess i do i mean i don't i just need to promote i just need to promote that's all i need just let me queen bro check go to the a file good good good good good good it's good progress good progress let's come back and rook b7 easy come back and rook b7 rook b7 and that's it we're going to win that's it that's it he can't stop me now here bishop d4 i'm too fast i should not have done that why did i do that now i have to reposition my bishop again just i'm so dumb what am i doing all right there we go we're winning ah now it's going to check me a lot but it's not good enough and i'm going to win oh stressful i'm going to make another rook no i'm not i'm going to make a queen yes yes you suck you suck and if i don't play a meme opening i'm going to win every single time bro you can't stop me ai has been defeated today king c3 it's over yeah this is my ai beating song i defeated my ai takes put the bishop on the other side and let's pre moove a checkmate i don't know how it's going to move so let's go build a box you don't even need the bishop there it is box technique there it is boom boom build the box boom now here i can waste the move and all the way back and i have sl l the gotham bot
