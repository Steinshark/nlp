hello everyone and welcome in this video i have teamed up with progressive and we're going to be learning about the science of snow driving now to understand snow driving we need to understand a tires grip and to understand grip we need to understand g-forces so a g-force is a measurement of acceleration there's 1g pulling me down right now the earth's gravity when you go on a rollercoaster you may experience 2 to 3 g's pushing you from side to side as you go around that rollercoaster well you can think of this similarly with your tire so there's an ultimate amount of grip that it has and so that can be displayed as a traction circle so the ultimate amount of grip that that tire has displayed as a circle so in any one direction it may have about 1 g of grip so you can withstand 1g of acceleration without the core sliding out now that's in a dry scenario if it starts raining and the roads are wet then that traction circle decreases and the ultimate amount of grip you have is now about 0.7 g's now if you go down even further to say let's say you're driving in the snow now you may only have about point 3 g's of grip and then if you're driving on the ice that traction circle shrinks even further and now you only have about 0.15 g's of grip so you don't have much traction at all in any one direction so whether you're cornering whether you're braking whether you're accelerating this traction circle tells you you know depending on the force that you're trying to apply to the ground with your tires are you going to be able to you know maintain grip or are you going to slide out if you exceed that traction circle the car starts to slide so now to put this in context let's talk about stopping distances so let's say you're driving at 30 miles per hour in the dry you know it's sunny it's nice outside and you're driving on dry pavement you slam on the brakes at 30 miles per hour and you come to a stop based on our initial traction circle in just 30 feet well if it starts raining and it's wet now your stopping distance is increased to 43 feet if you're on snow stopping from 30 miles per hour now it's about a hundred feet and if you're on ice now we've doubled that to 200 feet so more than six times the distance to stop on ice rather than stopping on dry pavement based on our initial traction circle well what if we were now stopping from sixty miles per hour to zero well because the stopping distance is a function of speed squared this means our stopping distances have been multiplied by four so stopping from 60 to zero in the dry means it takes 120 feet stopping in the wet 172 feet stopping in the snow 400 feet and stopping on ice 800 feet now the same logic can be applied to cornering as well so let's say we're at an intersection and there are four lanes two lanes in each direction and you're turning from the inside lane making a left turn into the next inside lane so that's going to be a radius of about 30 feet so you're going to be taking a corner with about a 30 foot radius well if the road is dry you're gonna be able to make that corner at 21 miles per hour if it's wet that's going to reduce your maximum speed to about' miles per hour if there's snow on the ground now you're down to about 12 miles per hour and if there's ice on the ground now you're down to about 8 miles per hour that you can make that 30 foot radius corner at the intersection so now that we understand how grip works in snow and ice what does that tell us about how we should drive in winter conditions and the most important thing going back to that traction circle is you know if you know you're going to be driving in the snow it's a great idea to get some winter tires because that will increase the size of your traction circle when you're driving on snow and ice so that means you have better acceleration better grip better cornering ability better braking so all of that comes down on that traction circle the most important thing you can do to improve your driving in the winter is to get a nice set of tires for winter driving you also want to be smooth and slow with your driving input so easing on to the throttle easing into the brakes lightly turning in with your steering wheel you don't want to have quick sharp inputs because that's going to upset the cars balance so you're gonna start to slide you'll lose grip with your tires with what you're asking it to do so be easy on the inputs drive a little bit slower you know you're obviously gonna have to drive slower because that's what conditions allow for you can't drive as fast as you can on a dry pavement you're also gonna want to give yourself more space between you and the car ahead of you so often you know driving in the dry you may drive with three to four seconds ahead of you whereas in the snow and ice you might want to give yourself maybe eight more seconds behind the car in front of you that way if anything happens up ahead you've got plenty of time to react to it because your car can't slow down as quickly as it can in the dry and finally if you're traveling through deep snow it's a good idea to keep momentum keep your car moving so don't let it come to a complete stop of course if there's a stoplight something like that then you have to come to a stop but if you can avoid it keep your car moving because chances are if you're going to get your car stuck it's when you're gonna come to a stop and then you're gonna try to accelerate you're gonna be in too deep of snow to accelerate and it's not going to let you keep moving so the best idea when you're traveling in snow is to keep your car moving and you know get yourself a nice set of tires that way you're maximizing your traction circle and you know you have the best possibility of traveling in those conditions so hopefully this has been helpful in educational about winter driving a big thanks to progressive for partnering on the video thanks for watching
