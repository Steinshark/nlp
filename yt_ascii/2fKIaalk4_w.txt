last year we put together an absolutely wild miniature server so that we could travel to trade shows with a team of editors and still use the same high performance workflow on the road and then as soon store comes up with this thing that does everything that our diy machine did at a quarter of the price half the size and with zero jank how could it possibly do what they say for less than the price of the motherboard in our server who is building an all solid state nas and why did they design it for desktop rather than rack mount use why is it that i'm not going to answer any of these questions for you until i tell you about our sponsor the ridge the ridge has joined with travis matthew for a limited run of their classic wallets this sleek low profile wallet is perfect for any golfer on the go and now with the travis matthew touch you can elevate your game in style get your hands on this collaboration using the link down below right out of the gate i can tell you one of the reasons it's so cheap is that it has just a wimpy quad core celeron processor and four gigs of ram so our machine is definitely faster but it's also ludicrous overkill and almost screwed us over at the airport since when it's packaged with the network switches and the cables we need it was too heavy for a standard carry-on it's also a little on the big and cumbersome side by comparison the asus store flash store 12 pro is an equally all nvme nas but it's about the size of a playstation 2. look at that it's so tiny and that is what she said oh it also weighs almost nothing it feels like a toy it's got plenty of features though two external usb 3 ports if you wanted to back up your external drive to your nas 10 gig lan right on board spittiff and hdmi out i guess if you want to use it as a media center you should install windows on oh it's just a computer how wow so it's like fully hackable yeah you can install truenath on it you can put unwrite on it okay that's super cool we gotta open this thing up oh did i mention those usb type a ports are 10 gig oh well you're gonna break the thing no can i help you i want to figure it out do you need an adult no you need an adult you just told people to put unread on here but andre doesn't have proper ssd support it doesn't support trim i mean he doesn't ssd or doesn't have a proper sliding the [ __ ] plastic panel support apparently boom wow you did it look at that got him that's not even the one you're supposed to take off first well seems like a missed opportunity for some like quick disconnect kind of mechanism you know seems like a missed opportunity to tell you about our fantastic screwdriver available on lttstore.com yeah you didn't notice this at all you're not gonna i'm not gonna say anything about this cool a type a port wait what for the what the hell that's their fan connector okay i guess we shouldn't complain about things that are over built right yeah exactly we should encourage it oh sick the ram is upgradable yeah it only comes with four gigs by default which is pretty pinner so we have more ram try not to break it eh i'm not gonna break it feels like there's something still nah it's all good hey look another screw no way it's a big heat sink for a little chip and the only airflow comes from this fan that basically blows right over and through your whoa 12 m.2 ssd slots here okay that's pretty sick and then blows a little bit over your heat sink and then out the side here i mean it doesn't need much you're going to be using more power here than you will be over here oh yeah what does it use in terms of power oh 65 watt i think you mean 90 watt like what oh they said 65 on the product page wow i've been lied to a suit store wow way to go asu store they've actually got some foam up in the front here as well to make sure that no air is going to accidentally leak out over here yeah what if this is rgb are you sure where's the led is it on the board oh okay there they are i'm trying to figure out what the deal is here they've got these as media controllers but i've never seen an as media pcie splitter why three how many pcie lanes do you think this thing has i'm gonna say 16 8. yikes are they just trying to get out ahead of nand prices falling even further to the point where even general home users are building nasa's with flash rather than hard drives hard drives are fine if you need lots of capacity but as soon as you go i want to copy a thousand small files or i want to scrub my timeline in premiere you start to realize pretty fast that they're just hard drives and in the event that one of them fails it can take hours if you're lucky or even days to rebuild a failed array with mechanical drives with an ssd minutes maybe hours that's a lot less time to be stressed out worrying that your data is on the line because you didn't have an off-site backup and the truth is most people don't you're limited by the 10 gig port but just humor me this our crazy video editing server that's tens of thousands of dollars what do you think the peak usage is during the week we have like 15 video editors that are all editing 4k and sometimes 8k footage we have like 80 other people that use it as their just work storage thing watching footage ingesting footage 13 and a half 14. yeah and that's with like 100 people using that i mean i would have given anything for something like this to exist eight ten years ago when we were starting out does that celeron have any kind of like raid acceleration anything that i'm not aware of i think so okay it does have an igpu so if you're going to run like plex media server on this thing because you're a baller and you have an all ssd nas you can totally do that i think you'll get h.264 and x265 acceleration but not anything more than that so your mileage may vary i did find out what the optical is for if you're like an audio file a lot of people run roon which is like a music streaming server they do have an app for it you can use that to output to a dac and some fancy speakers okay what what it's durable let's go thanks crucial the same ramp 3200 cl22 it came with four gigs we're putting 16 in which is the max that this soc can handle you know actually i think that the 316 terabyte hard drives you need to get that same amount of storage would be almost the same amount of volume oh oh wow you have to push really hard yeah i mean they're plastic i mean they're very cost effective quick m.2 disconnects i would take that over screws any day of the week yeah actually yeah why aren't these on motherboards i mean we know asus store is just jesus yeah right like everybody yeah everybody knows that right just put this on your motherboards this is kind of awesome hopefully they don't end up like oneplus i mean we can install trueness who cares that's true the fact that this is so open you just get to do what you want with your computer imagine that well i shouldn't be impressed by it i know but i have to be these days that's that's it right that was a lot easier like with the first port of nas we're going to be using a ubiquity switch flex xg it's a four port 10 gig switch also has a one gig poe in we're not going to be using that and it should be the perfect amount of ports i think this time i feel like we have three editors and one to the nest then on the client side we're going to be using apple silicon macbooks with these cool external thunderbolt 10 gig cards from cal digit now you're probably wondering as an adobe and predominantly windows house why are we using macbooks there are certainly faster windows laptops the issue is that adobe premiere is actually it's just turning on more stable on mac os these days and anytime that you might gain from a faster machine you lose in crashes and glitchy behavior we didn't even notice the 32 gig ssd that's built in for the operating system ah that's super cool because it means you don't have to use up any of your storage for your os one potential downside is it means if that emmc storage fails which can definitely happen especially if it's running any kind of write intensive applications or if android ever gets their act together when it comes to ssds you would boot off usb anyway hey look it found it instantly oh that was i have read and agreed to the adm terms and conditions gives us three options by default is balance which is raid 5 so that would give you one drive parity data you can lose one drive okay which across 12 is not a lot but then again this is flash storage not hard drives they fail a little differently you should have a backup what are the other options but maximum capacity that's raid zero oh my god no and then superior especially if you don't even have the cpu to push any kind of decent throughput off it well you might as well go j-bot well it would be good because there'd be no parity you'd be literally yeah it would be a bit slower for random barely the last one is superior data protection which is raid six which is like raid 5 but you have two drives a parody and it has a more expensive parity calculation which given that this is a quad core cpu that oh my god but that's all it shows oh my god it has really on wow that booted really fast yeah not bad wow you know what now we're gonna call it penis too nah actually that's kind of better hdd partition you literally can't put hard drives in this what are you talking about i mean you okay m.2 to micro drive adapter this is shockingly painless i've never tried an asus store product before they have begged and pleaded for us to cover them but i was just like yup their nas box is all right i'm very interested to see what their software actually looks like once you're in there because that's the thing that people are paying for ease of setup simplicity and like it just works with all the stuff yeah i mean of all of the things in this list in regards to bettering your data security this is the least important one it takes all of half of a second to port scans you know how stuff like this happens though right some executive at asus read some article somewhere targeted ports hall yeah now jake's gonna figure all this out while i go buy a gpu on facebook marketplace and i'll see you in a bit because this is just using normal raid and not zfs or anything like that it has to sync the array before it's kind of at its full performance and it's already seven percent done and it's only been like half an hour but it says the eta is 10 hours whatever performance we get right now is not really going to be indicative of what it can do but i do want to try it so let's see if i copy a file here it seems to be averaging around 300 or 350 megabytes a second or around three gigabit it's not anywhere near the 10 gigabit that this port can do and the switch can do but the array is still syncing so any performance tests we do right now is not super meaningful although it is good it can still do 3gbit while doing that i heard there's a lot of apps on these things i haven't dove into it at all yet i agree sign my life away of course right at the top plex media server no surprises there let's install that wow they even have an app for portaner which is like a docker control panel i guess if you want to run docker containers on this thing which a lot of people do if they have this as their home lab that's going to be perfect for it let's let's install that select install docker first i don't know why i didn't just say we're going to install it for you oh prime video wait is that for the hdmi port if i install prime video is it just gonna like show up on here whoa you need a lot of things installation of firefox is recommended remote center oh if it needs something to run whatever you're doing it will install it oh look at that what are the odds that that happened right oh there's a pie hole one look at that okay so some of the apps are docker based some of them are just applications that's cool i have a cursor but that's it hmm cool it gives you a tutorial on how to use this there's plex this is running a bit slow it might have something to do with all of the apps i installed and the fact that it's still syncing it works we got a plex media server it's playing at full quality so if i go convert to let's say 1080p it's h.264 to h264 this should not be very difficult oh my god i hope it didn't take that long to do one frame oh god well that's a little disappointing all right the version that's on asus store's app store is very out of date weird that it's an android apk like this is an android app i guess maybe it's simpler to package it that way there we go well that's cool so you could throw in theory anything on here like we could put unify protect on here and you could look at security cameras you could do whatever you want oh hello what is going on this is what i had before that's not really a cursor though here i'll show you a cursor i want to try plex again now that it's not syncing the array to see if it'll actually transcode i did copy over a different file because the one that i used originally is like our very compressed fancy youtube one that is very high cpu usage for just a playback of a video let's try the other one again that one drives at 58. i don't think it can do the parity data fast enough to heat them up is what's going on here we just copied 75 gigs to it though i think it's leveled off there considering the noise level i do wish you had the option to do better with a little bit louder fan hey not bad that's about 300 megabytes a second we can try going the other way have you seen my true nas performance at home it's awful it's probably user error i mean you set it up so one gigabyte a second that makes sense that writing is not as fast writing is far more processor intensive and that's where that celeron is going to be hurting us this looks like your mac being turned what does preparing to copy mean why can't i stop this quit it's like the cancel button on a printer the printhead's not moving the page anyway or it'll print halfway and then stop and then just shoot out a half printed piece of paper thanks this is really useful yeah we could go to an ingest station and do it that way these are connected at 25 gig okay that is very 10 gig it looks like about all we can expect from raid 5 is 400 500 megabytes a second one thing to consider is this would likely perform better if we had say only six drives when you have 12 that's a lot of striping you need to do they ship 12 drive versions so it's on them to make sure that it performs as it should i mean there you go that's definitely cpu bottlenecked we're at like 80 90 on the cpu i bet you if i put trueness on it we could do gig both ways it's not gonna it's two gigahertz celeron i looked on passmark to compare the celeron to the port and as we built originally which is a 5700x it was less than one-fifth to be fair it also uses about one-fifth of the power i think the main value add for this product is in what the alternatives are compared to building a system yourself yeah you could do it but you're going to be spending as much on a motherboard as you are on this thing yeah so if it happens to be what you need it's kind of killer there's nothing else like it there is actually qnap makes one but it only has four drives well then that's not really that much like it is it and this is an even smaller segue to our sponsor super micro featuring their h13 generation servers powered by amd's epic 90004 series
