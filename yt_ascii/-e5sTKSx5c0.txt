- hey guys, this is josh, and welcome to the ultimate build-off. the name of the game is simple. it's team austin versus team ken to see who can build the
ultimate nintendo switch. both teams will be judged
on five unique categories: best feature, aesthetic, creativity, the use of our mystery
item, as well as spending the least amount of the $500
provided in company cash. me and my video editor in
crime, jimmy champagne, will begin judging at 3:00 on the dot. - that's four and a half hours. - four and a half hours, that's, hey, we started a little bit late, so, you know. (laughs) and yeah, that's about it. let's sit back and watch
the madness unfold. - that's our camera, how dare you. (laughs) that's our camera. - ah, okay, cool, thank you. - [josh] before our two teams set out to buy their supplies, wes taps in to his inner heritage and leaves behind a special present for his competitors. - i believe their planning
on building here, right? - [austin] yeah. - so, i think if we just
kind of lay out a couple, you want some by the way? i think it's still good. - [austin] sure. - okay. - [austin] i appreciate
the thoughtfulness here, of really making sure
that we're thoroughly sabotaging them, which will
literally take them, like, 10 seconds to clear but is
taking us five minutes to do. - the whole thing is that
they threatened it first, so you have to strike first. if they're gonna do it,
you have to strike first. - [josh] not to be outdone by the matzo, team ken also has also has a
few tricks up their sleeves. - [ken] why you gotta be a
wimp about it, though, like. they can, they can move that you know, like, actually put your car there. - they won't know. run! - [austin] so here's my plan. did you see the kev video where he basically turned it into, like, the switch pro, like a giant tv. he literally put a switch
on the back of the tv, put joy cons on the side. what if we literally just go buy a tv, paint it part red, part blue and we just stick the
joy cons on the sides. - so basically, i had a little think. the galaxy fold. so, what about if we made our switch, kind of in lieu of, you know, that design. 'cause it's pretty damn cool. - i really think that we
need to go to goodwill and find some jank lawn furniture. - okay. we set up the environment, right? - yeah. - we paint the picture. - so, we're thinking about spending, what, like $300? - on another switch? - on another sw- we could cost cut. let's go to game stop. let's get it used. - oh, you know if get the
paint at, like, lowe's, then we can also get
like a tarp and some sand to turn it into a beach. - a beach? - mmm i could take it maybe
a little step further. do we just want to use my switch? we can probably win on the budget portion of it. - oh, wait. - it's, oh, it's 11. i thought it was 10, i was like, oh wait, they're not open yet. (laughs) look how
expensive that is (laughs). let's go in the back. $219, $299, $149. 43-inch, this is it man. so, basically, we don't
care about quality at all. it's a 43-inch tv, we'll just glue, like, the joy cons to the side and, like, strap the switch to the back and kind of like color code it. - [wes] yeah. - [austin] done. a $150 tv. - [wes] oof. (clears throat) - [austin] so ,that was super fast. now what i'm really curious about is what the other team is doing. like, they're not doing the tv, right? - [wes] well, we didn't see them here, so i'm assuming no. - yeah. i wonder what they're doing. - [ken] that's not a
hinge, that's not a hinge. oh, no, that's not a hinge. oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. there's smaller ones. - [matt] but these are for cabinets. - [ken] look, look, look, look, look. - [matt] that's a match
made in heaven right there. - [together] yeah. - this feels, like, really
meaty, like, hardware wise. it'll add a little bit
of weight to the switch, but i think that might not be a bad thing. like, it's not gonna look as pretty, but i think this has an industrial look. - [matt] let's go with that then. - [josh] the editing squad is
not exactly editing right now. i got my own switch. check out the charizard. - [jimmy] they get to take
the day off and go have fun. why can't we? - so, one of our concerns for the hinges is that they're door hinges. they're mean' to- you know, doors are meant to
open and close really smooth, so to add a little resistance
is to use these rubber, these basically bread ties. so in theory, we should be
able to actually prop these up and have it stand on its own. i think that's all we
need from home depot. - [ken] sweet. - [matt] awesome - [ken] sweet. - [matt] this is going good. - [ken] yeah, not bad. (phone ringing) - [josh] what's going on, austin. - josh. - [josh] hey. - we have a question. - [josh] what's up? - what are the categories again? (laughs) - so, i love hobby lobby. they have, definitely, some bad press, but at heart i am a basic white girl. i love all the knick knacks, just gonna say. - [ken] you are a basic white girl. - i am. - [josh] team austin has arrived at lowe's and oh my god, dude,
what are they even doing? someone check this man's prescription, he looks completely lost. okay, okay, now it looks like they found what they're looking for, at least. - [austin] (sing-songy) hey. - [matt] i dropped the switch, oh you can't see it there, that orange thing, that. - wear your seat belt. - [matt] (chuckles) you told
me we were already there. - [josh] checking back in with team austin it appears they're on the
hunt for some beach sand, but it doesn't look like
they're having much luck. - yeah, we need tropical
and i'm thinking, like, bermuda pink. - [josh] bermuda pink? bro, do you know where you're at? this is lowe's not bath and body works. all right, it looks like they actually might have found something. - [wes] oh, dude. these are only $3.48. - [austin] three bucks? - so, if we have, what, three hundred something bucks to spare... - [austin] yeah. no, we should really go for the budget. i think we can get it. - we should probably get about 100 bags. its a joke. - [matt] (gasps) puffy glitter. aww, look at these are cool. i remember these. - [ken] aww man. - [matt] these ones are glittery. (gasps) this is like nibbler. - [ken] we can, like, leather back it. - [matt] dbrand's got nothing on us. - [ken] these are all vinyl, but i mean d-brand's vinyl. - [matt] that's... - [ken] oh, this is nice. - [matt] i guess it just... - [ken] whoa! - [matt] yeah. - [ken] that is plush! - [matt] yeah. - [ken] i love that. - [matt] that's really comfy. - [ken] that...you could
sleep on your switch. switch pillow. - [matt] look behind you. - [ken] oh my god. - [josh] all right. the boys
are just about done at lowe's. all that's left is austin getting id'd by the cashier to buy spray paint? - [cashier] you look like you're 12. - [josh] boy, that is gold. - [cashier] $22.36. - [matt] $22.36, perfect. - so something just came to mind, though. should we cater toward our judges, though. i know jimmy will like the leather, 'cause jimmy is a leather boy. - [matt] jimmy is a leather daddy. - well, let's not go that far. (chuckles) - what do you think josh would like? - do they have 2k on the switch? - [matt] i was thinking rocket league. - rocket league. - [matt] josh is a huge
fan of rocket league. - yeah. there's a game stop literally like - [matt] right there. - right there. no, right there. right there. - [matt] right there. - [ken] behind the pole. (car horn) let's just go to walk to- i didn't curse. i didn't use profanity. let's (car horn) go to game stop. - [wes] this is kind of beachy. it's only six bucks. - [austin] yeah. - [wes] if you want to do a second thing could definitely
do what we need it to. - [austin] six bucks each? yeah, we could do that. - [josh] all right, so our boys have found their baskets, but now they need a chair. goodwill's selection appears to be slim, but wes might be onto something. - [austin] 13 bucks? - [wes] can you really put
a price on a good chair? - [austin] yeah, $13. - oh, sorry. yeah, this is it. - [austin] okay. - so, we're gonna be doing mystery tech and one of the items... austin cover your ears. one of the mystery techs
that we're gonna do has this hot wheels rocket league set and nothing would be
more appropriate for that than two copies of rocket league. if i just so happen to
use the company card for mystery tech... - [matt] clearly, it won't
go against our budget. - [josh] hoo! these boys
going above and beyond to win the least amount
of money spent category. - [austin] we need a
five cd changer, right? - [wes] oh, what about the big mouth bass? - [austin] aw, yeah,
actually we need that. yeah, yeah, we need that. just grab it. i wouldn't mind an xbox controller. - [wes] yeah, right? - [austin] but, nine bucks? nah. - all right, that is... - [austin] well, a great start. - this you or me? - [austin] that's you, man. wait! red, red, red. that's it. - [wes] yeah, that's totally you. - [austin] this is me. it's a woman's shirt, but whatever. - [wes] all right, it'll be the theme. - [josh] my mans with the
moves like mick jagger. check out that foot work too. now checking back in
with the editing squad, we both out here putting
in that pokemon work, but just as i was about to catch myself a second gyarados, boss
man rings my line again. aight, cool. we will do. aight, peace. - so, we just got offered
chipotle by austin and kind of feels like
he's sweetening the pot on us a little bit, what do you think? - we'll see. if he paid for it, i mean, it might work. it might work for me. i don't know about you. - i mean food is the way to my heart. - [josh] food is the way to jimmy's heart. - i think it's the way
to most people's heart. - [josh] facts. - so, its 12:20, so we're
still looking pretty good. - [wes] don't look in there. - [austin] what's up? - [wes] that's the other team. - [austin] oh, we're not allowed in there any more? - [wes] i mean, they're
probably building, right? - [austin] i mean... - [wes] oh, i don't
think they're back yet. - [austin] oh, they're
not even back yet, oh. we're here, there's two
and a half hours left and they are no where to be seen and we have everything we need. you know what, i think it's
time for a chipotle break. - [josh] all right, i'ma keep it real. at this point, ya boy's
getting a bit worried about the status of team ken. we've heard absolutely nothing from them so let's just check in to make sure everything's going all right. - (over the phone) so, just be aware, the other team is already here. they got a little bit of a head start, but you still got just under three hours until this is all said and done, so... - [ken] oh, yeah, no, no worries. we got it. - okay. - [matt] we won the moment
you announced the competition so we're fine. - [ken] yeah. - [josh] okay, okay, okay. we got some confident boys over here. okay, well, we'll see
you when you get here. - [matt] all right. - yeah, man. - [josh] good luck. - yeah. see you there. - [josh] aight, peace. - i don't know, man. i don't know. i don't know how much
thought they put into it but matt thinks about
one thing, "this is," and other than that, he
doesn't think about a lot else. (funky upbeat music) - i'm pretending like i'm
in slow motion right now. i'm really curious to see
what a $150 tv looks like. i bet not very good. so, my thought is that if we glue this right about here, we can
drop the switch in.... oh no, we should do it this way so we can actually get
access to the ports. - [wes] yeah. - and then, for the joy cons,
what i think we should do is if we use these little
stupid, like, wrist straps, i think we can glue that
and or tape it, right, to the sides, so that way
we can remove the joy cons and so they don't have to
live on the tv all the time. - [wes] yeah, for sure. - all right, let's get
this thing glued up. - [josh] before heading
back to the studio, we make a stop at ken's house to pick up the second switch. as well as, fueling up with arguably, man kind's greatest creation. but before leaving, chef matt has a plan for the mystery item. - [matt] i happen to be
a world famous egg chef. you want them to be light and fluffy. i'm not into that fancy stuff. i like to use this
mexican blend of cheese. they got a little bit of spice in there. now, today when i came into work, i did not think i'd be
hosting a cooking show. - last look at the switch logo, before we never see it again. - [austin] good night, sweet prince. - [wes] here we go. (static) oh (honk), aw (honk). i mean dammit. darn it. - [austin] what happened? - i got glued. - [austin] oh, you got glued, oh no. (honk) (austin laughs) - [ken] all right, we're back
in the office, let's build. - [matt] build! - [ken] oh, those bastards! - [matt] oh! - [ken] what?! (sighs) okay. hold on, hold on, wait. i got it, i got it, i got it. - [wes] no! oh, that was a lot of it too. - [austin] you okay? - oh yeah. we can save it (door beeps) - [ken] go, go, go, go, go, go. - [matt] oh, why is it so wet. - [austin] oh my god. dude. dude. like, ken ran in here and
just chucked everything. it's like inside our tv right now and he just saw what the
hell we're doing right now. i mean that's obviously
disqualification points, right josh? - ah, i mean it was a quick look. it was a quick glance. - [austin] aw, i- this? this. this is what you call quick? (everyone laughs) look there's literally, there's like matzo in our switch box. look at this! look at this. they're still delicious i'm sure. - oh, it's very stale. - [austin] no, then. well that backfired. - where's our switches. - [ken] our switches are right here. - [matt] so, what's going to be like this? we got two switches. tops. they're gonna be like a teepee, but what we're gonna do is flip this over. got our hinge. - [ken] there we go. - [josh] damn, son! ken really just made it rain matsa all over this tv. - [wes] all right, so we take this out and then there's just a whole bunch of switch components in here that we don't really care about. - [austin] all right. well let's give it a nice
little healthy dose of glue and then... - [austin] man, ken's a dick. we just put it on the table, he didn't have to, like, dump it on us. - at least, we got them first. - [austin] we did get them first, but i think they got us better. - [wes] look at that. that's some professional
build quality, right there. - [austin] all right. should we go paint? - let's go paint. - [ken] okay, so i
pretty much made my mark around the switch for the hinge, so i know exactly how to glue it. a little liberal with it. - [matt] we are not getting that back off. - [ken] all right and put that down. second part of the gluing. all right and let's get
the positioning right. there. that looks pretty lined
up, for the most part. - [matt] now, we're gonna have a... - [ken] yeah we can't- no going back now. - [austin] i'm a painter now. with very fogged up glasses. - [josh] we have entered operation avoid as many
people as possible. well, that was a rough start. jeez, is that someone else down the hall? yeah, that's jd. and now kev? what are the chances? we're building this into a
nintendo switch right now. - [kev] yeah, i know. (laughs) i'm a little, by the way, i'm a little insulted no one consulted me. - [austin] i think,
cause i stole your idea. these are just joy cons and everything taped
to the side of this tv. - but i wasn't asked. - [josh] well this operation
is just a fail at this point. it's like austin intentionally took the most populated route. - [austin] perfect. - [wes] you think it's gonna crack? - what's gonna crack? - [wes] the panel. - i mean you see it laying down, isn't it. - [wes] yup. - okay, cool. let's do it. - [wes] all right, so just... there's still matzo on here. - [austin] i'll buy that. - [wes] yeah - [austin] yeah. - [wes] yeah, that's fine. - [austin] yeah. - is that it? you spray it? have you ever used spray paint before? - [austin] i actually have
never used spray paint before. - [wes] oh god. - [austin] all right. - [wes] all right. even coats, all in the wrist. - [austin] i just... okay. that's a lot of wind. - [wes] oh god. even coats, man. - [austin] okay. - [wes] what are you doing? - [matt] i'm trying not to cover up any of the speaker vents. this will cover up a little bit, we'll try and cut a slit out of it. other than that... - [ken] should we cut out here so it doesn't show? - [matt] yes, yeah. - [ken] yeah, so i guess that's where an x-acto would come in. - [matt] that is exactly why
we have an exact x-acto knife. - [ken] you know, i half expected them to sabotage my arts and crafts kit cause it's been sitting out in the open, but they haven't. and maybe that's just
cause they didn't notice. (overlap) - they're just not on top of their game. - [ken] yeah. - [austin] hey guys,
this is a bad decision. aw, that's very blue. - [wes] actually, that
looks much better though - that looks like a joy con to me. you squint a little bit,
that's a joy con right there. - [wes] if i put the camera
really out of focus... - [austin] yes, yes. - [wes] yeah, no, that... - [austin] joy con, right? - [wes] that looks like a great... - [austin] perfect, prefect paint job. it'll be dry within the next two hours. yeah, no, i'm good with that. should we have, like, plugged the tv in and see if it worked
before we did all this? ah, whatever. - [wes] yeah. - [matt] this comes down - [ken] yeah, and all we have to do is cut the little frills off of here. - [matt] yeah, oh no, oh no. - [ken] did you glue the scr- oh my god, matt. - [matt] i might have glued the screen... - [ken] matthew! matthew! wait, hold up. let's do this like we
normally would, right. so, i'm gonna hold it
like this just for safety, but let's- ready? - want me to hold it here? - dude! yo! that works so well. - that works pefectly. - yo, and that's like rigid. here, undo it, undo it. (laughs) yo, aw man! - [josh] do you have some matzo lying around your crib? then do yourself a favor and
cop yourself a dyson v10. it's putting in the nine to five, baby. - all right, so we've
cleared up all the matzo. so let's go over here and see kind of how
much space we can cover with our tarp. we should be able to cover a fair amount. oh yeah, this should
definitely cover enough. ah, green. there we go. - [austin] we should do
blue, though, for the water. - i thought you said i
couldn't add water to this. - [austin] yeah, but it's
blue, it looks like water. - can i put real water in it? - [austin] no. - we just cleaned up
one mess, man, come on. - all right, fine. one day, i'll be as shredded as you. - [austin] what kind of sand is this? - [wes] all purpose. - [austin] that's all... i just mean like beachy
sand not like ground sand. - it matches the aesthetic of the studio. (laughs) see look, it matches the wood. perfect, look at that. oh, this will essentially
look like a tropical island. i love it. - [josh] you know what, wes? this idea just might work. ya boy was definitely skeptical at first, but i can't argue with the results. this isn't looking half bad. - [wes] i've gotta...i need to... - [austin] you may wanna wash your hands. - [wes] i'm gonna wash
my hands off real quick. - [josh] and across the hall, ken is cutting out a piece of leather for their nintendo switch. - [ken] matt's gonna tag up the office with some paint. why do i keep saying paint, with glue. oh, dude, yeah. douse it. - [matt] adding a little
bit more on the sides. kind of only have one shot a this, so... oh, its... oh no, it's gross. i do need your help. - [ken] oh. - [matt] i do need your help. - [ken] okay, okay. hold on. - [matt] oh, it's gross and slimy. - [ken] okay, well it's
white, and gross, and slimy. - [matt] what i mean is,
it smells really bad. - [ken] okay. - [matt] so, i need you
to come around here. - [ken] can you grab- can you do the bottom
part, i'll do the top part. aw, it is gross and slimy, ew, ew. - [matt] all right, go ahead. - [ken] okay, so just lay it down oh my god, i'm twitching. - [matt] oh, oh no. - [austin] so, first of all
let's start with the chair. oh what... the chair's so sticky. ew. so we add this. - [wes] perfect. - [austin] we also have
our big mouth billy bass. does this actually work? aw, do we have three c batteries? - [wes] yes! - excellent. - you all made fun of
me when i bought them, saying that we will never use them. - okay, here we go. oh no. it doesn't work. - [wes] you know, actually, if we bury it in the sand it will look like just a washed up fish on the shore. - where the creativity points come in. - [josh] time is almost up. and it looks like team ken is a-okay. the switch has power,
matt's upstairs chilling. while on the other hand,
team austin is frantically trying to find the
screws to their tv stand. i'm not a betting man, but if i were, i'd say austin lost them. and it was at this
moment austin realizes... - [austin] we are actually
already past three. okay, okay. - [josh] but little do they know, the judge's priorities were else where. judging was supposed to
start three minutes ago, but it's happy hour. that tastes good. okay, okay. team austin has a little
bit more time to work with and it looks like they're using that time to make one more phone call. who are they calling? and more importantly, what do they need? (josh on the phone) yo, we're
gonna close out, thanks. i got this, jimmy. - are you at the bar? - [josh] we are at the
bar, we are closing out our tab and we'll be up shortly. - okay. i need your help. - [josh] you need my help? - yeah. - [josh] with what? - [wes] you know the wooden
pallet piece in the corner? - [josh] the tall one? - [wes] yeah, yeah, yeah. - [josh] do you need that? - [wes] oh yeah. - [josh] okay. i will get it for you. - [josh] all right, ya
boy has grabbed the pallet and it's now 3:30. time to let the final presentations begin. or at least i think so. - [austin and wes] whoa,
whoa, hey, whoa, whoa. - [josh] whoa, whoa, whoa, it's 3:30. it's 3:30. - [wes] we have a presentation. - [josh] you have to stop. the time. man, these boys did me dirty. the disrespect. i guess the show must go on, though. welcome to the final presentations of the ultimate build-off. - [wes] so, we do have a place to welcome you guys to. we'd like to welcome
you to victory island. - [ken] oh my god. - [josh] okay, oh, look at this. - [wes] your switch tropical destination. - [austin] this, my friends, is a destination which
you have never experienced before in lives. - [matt] that explains
the really weird shirt that austin's wearing. - [austin] it's okay, you gotta get into the island theme, in fact, we really need to get
into the island theme because, of course, we have real sand. - [josh] oh, this is real? oh, this is real. - [wes] yeah, your very
own island surrounded... - [jimmy] josh, we got the egg point. - [josh] we got the eggs! oh look at this. okay, look at- okay, so we got painted blue and red to match the joy cons. - [jimmy] i gotta give them
props on the shading too. - [austin] it's pretty good, right? - [jimmy] yeah, this is
as close as it can get. - [austin] take a seat. - [josh] oh, oh, a
little cold, little cold. - [austin] nice, though, right. - [josh] yeah, oh. - [austin] all right. - [wes] and then, josh and jimmy, while you guys enjoy
your tropical paradise have yourself a frozen margarita by maverick, our wonderful mixologist. - [ken] whoa. oh my god. - [wes] just for you, take a seat. enjoy it. - [josh there's salt on the
rim in case you didn't see it. - [austin] this looks like a tv, right? - [josh] it does look like a tv. - [austin] it's not a tv. this, this is a switch pro. - [josh] this is a switch pro. - [austin] so, in fact,
to correctly use it, get your lap ready. - [josh] oh, oh, okay. i got a microphone in my hand. all right, i'll put this down. - [jimmy] oh no, oh no. - [austin] i know that
there's a lot of rumors that the next switch is gonna be, like, eight inches or nine inches. - [josh] okay. - [austin] well, this
is a 43-inch switch pro. 1080p. the highest performance available. and, in fact, it support's tilt controls, so you can use this like the
biggest mario kart wheel. - [josh] all right, i gotta
pick this guy, obviously. i will say my arms getting a little tired. (laughs) but that's okay. i'm 200cc. - [ken] oh, my god. see, don't you like having
to physically move your head while using this switch? - [josh] we don't need vr. - [ken] it's like vr. - [austin] it's like vr except better. - [ken] i see, i see. - [ken] i, at least,
appreciate that you guys didn't throw the sand
onto the straight floor. - [austin] yo, we had to
clean up all the matsa just to put this down. (laughs) - [josh] okay, here we go. - [austin] yeah, there ya go, there ya go. - [josh] all right, so
i can use the controls, but i don't feel like they're
falling off or anything. (mumbles) if i win, do you guys get bonus points? i don't know. - [ken] no, they don't. - [josh] no, no? okay. jimmy, what do you think about all this? - [jimmy] i'm very impressed. i think the tv... it's good, but i think the creativity of the rest of the rest of
the stuff surrounding it brings it to the next level. - [ken] not apart of the console. - [austin] nah, no. - [wes] the switch is a portable console. - [austin] this is victory island where you appreciate the switch. - [ken] look, i still
think the best feature out of everything here is the fact that you invited maverick, like, that is my favorite feature
of this whole thing. - so i gotta say, i don't know
if the detail can see this, but can you see my fingers? there is a lot of glue on these fingers. - [wes] it was actually strategic, cause we know you're gonna
get a little tipsy here so we're gonna make sure
you don't drop your switch. - [josh] okay, okay, nah, this is cool. i like this, guys, this is good. - [austin] so, in case anyone's curious, our eggs are are laid. this is not what it appears to be, right? it's not just a fish, in fact... - [ken] oh no. - [josh] oh! - [ken] oh no, aw god. - [austin] billy, the big mouth bass, who sadly found an untimely
demise swimming in the lagoon, however his spirit lives on. - [ken] does he work. - [austin] his spirit lives on. (laughs) so this is the next
generation of the bass. - [josh] the next generation. those are big eggs for some fish, but you know, i mean... - [austin] don't question
billy, the big mouth bass. - [josh] all right, i
will no longer question. - [wes] we're not sure, but that might be why he died. - oh, that's delicious. - all right, so we just
got back from team austin's judging and i'm not gonna
lie, it went pretty well. what can you guys bring to the table. - so, we decided to
embrace the portability of the nintendo switch,
because let's face it, that's what it's meant for. who plays it on a dock? who plays it on a private beach? you could take this to any beach, including your private beach. - [jimmy] i don't see any trees. where's all this shade coming from? - [josh] ohh. - foldable is the new future. so, we present, - [together] the switch book. - [josh] the switch book. - yes. - the switch book. - [josh] all right, all
right, all right, all right. you got me intrigued, i'm intrigued. and, we got style. it's leatherbound. - [josh] oh, hold on. - it's an actual book. - [josh] oh, that feel real. - [ken] it feels great, right? - fully hingeable. it cracked slightly. - [josh] that didn't sound too good. - nah, its fine. - [josh] oh, okay. - [jimmy] a nice squeak and a nice crack. - [austin] i'm actually
super curious to see what... - [ken] hold it, hold it. - [austin] where did the
second switch come from? did you guys buy a second switch? - (laughs) no, we didn't. - we didn't. - i took one for the team. - [matt] we took a lot for the team. - wait, are you using
your personal property? - yes, i am. it wasn't not in the rules. - [austin] that's obviously not... - [jimmy] he super glued that on there and destroyed his own switch. - [josh] yeah, that's fair game. - yeah. - [austin] wait, why'd you do that? - that is permanent, my friend. - so you ruined two switches forever? - [austin] josh, can you
please chime in here. - [josh] yeah, all right, okay, okay. so... - it's only on the back shell. - they didn't spend any money on it. there was no rules against using
your own personal property. - yeah. - i think this is fair. - (laughs) yeah! - also, we went in with a hard rule that we did not want to spend over a certain amount of money. - and you know what... - oh that's a lot of mo- that's a lot of cash. - [josh] that's a lot of company cash. - [austin] looks like it's all ones. - [josh] i only see one 100, man. - [ken] hey, hey, hey, hey. - a boy gotta eat. - [austin] hold on, hold on, hold on. before we get into all this.. - [matt] whoa, whoa, whoa. you back yourself up there. we are not done presenting - [austin] all right, i see how it is. - [matt] we couldn't help
notice that you had mario kart. okay, i guess a kids' game is good, but... - we presented- we're giving our judging panel, - what they really want! - free copies of rocket league! - [josh] all right, so, in
case the people don't know, i'm a master rank in rocket league on my personal account,
so this is a big plus. - you're not on the switch, though, right? - not on the switch, on the ps4. - but you are now, with your buds. - [ken] the best part about
this multiplayer experience is that you don't have to
worry about screen-looking anymore. - [austin] it's pretty good. this is pretty good. - [ken] matt! you guys are our first people trying this, so we're giving you some free food. - i mean this isn't alcohol, but i mean i am hungry. - its a little older. - mm. it could use more salt. - [woman] they ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine. and you're not really fine. - [matt] go ahead, jimmy. - [austin] yeah, jimmy. [jimmy] i don't eat eggs so.. - [matt] oh. - [josh] oh! [austin] do you want another margarita? - i would love a margarita. (laughs) - [josh] oh, ya boy is in his element with the rocket league,
but i've never played it on the switch before. but that doesn't appear to matter. - yeah. - i just scored on myself. - yes. - [josh] it's all good, jimbo. it's your first time playing. and bro, this switch book
doesn't feel half bad. yeah, and it's holding up. i mean, i'm not, like, really
giving it any crazy pressure but, ya know, i'm not... it doesn't feel like it's falling apart. that's a long goal, i'm
not even gon' touch it. be great, jimmmy. stop it, jimmy. jimmy, stop it. (laughs) all right, now let's see how
this tabletop mode works. - is the angle good for you guys. - [josh] i probably, should
get like this, not gonna lie. - [matt] here's the thing. - [ken] you guys are tall, we can just... - [jimmy] oh my god,
this is a game changer. - [josh] oh! - [matt] it will stay wherever you put it. - [jimmy] 10 seconds left. -[matt] i think jimmy's gonna win. - [jimmy] no. - [josh] yay! i'm doing it 7-1 like brazil did germany. - [announcer] it's brazil,
one. germany, seven. - [josh] okay, do you
guys have anything else that you want to present or is this the end of le presentation. - i think the presentation
spoke for itself. here have some more eggs. - [josh] oh, oh, yeah. - [ken] oh, there we go. see, we feed our editors. - all right, so we've
reached the conclusion of our day. both, team austin and team ken,
have completed their builds. only thing that's left is the judging. first category is
creativity and after jimmy and i talked about it, we
gotta give it to team austin. - yes! - team austin wins the first point. - wow. - when you walk into the
room, lights are dim. you see the beach, you see the tarp, you see marilyn monroe. it's pretty creative. - they brought us a private bartender, so that was the big
creativity point for me. - so, right now the score
stands, team austin, one. team ken, zero. - [matt] do we need to
recap for literally, the first category. - i don't think we do actually. - so, let's jump into the next one. we're gonna go into best overall feature. now this one was pretty
easy for us to decide. it's gotta be team ken. - yeah, man. - team ken with the hinge, the book, whatever you wanna call
it, that's pretty nice. now, could it be improved a little bit? potentially. but the over all prospect
of what you guys were bringing to the table was very impressive. - we're on the upper
echelon of human, not god, so, just saying. - you guys might be
thinking the third category being aesthetic, is
that a little similar to creativity? it might be, but hey,
these are the categories that i have chosen and
we're gonna go with it. so, the best overall aesthetic
is, once again, team austin. for the reasons i stated before. i mean, it's just... look at this set. this is beautiful. the only thing that was
potentially gonna knock it off is the fact that i did get a
lot of glue on my left hand, but, you know, i was able to peel it off so its okay. - is that your good hand? - well, i'm a righty. i'm holding the mic with
my right hand, so... - that's why they got the point. - before we get into the
counting of the money, which just might
potentially decide this all, is the use of the mystery item. just to quickly recap, we have the eggs... austin would you step aside for a second. - [austin] yeah. - [josh] we have the eggs down
here by big mouth billy bass, is that his name? - [austin] that is his name. - big mouth billy bass and so i guess these are his offspring. and then we had the delicious
homemade, matt scrambled eggs. this is a tough one. this might've been the toughest call we had to make during this event. - really? - yes, it was. - okay. - it was very tough,
cause you know, i mean... - [matt] two of the categories
had the same criteria. (everyone laughs) - but at the end of the day, even though one of the
judges could not partake in the scrambled eggs, team ken takes best use
of the mystery item. - matt, i love you. chef matt. - chef matt, they were good. i wanted more salt, but i
appreciate you looking out for my health by not
putting the salt in it. so, right now, two to two. team ken to team austin. only thing that's left is
how much money did you boys bring back. - there's cheating involved. we bought all of this, literally, all of this. - [matt] how much did this lighting cost? - the lighting came free just like the sun came free for you. so, not $100. not $200. but we have two, like, thirty something. - oh, great. - ken, you got a big stack of cash there. - i do. $100, $200, oh we're
already done, that's $300, so we're good. - and we have a winner! team ken. - woo! - team ken. matt, come on out here. - you gotta celebrate. - come on out. - there we go. let them get their moment. so... aww, boo! - [ken] the lighting
guy cuts off the light. - [josh] so you guys
have won the first ever ultimate build-off. - and i heard that the award for that is all the money that we didn't spend. - [austin] that's not
true, that's not true. - [jimmy] how about the
reward is employment. (laughs) - aww. - [ken] wait, i mean,
i thought i was fired, but i wasn't, so i mean,
his mistake not mine.
