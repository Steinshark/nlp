if you've got an nvidia graphics card you may have noticed that the majority of their driver updates are labeled as game ready drivers with the idea being that in addition to bringing general updates that benefit everyone these drivers are optimized for a specific new game and are released very near or even on the game's launch day but guess what with a few exceptions downloading the latest driver for your graphics card probably isn't going to give you a massive performance boost even in that new game huh so what are they they actually do well we'll get to that but first a quick history nugget it turns out this misconception about performance goes all the way back to the days of the reva tnt an nvidia product from 1998 there was a famous driver for the reva tnt called detonator that actually did boost performance significantly due to the inclusion of optimizations for amd cpus that previous drivers lacked this was great press for nvidia but unfortunately it ended up setting setting an expectation that drivers would be some kind of silver bullet for performance issues the issue with that is they're usually not and a big part of the reason it's rare to see big performance jumps with new drivers these days is that devs work closely with nvidia while the game is in development this isn't to say you never see significant performance increases with new nvidia drivers but it's not as common as you might think especially as tweaks to the drivers are often made with specific games in mind well before launch meaning that if you've updated your drivers with any regularity there's a good chance your game will perform just fine even if you're not yet using the specific game ready driver for that game nvidia has over an 80% market share in the discrete gpu market so it probably isn't a surprise that they have plenty of contacts at major game studios there's actually a regular cadence where nvidia sends out pre-release drivers to developers on mondays and from there there's back and forth between the game developers and the nvidia folks to get things to play as nicely as possible before launch day and while nvidia can't possibly test every single hardware configuration they do have over 4500 combinations they test that go all the way back to 2012 as of the time this video was shot in case you were wondering this is how they figure out what the optimal settings for your pc are in geforce experience but enough context already what specifically about these drivers do they tweak before release we'll tell you right after we thank the sponsor of this

the general approach with game ready drivers is to ensure stability for example nvidia has outright disabled resizable bar support for certain games as it actually caused performance degradation with certain hardware configurations something that notably happened with hitman world of assassination where nvidia turned off the feature on systems with intel cpus to prevent a performance hit but if you had an amd cpu in left resizable bar on because it wasn't causing performance issues that's not fair not only that tweaks like this tend to be for an entire product stack so for example if there's a problem with an optional feature that's being seen with a lot of rtx 480s it's often switched off for the entire love lace architecture instead of creating a situation where that feature has to get retested on a per card basis for every subsequent driver release and of course resizable bar is just one of a huge number of levers nvidia can pull dlss other ai features and the actual cuda cores themselves all need to be able to support a massive number of games which is part of the reason modern gpu drivers have gotten so huge your new game ready driver has specific code describing how to behave when you're playing this specific new game nvidia has actually tried to strip out unnecessary components to get driver sizes down from around a gigabyte to around 600 megabytes which is still pretty gigantic and with all of those variables game ready drivers still can and sometimes do cause issues even after extensive testing this is part of the reason nvidia also offers studio drivers geared toward even greater stability for content creators which aren't pushed out as frequently as game ready drivers the issues that game ready drivers sometimes face are a possible point in favor of amd's slower release cadence for its whql certified radon drivers and something that the two companies have publicly critici ized each other on of course amd has also had issues with its drivers at times with their anti-ag plus feature causing gamers to run into problems with anti-che software in late 2023 standing out as an example so slower cadences aren't necessarily a perfect solution either and the industry's transition towards the directx12 api has actually shifted more of the onus for getting things right towards the game developers and away from gpu companies the intent behind this is to give developers more control over their own game engines but an unintended and common consequence has been that devs can violate the directx12 spec when they actually believe they're following it so i wouldn't expect those hot fix drivers that target a specific problem to go away anytime soon it's not exactly like trillion dollar companies can't make mistakes hey thanks for watching that whole
