this is a regular pentagon which is a great 
shape the diagonal if you go from corner to   corner like that is the golden ratio times the 
unit edge and don't get me wrong i love other   shapes that do similar things a square square 
is pretty exciting it's got a diagonal equal   to the square root of two another wonderful 
constant however if you take a square and you   go up a dimension and make a cube the space 
diagonal diagonals in space is root three   times the unit edge i'm like oh my goodness so 
a square to a cube goes from ro < tk2 to < tk3   if we start with a pentan and we go up we go 
from the golden ratio to what well i want to   find out which is why i haven't just got one 
of these i've actually got 12 they're made from   laser cut clear acrylic once i peel off all 
of these bits of film we're going to build a   regular pentagonal do decahedron and we're 
going to see how long it space bag [music] are quick aob i will be doing an evening 
of necessary detail on sunday the 14th of   april in new york city me grant sanderson 
other amazing guests and pre-orders for   love triangle are available worldwide all 
the links and details if you want a signed   first edition with a limited book cover in 
the description below oh this is going to   take forever alex do you want to give me a 
hand with this you can do sure those is it   for [applause] you this is going to end up real 
big question is do i tighten it now or do i build the i think that's one large transparent regular 
pagal deedon i just need to cut off all the   stuff double there it is 30 edges each with four 
cable ties 120 cable tires later we have a regular   pentagonal to decahedron let's have a look at 
the diagonals andlike a cube we have a choice of   space diagonal diagonals in they are the longest 
ones if you go from this vertex to the opposite   one over there that's the longest possible space 
diagonal there are 20 vertices so you pair them   up there are 10 of these that go right across the 
center there are then like your mid your medium   siiz space diagonals going straight across 
you go to that one over there which is ever   so slightly closer and then you got the smallest 
internal space diagonal which is if you go from   here to [music] here and we'll start with that one 
first that is the shortest space diagonal and just   quick recap don't forget it's all about the golden 
ratio that's a golden ratio across the face from   there to there the distance from there to there is 
the golden ratio time < tk2 that which is a square   a square number well not a square number it's 
the number you get from a square so actually if   that's < tk2 then this is the length of a diagonal 
from a square made out of the face diagonals you   know let's i'll mark them on here we go one there 
that corner there all right so i've labeled   four of the face diagonals not the space diagonals 
the face ones and those four there you can see   make a perfect square so there is a square hidden 
inside a regular decahedron which is why why this   space diagonal from there to diagonal in to there 
is root 2 * the golden ratio cuz that's the golden   ratio and that's a square amazing our next space 
diagonal instead of just going from here across to   this one we're going to go all the way over here 
and that distance is the golden ratio times the   golden ratio oh thank goodness we're back back in 
pentagon town so that actually means from there to   there must be part of a pentagon we can see that 
if i label i've got a long bit of green tape here   i'm going to mark in i'm going to reuse that 
line and i'm going to put in what i'm going to   call the equator of the do decahedron so it's 
all the way around these sides like this then   that should just line up there there we go and 
the equator which is not quite half but you get   the idea that is a perfectly regular pentagon 
and these face diagonals are reach the golden   ratio so that you can see there so it's it starts 
here goes down there to there and then down these   sides to here and then joins up that is a regular 
pentagon with side length instead of being a unit   sp side length like the faces that's the golden 
ratio side length so from there to there which is   the diagonal within the pentagon is the golden 
ratio of a golden ratio pentagon so that's why   there we have the golden ratio squared lovely but 
don't get too complacent because our final space   diagonal the longest one in a regular decahedron 
which goes all the way from one corner like the   vertex up here to the most distant one like over 
here that is the golden ratio times < tk3 it's   the cube it's the cube ratio so somehow there to 
there combines the pentagon ratio of the golden   ratio with the cube ratio okay i'm going to label 
in some more edges try and turn this square into a cube all right if i put in this last one here 
from there to there i'll wave this around in a   second so you can see it clearly i've now labeled 
12 of these face diagonals all on the surface of   one of the faces of the decahedron and they form 
a perfect cube so there is a cube embedded in the   surface of a regular pagal do decahedron and 
that cube goes from so this corner down here   this vertex to the opposite vertex of the 
cube is also one vertex of the decahedron   to the opposite vertex of the decahedron so 
that's why when you got this cube where all   the edges are the golden ratio length that 
the space diagonal of the decahedron is the   same as the space diagonal of the cube and 
the cube is golden ratio which is why the   big space diagonal in a decahedron is < tk3 
time the golden ratio it's so nice and this   bright tape i've used to mark out the cube is not 
just bright in terms of color it also fluoresces   so we're going to put this under a uv black 
light so you can see the dedon turn into the [music] cube yeah i should have taped the inside as well 
but i couldn't [music] be one cube is fine but the   question now is how many cubes can we fit inside 
our do decahedron well each of these pentagon   faces has well five of these face diagonals and 
there's 12 of them and 12 * 5 is 60 so we've   actually got 60 of these we could use up to make 
cubes and we've only used what 12 the 12 that give   us a cube you how many times does 12 go into 
60 well it's five turns out 5 * 12 is the same   number as 12 * 5 write that down in your workbooks 
now so actually because there are five diagonals   per each of the 12 faces we can get five cubes 
that each have 12 edges we just got to be very   careful line them up i'm going to stop that from 
spinning that's a bit too much there we go now if   this seems at all familiar you may have watched 
a video i made with adam savage over on their   tested channel we built shapes using the space 
diagonals inside a do decahedron have we built   the shape first and then put the do decahedron 
around the outside whereas what i've done here   is the opposite and the shape we were trying to 
make was the compound five intersecting tetrahedra   not cubes triangle based pyramids here's here's 
a picture of what that looks like i just went and   took the standard picture of wikipedia made in 
stella 3d i've actually got a little print out   of it here and then are so that is one of the 
regular compound polyhedrons and when adam and   i were building these they've actually got mirror 
symmetry so while adam was building one based off   the model that was directly in front of him i was 
looking at it in a mirror which was such a dumb   idea seemed clever at the start i regretted it 
immediately so i could build the other chirality   version of the shape and the great thing about 
putting five tetrahedra inside the decahedron   is this has got if you count them all up there are 
20 corners and each one of the tetrahedra has four   corners and four * 5 is 20 so the every single 
corner every vertex matches one vertex on one of   the tetrahedra and what i mentioned in the video 
with adam and hello to everyone who came here from   that video if you haven't seen it you don't have 
to watch it straight away everything should make   sense in this video anyway but definitely watch 
it afterwards it was a huge amount of fun i did   mentioned you could combine both handednesses of 
the two different compound five tetrahedra and   get this one 10 10 intersecting tetrahedra 
is that one combined with its mirror image and   now you've got two tetrahedra per vertex of 
the do decahedron so i'm going to put that   one up on the board as well so we're now up 
to two reg regular compound polyhedrin   and what we're building now is a third one if 
i arrange all five cubes in here according   to these diagonals nice and carefully it would 
be perfectly regular just like the deedon itself   is a platonic solid we can make the compound 
polyhedrin version of a platonic solid because   the way they''re arranged means every vertex is 
still indistinguishable it's so nice and if you   did come from adam's video this is what i promised 
i would do on my channel so i'm going to do it i'm   going to tape on the other four cubes and we'll 
have another little uv polyhedron [music] rave [music] all right isn't that absolutely 
incredible so we've got all 60 face diagonals   are now labeled in five different colors 12 each 
and that gives us five intersecting cubes which   is a compound regular polyhedrin i might put 
handful of lights back on again isn't it amazing   that if you take three of these face diagonals 
from any one corner they are all at right angles   with each other those right angles are hidden 
inside the dodecahedron and this is our next   one of the regular compound polyhedra so we can 
add five intersecting cubes to our collection   up there so good it looks like because it's 
every single pentagram like the most flamboyant   satanist party you'll ever you'll ever get to go 
to and now the obvious question that's left   is how many are there if there are five platonic 
solar that is just five regular polyhedrons how   many regular compound polyhedrons are there also 
five the other two that we haven't gone near is   cuz one's comp one's boring we've also got the 
two intersecting tetrahedra yville and we've got   five intersecting octahedrons which doesn't even 
have a convex hull so i refuse to build either   of those now but i will put them up on the list i 
mean an obvious question is is it significant that   there are five regular polyhedrons and there are 
five compound ones and i don't think so i think   it's just a coincidence that there are five of 
these but what's very pleasing is three of them   are all hidden inside a regular do decahedron 
so i've made we just i've only got the edges as   like a frame cube of each one and the picture on 
nick off wikipedia has all the faces colored in   as well same shape h so you can see the one i've 
done here and you can go check out the left and   right-handed five intersecting tetrahedra on 
adam savage's channel which combined give us   a 10 thank you so much for watching do check 
out the video i did with adam savage over on   the tested channel it was a huge amount of fun 
to make and people who came here from tested   thanks for coming along you may know me from 
number file and that video where i talk about   spreadsheets so this is my this is my channel
