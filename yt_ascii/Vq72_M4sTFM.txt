i have an announcement let's not make this awkward let's just jump right into it after years of being a poor poor detective in the 10 million dollar studio it's time to sell out to sell out can we make this faster to sell out of to sell out of of merch sell out i have i have merch shopthething.com i don't know look before you guys go all in and i know you see these graphics you're sayings where do i buy no wait wait a second i want to say something real quick i want to be straight forward with you guys look yes we made the shirts hella affordable 20 bucks t-shirt hoodies a bit more i think 35 bucks the clothing is nice crisp crispy as can be and soft and yes it might be too drippy you know school might ban you if you wear this if you wear this at work definitely probably they're gonna say go get something more professional but i want to anti-sell you guys for a second because it's serious put the serious music on some of you guys are here because he got scammed let's be honest right and so i felt feel an obligation to say this if you got scammed seriously actually unironically don't don't invest in this don't it's not an investment keep your money if you put your roth ira into dink doink and now you're homeless save it save your money i don't need it you need it right now you need to invest in yourself and i don't mean a dan lok course take yourself on a date maybe half-price books maybe get some anxious wisdom in you you know that you don't need this shirt between me and you don't tell anybody else you don't need it okay now the rest of you now that got that out of the way the rest of you who can't afford it you do need it you do yes no i'm serious looking to my you need this look guys we're calling it the crypto collection and unlike the blockchain this won't last forever which sounded cooler as a slogan in my head but now it just kind of sounds like we're it's lasting till december 31st and then we're not selling it again because i want to make this like a little slice of history from coffeezilla and then in season two or three or whatever season we're on you can get more the different stuff this represents different things so again to recap this is only for people who can afford to support the channel and want to support it guys and you got to love the merch so the reason i'm stressing that is because this merch money is not for me to live on guys i'm fine i'm in the 10 million studio i can eat some bushes baked beans baby i actually think i have more money than steve will do it right now now that he quit rubet so i'm fine i want to say this merch be super transparent it's all about reinvestment back into the the channel guys you guys don't notice we care a lot too much frankly about production youtube does not reward it the way they maybe should but we care about it nonetheless and we're going to keep pushing forward the levels we want to take it to the next level just like last year we took it from a bedroom to the 10 million studio this year where could we go 100 million dollar studio who knows it could be we don't even know that's that's the whole point you know it could be we could get to cyberpunk levels okay actually maybe that wasn't such a good example but the point is we're getting to hollywood levels on a youtube budget baby and i thought it was impossible but then oh i was in the shower the other day and i had an epiphany how does disney make its movies best animation in the game not from the box office baby they actually make it from selling merch and basically i want to do the same thing on a much much much much smaller scale without all the corporate takeover and stepping on small artists and screwing up copyright and you know what that's actually another bad example and i'm on a bad streak here but the point is i want to get us to a place where no one can put together the investigations and stories we can and to support that i'm selling some merch so you guys can come get it if you want it i think you guys are gonna love it i partnered with actually a fan of the show who's an incredible graphic designer ronan he created the collection with my input and i'm just excited to show it to you so look if you like the show you like what we've done here go take a take a poke around our website shop coffeezilla.com go see what you like you know maybe don't buy anything maybe though you like something maybe you get it for your girlfriend maybe she doesn't know who i am maybe she hates it because you picked the one with my face on it i don't know maybe she says this reflects poorly on your judgment maybe you break up but maybe you should have broken up a long time ago because you needed the change i don't know the point is when you buy coffeezilla merch anything can happen that's all i'm all saying kids you said you'd save but what a shame what a shame you're a fraud are you the same as so you're saying no you're not
