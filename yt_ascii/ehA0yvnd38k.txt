david goggins posted a 48-hour challenge which is run four miles every four hours totaling up to 48 miles as 12 sessions i'm doing it to harden up the mind in a dimension that i don't usually challenge myself it's cold outside below freezing it's icy and wet it's windy i actually tried to record this intro outside i had to come back in because there's too windy for the audio or i don't know what i'm doing in general i don't know what i'm doing i didn't tried to think about this too much just said do it i said i was gonna do it i'm gonna do it you might be wondering i'm wondering how long i'm actually gonna last you're gonna have to watch the end to find out i might swap out a just a training session for one of the running sessions i also decided to do an exercise of gratitude almost like a thought experiment i wrote down 12 things i'm grateful for one for your session to think about when i run and to talk about when i come back from the run i thought this would be a nice challenge a nice way to strip away all the literal and metaphorical fat from the mind all the distractions all the busyness that fills up the day i really purely zoom in on the things that make life worthwhile to be thankful for them to push the mind to its limits to see you know to see that i still got it still a tough guy in a way that i don't usually these days test myself i usually test myself in the realm of intellectual work i don't as much that's myself in the realm of physical work so let's see if i still got it cold wet windy in the night still rushing still tough let's see let's see how long i last watch the end to find out all right let's go all right four miles down 40 to go plus the jujitsu session that was easy but i can tell it's gonna get tough so like i said i made a list of 12 things that i'm grateful for one per session the first thing i'd like to show my gratitude for is to go all the way back to the beginning is to my childhood to my family in russia and to my grandmother who was a really big important person in my life early in my life and throughout my life and throughout my memories the love the kindness the toughness and also just the piercing simple minimalist intelligence that she gifted me or showed me the importance of but of course the love just the care and i miss her deeply i miss the the bigger family very much so many my formidable experiences were there so much of the soul of my love of literature of my love of knowledge of my love of pushing your mind to the limit of understanding curiosity about the human mind so much of it was born there whether it's in the early days of friendship with a my close friend yura who who showed me the the deep value of friendship i think i understood what it means the brotherhood that makes in the companionship that with which life becomes somehow a more fulfilling when you get to share it with somebody else that kind of love that kind of friendship was revealed to me early on is profoundly important and fulfilling in life so and the russian culture at least that time least in the context of my family we didn't have many material possessions but that didn't matter it was all about the relationship about the friendships the music the soul of the people that i that i loved and it implanted in me again the the love the brotherhood the connection with other human beings that's so profoundly fulfilling in life alright i'll try to talk less try to run more i have to try to figure out the whole clothing in the shower situation and something i didn't anticipate with 12 sessions i guess for most i'm gonna have to jump in the shower and change clothes so i'm gonna maybe have to do a little bit of laundry okay i loving it go let's do this alright that was 3 a.m. 8 miles down 36 miles to go and one jujitsu grappling session that was a little bit wet a little bit cold but we'll be alright the the body feels good to my eye feels good well alright this is kind of fun like i said i'm making a list of things i'm grateful for the second thing is of course my family my dad my mom my brother it's been ups and downs and tension like all families have but really to focus in on the most important thing as there's been a lot of gifts that they've given me each my dad's really given me nothing no i'm just kidding oh my dad's given me the love of knowledge of physics and science especially the rigorous of mathematics and also the love of music and poetry in which of revealing of seeing the absurdity in things that otherwise might seem painful that might be stressful seeing the humor in all of it that's the little bit of the jus a little bit of the russian in him my mom has taught me what means to be what means to love of course but it also what he means to express emotion i mean she is she's a vibrant beautiful personality in human being and i i certainly haven't heard enough of that in terms of temper in terms of emotion in terms of by deeply feeling experiencing things and my brother's i mean i wish i hope i inherited something from my brother because he's an incredible human being he's fun he's fascinating he's brilliant he's in many ways opposite than me in terms of how much rich interesting personality he has and i've always looked up to him growing up it's always wanted to be like him i still want to be like him so i'm really grateful for the family i have and for the tough times and for the beautiful time so alright here we go let's try and get some sleep let's get in the shower we're almost there only ten more sessions to go let's do this see you at 7:00 a.m. okay that was 12 miles down a lot more to go feeling good it's been a while since i've been up at 7 a.m. in the morning on a saturday but it feels good it feels like i'm getting in front of the day because nobody else is out it's just productive i'm looking forward to hopping in a shower and getting some work done before the 11:00 a.m. on and then the jujitsu session so some people are asking me what i'm eating i'm didn't plan any of this so i'm eating what i usually eat which is meat i mostly eat meat these days and we all make mistakes and one of mine is to eat like i usually do which is one larger meal i ate after three i'm running and that turned out not to be a good idea because i just feel just really heavy infall which is not a good feeling when you're running okay so in terms of things i'm grateful for is you know i often joke around about being russian and it's true the culture the music the poetry the science of the people is in there in my blood and my roots and my family but i am at this point i'm a red-blooded american i love this country this country given me everything i have the opportunities the ability to do what i do the ability to challenge myself to create things i want to create it's an incredible country an incredible country that welcomes immigrants with open arms for the most part people like me silly silly washing kids like me with a dream it opens its arms and puts it into this giant pool of people that compete against each other cooperate against each other there's a there's a tension there's a love and you figure out how to how to make it all work as a big pool of diverse kind of backgrounds you know nobody is truly from america except native americans but even and even then there's a diversity in that history so it's it's an incredible country in its welcoming of immigrants and opportunities that provides for people with the dream and that are willing to work hard so i'm deeply thankful for this for this country for the united states of america i know i often joke around about being russian but it's more just the wooden humor and i am in in terms of my roots russian but if we look i look in the mirror if you look at who i truly am i'm an american i always will be american and i love this country an opportunities given me i'm deeply grateful for it alright that was 16 miles for sessions eight more to go i'm getting in a little bit of a zone feeling good getting a lot done there's an interesting urgency to everything which i kind of enjoy i'm actually getting a lot of work done even the napping has an urgency to it i shut off turn back on have a lot of energy the only thing i screwed up in is eating a little too much through you last night but other than that feeling feeling pretty good still would have been fast a little bit soft but just getting out there on the road a little cold it's a little windy but yeah it feels good that's good i'm glad i did it it's a fun way to so wretched to the whole thing of life to make you appreciate everything and to be grateful for everything so what is this number four on the list of things i'm grateful for man his friendship in general like i said in russia is one at first develop really close friendships but really when i became slowly to say but when i became a man was in america in good going to high school middle school in high school here college and meeting some really really close friends especially in the chicago suburbs in naperville a really close friend of mine matt you know i really formed a close lifelong bond with him and with other folks here with his family and you know we don't often you know these days we don't even often talk that much together but there's still any time we see each other there's it's like we never spent a you know an hour away so you know matt and others have taught me the value of friendship i'd spent so much time working i spent so much time pursuing my passions but behind it all is a love for the human beings and friendship is at the core of that of course i also want a family and friendship but with a you know whether with a girl with a wife with my kids it but i see it all just kind of part of the same big picture and you know it all started in middle school meeting that weird-looking iranian kid matt you know that we just kept instantly connected different worlds different backgrounds different histories different music preferences the guy likes biohazard and like pantera heavy metal i like it's pretty good it's pretty good but the i'm more of a classic rock kind of kind of guy and we together fell in love with music playing guitar sports football soccer tennis chess everything talking about the biggest philosophical questions about the universe and things like that and it's always a pleasure to see him and i'm deeply grateful for having the chance to met him to met others in naperville allan p jim jonathan i you know collis countless people that have have changed the direction of my life affected me has shown me what friendship is all about so i'm deeply grateful for that then we'll forget it they're always there always family all right let's go do some jiu-jitsu black belt instructor philosopher warrior with it [music] all right i think that's five sessions now although i'm starting to loose track a little bit it's a fun time that's a little break from the running and it felt remarkably good for some reason makes me feel like this is the calm before the storm but so 16 miles a jujitsu session just just a few more miles to go it should be fun so you know since i did get sore did a little bit of nogi grappling it's a good time to say that i'm grateful for all the people that i met on the mat i forgot who said it but it's true that the mat is one of the only places in this world that's deeply honest you can't hide from the truth on the in combat sports in general it's one-on-one and it's just you in the opponent and you're constantly especially in the grappling sports where you can go 100% and get choked and threatened of murder over and over and over again with some of your closest friends i mean it's an incredible kind of experience that's deeply humbling that i hope to be doing for the rest of my life i see it extremely valuable for your intellectual curiosity and girls to be humble throughout your no matter what you achieve in life to be humble is i to me is essential for happiness and for just continuous growth but your brain can get lazy you can start getting fool yourself so i think jiu-jitsu for me at least especially as my body gets softer and you're older and don't have as much time to train juju this is a great place to be humbled where you you can train with a the young blue belt they'll kick your kick your butt and submit you over and over and it kind of reminds you that you might be good at like programming or something like that or you might be good in the space of science and so on but somehow being tapped by 20 year old reminds you one that you're mortal and two that you're not as special as you think you're not such a big shot and i think that's a really powerful thing i think that's probably an essential element of why i know i talk about looking up to joe maybe a little too much but i i do in this regard that he is truly everything he's accomplished in terms of both wealth and success in comedy and so on he's still humble i think just is a crucial part of that it just for me so i'm really grateful for having discovered for having sort of come across the sport first through judo grateful to the folks at philadelphia judo for revealing to me the beauty of this art of the gentle art of judo and i'm really great grateful to balance studios in philadelphia for teaching me brazilian jiu-jitsu taking me from white both to a black belt i'm really grateful for all the people have met in the grappling arts and jiu jitsu martial arts in general i'm grateful for my current gym shawn fisher john clark and all the people that trained there there there's something about them that's both deeply philosophical i think something about jiu-jitsu attracts order or encourages the development of intellectual kind of chests like puzzles solving curiosity that creates really interesting people from all different kinds of backgrounds and also the toughness like like i said being tapped kind of sharpens your mind to to understand to understand that you're not special and because you're not special your approach to life has this kind of humble curiosity which makes you a really interesting person to talk with to be friends with to just have a deep conversation one to have some beers with so i'm from broadway jujitsu here in boston - all the way back to fill with balance studios and all the people i've gotten to me i'm deeply grateful for that my hope i've been for the most part injury free my whole life in martial arts now you know banged up here and there but nothing broken nothing torn i hope i really hope that stays same you know if it doesn't so what i'll still persevere but i do hope to be doing jiu-jitsu for the rest of my life it's a beautiful it's a humbling journey i'm deeply grateful all right i think those 20 miles but i'm not sure i'm kind of losing track and also not really worrying about the full span of it but instead focusing on the next step it's getting a little bit tough after doing jujitsu your body gets banged up a little bit so you get to feel the run a little bit but not even just physically you get to feel the duration of it mentally which kind of starts wearing on you you start to this the the sleep kind of the whole weight of it because i've also been working while doing this in the span in in the ties between the runs that's the stuff this is there's the ups and downs and i've been feeling pretty good but come down pretty pretty hard at this point and you know i took a i took a shower before filming this just really doing i would say filming is probably the hardest part having to face the camera having the review of these parts of myself hopefully it's a value for somebody to be fragile in this way i knew this was going to get tough it might get even a lot tougher i'm ready for it whatever brings so far so good physically so there's a little bit of shin splints a little bit of ankle pain i'm trying to make sure i keep a slow pace doing 9 minute miles kind of paste to really make sure that no injuries get aggravated i mean this we're starting to go into a territory i haven't been before in terms of distance in terms of mind so let's see this is going to be fun it's a fun test it might be kind of silly to say but i'm really grateful for books for having an opportunity from an early age to explore the the minds and the thinking and the ideas of others through como si so i would say most the 20th century existential philosophers and writers were for me early on really influential for me at least they broke me out of the pursuits of everyday life that were born with the sort of the focusing the egotistical view of life where you just kind of focus on the task at hand and the existential way of thought counter-intuitively perhaps got me to think about the bigger picture of life got me to think about my own mortality about the the meaning of life of life in general so come albert camus herman has a nietzsche of course friedrich nietzsche dostoevsky kafka franz kafka hugely influential for me hemingway george orwell animal farm is one of my favorite books i don't know why just love it for me i would spend months i read slowly and i'll spend months in a particular book and really take it in it was kind of a friendship with both the author and the ideas and that i mean with herman has the glass be game siddartha damian steppenwolf like all of these books i actually i guess i could say it dated them i was like a girlfriend for a few months you know and some of them i'm still seeing on the side every once in a while and i remember moments when there's reading me these individual books and just coming to a point in the book where it was like a transformative moment i would sit back and think about how incredible it is to be here to be my skin to be alive and also how terrifying it is that this whole thing ends just mortality speaking of which ernest becker denial of death so the more modern philosophers and thinkers a psychologist nonfiction and fiction and just the tremendous effect on me if i were to regret anything i think it has to do with the my soviet of bringing is i never really got into science fiction so i've really it seemed like to my mind it seemed to me more profound and more important to study world war one in long war ii and the subtle experiences of everyday life that camus has seen dostoevsky described as opposed to having to create a fantasy world i always saw the fantasy world as a kind of unneeded spice added to the picture that's already fascinating and not fairly so i felt this way because i can see now there's a lot of profound philosophical and dramatic work that's done in science fiction but one of the things one of my goals is to find the time to read more science fiction so if there's good recommendations certainly the foundation series i need to read snow crash dune all of these books i need to read that that have not been part of my childhood but really should be part of my extended childhood because i still haven't grown up okay talk for way too long but it feels good to talk maybe to escape from the writing i look forward to the challenge of the 11:00 p.m. run or the 3:00 a.m. run and i think will be the hardest is waking up for the 7 a.m. and doing that run and then a full day after that this is fun i'm glad i'm doing it it's a good test of mind let's go all right 24 miles down just past the halfway point 11 p.m. run i feeling okay dreading going through the night a little bit but injury-wise a little bit of shin splints little bit of aches here and there hamstring from just as a little bit of roughed up but i'm gonna be all right it's just mental at this point which is great it's exactly exactly what i wanted test the mind versus the test of aches and pains and injuries and stuff like that something i'm grateful for might be ridiculous to say but because of my love for artificial intelligence i'm grateful for the big community the shoulders of giants they get to stand on from the 50s to the 60s the seventies and eighties of the development different branches of computer science and general mathematics and all the things that are interconnected in your science and physics to on your biology to psychology of course all those things are interconnected in my in my work in my in the in my view of artificial intelligence some deeply grateful for all those brilliant researchers just allowing oh and of course computer programming just believer and robotics being able to build that stuff i mean there's just been you know i guess it always feels like that when when you're at the cutting edge that you're born just at the right time but it for me really does feel like i've been born just at the right time to do truly break breakthroughs in the field of artificial intelligence and initially when the dream was born for me which is to understand the mind i'm just i feel like the kind of developments that are had happening now the kind of tools that are available to for breakthroughs both in the understanding and the indigent engineering space is just amazing i'm really grateful that reading a little bit now looking forward to the night running but it is what it is got to get it done let's go all right i don't really feel like recording this video but kind of do what you gotta do i just ran a 3 a.m. run i think that's 28 miles then i spent maybe an hour to dunkin donuts drinking coffee continue listening to an audiobook about rocket fuel means some sense i was a little bit delirious just happy i'm truly happy but sort of don't want to be talking right now i don't want to be recording videos i just want to jump in the shower and get some sleep and get back to work so things i'm thankful for may be kind of silly to say but just my academic journey in general has revealed a lot to me and the ups and downs of it i'm really thankful for from the vsms phd that i got in computer science computer engineering and focusing on machine learning and artificial intelligence so getting exposure to the exciting full space from theoretical computer science to math physics quantum mechanics of classical mechanics that - even literature took a james joyce course and just getting going to college i love learning and then getting an opportunity to do research one of the best places in the world in industry is at google i machine learning early especially earlier days of deep learning was really exciting and and of course then to tell my tea - much less sunnier boston but brilliant people from all walks of life the close knit colleagues the friends i've developed here and more distant from physics and mathematics - brain and cognitive sciences and neuroscience - the business side of sloan - psychology i've gotten to experience that i've grown a lot through that just having the opportunity to be here and that opportunity also gave me even the bigger gift to realize the dreams i've had always and the dreams that burns now of having a large scale impact of of working in large teams collaboratively on one big moonshot project it's something that's much it's very difficult to do in the in the academic setting and so it took me to go to mit to understand that that's not the right place for me to realize a dream i haven't so all of that is a beautiful gift i couldn't ask it any other way i'm really grateful for it grateful for all the friends i had merrill for the connections i still have at mit and perhaps forever will be connected to mit in the broader academic community it's a it's a real gift that i'm thankful for okay on to the next few miles just a few left i don't know how many more i'm not even letting myself think about it but i'm excited to get it done i said i'm gonna get it done i'm gonna get it done let's go okay i'm gonna try to make this quick not feeling great that was 32 miles and it's getting rough i don't actually walk a little bit of that the thing i'm grateful for sounds funny to say but the community people on the internet of supporters in general people on patreon people who had discussion through email through social networks also might be funny to say but i'm really grateful to the people who's the the companies and actually the people behind those companies that sponsor the podcast i think i didn't take on sponsors for a while but there was a point where i really literally needed money to offer food and shelter so and so i thought that monetization might not get in the way of the deep conversation that's why i really wanted to just do it in the beginning the beginning and i could connect with the company cash app and they decided to sponsor the partners it took you know they made it really easy they took a risk of me i guess a guy named naveed especially just and there's a bunch there's really good people really give you but i was kind of surprised how pleasant and fulfilling the experience could be to sort of tell others to use a thing that i already use and the funny thing about cash shop is because they sponsored let me to kind of open up this floodgate i don't know if it's because of them but or just the general growth of the podcast but and the floodgate of other people who wants to sponsor the podcast on but nothing and allows me to completely freely choose if my hands are totally not tired i don't have to be sponsored by cash up at all by everybody else expressvpn incredible thing i've used for a long time that's your class this place where you can watch videos from the most brilliant people in their field chris hadfield talking about how rockets work is just incredible and the fact that they would want to support the podcast is so cool and there's like many others that could choose from so i'm really grateful for that support too just in general it it allows me to survive doing something i love which is these deep conversations and podcast form while i work on the main thing that is my dream the startup that i'm working on so i'm deeply grateful for that for the financial for the emotional the psychological mental the physical support all kinds of borders people reaching out and being kind giving me strength i a deeply appreciated that i'm sorry if i look like a mess these videos are really tough to record i really don't want to record them i am really struggling to even finish this freaking thing not sure i should be recording myself in this state but hopefully it's valuable to somebody to see the fragility for some runners this might not be this be just hard but not too hard but for me not a runner this is rough but i said i'm going to finish i have to finish let's go all right i think 36 miles down 11 a.m. session and four cups of coffee afterwards like little little cups with a actually cappuccino on a cappuccino machine then i found free coffee and i couldn't stop and i'm feeling really energetic so body's feeling alright i'm just not letting my mind listen to the body there's no injury so that's really the important thing the shin splints hamstring from jujitsu is just you know it's there it's there it's like like a little reminder that i'm still alive but it's also affecting my pace i'm i'm saying i slid from maybe a 9-minute mile pace to 10-minute mile pace so just focusing on taking one step at a time feeling alright a little bit of a headache i think it's a salt issue that i need to get some more sodium in whatever they're called electrolytes whatever so people have been asking what i'm eating i'm eating just me same thing i was eat feeling good overall energy wise as this affection before people made fun of me but you know a low carb when i travel eat mcdonald's even even here he mcdonald's just the beef patties you know yesterday made the giant mistake because my body my mind for some reason wanted an oven roasted chicken from from a grocery store six bucks so it's cheap and it just it always looks delicious when it's the one it's right there so i i took it home sounds weird to say i take a little thanksgiving dinner and i i was planning to eat maybe a quarter a half and end up eating the whole thing so i'm regretted that and in general i've been just feeling a little bit too full i've been overeating which is not good when you're running every four miles it's interesting i think because i only once a day or twice a day at most this adjustment was necessary to me and i just my body my mind is refusing to make the adjustments i just been overeating so for people wondering if i'm losing weight i probably gain weight from this whole challenge just because i've just been eating and drinking tons of coffee and who cares i'm not doing this to lose weight i don't i don't care how much i weigh i care how i feel and in general i run because and the way i eat is because i want to feel good and so eating meat has made me feel really good i don't care what i look like i care that i feel good and it made me feel good help me focus the mind and so on i wanted to talk about diet a little bit because something weird reason i'm feeling really good right now so you know its ups and downs that's the amazing thing about life is if you take just one step at a time you can feel horrible i think 7 a.m. long i just felt horrible and i can for this one i felt felt pretty good so if you take one step at a time the the suffering will end and the good times will come and i'm feeling good right now next one will probably be the hardest one 3 p.m. is because it's like the body's right now i really just want to rest and there's no glory in finishing the eleventh session right there's glory finishing the whole thing so but it's just one step at a time one step at a time something i'm grateful for i've been doing a podcast called artificial intelligence maybe you'll listen it's one of the things i'm grateful for is how many people for no reason whatsoever said yes they'll do it and they've been really kind and generous with their time with their mind bringing up their mind to my style of questioning to my attempts and growth and learning of how to crack a hard question how to have conversations some of the busiest so basically my whole strategy has been asking silly profound questions of the busiest engineers in the world i mean the fact that elon musk twice carved out time from his day to have a conversation with me about artificial intelligence consciousness the human brain and the thalamus vehicles as as incredible and everybody else don knuth just i am so deeply grateful first people have looked up to like don i mean don offered me hot dogs after the conversation all right but that's i could i could die happy now don knuth offered me i had a long amazing conversation welcomed me into his home and offered me a hot dogs after to go out for hot dogs i mean how freaking amazing is that so i'm so grateful from eric schmidt eric weinstein the sean carroll the physicists of the physicists mathematicians computer scientists for neuro scientists philosophers historians i mean they everybody has kindly sat down and said yes at first sat down and just listened the way you know when you become famous like a few of the folks have many of the folks i've spoken with it's so rewarding to see that that they still truly listen to the human they you know most of them don't know who am i i'm just some kid sitting before them in the fact that they would sort of listen to me and really look into my eyes and and like wonder what is this kid about and really generally like human to human be able to connect throughout the busyness the chaos of their day that made me so happy about the human race that no matter where you are no matter how small or big you are you could still connect on a human level so i'm really grateful for the opportunity to learn that for the opportunity to share that with with the world and with the great media of people through the podcast medium which is like which i think is the one of the exciting mediums in the future for long-form conversation i would say it was started with joe rogan really brought to life that long-form two three four our conversations there's a hunger for them he made me realize that and the fact that there's a platform for it super grateful for so alright back to running clearly i'm feeling weirdly good it's very strange probably going to do some work now get a little bit get a little bit of work done get back on the road finish this thing refused to quit i said i'm going to do it i'm gonna do it looking forward to the last few miles let's go alright i'm gonna keep this short i did 40 miles took a shower i did swap out one of the sessions for jujitsu session i decided i'm gonna stay true to the for 48 hour 48 mile challenging i'm gonna try for i'm gonna try and do it i'm gonna do eight miles a mile run at 7:00 p.m. of my body's just exhausted muscle wise but there's no injuries period that's it nothing else to say it's just the mind now beautiful test really glad i did it it's there's a lot to think about a lot to learn from i'll remember this experience for a long time i'm not so sure i'm glad i did the video i still have to watch it maybe edit it down this way too much talking but maybe this kind of sharing is useful for people i'm really grateful for the for the hardship that my life has presented that been a little a lot of ways in which i've been tested throughout my life and i'm really fortunate for that and some of them many of them especially recently had been self-imposed in me to choosing certain decisions in my career to to really challenge myself in every kind of way and also test like this which are really fun little divergences in life into a totally different direction i'm grateful for people that who loved me back actually but wanted nothing more for me but to be comfortable and to be mediocre one of the things for some reason there's a fire in me that refuses to be mediocre and so when everybody tells me even my parents or people who love me to slow down to take it easy to sort of relax to take what is it somebody in the internet says how bath with some soap and i don't know i'm sure rubber duckies will be involved i don't do hot baths and i don't do mediocrity so whenever people tell me that i hear it and it's a beautiful thing because i feel the love and that but i also refuse to give in to that kind of advice i enjoy the richness the deep beauty of every moment so i'm grateful for that but i'm also endlessly on satisfied with not realizing the potential that i believe i have so i really have a belief a dream that i'm driving towards not comparing myself to others i don't care what success that if i'm famous or my name attached to it or if i'm successful under any kind of dimension that this world presents itself but i have a dream and i want to realize that dream and that the the opportunity to take that on to take the full challenge of that to have the will and the dragon after defeat to go to the castle princess or not who cares about the princess it's it's about the dragon and then maybe the princess can help me slay the dragon too but i'm grateful for that opportunity for that hardship and looking forward to 7:00 p.m. to crush that eight miles and enjoy a nice hot cup a cup of coffee maybe a steak let's go all right here we are hard to believe with 40 48 miles down zero to go some people kind of look to the next thing right away to me i really enjoy these moments i purposely brought it out so it's a 10 mile route so i get to walk now for a couple miles legs legs are definitely shot but i feel good mentally it's probably the hardest thing that i've ever done physically now i'm feeling really good now but the i would say session seven eight and nine and now maybe ten or is really really rough mentally i had to kind of suck it up and not to think about it but if i had to take any kind of lessons from this is if you really take one step at a time you can accomplish you can accomplish a lot so i really let my mind sort of meditate on the moment really focus on the moment taking one step at a time and not think about the future not planning for the future and got the job done as silly as it is to say i'm really grateful to be alive really i'm dreading the whole fact that it ends eventually but while the last would enjoy the hell out of it and i'm glad i did this it's been rough at times mentally physically but anyone gets an opportunity to test themselves in this kind of different kind of way i highly recommend it big thank you to david goggins for challenging the world and for letting me in on the challenge by seeing it on instagram wherever the heck i saw it for everyone out there that's actually listening to this i hope there's some value to it keep pushing your self to whatever your limit is intellectually physically and most importantly i keep putting love out there in the world i love you all keep grinding let's see what the next challenge holds let's see what the next exciting opportunity that life's brings us you
