ladies and gentlemen chess is a game that makes us feel all sorts of complex emotions and if you followed my channel for a while if you followed my channel recently if you've never seen me before and you've just clicked on this video because the youtube algorithm recommended it to you well you should know that i wear my emotions on my sleeve in chess and i show them to all of you and in this video we will once again be taking a look at a recent chess tournament that i played in i am retired in the traditional sense i do not play physical over theboard chess because it causes me a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety but i do play online and i played another event in chess.com title tuesday tournament which is an event where you play 11 games against titled chess players and yesterday i performed like a grandmas i had my best result in years scoring eight out of 11 eight wins three losses tying my record i have never scored eight and a half and i basically tied for like eighth place in a tournament with some of the best grand masters in the world i did not have a chance to play against magnus carlson but he won the event so that was very special and i'm going to show you three games that i played against some of the best grand masters in rapid and blitz events online and just show you that i actually can be a good chess player so without further ado let's jump into it also if you're watching this in late 2023 i'm going on a mini mini world tour i will be in new york and new jersey these events are coming up i will be in london i will be in florida and i'm going to be in toronto so link is in the description if you want to do a little meet and greet get a sign copy of my book go to an event we'll take a photo together as well very excited to meet you all and maybe there will be more events coming in 2024 so e4 in this game i played against somebody named gm peter and when i saw saw that this person was a grandmas but rated 2400 blitz i i assume they were old that is probably you know that's probably not a good thing that i assume that but i just assume but actually turns out it's a 19-year-old grandmaster from india 19 and 2400 this dude should be like 2700 and this dude had won a couple of nice games so he played e5 and i went for my my true and tried vienna which is what i play against e45 highly recommend the vienna opening vienna gambit for those of you that don't know it my opponent did not play bishop c5 which is the copycat which allows queen g4 with some good attacking possibilities on this pawn the most famous line being this one where you move your king that's not mate but you create very annoying threats to your opponent he didn't do that he didn't do that people at my level they generally play the two knights and then he played bishop to b4 and you'll notice i have not spent any time in the opening literally no time at all because i know the opening and you get a second bonus in title tuesday now at this point many people take this kn they take this kn even as early as this position they try to play for a very quick pawn to d5 as well but my opponent did not play for pawn to d5 played d6 which allows me to play this move and now in you know i'm going to i'm going to do what's called put pressure on the pinned piece so if my opponent plays something like rook e8 this would be a very big mistake look because whenever there's a pin on a knight to a queen and you can apply more pressure and nothing can get in the way this is a big problem because the next thing that you're going to do is you're going to bring even more pieces but in general what you want is to open up the king and you want to play knight g3 queen h5 you know all of this good attacking stuff so what did my opponent do my opponent tried to kick me out and i took and went here okay and i and i i had a plan here i'm getting out of the way of this bishop so now i'm going to force the queen back and expand all of my pawns expand that entire armada of pawns pawns forward why because i'm threatening to trap the bishop which now has no moves and the only way to stop that is to play a5 and so here i'm now going to take and damage my opponent's pawn structure it is much better for my opponent to take with the a pawn to keep this all together right all the pawns together and open up the rook it is much worse for my opponent to have to do this that is very ugly now there is no c pawn so there's no anchor to these pawns and these squares are very exploitable these pawns will be weaknesses forever and i thought you know what i i got exactly what i wanted from the opening i mean in chess the opening is supposed to get you to a position where you more comfortable than your opponents where you are understanding the plans better where you have an advantage i have a 1 minute and 10c time advantage from the opening and well i would like to think i'm better now my advantage immediately goes away after i play this move apparently i was debating for a long time whether i wanted to push but i did not see a clear way forward here the computer does want me to push and then play queen b3 stop d5 stop bishop to e6 and you know my opponent would do something like this and fight back but i i didn't i didn't like that so i kept the tension but after this i thought well i'm very happy i mean these pawns are awful right these pawns are bad i'm going to expand i'm going to i'm going to slide forward with my queen in the future put some good pressure on these pawns opponent went here and so now it's another very instructive moment white is better but only if white plays a certain plan and that plan is this f4 move immediately activating the rook and if my opponent doesn't take me well if they do take me i'm going to go here and here or there now if they don't take me i'm going to play f5 i'm going to shut down this bishop so if bishop d7 is played i'm going to play f5 and now now black's pieces just can't get into the game at all at all and the more you trade the more damage you are doing doubled two sets of doubled and i is olated pawns this is a terrible position for black terrible with a capital t so bishop to e6 f5 bishop takes queen takes and i thought well i'm just very happy i mean i've done everything that i wanted now the computer is completely unimpressed as you can see it says minus .04 which just means equal and if anybody's better it's black but my opponent was playing very slowly he was playing so slowly i had 230 he had 51 seconds on the clock and here he tried to fight back against me and i i i thought i came up with a very neat idea which was to just completely neutralize him and do this look at my queen defending everybody you know i'm going to go f6 next so if my opponent plays something like rook c2 i'm going to play f6 i'm going to open up the king and i thought i got good attacking chances again computer not impressed not afraid at all so maybe that wasn't necessarily the right idea but maybe e6 to create a pass pawn very very combative game and now the pawns start falling so i i i get b6 my opponent now should definitely take this but he goes here and then i get that pawn my opponent goes to the second rank and i and i just start defending myself i start trying to trade the pieces because i'm looking to get into a winning endgame i'm trying to get into a winning queen end game and then i make a mistake i make a mistake and i actually i get very upset with myself right here i play h3 and i blunder the fact that after rook takes regardless of how i take back i'm going to lose a pawn so if rook f2 queen f2 this check and i lose that pawn so rather than getting frustrated and then if king f2 there is this but rather than getting frustrated with myself here i actually managed to regain my composure and find a really nice idea also my opponent has 10 seconds right so i found a very nice idea which was this this this and the point is you cannot take this pawn because i realize that i have check here and a winning king and pawn endgame this is such a deep idea which i saw in like 5 seconds i i went full magnus carlson here the point is yes material is equal and like let's say king g6 but the point is black has no moves if black takes me my king gets out and active and i'm disallowing this king to get close my king will then go to that pawn and i will win the game if my opponent does not take my queen and instead plays h5 i will just wait and at some point black will run out of moves if f6 i go here and black just can't do anything we're stuck and at some point black will need to do this my king will go and i will promote so i realized when i when i went here my opponent can take but i'm going to be wi and i i just made my entire objective run forward run forward sack the pawns and just go forward make this really difficult the opponent only has 5 seconds started giving me desperate checks but he accidentally forced my king to a winning situation so now i have two pass pawns and there was not a single check so my opponent panicked in this in this queen end game i ran my king i regain my composure and i managed to actually win this game he tried to trick me with low time and and i won that was a nice you know that was a nice win it was very combative it was very back and forth and it really built my confidence and i managed to beat 220 900 level gms after that so you know not every day vladislav kovalev kovalov he's a a grandmas from bellus very strong player like 2670 i think was his peak and by the way another vienna just like the last game this time bishop c5 you will remember that in this game in the opening my opponent won bishop b4 you you got to know your openings and by the way if you want to learn more about the vienna e4 course all at your boy f4 d6 knight a4 this tricky line where you try to get this bishop opponent played here i took the bishop and now here white can castle white can play c3 white can also take on e5 i decided to castle and just be a little bit solid i was not afraid of this because of rook f2 or rook e1 my opponent also castled and i was like wait a minute but what about the pawn and i thought how exactly is he going to get the pawn back now he started attacking me and i just stayed solid and he just tried to get my pawn back that was the entire game and so here was a big moment what i probably should have done is i should have stayed i i should have went for the knight directly because then i would have had this this this and then here i could play rook f2 and then if he takes my pawn i could maybe play d4 or i could play take take and d4 or f4 this looks quite nice and then i can push him back and then i can play f5 and try to trap his bishop look at him his bishop is locked in a cage right if he play something like rook d8 i'll play b bishop c2 or queen h5 right and so this is probably what i should have done but i i did it this way and and the problem would doing it that way is his knight is going to survive so now i i spent a lot of time here and i played a move that is not the best move position is still equal take take and i said you know what i got to get rid of that i boom boom and i thought okay i'm in an equal end game against the 2900 gm right we have six pawns each seven pawns i can't count seven pawns each queens and rooks he went here i unpinned myself i could have taken on a7 but then he would have played something like c4 okay b4 and then and then f4 right so pushing him out and then you know maybe going to win this or take this or take on a7 and take on c7 and i thought okay i'm going to just going to draw the game because you playing it gm not a bad result queen d6 took on a7 he took on c3 i took on c3 he took on d3 i took on d3 he took on d3 takes takes okay two rooks four pawn two rooks four pawns we are going to trade off these pawns and i thought i am slightly better here because i have a more active rook and then he just very quickly went here and my friends these are typically positions that i lose to grand masters i mean i i just panic i do something stupid i find a way to lose this i'm you know and i thought you why am i why why why king g2 what i don't want to do here is i don't want to end up in a weird situation this blunder check made by the way but let's just say he has a pawn on h6 first let's just you know h6 you you know rook e one something like that you don't want to get like slammed here you know with your king stuck so i thought let me bring my king up because anytime he's going to take this pawn i'm going to take this pawn right so he played g6 and i offered a trade and my idea was take take check here here rook c5 he's going to go for this pawn and i'll play like h3 he'll you know rook c whatever and i'll be fun and then he went here and i got a little spooked but then i found f f which i thought was a nice idea ready to run my king out of the danger of the rooks and then here's something insane happened he gave me a check and i thought okay well he could take or he could take or he could go here and he played rookie two and rook e 2 sets up g5 mate which is a very scary move against the grandmaster you know oh my god the grandmaster is trying to checkmate me whoa and i thought well i can play f6 and then g5 f oh look at me i'm very strong you know and and and i also was thinking e6 i was thinking rook g3 and i was thinking all these things then i went wait always look for checks made in three this was not here during the game and i thought oh my god check check m i didn't even look at how much time it took me to find checkmate 9 seconds i was sitting there looking at the board going wait what about g5 m like what do i do the he blundered mate he just straight up blundered a checkmate in a rook end game and that's what happens when your pawns get so advanced sometimes it just happens you know and and again okay yes was this lucky yes unquestionably but i i'm a firm believer in the fact that you know you earn your luck in chess all right you you earn your luck and in this game it was combative and it was probably supposed to be a draw but sometimes that's what happens normally i am on the receiving end of such a checkmate and then i want to cry but the most impressive game that i played of the tournament by far was this game against serge shalo i beat zagalo once before he's always playing against hikaro he's played hikaro many times i have a record of 4 and eight against him i've won four games i've lost eight games which i will take because he's a very good player and this is probably the best game that i've played in the last month so i played e4 now admittedly if he's actually isn't bellarus he probably played this game at 2 in the morning but aside from that he's a great player i'm very happy to win this game c5 and i played a3 i play a lot of different things a3 is also actually in the e4 course the idea of this was not to promote the e4 course but you know i like to play the a3 sicilian i like to play this wing gambit style and he played d5 he spent 25 seconds on that move maybe he was fixing his wires or he was fixing you know played d5 which is a very decent move and then he played knight f6 which i haven't seen in a long time i mean most people take with the queen and so i thought okay let's just be simple let's not be greedy let's not try to hang on to the pawn because he's probably going to win it back and if he doesn't win it back he's going to you know play in a again way and put his knight here and i'm not better at despite being so you know i thought fine get your pawn back buddy d4 i'm playing d4 because after it takes maybe i'll take with the queen then i'll play bishop b5 then i'll castle maybe i'll take with the knight and i just thought i like this position i'm going to go here in castle and this move it doesn't hurt or benefit my position if anything you could argue it benefits more than hurts because i will expand my pawns right so my pawns will then work together and my second move a3 isn't so stupid after all so from the early opening you know he was developing his pieces and he was actually playing in a very aggressive way he was trying to get me to take his pawn probably against a lower rated player i would take but i have a lot of respect for like 2900 gms which i shouldn't and i just decided i'm going to keep it simple i'm not going to go take that pawn he wants me to take the pawn and then he wants to like try to win the pawn back and then he wants me to play b4 and get all you know and i'm just like do do i trust myself to to keep this i don't know let's just do this and he played e6 now i can't take the pawn for free and then i played c4 and i had a very simple plan here my simple plan was going to be to take this pawn offering a trade of queens which i thought benefited me because i would get the file and then i would expand my pawns and i'm going to expand my pawns no matter what because i need to justify my second move right so the way the pawn structure is changing in this middle game i was like i'm going to expand my queenside pawn so i played b4 he didn't trade with me and i didn't trade with him our queens are having a staring contest i don't want to take him because i don't want his rook there and he doesn't want to take me cuz he doesn't want my rook there and he probably also wants to keep his queen because he wants to win the game when you're trying to play for a win you're not trying to go to an end game which is probably just going to be equal so he played castles and i just finished my development at some point i'm playing h3 i'm thinking where my pieces going to go and then after that where are my pawns going to go do i want to play b5 do i want to play c5 do i want to not touch the pawns because they control four very important squ s right i have a little bit more space so he goes here and this was probably my best moment of the game because what does black want black wants to play rook c8 rook d8 or black wants to play rook d8 and then maybe double and if i play a lazy move he's going to play rook d8 i'm going to have to move my queen and then he's going to play a5 rook c8 he's going to start firing away at my structure here so i thought i thought how do i disrupt jal's development i spent most of my time advantage in played knight b5 i thought this was a very clever move because his options now are to go back here which walks directly into my rooks which is a problem or he has to go to the corner and that's a big loss of time and he can't come forward because if he comes forward he walks directly into c5 which is a big big big mistake cuz now he has to go here and his position has not improved if anything he's allowed in my night way closer than it should be he can't really go back to stop me cuz i'm just going to keep going i'm just going to keep going he's got to go back all the way to b8 now was very unle bishop e5 like no you don't queen d4 is a nice little fork so he went queen b8 and then i thought boom and so now i'm going to put my rooks here and i'm going to bring my knight to d4 and i'm going to play h3 this is my plan so i was very cerebral this game i was playing much better than i normally do against 2900s a6 i brought my knight back to d4 and i took like this he went queen c7 and i thought okay i want this this this just to just to kick out the bishop and also give a little left for my king and then i probably want to put my queen on one of these two squares either b2 to have pressure or e3 to fight for the center and also threaten stuff with my bishop right create a battery and then do and i'm still not touching these pawns because they they don't have to be touched they're in they're in a pretty good comfortable position okay so i played queen e3 now and at the same time i need to monitor my clock which i'm doing a good job of i'm slightly better for this game i haven't given him a chance to create any any count play yet any meaningful counterplay and i'm stopping him from doing his plan if rook c8 i'm probably going to play rook c1 but he can't do this because this i'm just going to win mat cal so he can't do that so what does he do he undevelop his knight to control b6 i'm making things difficult for him i bring one of my rooks he brings his rook and then i finish my setup right i get to that setup that i wanted i have a point4 advantage and a 20 second lead on the clock but this is the part of the game where i always panic this is the part of the game against the grand masters where i always screw something up i have this beautiful thing and i need to put a final couple touches on it and then i screw everything up and they get counterplay and then i tank all my clock time and then i do something desperate in fact i did it immediately i did it right away the best thing in this position the side that has more space in chest wants to avoid exchanges why because if you decide to trade all your pieces look look look if you trade all your pieces rook d8 take take yes in this particular instance there is bishop to f3 and then some endgame stuff but let's just say this is the position there's no advantage it's gone in this is a very rare case white can attack but my my point is white needs more pieces on the board than not white needs to go here and then take with the bishop and then here or threaten m or expand the pawns what you or or you need to play c5 take space away build your brick wall but i'm i'm playing a 2900 so i i go here and and my logic was well he this is his most active piece now he doesn't have any active pieces look at advantage is gone the good thing is despite the advantage being got the position still very solid still white is doing very well right but i don't need to respect his position i need to call the shots and against any 2700 2600 i would play knight to e5 i would say take take you can't go queen c6 because i'm going to go bishop f3 you know then i have to think about some other stuff but that this is what i would be doing instead i play bishop d3 but but at least at least he has no targets and then here i i i play rook d1 and i i thought this was a very nice idea and my idea here was that i'm giving him the again no need for that i should just play c5 and frankly i should have played c5 two moves ago but the idea was if he takes me i'm going to go here which i thought was a position ruiner i thought take rook d7 rook d d7 rook d7 look at this if queen c1 i can take and then take and then king h2 and the computer finds a brilliant defensive move which is this o not that which is this he can sacrifice the rook for defensive measures and bishop d6 jack i did not see that neither did he i thought this was very clever as it turns out that stockfish is a scumbag but he didn't see it and all of a sudden the sky started to illuminate he set a trap this looks like it works it doesn't because he has rook d3 and if i take his queen he can get that or that would check and then my bishop so that doesn't work but i realized wait a minute what if i just play knight e5 and now i have one very powerful idea and i'm up 25 seconds of the clock at this point i'm like am i going to win this game he goes back to b8 and i went rook e one and i set something up which he fell directly into i am setting up the fact that all his pieces are standing around but nobody is protecting the king the king is protecting the house on his own and i have a cannon pointed that way and i'm stable everything is stable and he played b5 with three seconds on the clock and i hit him with knight takes f7 and the point is everything falls apart in the words of lincoln park even the people who never frown eventually break down the sacrifice great song by the way shout out to lincoln park rip chester queen e6 knight h6 all ideas and if you don't take me i don't really know what's going to happen because i'll probably take your rook and play queen e6 so he did take me but inar this but i had one more trick up his sleeve which was this one more trick up his sleeve which is a move that i did not even consider because i thought i would have a checkmate with something i thought i would be able to mate him somehow the point is no matter where he went he was he was busted he went to f8 i would take and then i would just take on f6 frankly i would just play here that's made so he takes and i can win the end game like this you know like this is also a completely winning position but instead of that after king g6 just rook g3 and the point is if he hides well then i would have had a chance to sacrifice the rook queen e7 queen f6 but instead of all of that he sacrificed his queen and took but it was not the bishop that i was after it was this and the point of king g6 is that if this that's a problem and now i am x-rayed skewered not x-rayed skewered and he played king g6 i gave him a check and when the dust settled i grabbed his rook i grabbed his pawn because my queen was hanging and in this position he ran out of time but he only had like one second on the clock so he b basically resigned and i defeated him with an accuracy of like 95% i mean that was a very very very controlled game i played that game from start to finish with solidity with poise i with patience at times i fell very slightly into bad habits such as bishop d3 just like trying to trade off his bishop for some reason but overall if i can play like this i i i can i can beat these grand masters i mean i did not make any blunder i thought i played very well my accuracy was 94% of course i had some mistakes some inaccuracies like in the opening this gives me what shut up but i had this brilliancy which i was very happy with night takes f7 is likely yeah the brilliant move of course i planned that from the beginning and my estimated elo in this game was 3,300 so i played like a 3,300 this game and i finished the tournament with eight points out of 11 three wins versus grand masters a loss i also also lost a couple games to grand masters i lost one game to a grandmaster i lost to alexander indich from serbia but overall eight out of 11 and you know events like this and days like this do make me feel like like i'm not a total bozo i'm not a total bum i know how to play chess and we keep getting better and better we keep beating grand masters and it's quite nice it is quite a nice feeling so let this be as an in let us be an inspiration to those of you who might be in a slump at the moment sometimes it feels like all of my chest is a slump but i wanted to share it with you i hope you enjoyed the games hopefully
