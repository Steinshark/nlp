ladies and gentlemen it's currently august 1st 2023 and a couple of weeks ago chess.com announced the launch of a new chess engine that is supposed to overtake all of the others hopefully i uploaded that video and you all enjoyed it very much i named it 1 million elo chesbot not quite but it defeated a lot of chess bots in its way except for one and that's what i'm going to share with you in today's video this is a matchup of 1 000 speed games played between torch the new chess engine and stockfish the incumbent the champion the best chess engine in the world rapidly approaching 3700 plus and this is a wild video i'm first going to show you some moments where torch succeeded and the last game that i'm going to show you in this video is absolutely going to blow your mind i'm going to show you one of the filthiest ideas i've ever seen in chess and naturally played by two computers we should just sit back relax and enjoy it because this is otherworldly chests that you are about to see of course the computers play like this you ask the computers to play two openings against each other one with white one with black to get to the same position that is how computer chess is played because if it would be played otherwise they would just make a bunch of draws because chess played perfectly is a draw so first game i'm going to show you torch has the white pieces it's a sicilian defense from stockfish it's an open sicilian defense and in this position stockfish plays knight bd7 which is a whatever move but then plays a6 so it basically played a night or of sicilian with asics and then knight bd7 which is a bit of a sideline and torch immediately plays g4 it does not go back to traditional developing principles of moving bishops it pushes g4 right away and its intention to do that is to try to take advantage of the slightly inaccurate development of its opponent so we'd place pawn to g4 and it's ready to go g5 at a moment's notice but it does like this the defendant center and a couple moves later it plays the move g5 in these sicilian structures the most important thing is the d5 square if white can successfully win the battle for the d5 square white will have an outpost there white will put pressure there and there and there and life is going to be good a couple moves later we have pure unleashed sicilian defense the sicilian is very very very much like this opposite side castling black is trying to play b5 a5 rook c8 queen a5 the bishop on e6 goes this way white is trying to go like this and f4 and bishop b2 i mean like you cannot ask for two for a better opening for two bots to play h4 b5 i mean they're just firing away at each other the king slides over which is a very common thing to do when you castle queen side to prepare for the attack knight takes b3 c takes b3 not a takes b3 but c takes b3 because is now the c file is open and you've built up a very powerful cluster of pawns had you taken with the a pawn black would have maybe gotten a 5a4 but this way you've created a very powerful brick wall now knight to g3 some of you may have been wondering about this move or maybe you're not paying attention you're just mesmerized by my voice and yeah this is very much a thing the problem is that now the knight took the bishop but the bishop never got a chance to move in this game and the pawns are simply going to walk up the board a couple moves later h5 by white b4 by black right back in your face the knight goes to d5 and i told you the winner of that square will win the battle for this opening and probably the game queen e6 and the queen just goes back to d3 if you'd like to attack your opponent making a trade like this does not make any sense because you have now lost the battle for that square because you're never going to get there this is under a little bit of fire and the position is just equal so the queen goes back a5 there's h6 okay a very very very long and grinding game rook c8 pawn takes g7 7 and now a4 so stockfish is just throwing it right back in your face it looks like white has absolutely nothing to do over here so white takes tries to fight back the rook goes back to a5 and still pressure is happening on that side of the board we have bishop to d2 putting some pressure on the opponent b4 and in this position black plays rook a8 hitting the a2 pawn a4 if you take on passant i'm going to take your rook so d5 black is exploding the center of the board here comes white's king rook h1 queen to g6 pinning rook h6 pushes the queen back and now the queen slides out of the way black takes in the center white takes in the center and black retreats and from this position torch pulls the brakes on the attack and basically says stockfish survived the attack and definitely fought me on equal grounds but my a pawn is going to be decisive it's going to have this outside pass pawn throughout this end game that is going to restrict the black pieces and slowly it just begins trading it doesn't even mind being down material you cannot actually take this free bishop the threat is rook g2 if you take queen d8 here check and it's made as you can see in two moves because i take the bishop and then i take the queen black's position is just in a bit of a disarray you can play bishop to f4 i'm gonna play bishop c5 threatening checkmate rook c2 and i win these two pawns and now it's just a matter of time and that's exactly what torch does and it really is a matter of time because it takes nearly another 50 moves but slowly slowly slowly we win the pawns i mean there's like some ridiculous tactics here with bishop coming down and trading and you see the pawns survive that's the most important thing and this is just smooth sailing the king joins the party the queen the bishop trying to get a trade centralizing slowly slowly you advance and the king walks all the way to the other side of the board avoiding perpetual check queen e8 queen c6 bishop c5 and the rest of this game is mostly just ceremony and you know just out of respect they play on until a checkmate this was a very very very very fun game i mean it was it was punctuated like you know h5 b4 just both sides throwing these these attacking kit pawns at each other and when it was all said and done it was actually torch beating stockfish by using the counter measure the defensive measure to create a long-term outside pass pawn component to this game this was a nice game from torch and torch had a couple of nice games here's another one that torch played this one was more of like a ready and then it was it was black playing a reverse london which is a thing and this one was again opposite side casting this time white was on the short side and black was on the long side bishop f4 bishop d6 and we had a big exchange in the center bishop for knight and then bishop for knight and you just think about how completely ridiculous computers are like no human being on the planet plays this move it's an insane move to play how could you possibly give up the bishop that you've put in front of your king for what right how is that possible now you just have weak light scores no it doesn't care at all bishop to g5 and the idea is that if the rook moves to e8 let's say now i play this the queen is forced to see eight and white is likely just completely winning because the queen is just jailed i mean there's nothing for the queen to do knight b5 b4 b5 so instead of that black aka stockfish takes in the center and gives up the rook so they get a bishop they get a a bishop and a pawn for a rook with the possibility of attacking h5 h4 when starfish attacks with black it's very fun because it it doesn't think it's any worse now and it just brings the knight back knight takes e4 and a couple moves later it just starts playing h5 and the thing is with white if you acknowledge this like a human being i'll play g5 and if you take i'm not even gonna take back i'm just gonna play h4 and then i'm gonna play f6 and i mean i'm slowly going to absolutely ruin and you're a king i'm going to take and may you somehow on the light squares here so rook to c1 is played instead h4 like stockfish is just going for it with the black pieces sacrificing a little bit of material trying to create this big attack g4 pushing pawns in front of his king now here stockfish finds a crazy idea the bishop is hanging but it just lets it hang h3 you can't actually take of course because queen g5 queen g2 but the insane thing is you actually can queen g5 king f1 rook h4 e4 queen g2 the king actually escapes to e2 and oh that will that would be nice but rook f4 rook f1 and and then there's some ridiculous lines here where white is actually not losing but torch just decides i'm not going to enter into any of that i'm gonna centralize my queen and now we have a very complex transition to an end game but we see towards having very good longevity like doing a very nice job defending its king and torches patient it does not mind it pokes and prods and and improves its position very slowly and then here it finds a a beautiful a beautiful tactic queen d5 which attacks the rook and when the rook moves it sacrifices its queen to split the black pawns win back the queen and it's a very slow process black has two extra pawns but it's a bishop and two pawns for a rook and the rook is just too strong the rook comes in the night reroutes all the way back to b3 c2 and slowly torch is going to make make stockfish work for it there's this there's this there's too many weaknesses and you just cannot can compete against the rook in the end game and all white needs to win this is a pawn that's it and that's exactly what torch survives with it gives a check it plays rook a4 and this is a winning end game as long as it's able to keep its pawn it has an opportunity to win this end game maybe with with a little bit more time on the clock stockfish would have would have found a way to draw it but it's just a matter of time and torch walks in forces the black pieces to the back rank infiltrates and it all comes down to one pawn and knight c7 knight d5 rook h8 and you just cannot defend yourself it swarms in the end game and this one takes over a hundred moves but torch doesn't even promote a queen it just plays knight f5 and rook g7 and it's it's a checkmate a very very fun couple of games where in this one in particular stockfish was the one actually counter-attacking it gave up a rook like this but then a couple moves later it played h5 h4 h3 i mean it was like really really trying to to obliterate torch and make it seem like it doesn't belong well my friends unfortunately unfortunately stockfish still reigns supreme and i am about to show you three of the many games that it won in this match and i will tell you the score line at the end stockfish did unbelievably brilliant things in this match and if you're still watching and you haven't clicked on anything else thank you because i'm about to blow your mind the last game of this video i was watching it and i and i didn't even understand it took me like five attempts so i will try to break this down for you there was a game they played where stockfish was white and black played bishop to g4 g6 and in this position rather than attacking the bishop or finishing your development or anything like that stockfish undevelops its knight and the point is that the bishop on g4 is misplaced and now i'm going to play f3 d5 and i'm gonna have a springboard for my attack e5 d5 knight d4 giving up upon stalkers doesn't care it is more important for stockfish to keep the dark squared bishop because if you take take and then take with the queen it's just opening up black's bishop and in this position stockfish undevelops the other night when i saw this i was like are you kidding me and what does it want it just wants to go c3 it just wants to say the knight got stuck in the in in the territory and now the knight has to go here now i take i told you in the sicilian same exact structure this is not a sicilian defense but in chess pawn structures can overlap in different openings before because we want to win the battle for the d5 square the knight goes back and now here comes our night and that's literally all stockfish needs it just needs a little bit more space and a little bit of a weakness opposite side castling it does not even take the pawn on d6 yet it's gonna wait king b1 a6 and now when b5 comes the bishop on d6 on c6 is hanging knight to d5 rook d8 sacrifices the queen gets it back with the check knight c6 and it actually lost the rook i mean this looks like a beginner's tactic it looks like a beginner got to this position and saw oh i have queen takes bishop oh i'm so smart and then i go here and then oh i hung a rook no this was all planned it literally just lost the rook on purpose so it could attack the rook kick the rook out of the position and not even take here just do this why because stockfish realized that it can lose a rook but the quality of its remaining five pieces is higher than the quality of the remaining black pieces so right now black has two rooks and three pieces white has one rook and four pieces and all white is going to do is use a pawn majority and a bit more space on the side of the board that's it like that is all white is going to use to try to win this game watch a4 knight d5 knight t4 check i'm fine taking now i'm gonna rig my king it's just a maximum utilization of resources bishop d5 b4 rook b1 b5 completely effortless with one tactical combination stockfish completely removed half of the board from mattering look in this position queen c6 97 and the rest of the game occurs on the queen side knight d5 king d3 it's just completely effortless at some point the board is going to open up obviously but look at this i mean it just it it just completely focuses on one side of the board until the position is just simply not defendable anymore now this rook is just stranded on the edge of the board the rook can't come back the rook tried to play defense it ended up getting booted to the edge and now white is just winning white is going to transition into a winning rook end game rook d7 d2 rook f7 check rook d7 back and we stopped the pawn and now we're just gonna promote yeah i mean king d1 but that's it and black tries to fight back but now loses a bishop king d2 and yes they've lost two pawns but white has knight and bishop for a rook which is more than enough to win and why it's just going to be a matter of time bishop c4 king g2 pawn to h4 the king is checked many many times the bishop goes to f7 and and this is all you need you just need one pawn why do you just need one pawn because you need the thread of a promotion and now it's going to be a very long process where white is slowly going to try to advance the pawn and it's night bishop and pawn versus a rook which means that the pawn is going to promote into a queen the rook is going to give itself up for the pawn and white is going to demonstrate how to win with bishop and knight vs king and that is exactly what happens and white slowly marches one pawn forward because that's all white needs gets it and now demonstrates the fastest possible way to checkmate with a bishop and a knight by forcing the king to the same color corner as the bishop which makes it significantly simpler knight c7 knight a6 bishop c6 mate i mean this was so absurd knight to g1 followed by knight to d1 followed by securing control over the light squares and just queen c6 losing the rook which just looks like an elementary mistake with a ridiculous long-term bind of just arrows like the arrows that i've drawn here and it literally knew somehow that despite not having moved two of its pieces its pieces were of a higher quality than the pieces remaining in the black position stockfish is ridiculous and this is not even the last game i told you the last game is going to blow your mind it's not going to disappoint you okay like i'm i'm not just saying that to increase watch time although definitely doesn't hurt this game is spectacular and the last game is just otherworldly i i like i i don't even know d4 g6 e4 bishop g7 knight c3 pawn c6 knight f3 on d5 typical stuff easy stuff this is the robots defense modern however you want to describe it bishop f4 take take and from an early position white is obviously doing pretty well like plays here knights are traded c5 takes takes and black is castled six pawns each life is good but life is not all that good because white has a massive lead in development and white is stockfish and it's just so fun to see how the smallest of advantages is exploitable this stockfish thinks that this position is 0.29 giga stockfish is it pushes the queen out of the way kind of goes here to instigate rook here rookie one take take the queen drops back now we play knight g5 to create a threat create a threat create an imbalance it wants to get the bishop for the knight or it wants to tie black down f4 now you take now i take now i have two bishops the pressure paid off i got the dark squad bishop versus your bishop knight now push your bishop back now create an attack on your king even though moves like queen to g3 are possible a queen trade benefits white because it's black who has the problem right the activity favors white queen e3 rook f1 queen f2 pawn c3 just preventing the black knight from getting close bishop to e6 if you take i take that's mate your rook is hanging it's game over so you have to play rook to d8 now i play before you still can't take my bishop you go here now i slide back to my square you try to attack my pawn on c3 i take and i play bishop f4 and all stockfish needs is the tiniest bit of imbalance it's slowly methodically expands it has now created weaknesses long term targets that it is going to exploit that is all it needs h4 knight e5 knight g6 rook to d2 take take all it needs now slowly it's going to maneuver its king to the defense of the pawns and also the defense of the king bishop d4 it's even the material is still equal it doesn't matter there we go the pawns have been targeted it's going to win the pawn on a6 probably the king is now gonna have to dance its way out of checks otherwise black is trying to make a draw okay no draw no draw high and now we've won a pawn the pressure paid off we went upon now we start to dance the other way queen e5 now it's a queen ambition versus queen and night end game and black is stuck playing passive defense white guards everything making sure to get the king out of checks it takes a while all right we're getting checked we're moving our queen around king d3 king d2 a lot of checks we've got to protect our king we're slowly reaching 100 moves but white's pressure is going to pay off bishop f6 queen e4 and now white breaks and there you go bishop c3 the king has to hide again we're gonna win that pawn or we're gonna play b5 we've won the pawn 105 moves sometimes that's what it takes in bot games and now stockfish slow methodical calculated up two pawns in an end game up two pawns in a queen end game very easy now brings the king all the way up the pawns are going you could try to make a draw but at some point i'm gonna force a queen trade and this one takes 142 moves but the game ends with a ladder promotion very very very easy and balance like very easy to understand two bishops versus bishop knight but it just the the simplicity of which it all occurs is is amazing now the last game i told you about the last game this was this was something pawn to e4 onto e6 starfish with white torch with black french defense d4 d5 knight c3 this is called the win hour it's a very sharp it's a very complicated type of system e5 c5 a3 and black locks down the queen side a4 you cannot actually take this because it looks very good but i'll go bishop d2 and you really don't want to get involved in these positions i mean the pawn is one for black but black has absolutely no development so black plays bishop d7 instead the size make a little bit of pawn advancement over here and now black begins to play f6 and try to escape the pressure now you don't have to be a rocket scientist like to figure out that white is probably going to attack over here and maybe on this diagonal as well but it's a very close position for now knight h6 knight f7 torch reroutes and puts pressure on the pawn on e5 from c6 and f7 trying to capture take and live a happy life now it shuts down the center plays f5 and it says you're not going to open up the center anymore now i'm going to try to play g5 with my rook and i'm going to create some problems for you that's a very tough position for white because white is stuck defending this defending against g5 if white's play something like you know bishop b2 rook g8 queen e2 black is going to go g5 and get a borderline winning attack i mean pawn takes knight takes very dangerous stuff h4 very unpleasant queen d8 queen here later queen g8 so white plays rugby one and attacks the queen and one move later with the rook hanging doesn't go back but plays rook c5 but that doesn't make any sense because now the rook is trapped and in this position stockfish loses its only other active piece take take and seemingly has nothing to do the pawn is not gonna scare anybody the rook has no escape this rook is biting into granite this bishop has absolutely no role in this game because it's a light square bishop and all the pawns are on light squares white is not in any business to go over here i told you i saved the best for last in this position stockfish plays an obscene idea it plays and it sacrifices the rook what for a pawn like there is no clear reason it did that if i asked you what changed in the position you would say it opened the bishop so what okay now black is completely winning what have you accomplished rook c4 is disgusting the point is you go here you say okay and that attacks the queen i just go queen d8 not so fast i play queen c1 queen b2 and it's actually very hard to defend against checkmate you just don't you just don't have the capability you can play knight a7 that's checkmate in one it stops checkmate in three it allows checkmate in one so okay but what about queen a5 the point is you sacrificed the rook to open the bishop but because black's position is so congested bishop d6 queen a5 i still play queen c1 a retreating queen move slowly trying to go here and there is no defense for that you say of course there is what are you talking about just go just go here anyway because after queen b2 you play pawn to b6 and white is not going to trade queens with you because you're down a rook you're right there was another idea the idea of rook takes c4 played on move 23 was to lose the rook to open the bishop reroute the queen backwards and if black stop-mate with pawn to b6 to play rook a1 because that defends this and the queen is trapped you are threatening bishop to b4 and the queen is sealed in and if the queen now tries to break out with something like b5 it's an avalanche i mean it's just an avalanche in here you can take i can take i will play rook a8 i'll get my rook back i'll have interest it's going to be a very bad position a1 and the queen is trapped with bishop to b4 that is why on move 23 you needed to lose your rook for literally just one pawn to attack the queen and to bring your queen all the way back to team up with the rook i mean this is some sickening stuff and i got news for you after rook c4 dc4 bishop d6 all of this happened black went here rook b2 was played what does this move even do simple you don't want to play queen b2 anymore because you don't want to trade queens so you play rook b2 you have time to play queen c1 rook b2 and queen b1 to avoid a queen trade so your rook leads the charge and there is nothing black can do literally nothing black can play g5 or something queen to b1 b5 and the queen is trapped what so black plays knight d8 queen b1 and tries to save the queen but now rook b7 we sack another rook we sack another rook you can't take it because queen b7 is just simply it it means just game over in a couple of moves knight to b7 queen b7 it's actually a checkmate in 11 which obviously you see queen b8 bishop here bishop here to cut the king's escape something like rookie 8 queen a7 with various made threads like bishop c5 and queen g7 as well very very bad so bishop b5 is played rook a7 the attack continues and at some point white is going to cash in here and here white plays queen c1 to go back to g5 to go back to g5 and the rook is just left hanging because queen g7 is so devastating rook a queen g7 we take we are still completely down a rook we never got the rook back but it doesn't matter because we take we don't trade queens and now we just push upon black is in dire straits none of their pieces are participating in this game they are standing around waiting to be brutalized e7 bishop h3 bishop f5 bishop e6 and black just runs out of moves now comes the process of getting all my material back and white emerges up four pawns white was down a full rook and now is up four pawns and obviously is winning you can trade the queens here and it's just smooth sailing three pawns cannot be stopped by a bishop four pawns cannot be stopped by a bishop one of them is gonna get through and they play till mate again and the final score of a 1000 game speed match between stockfish and torch was 640 for stockfish and 360 for torch and i don't think torch one any of the pairs meaning if you and i played an opening against each other and you beat me when you had white but then i beat you when i had white in the same opening that would be us splitting a pair if you won and i did and i drew then it would be you winning the pair torch is not i don't think it won a single pair and i might have miscounted but it lost by a lot so it's not quite there yet stockfish is still the king but we'll keep an eye on torch and we will we will hope that one day it can stand up to stockfish hope this was fun this game absolutely blew my mind some of the others did as well and i wanted to share them with all of you i'm gonna get back to vacation get out of here
