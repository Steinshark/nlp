streaming video is getting pretty pricey excluding free trials teaser rates and ad supported viewing paramount plus peacock and prime video are 12 bucks disney plus is 14 netflix is ,550 and hulu is' bucks every month that doesn't sound like much if you're only using one service but according to public polling most of you have around three streaming subscriptions 2.8 to be exact if you're in the very reasonable position of wanting to watch the handmaid's tale star trek discovery and reacher assuming you're not sailing the open seas r80 you're looking at a monthly bill of $42 but not to worry because streaming services have the answer bundles amazon bundles prime video with its amazon prime membership which obviously includes free expedited shipping hbo max is now available through youtube as one of its premium channels and in canada telis is offering a phone plan that comes with netflix disney plus and prime video for an additional wait a second hold on this is just cable this is exactly what happened with cable what okay let me explain when netflix became the first paid ondemand video streaming service in 2007 the market for at home films and tv series was fundamentally different the typical cable customer was paying at least 60 bucks a month for 118 channels only 133% of which they even watched not only that but it was getting more and more expensive between 1996 and 2008 the price of cable in the us rose at roughly double the rate of inflation and if you wanted to watch an older show your options were to hope for a rerun or wait for a physical release that might never come now cable is expensive for a few reasons including infrastructure maintenance and lack of competition among cable companies but another contributing factor is upstream consolidation in the 1990s the number of cable channels ballooned and large content providers like disney nbc and viacom bought up and merged with competitors cable bundles began in part as a way to simplify sale and distribution of large numbers of channels selling channels individually would have been prohibitively expensive and a logistical nightmare due to ca's technological limitations not only that but bundles also had the advantage of increasing the perceived value of the deal in the eyes of customers it's like a fast food restaurant that only sells combo meals instead of single items separately that $8 burger $4 fries and $2 soda would cost $14 but together there may be only like 12 bucks that might be a good deal from your perspective but it's also a good deal for the restaurant because it means that you have to buy all three instead of just the burger but once the market consolidated into an oligopoly those few major content providers had the power to push cable distributors to carry their rapidly growing stable of low and mid-quality channels alongside their class a certified bangers that consolidation also removed consumer's ability to shop around for a cheaper deal thus our burger combo gets more and more questionable sides until the meal deal costs over $50 even though you still only want to eat $12 of it part of netflix's ability to disrupt that calcified market was technological it could provide users with a large library of on demand titles without having to worry about recording inconveniently timed broadcasts or paying steep late fees on forgotten dvd rentals but another major factor was simply the price in 2008 an unlimited monthly subscription to netflix cost only $9 less than renting three recent releases from blockbuster at the time netflix didn't have everything on its platform but streaming was simple convenient and relatively cheap so why didn't it stay that way we'll tell you after we thank today's sponsor paperlike paperlike 2.1 helps you write

purchase from paperlike you'll receive the digital pro planner for free make sure to check out paperlike at the link below the problem with netflix's business model was that much like cable once it was obvious how profitable it was going to be everyone wanted in on it and nobody was willing to keep selling their streaming rights for bargain basement prices as rival streaming services proliferated they competed for and bid up the price of popular content which was still mostly coming from the same heavily consolidated market that pushed up the cost of cable in fact those same content providers were often the best positioned to launch their own rival streaming platforms paramount global nay viacom has paramount plus nbc has peacock warner bros has hbo max and discovery and disney owns disney plus hulu and espn plus these companies then make the obvious choice of treating their own content as exclusives in a crowded field of competitors it becomes more more and more difficult to stand out early services like netflix and hulu can no longer compete based on technological superiority so instead they need to differentiate in terms of programming streaming services without their own production arm start spending the bulk of their money on licensing a few hot properties while the rest of their libraries slowly dwindle in 2014 netflix us had over 6,000 streaming titles they now have fewer than 4,000 plus a lot of cheaply licensed shows on these services are clearly just there to give the illusion of bountiful options not because they're a real draw to viewers who netflix has romancing the stone subscribe that might not be cheaply licensed i don't know it becomes difficult if not impossible for the average viewer to find a single service that offers all or even most of their favorite shows one show might even wind up with several seasons split across two services how this happens is that one service will pick up the first few seasons of a show on an exclusive contract in order to test how it performs if it does poorly they won't license the later seasons then maybe another service picks up the rest and the show gets popular this drives traffic over to the first site which might decide to renew their existing license locking the absurd split in place for the next several years i just want to watch the show i just want to watch it but in order to compete with other companies on exclusives streaming services create their own in-house production studios and and while it's relatively cheap to simply license and stream already popular content original content comes with a fair amount of both overhead and risk this is a big part of the incentive behind netflix cancelling so many promising shows after a single season before they really have time to find their audience these shows are so expensive that if they don't succeed immediately at pulling in new viewers the company just bails we know it had an amazing cliffhanger but daddy needs a yacht though to be clear this is not the primary reason why netflix now costs ,550 a significant proportion of the increase can be chocked up to simple inflation assuming an average rate of 2.43% inflation between when netflix launched at $9 a month in 2007 and now in early 2024 that $9 equals around $13.33 in real terms leaving us with an actual increase of only $217 that's not bad at all what are we complaining about higher licensing costs and higher overhead may it harder to compete on price but there's no point in being cheap if it means you won't have anything left to draw in customers worse there's essentially a finite number of potential customers willing to pay for any streaming service never mind yours specifically the average person in the us is already subscribed to multiple services and around half of us are paying for at least one we don't regularly use as the content becomes more fractured so does its audience as the audience becomes more fractured the margin on these expensive exclusives becomes narrower and narrower as each subscriber supports a proportionally larger fraction of the production costs now if you as a company can't cut costs you can still increase the perceived value of your product you can still bundle you can bundle together multiple streaming services you can bundle with your own parent company's other products you can bundle with other unrelated services you can even bundle with cable what you can like hbo max bundle with youtube to at least at least decrease the slight friction that comes with switching over to a different app at least then even if every individual service is given at a discount the customer pays more overall this expensive bulcan ised system has perhaps understandably pushed more and more viewers towards piracy which is why the current fight between streaming services and cable is over time sensitive content like live events especially sports passionate sports fans who want to watch their team's games in real time not only need to have cable but usually at least two or three different streaming subscriptions for example nfl games are typically streamed live on paramount plus which carries local cbs stations however in the fall of 2022 two games for the tennessee titans were exclusive to prime video outside the nashville broadcasting area not only that but the titans september match against the buffalo bills was only available on monday night football which is exclusive to espn now i'm just going to come home from work and be mad still tackle somebody this clearly isn't the best possible deal for viewers but it's the natural extension of a clear set of incentives cord cutting can't be cheap for the same reason that cable couldn't be cheap because the shows you want to watch are expensive to produce and the heavily consolidated industry that makes them wants you to pay for the whole bundle but we're not going to make you pay to bundle this video with another one from tech wi hey check check them all out after you like the video if you liked it dislike it if you disliked it check out our other videos i already said that comment below with video suggestions
