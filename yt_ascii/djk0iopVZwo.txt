just like anything there are a lot of 
skeptics when something new comes out   especially when it comes to technology and 
of course that's no different with blockchain   i think one of the biggest things we will see over 
the years to come is really the people who decided   to adapt and embrace technology like blockchain 
early on and how that affects their careers   and income in the future to come now i'm a 
numbers girl so let's break this down by what   it's valued at right now the global blockchain 
technology market size is currently valued at 5.9   billion dollars okay so yes that's a lot but 
where the numbers get really staggering listen   to this it is expected to grow at a compound 
annual growth rate of 85.9 from 2022 to 2030.   so i'm not someone who gambles or bets but if 
i was it would be on blockchain and also having   a career in that industry hey friends today 
we are going to be talking about some of the   top jobs in blockchain what you can do 
how you can get them and so much more   before we get into it though i want to 
introduce you to a platform which i have   been recently loving newton is canada's number 
one low-cost cryptocurrency trading platform   with high liquidity low spreads and over 70 
cryptocurrencies to choose from one of the   things that really stood out to me about newton 
is just how transparent they are with their prices   if you are in the cryptocurrency world you 
know sometimes on platforms they can really   not be very transparent when it comes to 
pricing newton doesn't charge funding or   withdrawal fees so you can really fund and 
withdraw from your account for free also i   think it's really important to note because 
even for myself before i got into the world   of cryptocurrency or blockchain i thought that 
i would have to be an expert in it in order to   get involved or i would need to know absolutely 
everything but you really don't and i think that's   something that newton does a really great job of 
is making it easy for entry for anyone easy for   entry yeah easy for entry meaning anyone can get 
on the platform it's easy to understand and you   don't need to be a crypto worth to get on the 
platform and with newton you can buy and sell   on any platform from ios android your computer 
mac and have access to some of the best prices   for cryptocurrency in canada i've linked my 
newton referral code down below so make sure   to click on it go check it out and when you 
place your first 100 trade you'll get a 25   referral bonus credited to your account play 
around with it i have been absolutely loving it   i actually have some other widgets on my phone 
so i can keep track of different coin pricing and   where it's at and it's just been really 
helpful so make sure to go check it out okay you know number one on the list has to be 
blockchain developer because i'm a developer and i   feel like you know we've got to pump us developers 
up and make it number one blockchain developer is   coming in at number one for some of the most 
in-demand jobs in blockchain and no when i   say number one i'm not referring to it's the other 
ones are lesser in demand i'm just listing off the   top jobs in blockchain and i really wanted to 
talk about blockchain developer first because of   it's definitely an area i've been interested in 
and started to explore i just think blockchain   is such an interesting world and it's it's 
not going anywhere let's just put it that   way so essentially blockchain developers 
are people who create applications for   blockchain some of the experience can include 
c plus python javascript and you don't need   to have specific blockchain developer experience 
to get into a blockchain developer role but having   programming experience is really important 
and then from there you can pick up solidity   and other pieces of blockchain development okay i 
have my computer here with me and i have on screen   at web3 career which has some amazing career 
jobs for a web 3 role so i'm going to search up   on this website to make it consistent the salary 
ranges for different jobs in blockchain and web3   so let's see what we have here the average 
yearly salary for a blockchain developer is   let's see where is it okay there's different 
price there's different salaries for different   companies but on average i would say it's about 1   120 to 130 u.s some are lower some are 
significantly higher so it really varies   based on company and experience but i will link 
web3 career down below so you can check it out as   well it's a resource that i've been really 
enjoying do you look at different salaries   and look at different job postings and they do a 
really good job with that okay coming in at number   two is blockchain architect and i realized as i'm 
going through this list it's going to be a lot of   traditional when i say traditional i mean jobs 
in the tech industry but we're just adding   blockchain on top of that so i understand that any 
job can be done in web 3 as well but it's focused   more on blockchain or web 3 technologies and 
that's really important to note too i think before   we continue on with this list because no matter 
what skills you have or what career path you have   there is a place for you not only in tech but 
also in web 3. and web3 is so it's still such a   infant infant yeah it's an infant it's a baby 
to some degree to some people it's you know   it's fully grown but to i would say the general 
population there's still a long way to go with it   and it's one of those things that i don't think 
people realize that there is a place for them   the more diversity in every aspect we have 
in web 3 better and i just really wanted to   highlight that because i think people think they 
need to have a 10 years experience or something   crazy to get into this no you can use the skills 
you have and just show an interest that you want   to learn and want to break into it more going 
back to number two which is blockchain architect   they are responsible for managing designing 
connecting and really organizing different parts   of the blockchain system this is a role i think is 
really interesting because you have to have a very   strong understanding about the blockchain about 
the blockchain system about the technologies you   are working with and it's a really interesting 
role because it's one that you need technical   expertise in but also expertise in blockchain so 
unlike you know blockchain developer where you can   land that role and then learn about blockchain 
as you go i think with a blockchain architect   you really need to have a strong understanding 
about blockchain before you can get to that step   the good thing is though usually not always but 
usually architects start out as software engineers   or software developers and then the next step is 
architect now on web3 careers they do not have   they do not have a architect let's see i don't 
architecture maybe they do oh there we go   okay architect senior architect is 
200 000 then we have one for 190. these are all senior architects as well keep in 
mind so solution architect 130 so you can see it   ranges a little bit here by the way these are all 
in usd and they list their prices right on here   they're the salary right on here which 
is really nice so that is the second   one blockchain architect okay let's go 
to number three okay so coming in at   number three is something i think is really 
interesting and i think it's just going to   spiral into mad rocket and demand if you will 
which is a blockchain legal consultant and of   course there are so many with new technologies 
different legalities that come into play different   questions companies have kind of a gray area that 
needs to be resolved and having a legal consultant   is essential so while this is a non-technical 
role i really wanted to highlight it because   we'll see more and more of these everyday roles 
even with outside of tech keeping on coming in   to the blockchain in web3 world okay and for 
this one the legal consultant was not on web3   careers so i went on glassdoor i think this is 
significantly lower than what it actually would   be but on glassdoor it says the average salary 
is 90 000 per year now i really think this is   not accurate i think it'd be much higher but 
this is what i'm going based on is glassdoor   okay i think at the end of the day we're we're 
seeing a pattern here really any role can be   implemented into blockchain so i think what you 
need to focus on rather than wondering can i break   into web3 can i like it break into blockchain the 
question is of course you can but you need to do   your knowledge or your training before you start 
applying to jobs in this industry so i'm going   to share with you now some top blockchain courses 
that you can explore some that are technical some   that are non-technical to have an understanding 
of blockchain before you start applying to these   roles okay i have my computer here and some 
courses up on screen so one of the ones that i've   heard a ton about and i actually started taking 
because i was really curious and kept on hearing   so much about it is the coursera course blockchain 
foundations and use cases and this is a course   that both developers and non-developers can 
take and it really talks about the foundational   aspects of blockchain what it is and really how 
to get started in it in a very friendly and   non what is the word it's not intimidating it's 
just very like easy to understand and anyone can   take the course another course that i have heard 
a lot of good things about is actually on udemy   which is more technical so it's called python and 
the blockchain technology and so of course this is   more for people who are looking for the technical 
career path and blockchain developers specifically   and i really like that it's done with python as 
well because python is so user friendly to   start coding with and even if you are either an 
experienced developer or a more junior developer   this is a course you can take the last one i want 
to highlight is from berkeley and i think it's   just a great course i mean it's a great course 
overall but i think what makes it stand out too   is the fact that you can put on your resume you 
took a course at berkeley and that definitely   does not hurt so berkeley has a course for 
blockchain fundamentals and it's a certificate   which is really huge too and it's hosted on 
edx so some topics that are covered include   bitcoin cryptocurrency blockchain technology 
architecture and so much more so i think this   is really interesting course as well and this is 
a course that you don't have to have any technical   experience to sign up for whether you are a 
technical person or non-technical person this is   a course that will do you really well okay i hope 
you enjoyed this video it was really fun getting   to have a candid really candid conversation 
about blockchain blockchain jobs courses to   take around it and just really how to enter the 
world of blockchain from a career perspective   i'm really curious to know are you interested 
in careers in blockchain have you already   gotten into one let me know down in the comments 
and i will see you all soon thanks everyone you
