[music] hey what's up guys mkbhd here welcome back to dope tech i'm your host marquez brownlee dope tech videos used to have a theme yes does this video have any sort of theme at all absolutely not this is three completely unrelated items they have nothing to do with each other and i'm going to take that as sort of a challenge to make the best segues between each of them like a linus inspired game of high-tech chain reaction so let's begin okay so i tweeted a picture of these not too long ago and a lot of you had questions understandably what is going on with these hilariously huge airpods so these are the three x pods and i don't know why they call them 3x because they're clearly a lot bigger than three times the size of airpods but they are bluetooth speakers modeled after airpods pro there are the size of a camera and a lens maybe or like a really big coffee mug the point is they're hilariously big and weirdly enough even though they definitely don't go in your ears even if you are shack's size they still have rubber tips so that if you wanted to if you wanted to put them in an elephant's ears or something they would have a somewhat comfortable fit i guess so a couple things you may be wondering about them one yes there is a black and a white version they do pair quickly and easily via bluetooth and on that stem you can see there's a couple controls a power switch some playback controls a microphone and sadly a micro usb charging port and you can also play music from these from built-in fm radio a usb flash drive or a tf card yeah i have to look that up too it's a called a trans flash card which is basically the same thing as microsd and they sound like you're not buying these for how they sound come on these if you are wondering they sound pretty bad actually they have very very little bass they don't get very loud maybe they are kind of sounding like giant airpods there are other speakers of this size that cost around the same amount that get twice as loud and sound much better you're not getting these for the sound but really this is much more about the novelty factor i mean look at them how is this not an amazing conversation starter just sitting on a shelf in your living room you pick these up they're super lightweight and then just the fact that they actually function as speakers and all the sound comes from where you'd expect them to is pretty sweet now i just want you to know before you go out and buy these they are 40 bucks right now on their site so i guess i should expect this but they are super cheaply built and you can feel it immediately you can tell it says on their site that they are 3d printed but i don't really know if i believe that there are seams all over the thing there are screws the grilles that match the metal on the airpods are just stickers but even if they are 3d printed it doesn't seem to help the actual build quality so don't buy these for the build quality don't buy these for the sound quality buy these for the immense flex that not only do you have airpods pro but now you also have the gigantic 50 times size airpods pros they actually function which is wild although minus the noise cancellation actually what's funny is when they ship these you get a black and white but they're both left airpods but what they should have done what they should do is give you one right one left and then have them pair up in stereo mode and let you really get into it but maybe they'll save that for the second gen version speaking of the second gen version this is the second gen asus zephyrus duo okay so you might remember we already had a dual screen asus laptop in a dope tech video less than a year ago that was the first gen one and i think we can agree the main complaint about that first version was that screen up against the keyboard was kind of hard to see it was a little off axis and that's hard for any display and then light would reflect off of it and you know it was a matte finish and everything but that was the problem with it so boom problem solved so this is basically a sequel and you can see they've built this actually pretty simple hinge that every time you open the laptop the second screen also rises up out of the laptop and tilts towards you a bit for improved visibility and it works and it's a sturdy hinge too so since it's still a 4k touch screen still has a matte finish it just is that much more likely that you'll actually use it now that you can actually see it more and you don't have to strain your neck to look down at that screen so it's smart design and it also has now this bonus of a little bit of air can flow through the back there for cooling which is nice and there's also the speakers down there and then yeah all the same stuff that i said about that first one about how awesome it is to have a dual screen computer that of course applies to this one again too it's like the touch bar on steroids all the multitasking capabilities but also keep in mind there are still all the weird quirks that come from this unconventional form factor too like the fact that there's no palm rest built into the laptop from the keyboard being pushed so far down like the tiny mouse pad if you actually use it without a mouse now the power plug is also kind of in a weird place in the middle of the left hand side which i thought was curious and the battery life also still takes a hit since obviously you're powering two 4k screens now instead of one it is a 90 watt hour battery but you'll notice the battery depleting much more quickly if you have brightness up on both screens like i usually do but hey i'm happy to see asus really doubling down on this concept that was already pretty sweet in the first version and really working to improve it and this new laptop also has great specs it's an unlocked 8-core cpu it has an rtx 2080 super max q 32 gigs of ram solid-state storage it's definitely a capable machine and they're not shy about what it is capable of but i think the coolest part is that asus is listening and is making stuff like this and i think possibly the most telling part about how they expect you to use this laptop is in the ports layout so like i said power plug is on the left hand side that's along with the mic and headphone jacks two full-size usb and one usb type-c on the right-hand side and then in the middle of the back there's usb ethernet and hdmi which is pretty perfect if you're going to use it as a desktop replacement that's the type of stuff you'd run down the back your desk while attaching the whole thing to a monitor which boom brings us to our third and final item that was smooth this is the samsung odyssey g9 49-inch ultra wide gaming monitor this thing is ridiculous in so many ways so everything about this monitor is to the limits okay first of all it comes in this box this insane box and then it's a 49-inch diagonal monitor so biggest monitor i've ever used and then it's at a 5120 by 1440 resolution so 5k wide which doesn't make it the first monitor of that resolution but i do believe this is the first one we've seen at a 240hz refresh rate with hdr 1000 certification thanks to qled so it gets crazy bright if you need it to it has a one millisecond response time it supports nvidia g-sync over displayport 1.4 and it's curved massively curved so curved monitors there's different levels of the amount of curve you can have this monitor is what's called a 1000 radius curve which just means basically if you put these monitors into a circle until they all connected the radius of that circle would be a thousand centimeters which without any context doesn't really mean anything but what they're trying to tell you with that number is it is very very curved around that center point and so it sticks out a lot from the base as a result apparently the curve matches the human eye the bottom line is the experience you get sitting in front of this thing right in the middle right up close using it and especially gaming on it is one of maximum immersion i've never had a monitor get into my peripheral so much and then it checks most of the rest of the other boxes from a high-end monitor there's two display port one hdmi and a usb hub and audio jack around the back there displayport is definitely the best way to get the most out of this monitor i also kind of wish there was usb type-c samsung as long as we're trying to check all the boxes but it doesn't have that and then also around the glossy white back you can turn on the rgb lights in the middle and this thing glows it's pretty sick it's it's kind of like this infinity void even though you never have to really look at the back of your monitor at least you know it's there and hey maybe you get a little spill over onto the wall behind it but what's actually nice about this back besides the cable management is this headphone holder because even though it is kind of hard to reach behind a huge monitor like this it's nice that they thought about that and put something back there because when you have this monitor on your desk it's really hard to have anything else on your desk so that is the price you pay for this huge vast expanse of a screen but hey a lot of people looking at this right now are thinking you know what that's worth it i want this so if you are one of those people who literally wants to buy this along with anything else mentioned in this dope tech below the like button i'll leave all the links to everything this you'll find is 700 bucks which is definitely expensive for a monitor costs more than the equivalent of like buying two separate 27 inch 240 hertz monitors but i mean the bad ass factor of having it all in one unit the lack of a bezel in the middle the hdr certification the q led the image ah the curve it's kind of hard to to match this now for me personally like i've gamed on this a bit i'm i've never been a huge ultra wide person i need the vertical pixels when most of the work i'm doing requires vertical scrolling so ultra wides are ultra wide they've never really been very tall so 1440p not enough pixels vertically for me but for gaming i mean this thing is incredible and that's why it's dope tech so that is the samsung odyssey g9 this has been dope tech i hope the segways were up to par for at least what i set the expectations to be at the beginning of this video thanks for watching catch you guys the next one peace
