okay so welcome one and all i'm mercury black the lunatik co-host of sorting myself out i'm joined today by andrea lewis from the youtube channel andrea with the bangs and she's agreed to assist me with my interrogation of john and pasha now this usually goes best when you start with the good cop so i'm gonna hand this over to you andrea the minute you're not cooperating jonathan i'm stepping in so i all right andrew we should have come up with a secret signal but okay so hello jonathan paige oh it's good to meet everybody yes i am very excited to be in this little cohort it's my first little team up with another channel so i am glad it's that is here and guys now so okay mercury mercury and i were speaking yesterday and we got this idea of like you know because symbolism the king's court and the sub is their subject but we rather than the king like we're tired of hearing about him we're at least at least in this impure purposes of this this chat so we're i'm thinking about like the queen and then for mercury's sake i wish it was you saying this but i am saying the the jester slash fool so i i am representing well mercury's got his misfits shirt on so it's perfect i'm the queen but no but i i definitely in this space represent the feminine anyway but i would like to hear about it from you because okay i've i've heard a lot from say initially jordan peterson and then from you and even when we talk about the the margins it's we hear about monsters who are some female but mostly male and i'm i'm really interested in like the feminine in in the different walks of life so i'm gonna borrow from game of thrones slash ancient greece so we have the maiden slash the virgin the mother and then the crone aka the three feets so i'm that i'm kind of balling it i'm gonna volume you forgot the amazon the amazon is important oh okay oh oh right she's da hey okay so there are women especially for today today the amazon is all important because that's pretty much the only character left pretty much well then take it away should we start there should we start with it not a good idea to start with the amazon you finish let's start with the first walks of life let's start with the the maiden that is that okay well i mean maybe we can talk about i mean maybe we could talk about feminine feminine characteristics the first thing that's important to understand is that we have to be careful when we talk about these categories that we don't we don't flatten the category with people and that's really that's sometimes a dangerous thing where we are all people right so you're a person you're not you are a woman you are feminine but you're not only that and it's the same for me so we symbolism is fractal so every aspect of reality has both a masculine ants and feminine aspect let's say right so each person also but in a social system then certain people are male and then certain people are female and then the males will have a more masculine role and the females will have a more feminine role it's a but it's really important to be careful not to because sometimes it can avoid it sometimes becoming personal where people want it to be personal you know it's like well i don't i'm not like that or i don't feel this or whatever so we all exist on scales of these things like nobody is only one aspect you know as a person that's what important to talk about to say first of all a second of all so the notion of the feminine is really the idea that you could the first way to talk about it would be to talk about the idea of space right the idea of space and an actor in space and so the feminine is space and so that means that when the feminine is represented as the maiden then she becomes the space that will motivate the action of the hero right so she becomes the she becomes the reason for the hero to to advance and to make himself better okay in that sense and well the idea of the virgin first of all is also the notion of pure potentiality so untouched space you would say right undefiled ah run into pure nature all this kind of imagery is totally like that's idea of a mother nature for example is not it's not at all arbitrary it makes complete sense that you have the this kind of virgin natural world which is untouched or unmodified not modified something like that and so the maiden can have that role as well and so it appears to the hero as something extremely desirable because it's something that you want to concur in a way i mean it's it's kind of this kind of it can sound bad when you say it that way but it's the idea of when you have the idea of conquering a lady conquering your heart is better way to say it you say conquering your heart it sounds better but the idea is is that you have this you want to join yourself with this pure potential and and then then the virgin becomes the mother then the relationship between the virgin and the mother then there's a transformation where then the space the the space of desire for action so let's say the hero has this desire he see something which entices him to want to act then then when the union happens and it becomes this face for the home so the house the home the womb all this imagery of space in order for the child to grow within within the space and so that's usually mostly most feminine symbolism will manifest in that in that role let's say but the thing that complicated about feminine symbolism is that especially when you think about a queen for example is that this happens at every level of reality so we have this idea of a coupling that happens at every level of reality and so there so people will think oh man above woman below you know like you see this i have an in earth's type of thing so that you can see that there's a hierarchical relationship and it's presented that way in the bible and didn't a lot of traditional stories but that it happens because it happens at every level it also means that at the level of kingship there's a coupling right and then at the level of society there are couplings and then at the level of your family there's a coupling then in your own soul like in your own self there's a coupling right so it just it just kind of fractally fits itself into each other and so so that's why you can have a king and a queen and the king is above you and the queen is above you as well just like when you're a child your mother is above you right your mother is not the same the relationship you have you're with your mother is not the same that will happen that will be with your wife it's a very it's a different relationship right there's a relationship of seeing the feminine the heavenly feminine you could call it something like that and then the earthly feminine or some some there's different ways to say but that's a good way to pronounce it and then there are figures that join it all together realize there's one figure the mother of god mary she joins all the images together so she's wife she's virgin she's mother she's she's she's all duh she's all the images of the feminine kind of boiled into one and so she's both the earth in the sense of the make the matrix of reality but she's also the heavenly queen and she's the she's the virgin but she's also the the queen in the sense that she's actually crowned and joined with her with her son which looks like a in sexual thing but in terms of symbolism in terms of ultimate symbolism it makes sense if you try to bring to bring the image of the feminine to one figure it all has to kind of boil into this one thing so that's the basic idea of the famine adam that makes sense sometimes i feel like it does sin i like that you gave the little like warning like you oh i know that some people want to think of it from a personal perspective and and so we have to understand that there are dichotomies and and fractal-like bonds that goats like you know showing this way in that way and and it's not all one thing but i absolutely is like personal like but what's my hero's journey like like what is i totally completely understand the woman as home the woman as you you are coming to find me like i understand that and it does resonate at a really deep level but at the same time i want a purpose i want an aim and there is i can i can tell you what the purpose of the feminine is that you can't have one without the other they were they're complementary and so so you have the image of the hero who saves the princess from chaos let's say who who separates the potentiality that is useful from the potentiality that's destructive okay that's usually what when you save the virgin from the dragon it's as if you're taking potentially potentiality that's that's useful you're separating the a good way to say that which is very mesopotamian is you're separating the saltwater from the freshwater so you have fresh water which is useful and you have saltwater which is deadly right and so that's this idea of the so the hero comes and he conquers the virgin he conquers the the maiden okay now the reason why he's conquering her is because she is giving him focus right he wouldn't be a hero without her he wouldn't he wouldn't he wouldn't do anything he would just sit around and play video games and eat ain't he tips and that's what he would do right because the the feminine is is the the frame of reality hmm so okay an image the best image of the feminine i think one of the best images of is in scripture you have mary who at the wedding of cana this is one of the most mysterious and amazing stories ever told so mary there's this wedding and they were alive wine and mary says to christ they ran out of wine so what she's doing is she's presenting a problem she's presenting a quest it's very little it seems like a little quest but she's presenting a quest she's she's framing reality she's saying this is the frame now you have to answer the question here's the question you answer the question but that that question that's a very very powerful thing i don't think you can understand how powerful that is there's there's a great quote in my big fat greek wedding saint which looks very cliche or kind of silly when you hear it but there everybody has hurted where the woman says to her daughter she says the man is the head of the household but the woman is the neck and it's a great quote it's an amazing it's an amazing insight into the feminine because what he's saying is the woman will decide what the man looks like looks at she will frame reality she's gonna give him the frame and then he's gonna answer but he's gonna answer within that frame so when when mary says there's no wine she's saying okay act reveal yourself manifest the logos but manifest it in this question right it would be silly for it would be silly if she said there's no wine and then christ you know changes stones into bread like why are you changing stones into bread i said there's no wine right that's the issue that's the frame now act within that frame okay and so that's why i mean jordan peterson talks about this but you have to you can understand at a very deep level that is that's why the stories of stories like like beauty and the beast are about a a woman who tames a wild man she gives him purpose she she focuses his energy so that he can act right and so it's so the idea would be that the the feminine hero's journey is to is to properly frame reality that sounds very abstract but in practice it can be very practical practical right it can be extremely practical because that's also what you know that's also in a way what mothers do with children right they create a frame within which the children will act and that frame is extremely important that house that home all that is extremely important but it's not limited to the idea like i said of it's not limited to the kind of cliche fifties waif of making a home although it's part of it but there is really this more powerful image which is that without the frame there's nothing nothing happens manifests himself an answer only comes for from a question okay there's no question there's no speaking no if there's no question there's no there's no manifestation so okay does it make sense to say that women so women are the questions sorry not women i guess we could say feminine or women like there's a call-to-action there the question yeah but it's a it's but it's really important to understand that the call to action is more than what you think it's more than just a call to action it's an actual framing of reality it's deciding what's important okay it's actually it's it's its relevance realization in the way that john greer vicky talks about it it's framing the the discourse so framing the discourse is he is comes before the discourse oh i'm just thinking mother nature came first well you can see you can see that if you look at if you look at the imagery in scripture you have this sense that so you have this sense that there is this the the chaos or the matrix it's it's like a it is like desire in a way it's like calling it's asking it's saying what so what like what what what is going to come of this like what is gonna happen and so but that question is like i said is that is the very primordial of mary at the wedding of cana because she is basically bringing christ to - into his mission and that's why when she says there's no wine christ answers my time has not yet come which is just sounds like the craziest answer to answer because he's basically saying i'm not ready to die but she's asking him about wine like why is it that she's asking him that saying does not wine and he's saying hey wait a minute i'm not really ready to die yet because he understands that she is actually opening the door for him and she's saying here's your path take it this is it like i'm open i'm opening the door you take you have to take the path now oh okay how many times have i read that i've never seen what i've read it i've read it a guy like i i say i have a degree in christian studies and meyer and you've never seen that in the end attack i've i've never i've read it and i know the story but i've never seen what he i've never seen it like do you know what i mean so he does the same mary is an anti eve eve eve takes the apple what are you gonna do at him are you gonna bite it or not he bites she presents she presents possibility and he takes the he takes the bait and but mary does the same mary is basically and it's exactly the same but it's it's in reverse because i eve is leading adam to death and mary is leading christ to death but as he says he says it's not my time yet he's saying he knows it's gonna lead him to death he knows he's gonna die if he takes if he if he does this right but there's there is salvation waited right that's it that's the the transformation of death into glory that i'm always talking about and that's what's happening in that story okay okay i think you're like i've taken up so much time mercury let's go to the margin or we jump into the freak show just so we're on the subject of the divine feminine one thing jonathan that you might want to do i like a pop culture reaction - for the purpose of outlining some of what you were saying is masters of the universe so i don't know if you're familiar with that cartoon when we were little but kevin smith is gonna be bringing it back and so that it become more culturally relevant soon but the key thing is that prince adam his lies around doing nothing as a waste of potential he's got this tiger named cringer that is afraid of everything and it's not until the sorceress who's trapped within castle grayskull protecting all the powers of the universe so in other words dog and when she finds prince adam she gives him the sword that he holds up to say by the power of grayskull and so without her he lies around napping and not doing anything the king walk and to do and his cat is a cow with the yeah and that's an egg so defense that turns into battle cat he turns into he-man which there's nothing more masculine and then is tasked with protecting her and all the secrets of castle grayskull so is this man like ads in the he-man and shera like the because i'd collect vintage toys i've got okay merrily he mentalism all over the place here but that may become bigger and culture cuz kevin smith's continuing the series and i would love to see you do a video one day on the original masters of the universe that divine feminine master yeah when i was a kid there was that's what i mean i remember watching that when i was a kid that was four that was it was playing so yes i do remember that i don't i think i even had some figures when i was a kid i think i did have the he-man figure actually i'm pretty sure i had a bunch as a kid but also now like my kids have some vintage he-man okay and i've got a bike my room is full of old toys so i'm gone just a pile of heman all over the fights you see you see that in the story of king arthur you have a similar situation where where the lady of the lake she presents arthur the sword but it's a very very old story right in the story of gilgamesh we get the same we get the same story we're anki do is presented as as a wild man in the forest who lives with the animals and you know who can barely speak can barely do whatever and so the people of uruk send a prostitute to tame him basically and so she kind of she kind of seduces him and then in seducing him then she also teaches him to to do to dress and then to eat food and etc etc and as he's doing that the animals start to be afraid of him and then finally kind of separates himself from nature and until he's will he's ready to face gilgamesh in the in the duel but as i recall he like curses her for waking him up on his deathbed really i do okay okay i've just i remember that i i just listened to it there's a myths and legends podcast called myths and legends yes i like that yeah i've been going through it like crazy the past screams yeah yeah and so he does the epic of gilgamesh and i mean i just i just listen to it and so like she but she literally comes in the door be like oh really and of course you know he's i mean he pulls an atom it's the woman you gave me you know but then but then you know she's just doesn't straighten and he's okay maybe it's a bad okay all right after i know i'll have to listen to that version on the podcast according to this version i've like really gone through the texts he does a pretty good job he usually says it when he goes astray like he says i changed this or that when he tends to try to stay pretty close to the he's actually better and then first the first podcast they were unbearable because he was virtue signaling the whole time he was always trying to show how he doesn't agree with the characters and i think i feel like he's gotten a lot better later in the podcast where he stopped always virtuous singling all the time because i mean okay don't expect these stories to fit politically correct ideology just not you know just drop that before you start telling those stories because you're gonna apologize all the time i just i do i do really like the way that he he's like you know zeus is gonna rape like he always does like he's quite he kind of has his little equips found a way he waited to tell the story yeah i think it's i do have woke a speaking of the greeks because i do have one question that if we if you wouldn't mind indulging me one last okay so regards to the feminine okay so jonathan a couple weeks ago i actually asked you on twitter and i talked to you about this and you answered but i remember being confused so i'm like forget to talk to him i'm going to i don't remember i am i know you've got a lot of but okay i asked about i thought it was odd that of the three perpetual virgin goddesses hestia is one the goddess of the hearth and i thought that was odd because the hearth is the center of the home for women well for everyone but like right we're for women so that's why i actually answered but i just you wonder why i answer wait okay i remember not what i answered okay i mean the idea is that so the idea would be to understand the the center right let's like the ideal meeting of heaven and earth if you id if you idealize it you actually have this idea that i don't know how to explain it it's like - in order to for the the feminine to be to fully manifest everything that's that's where the idea of virginity comes from and so in christianity we take it to the extreme which is the virgin mother and so she is perpetual virgin but she's also a mother and so because of that she's actually the mother of all because she's she remains untouched you could say so she remains the matrix underneath the world right and so the hearth which is the center so the so though you can understand you can understand masculine feminine there's like heaven and earth as like two categories like this but then when you have a mountain let's say or you have a center you have a category then you can understand the category as as a center and the center is made out of a masculine and feminine element so let's say in the temple or in the tabernacle you have the seat the throne of god and then you have the glory of god which sits on the throne right if you look at an icon of christ and his mother you'll see often he's sitting on her lap and she is called the throne of wisdom right and so she's she's the throne and he's the glory of god on the throne right the image of christ on his mother's lap is an image of the of the of the of the ark of the covenant with the glory of god on it and so the idea is that the center is made out of the frame and the name or the answer the question and the answer the opening of space and the manifestation of space okay so the virgin represents the potential of could could go anywhere yeah and so yes exactly but you can so you can understand it as so the ultimate feminine is unbound did potential right so it's it's toboe it's that it's it's mara you know it's the chaos at the the beginning of time right it's the the the first this first separation of having an earth right but then there's also framed there's a framed version so there's a universal question which is is there gonna be something like is there gonna be something or nothing like you could say that it's like the universal question is there gonna be something or nothing and then there are frame questions and then those become more like the home so you but you can represent it in its virginal state because that's the frame so you can say that want to be framed in the eternal potential no but it's just it's just different aspects of the feminine and so potentiality potentialities potentiality but there is only one unbounded potentiality there's only its the only one and then there are different levels of potentiality depending so like there's a there's the potentiality within within basketball right so the potentiality within basketball is the frame of the game and then within that frame then certain things can happen but but a pickup truck can't participate in a basketball game that potential is not available to the basketball game okay right and so everything has a as a frame as a limit has things which delimit its reality and then within that reality the discourse can occur so i mean i use basketball but i could use any anything right okay so you can represent that as you can represent it as a virgin if you want like it can be it can be a way of manifesting that so the hearth the center of the home so okay so you have the heart and you have the fire mm-hmm in the heart okay so you would say that that hestia is the goddess of the hearth so she's the goddess of the space in which the fire burns which lights the the house but then also becomes the center so so the identity the frame of the identity and then the identity the manifestation of the identity or the particular of the identity okay does that make more sense yeah it just brings that like i'm like oh yeah those divested virgins who had to attend the fire for their lives like they literally became what you're describing figuratively yeah so an example an example in greece is that there's a great example the example of the of the what's her named adele fee delphi oh or so the oracle at delphi is a perfect example so the oracle is a is a woman and so she receives this like raw intuition right she receives it's like raw we don't know how she got it we don't know what she did but she received this like raw intuition and then she would say a bunch of stuff but the people who came to ask the oracle for information would never meet the oracle they would meet the priest because the oracle would speak to the priests and then the priest would would take that potential and then would focus it for an answer to give to that person oh so the priest would always interpret the oracle for the for the for the the person coming to ask the question so if someone came with the question you there would be two parts of it one would be this like raw potential mixing up of the super of knowledge or whatever and then out of it would come a bunch of associations and then the priest would associate would would focus that to answer the question the question ok so he'd bring order from the chaos of her pateros reign chaos it's not pure chaos it's okay it has a certain limit it's just like so all forms of divination are that so you you you take a bunch of bones you know you throw the bones and then they to fall so there's this like chaotic weird thing that manifests some intuition or some associations and then but you need someone to interpret it without it it's nothing right where do you need both okay just like in scripture you have the tongues where people say a bunch of stuff but in scripture it says if you don't have an interpreter then it's pointless okay nice more time trying to find all million of analogies there no no no it is no it's it's it's one of those things where it makes sense all the things you're saying and i just need to think about it more it's also hard to think it's hard it's hard for us to think that way because we're not used to we're not used to seeing the world that way and so it's difficult sometimes for us to kind of we can into like you can intuit it but it's all of a sudden your rational mind comes back and says well that's not how things work absolutely i feel very deprived of being from a protestant like background well for ever with regards to the feminine like it's just mary like really yeah for sure sure private ism is extremely masculine yeah so she got really perfect for you yeah but then in the protestant space it's like what yeah well not just mary but also the fact the reason the fact that protestants removed the the apocryphal book they also removed the whole wisdom of solomon part which is which is which is this kind of discussion with a witch feels like it's god talking to his kind of cosmic consort or like this idea of this sacredness like divine feminine or something okay we're not supposed to say it that way but it's like there's there's really is this thing happening in wisdom of solomon like there really is this this relationship which which got a lot of theologians into trouble recently but it's still there's still something there going on like there's still something there okay the margins mercury quickest way to summarize to me cuz i assume you know nothing about me right john okay i was a catholic altar boy as a teenager got into punk and all that independent film just before turning 27 i got hit by a bus oh rigored me being bipolar type one at a very high setting of insanity complete psychosis first time around all revelation based into the mental institution got out my first cycles were three years long so two years of suicidal depression i tried to put myself together again another end of the world scenario this time much more twenty twelve related hmm anyway marched into another sane asylum this time naked bloody handcuffed wrists and ankles after that i went into isolation i got a house farm right near my parents i didn't tell anyone where i was going the first two years no phone no internet no car never laughed couldn't see any neighbors i just had all my supplies dropped off as i came out of that i encountered an archangel being aware both of the psychological richard dawkins perspective that this could all be in my head and having the sub personalities that were total believers i interacted with the archangel that way where i examined it from every angle and continuing to live basically in isolation it took me through a variety of training i thought i was gonna live as a hermit forever but at a certain point i was asked to open myself up to the world of that and the deal i made with god was that i didn't want any of that messianic crap to come up i didn't want to be telling people what they should do with their life so i said look i just want to focus on figuring myself out and continue my train if the world needs anything from me have the world to ask me directly and other than that i'll worry about myself gradually people came into my life needing help in one way or another often people with serious mental issues but it progressed to the point where certain point my archangel i've come across jordan peterson from his jungian depth psychology i'm not interested in politics and i saw and that's how i encountered angela this is talk to jordan peterson and my archangel said subscribe to that guy's channel you'll be helping him out and i thought like what am i supposed to do for andrew and you know my angels like nevermind just subscribe well let you know and all of andrews stuff about diet and exercise had very little interest to me i was introduced as talks with you and such but then one day he puts something up comparing a quote from peterson with a quote from alan morra magic with b and he was connecting the fact that they're both saying look whether the gods are inside you were outside you doesn't make a difference they're [ __ ] real man james seriously and when i saw that you know my angel laughed and was like see he needs to talk to you so i reached out to andrew and we became friends but also i kind of mentored him a little bit and he would ask my advice on the channel eventually he asked me to belong the channel and the response to the three podcasts i'd done with him was a lot of people asking me to start my own channel and my angel said i didn't have to and i was like screw that i'm not i don't barely know how to use my computer so i let that go but eventually when andrew wanted to stop doing his channel he asked me to take it over and that time my angel and the other people in my life all said like yeah you should do this so that's how i ended up getting involved with sorting myself out and since then like since the quarantine started cuz i put out up i'd been very inactive over like i have a yearly cycle so i died in the fall and the winter in the crept come alive every spring when quarantine hit i went online and sort of asked the community does anyone need that you know i've been really and not that active but you know my angel said to check with everyone and since then that's exploded i've been working full-time for the past two months either doing content for the channel hosting zoom of and sort of facilitating group meetings or my do private sessions with people and they'll use me in from anything from when you'd want to talk to a psychologist abouts i know quite like okay whatever angle the person walla gee i know other people come to me essentially the way with shock like i need a malfunctioning brain to run some info through to get some you know more random into the results and some people use me sort of like a priest or an emotional confidant i do a lot of counseling people through suicide or psychotic states look sorry not counseling them through suicide i don't teach people how to commit suicide i mean i counseled them when they're feeling i understood what you were saying but you have been talking about the monsters and the holy fools for quite a while and you know what happens when you talk about monsters too much you end up face to face with why so most of your discussions of the holy fool have been explaining it to the normies out there what advice do you have for those of us who are dog headed men finding themselves thrust into that position that's a really tough question i mean they keep the bad cop here and no it's okay the best of the best thing that the best thing that lets say the monsters can do in their role of monsters we also have to be careful again when i talk about these categories we're not we're none of us are limited to one category alright so when i talk about categories i'm not talking about people but the best thing that the their monsters can can do is well they're two they're two aspects one is to act as guards and the other is to act as bridges and so they they stand on the the edge and they're kind of usually they're not seen well from the center right they're seen as as freaks they're seen as kind of just not kosher not right a little bit off all of this is the perception of the center but they're their positive role can really be those two because they're so close to the to the dark side are so close to the bigger monsters then they can on the one hand extend their hand out and tame the bigger monsters you could say it that way so they can they can act as bridges to the outer world and the other way is that they also guard the inside from the bigger monsters that don't want to detain you know that that are that are threatening to destroy you know and so you can understand that it's kind of like it's like anything it's like anybody who has you can think of it as someone who was an alcoholic for example right and so the someone who has touched that world who's who's kind of been affected by that world then will always be can be a bridge you know to bring people in you know but the thing is that that's a positive aspect the negative aspect is that the monster can also be a bridge going out and can also pull people from the inside towards the outside you know the same thing with an out with a with an alcoholic like someone who who has those tendencies can pull people from the inside into addiction we can pull people out of addiction into you know a more let's say ordered life so that's what i would say that that's the two positive roles that that the monsters can play gargoyles and bridges st. christopher and the gargoyles well st. christopher is also a guard he's he's we tend to represent him mostly as a bridge in the sense that he carries christ but he's also a warrior he's also a warrior saint make sense yeah that all made sense to me i think like you look missing their firm if some other monsters watching this is i've also found that one thing i've been able to be of service of is like one of my spiritual practices is being a psycho having learned how to be mindful i don't know what that is what a psycho bomb a psycho pump psycho pump yes okay yes yes i know what that is the psycho pump like crossing the river styx or mercury okay all across worlds and assisting others in transit it's at a guard and a bridge that's what that's what the psycho pump does the psycho pump is the one who crosses you over the waters like saint christopher or and then and then he's also the one who guards who prevents those who aren't supposed to cross if you're not supposed to cross you can't get on the boat he's not gonna let you why are you let you through what we also do is sometimes go into the underworld to bring people up yeah this book that's when someone's suicidal psychopomp because i've learned i can manage mindfulness during extreme suicidal states oh and i don't take medication anymore all my magic and spiritual nonsense is entirely how i manage my condition and like all like i don't even use psychologists or therapists anymore either but i can because i have no problem going into hell anymore i've learned how to be mindful and non-judgmental and instead of saying god take this away from me saying god let me understand why i'm going through this and put it to use i can go those places with people and a lot of people have a little bit of the monster in them and it's hard for them to face that and if you can be a monster who's okay with who you are it will other people will open up to you about things that they won't talk to anyone else about again notice you're not gonna judge them yeah also if you're like me where you've learned how to be mindful and how to manage your own suicidal states and psychosis then there's other people out there that we can help in a way a psychologist can't or a society and who's never been through it and i never everything i do isn't it's it's not instead of your psychiatric help it's like if you're taking all the help you can and you're still completely losing your mind i've got other techniques so those are the other things i found the monster can also do in this in society yeah yeah i mean i it seems like that what you're saying in these in terms of structure it makes sense see that's you know you have the whole image of the like i said the ex-prisoner or the ex-alcoholic or the someone who has been in the dark side who might still like you said struggle with some aspects of it but is enough you know has it has been able to manage their desires or to manage enough of it so that they can they can be a guide for those who are still kind of lost yeah i'm no less crazy than i was sharing my cycle it's just that unlike peterson slave the dragon i just came dit and i know how i know now what psychosis is for manias for i know how to manage that and make it productive and you got to do all your shadow work and stuff because with the spiritual you can connect to something real but stuff up there so malleable that if you're being run by all your subconscious desires you just project all your shadows into the energies and here back your own [ __ ] so it's like once you do all your own work and i don't even know what to call it once you've cleared out your chado and integrated yourself or whatever once you've done that you can interact with all of that so i can ride the ups and downs now and i make productive use of it and the more you do your work the more clearly you can hear all the [ __ ] imaginary friends not the saints and angels at first you you hear it but then it's like playing a game of telephone you completely mix it up before you tell others and the more you do yourself work the more clearly you can pass things on while never losing track of the fact that there's not a single one of us telling the truth we're all filtering what we learn from god or from the outside world so if it's the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth like none of us have that so i'm always staying mindful aware as well well but i'll say like this is how i'm seeing things but i'm sure it's not accurate i'm just trying to be as accurate as i can be yeah and the truth the truth is is complicated because the truth is also based on the question it's based on the frame of the situation that there is no pure raw truth like there's only an answer to a question so that's why like you said you don't you always adjust the answer to what is being asked and that is not a lie if you're if you're doing it forth rightly you're you're gauging the reason for the question you're gazing you're gauging all of that you know and then you answer based on that on which you gauge from the situation so i think i think that makes sense in terms of we talked about taming the the dragon you know there are versions of the st. george story worried that's what he does that he doesn't kill the dragon that he tamed the dragon he turns him into like a pet dog and he brings he brings him on a leash into the village and then shows everybody makes it do tricks okay kind of stuff not subject up like aussie freaks did you have anything you wanted clarification i do i do it actually i just say that little the the dragon doing tricks reminds me of that the latest pixar onward i haven't seen they have okay well they have a little dragon dog does tricks just like what you said yeah i actually i would be really interested for you to do a video on that because there's a lot of questing in that yeah yeah because it's magic well whatever you you need to watch it but okay sorry your ordeal if you want you think about these things that i used to make video a lot of videos on those kind of movies because my kids would watch them and that's why i would watch it because i don't actually this is like my my dark secret is i actually really don't watch a lot of movies like very few i almost never watch movies and so i usually watch them with the family like i watch them with my kids and so you'll see that like my the level of my movie interpretations like they start with like moana and whatever and now it's like like avengers movies and like 15 so the movie that i watch well i mean it does have like star-lord and you know from green guardians of the galaxy and it also has have to give you their kids to watch because i don't want to they're like yeah we're too old for that now i don't know but like oh my like i mean my husband and i took our kids and we we were so they're they're the two older ones i have an eight-year-old of six year old and four year old they're all boys hence my really my interest in the feminine masculine dichotomy anything because i'm surrounded by men but yeah we went and my husband and i took the older two and went and like we looked at each other and were like like we were like holding back the torrens like the tears it was it's really good it's an old it actually feels like an older pixar movie okay i'm done with my pitch i will move on but okay i just really so yeah i'm it deals applause whatever they always do but anyway okay so i i do have a question with regards to monsters and whatnot yes yes the mantra so so we i have a question regarding the with with tricksters those are on the outskirts correct mm-hmm okay yeah i i remember hearing a jordan peterson mentioned this once and i didn't really understand and i actually i i think you've answered it and i forgotten what your answer was because you did a talk on the fool i remember watching it but i don't i remember the question i often forget the answer so if you'll indulge me well i is the trickster i give way too long of a preface for right why is it tricksters the the precursor to the messiah because when i've been hearing a lot of these trickster myths on myths and legends the podcast and like you can't trust them i mean you just watch the avengers movies like loki's the worst you know bucky sometimes is the best but you know yeah why is that the pre wise always the trickster the precursor i think that's a quote from young i mean i don't know whether or not this is a systematic pattern i'd have to really think about it okay i do talk about the idea that in in the upside down right when the world is upside down then then the trickster or the fool turns the world right-side up because that's what the the fool does the fool is always turning right the fool is turning things so when the world is right side up the fool is turning it upside down mighty he's acting the fool is always acting kind of upside down right and so that's that's mostly the way i understand it so you could say that the fool comes before the the messiah or the trickster comes before the messiah in a way that he has to level the world so so st. john the the for st. john the baptist right that's kind of he wasn't a trickster but his role as the leveler right so the trickster or the fool is there to call out the the king right and so that's what st. st. john does st. john calls out herod he says you know you're doing this you're doing that you're doing all these horrible things and then that is one of the leveling aspects of the making straight the ways of the lord right removing the current structure when it's corrupt when i trickster can be useful i just want to point out i'm not a trickster for anyone who doesn't know me but my thing is authenticity and i've taken like a sacred vow of honesty so right now you know all but i'm absolutely not true yeah so it's like but you're right it's not the same i'm on certain tricks are not the same they're not they don't have the same function that the trickster really is the one who is who is showing that the showing that the pattern is wrong or undermining the pattern that's what a trickster is always doing a trickster is making you think you've got something but there's something else going on it's hip-hop it's of the form it's it's hypocrisy right it's like he's showing that he so the good trickster would be the one who by his trickery he's showing that that the pattern is his corrupt he's left he's breaking it down by by by undermining its you know the fact that this limits you could say something like that he it's he's showing he's showing the okay so so there aren't that many like pure tricksters in scripture but there are people who come close to it in this for example elijah is that's what elijah that's right so elijah you know he says all right so let's show let's see let's see what god which god is gonna answer they make your make your you know put up your thing and let's call the fire you know light here your your sacrifice won't see which god answers and then he's like you know and he's laughing at the at the priests of baal and making fun of them and he's like oh maybe your god is asleep you know what's going on with what's happening with that one of the one of the most humoristic one of the funniest scenes in the bible is in is in the light is elijah when he makes fun of the prophets of baal because he's like you know which is your god sleeping maybe you shouldn't you should scream louder and wake him up you know and so he's showing that their system is false like their system is is is saying something but it's not connecting to reality it's it's a form of you know it's not it's not right and so that's that's what i think st. john i think that st. john the foreigner was doing something like that as well but he's not a he's not a trickster in the end a more kind of mythological sense you know right okay well i like you say it's not the pure exact form and iteration in every if you understand the pattern you also don't necessarily need it to be that you don't naturally necessary you don't have to have it for sure one of the tricksters in scripture is jacob asked him like he literally his name means trickster he's told he's a snake like jacob is a snake for sure and it's a it's a funny it's hard to figure out jacob it's hard to totally understand like his he's also he's the he's the name of he's the name of the pole people like it's him he's the you know they're named after him so it's a it's a it's a weird it's a weird story yeah sir jake it was very strange well that's the one like i i remember a couple years ago when i like i watched i i binge-watched peterson's biblical lectures i mean you know you just you have to you just have to take him on and when he goes through like the brothers the the what is it it's a wrestling but like the the brother well he uses like thor and loki in the avengers movies like the way that they are portrayed you know he uses them like having them be made brothers in the in the movie but like the idea of like the wrestling brothers trying to think yeah and and cain unable is so much more clear-cut who's the good one and then when you get into these twins it's not so clear and he's that because it's like progressing into life like life gets more complicated or am i just reading into that it's a i mean i have my answer my answer is that it's setting up christ the whole thing is setting up the story of christ you know and i mean biblical scholars would tell me that i'm delusional to think that but so the idea is that you're it's like it's preparing its preparing edom you would say you know it's it's like setting up the idea of the of this foreigner which will then be like let's say saved by by by christ you know and it's a it's a it's a funny it's a funny situation and so it's like why is it in scripture that abel is the one that god loves it doesn't say it's very vague it's very odd why why it's him and but there is there is a sense in which the first the first born or the first is lost in the fall that's a way to see it because because because esau is adam he saw his edom that's his name his name is edom his name is adam it's the same word it's just it's the same thing it's just been reworked means red he's the same he's the same and so if you have the sense that the first is lost and so then then after the after the fall you have this like loss of the head or loss of the first and then you then it's always the second or the last it's never the first although in the law there's this idea of the first like it's always it's always it's never the first it's always joseph it's jacob it's isaac it's always it's never the first is that it's not just okay like i'm like in this not to set up christ and you're like yes yo for sure i think it for sure and then so christ saves the firstborn that's what christ does well part of what he does that's not all he does one of these prices is the firstborn sorry i'm going through all of my first born's in the bible one of the things to cry one of the functions that christ has is to save the firstborn but are we not oh why he says rome that's why that's why rome converts to christianity is because christ is there to save cane wait how is rome kane what's the story of rome well it's the oh it's brothers as well it's romulus and remus right so romulus kills remus and found the city yes cain kills abel and founds a city thanks to my myths and legends podcast ivers listen to that one and so it's not it's not a surprise that so it's not a surprise that the that the jews view edom as rome okay so in jewish tradition rome edom is rome rome is edom when jews talk about edom they're talking about rome so what does that mean is it the first shall be last principle of the the turning hierarchies on their heads is that has to do with it has to do with saving the world so christ christ christ restores the firstborn not just that but that's part of what he does so that's why christ uses he uses imagery that is based on agriculture he uses agricultural images christ joins the bread and the wine with flesh and blood so he takes cain's sacrifice he takes abel's sacrifice and he joins them together why has it been there my whole life no i don't know why people don't see it just seems so obvious when you see it until so that's one of the things that christ does is he is he is he but he doesn't only do that so that's why he's also the shepherd is also all of those other images but he's also the sower the reaper the city he's also that you know the the king of the new jerusalem i'm thinking of the prodigal son with regards to the oldest as well and the youngest and the oldest is the one left out upset i think that's all i think that's a little different like i think that talking related to the idea of the the lost sheep like the one of the things that christ is doing which is so christ christ is connecting everything together and so one of the things he does is he goes to the margin see he's always going to the edge he goes so it's happening in every way possible you know he speaks to prostitutes he he speaks to tax collectors and i like the tax collector one because all the like lefty christians they all love the margin until the margins a collaborator no one loves that no one likes a collaborator but a collaborator is also a marginal figure right so christ goes to all the margins and he connects to all the margins and he and he puts his hand out and he's like here's a way to come in but here's i'm giving you a way to continue to commit like all of you that were lost they were outside i'm gonna connect it all together and you can participate in this and so that's what that's what christ that's one of the things that christ does so he goes to get the lost sheep and so the idea in the the prodigal son is more to do with this moment you would say in in scripture where in this version actually the the prodigal son is more like the pagans he's closer to the pagans because he's saying i'm gonna i'm gonna save those that were that that were not inside those that those those that stopped following god those that went their own way i'm gonna bring them back so don't be resentful because i'm going out there and i'm gonna get all of them but don't they see the jews as the firstborn like as the chosen people is that is that in this or not really i don't think they see it i don't think i mean i see they see themselves with the chosen people i'm not sure about the firstborn part i just wanted it to work like i mean they're not literally the children look as abel's dead but they're their pastoralist there so that was a little bit different from the oldest and youngest situation it's a little in that in that story doesn't exactly have the same function okay okay well that's good to know because i am like just getting into this symbolic what you want if you want another little hint at what i'm talking about like so david king david is a hint at christ as well cuz king david he is a king mm-hmm how why do they why all of a sudden these nomadic people these like shepherds their house and they have a king and they have a holy city like what is going on like why do they have a temple and a city right and so that's why that's why there's a you can find it on your own there's a place in scripture where god says that that it says that that david was red-headed yes ready then he was he was adam that he was ready because he's adam he's he's also connecting he's also bringing back pain a little bit like okay okay this leads to more like so okay well i've heard you talk about david is like a mirror mirror to christ or he's very nice for the christ that's for sure and i and i but i don't i've not actually heard you it's fully explained it so maybe i missed a video or do i mean i've only talked about it in the video they where i talk about the fool i mean he he because he he david is weird man david is that story that story is he - he's not the first king he's the second king yeah but he's he's the he's like the it's the reason why he's the second king is important because he's the hidden king he's like the the the hidden messiah right he's the he's the hidden king that is king but no one knows he's king yet and so then there are all these stories about him kind of taking power from the evil king or taking power from the king of this world you would say but he does it without revolution and so it's very similar to christ where christ is going to take he's going to conquer rome anybody who says christ didn't conquer rome doesn't understand anything like the christ did conquer rome it's funny because the the jews were thinking he's not the messiah cuz he didn't conquer rome but christ did conquer all i'm sorry he's it 300 years but he still conquered rome yeah you know but he did it without a revolution right he did it without without bloodshed you did it without without refusing the authority of the of the the power that's in place and so you could say that saul is like a fallen is like the fallen cain he's like the bad cain okay so there is that aspect icon of a bad aspect of that right so he he's always trying to pin down david he's trying to fix him right with the lance yes like abel he's always trying to do that and at first david is the shepherd but then so it's like cain trying to kill abel but then david is a he's very close to christ because he he kind of then embodies he's a shepherd and a king and he's also he brings all these things together it's like david that story is a wild story he kind of he's starting to manifest all this but that he brings in the different aspects into one character well i'm thinking even the priestly bit when he and his men were hungry and they needed food he said like why is it that david didn't eat that why is it the damage can cause so do something which is considered sacrilege yes sorry yes right yeah has to do with transgression in the holy place and christianity is all about that i talked about this before that's what christ solves the the riddle and he solved the riddle of david too because david isn't totally right either he doesn't totally get it right he's still off but christ solves it he brings the scandal into the holy place but he solves it by making it not a scandal at the same time so it's like we take we eat his body and his we drink his blood what the heck we're not like we're eating bread and drinking wine but it's but it's the true body of christ so it's we're cannibals by the rowing it's resolving this the problem its resolving the scandal resolving everything i feel like we're like all over the place you're in the discussion sorry it's like little bits that i picked up that i'm like what is jonathan mean by that huh and i just i factored them away and then they kind of just came out oh my all my questions have been so i framed it we did have a couple audience questions you don't have time for it go for it i'm having fun so this is good okay so i'm also won't go back i know you were hit hard by the flooding last year yeah i don't know how like for me i was already living off disability and for me the pandemic like i was lucky in the flood my farms up high and endemic it's been the opposite of affecting me badly it suddenly thrust me into a full-time job that i mean it doesn't pay i'm still living off disability but i'm wondering you've got hit hard by the flood we also hit hard by the pandemic or that's been i've been surprised no i was really expecting i was really getting ready like in march i was thinking okay i need to get ready for like my revenue to go down i need to get ready for all this to happen and for some reason it didn't happen yet and so i'm grateful then i really i mean i've had people like i've had patrons tell me like okay i can't support you at night and like i'm like you know thank you for everything you've done already totally understand it but then i've seen other people kind of come up and i've seen the same with my with my commissions for carving where some people have said look i need to postpone this i'm this is too uncertain i'm not sure but i have so many orders in advance that i'm not like i just haven't seen i haven't seen it yet so i mean it might come in the fall like i keep thinking maybe the brunt of it's gonna come when all of this kind of settles and you know people really start to feel the pinch but for now it's it's it's as if we just kind of you know besides the madness besides the insanity of being in this this time and trying to understand really what's happening and trying to figure out what the play is like what's being played you know what are the stakes besides that i've been i've been okay until a mental note then cuz i have a lot of thoughts about one hand what card the angels are playing right now what do you think's going on at the moment i think we're in them in the time of really of like massive chaos i really do think we're on the edge of the world you know i'm not and so i think that it's not surprising to see what we're seeing we're seeing excesses on all sides at the same time excesses of of control excesses of chaos excesses of you know of mothering excesses of fathering excesses of it's just everywhere like it there's just we just move from one access to the other and not only do we move from one to the other but they flip right so one week one faction is has a discourse and the next week the same faction at the opposite discourse and has the discourse of their enemy and so you have this like it's it's insane it's a really it's enough to drive you crazy if you're you know not careful because it really is showing how much in upheaval our world is in terms of terms of identity in terms of ideology and so i think that i think that that's what's going on and i'm not saying there is an opportunity i think there is an opportunity but i don't know how long that out we're doing is gonna last it seems it might it might fade pretty fast i just we'll see what's the opportunity well the opportunity is that you can reframe the world and so one of the things that have been very pernicious the modern let's say the modern perspective on the world right from let's say the late like from the renaissance the enlightenment is the kind of insipid scientist of materialism that kind of thinking has really been pernicious for christianity i think like very very pernicious and post-modernism and let's say the postmodern moment or the the moment of upheaval this moment of chaos and i'm flipping narratives and everything is a moment where that narrative is also coming apart and so so i think that now the things that i'm saying i think that i think that 50 years ago people would not have understood anything of what i'm talking about i think they just wouldn't it would not have been even possible to talk about these things whereas now because the frame is open for is open to be grabbed so like we can the frame is open for those that can that can grasp it so i think that all of a sudden people's intuitions are also are also awakened and that and because of that then they they're more capable of understanding the idea of a frame of reality itself like because when i'm talking about when i talk about symbolism that i'm saying this is not i'm not talking about just things i'm talking about the frame by which things present themselves to you and and i think that now people are capable of perceiving it whereas we're like i said whereas not that long ago they just weren't so if there's an opportunity okay but can i ask a follow-up question like what are these intuitions like can you break it down exactly i know what you mean but i would love it to be articulated you will the intuitions the into intuitions are when a particular meets a pattern that's that's that's maybe the best way to see it is when through through a particular you encounter something that's beyond it until you you see that this thing is more than what is there right so there's an event there's something in your life there's a movie there's a story and then all of a sudden you can it's like you can see it's shiny it's it's kind of it kind of glows or not physically but it glows in a in a epistemological sense like it it pops out and it full it looks like it's full of life and then you have that's when you have an intuition of okay this is there's more it's dangerous it's a dangerous thing because that's what that's what people who fall into kind of wild crazy conspiracies that's also what they have they have these intuitions but because they don't have in my opinion because they don't have the proper frame then that intuition is limited to a weird material causality and so they have to admit so because they see meaning in something they have to imagine that someone somewhere put it there maybe for them directly you know that kind of weird stuff where it's like someone is trying to talk someone is communicating with me you know like aliens are communicating with me because i can see meaning in something like google is talking to me i've heard people say that kind of stuff where it's like i you know google's it seems like google is actually answering things that are too meaningful right because because it's like they see this pattern and so it's it can be dangerous but it's also an opportunity to understand that the world is is patterned yes i okay i just did an interview last week with sean carroll he's a he's like a physicist and like a theoretical physicist and he was telling me about how that's what they do patterns that's what they're looking for and i actually thought of you and i wanted i actually i'm like i don't know how to i didn't know how to frame a question to him about symbolism and the patterns there but i was like maybe someday i will be like good enough in how to how in the world do i frame a question about patterns and symbolism to a theoretical to did it you want me to give you an in for the next time you talk to a physicist to see so yeah so one of the problems with with scientists in general is that they they're standing and they look at the world and they tried to see patterns in the world okay now the proud one of the difficulties and i think it's it's actually kind of some some physicists right now are you've seen the problem but not a lot of them aren't so the question is is there a pattern to the way you look at the world so it's not just the world that has a pattern you also our pattern and your mechanisms of understanding are patterned hmm so it's not like you're enough you're a weird objective like completely neutral thing that is looking at a pattern world you are also pattern and your perception is pattern and so then that's when symbolism comes into comes into into comes into the sphere so it's like does do your thoughts have a pattern that you can that are similar to the patterns that you view in the cosmos to your does your family have a pattern similar to the patterns you view in the cosmos do as all human activity is it also pattern in a way similar well right yeah as as the cosmic patterns hmm and so then it's like and then it comes back so you have to now like look back at yourself and see that you're also that you're also patterned yeah so anyways that's what sorry said as within so without yeah and that's the that's the that to me is the key that's why i like i'm that's why i'm attracted to and connected to people like like john drove a key or people who talk about emergence and and the idea of content the problem of consciousness and the relationship between that and emergence all that stuff i think is important in terms of in terms of coming to the end of scientism using science to to to to flip science right mmm it's like let's let's point science back at consciousness and see what happens and you're gonna be surprised it's gonna look a lot more like religion all of a sudden haven't you heard donald donald hoffman yeah yeah i have heard him yeah there's somewhere that science is flipping it and saying hey those spiritual people telling you that there's something more real than what you see is scientifically a ballot idea his work i find fascinating yeah well it's because if once you try to account for consciousness you know if you try to brush it under the table you're just being a complete idiot because you can't brush under the table the thing by which you're brushing it under the table but you you just can't you can't use the tool just you can't use the tool of brushing to brush the tool under the under the under the rug like that doesn't work and so i think they've mistaken the tool for themselves they bonded with that tool so they don't think they're using it exactly that's what it is in but once you turn it back and then you try it you start to look back then all of a sudden yeah that's when this weird desire to understand how consciousness participates in emergence you know and then and then that's that's all so coming after don hoffman a lot of a lot of ancient cosmologies you're not gonna it's just sound it's stupid anymore they're just not because the pattern of something is not in the thing you can't find it it's above it it's transcends the thing so i think the problem we've had is in part related to plato let's say or in part related to that that that line is that you've tried to see this these patterns just as concepts let's say or as ideas right but if we understand them as related more to consciousness or will like in in orthodoxy we talk about how the divine essences are the wills of god in the world hiding under under phenomena so the the essences of things are actually the wills of god for those things the purpose the hidden purpose and you know of things is is a personal it's like it it's more related to consciousness than it's related to than to just concepts or you know abstract abstracts so it's more like intelligences so they end up that's what they end up being the end up being more like intelligences they end up looking more like a hierarchy of angels you know or a hierarchy of gods but the hierarchy of angels is better because it's the angels are submitted to the highest whereas in the you know in the pantheon's there's it's just so messy it's like just a huge mess myths and legends people and so shane's camera died he was gonna ask the audience question but like we're still recording and everything so he sent me a couple the audience questions okay sure jonathan does symbolism take precedence over what is metaphysically / logically explainable and if so why now that's two words that are quite a bit to put together again i don't i i would i wonder what he means by by metaphysically and logically maybe try them one at a time so does symbolism take precedence over what is logically explainable and if so why yeah well the thing about symbolism and which i think does take president just on logic is that let's say i often talk about the pattern right and then sometimes i talk about what i call the meta pattern and the meta pattern is both the pattern and the breakdown of the pattern and so in so that's why we that's why i'm able to talk about things like the fringe like the margin like the periphery because that's also part of the pattern now the problem with just logic is that it doesn't account for the monsters doesn't account for the freaks if you understand how so if you so if you have the image of the hierarchy but you also understand the manner in which the hierarchy breaks down and how the breakdown of the hierarchy when i talk about also in a non dual perspective the idea that the breakdown of the hierarchy can actually be turned into something which is more like glory like so there's this like death into glory and so it's like that precedes logic because it contains also the man in which logic fails and what that also looks like so maybe that's the best answer i can give i'd like to point out when you said freak andreea looked at me like laughing in general you happen to be in the general direction so i just said i think that like i think of kirk and spock and how kirk is the captain not spock there's a reason for that right something to this jonathan your kirk i suppose yes kirk is supposed to supposed to be the bridge between spock and bones like that's supposed to be his role it's supposed to be the one that unites the like the the raw emotional guy and the hyper-rational get it we got to please the the nerds which i am one you are one of them i watched i watched star trek next generation of the team i was okay i'm more that i yeah i'm more of a picard girl yeah i like okay sorry about okay another another audience question if you have one go for it okay so the next one and yeah shane if you have more audience questions that i get if you send them but shane decided to ask one himself next so he said first of all love your work so interest doing powerful and he says when you talked earlier about grasping for the frame can you give an example of how that would manifest in someone's life and in the larger world i mean would the idea is to understand your your place that can sound horrible you say it that way like know your place no it's much better to know your place yes but yeah especially as a monster where you're nice and stick to it and stick to your plate so i think that it has to do it has to do with that it has to do with with properly estimating the potential that you have right properly estimating the the actual actual potentiality so it means not aiming end up so you end up not aiming too high you end up not aiming too low right so i mean you meet people who who struggle to do that in every single way like you meet the guy who who says he can't meet a girl but the only reason is because he's always aiming out of his league like and that sounds like a horrible way but it trying to find a very practical manner in which in which like that can happen right and you meet you so the idea would be took to to properly understand your your possibility right so the mystery the mystery of christianity this is one of the mysteries of christianity is that there it has to do with this idea of the virgin mother actually that's to do it side this idea of virgin virginity which is that this the highest saints are the ones who actually let's say go the lowest in terms of let's say self-denial something like that where they actually eliminate they actually go like they actually eliminate their frame all the frames right until they're nothing and then then they're illumined because they they've eliminated all the worldly trappings right they've eliminated all the all the hierarchies so there's nothing i don't want to i want to clarify there's nothing wrong with the they're not necessarily anything wrong with the the natural social hierarchies but those who are able to divest themselves from those are the ones who reached the end of reaching the highest but in terms of the natural just regular hierarchies is similar right it's like a few understanding you know it there's nothing wrong we actually it's funny because there is a problem with that right now today which is that we have a system which only values one tie almost only values one type of success and so there was a time in history where you were born into a family of bakers and that was your world and that was awesome and it was fine to be a baker and it was fine to like to become that and you didn't have to there wasn't this idea that if you don't go to college somehow you're your you know your suspect or whatever you know and so that's it we've struggle with that in the past few generations where the capacity we want everybody to be equal rather than say you know this person would make a great you know like a great construction worker and that's awesome like doing man not going to like knock it out you know then this person would make a great lawyer it's like yeah that's it that's your frame like that's your possibility take it there you know rather than making everything everybody the same which is just baloney the other thing we've done now that you know child growing up in the family of baker's wouldn't have had is we over glorify certain positions so that child growing up knowing they're gonna be a baker doesn't feel all that adolescent pressure to be a rock star or a baby star to look like brad pitt and be the smartest sam harris and yeah i think in one way that especially now that anyone can suddenly be a star way it's almost you tuber is yeah and it can be now just you don't need to be exceptional in any way that except that you can suddenly be famous it's this weird pressure everyone feels to be exceptional that somehow you're less than that rock star yeah whereas it's just not the case we're glorifying certain things needlessly while degrading other things that have so much value yep sure jesus was a carpenter so other aims but he had a different name than the typical but still start from there you know jesus was a carpenter because he was there to save king who is the carpenter like who is the technically who's the technical person in genesis like is that one of the things that his his descendents the descendants of cain are the are the ones whose to create metallurgy who make cities who make weapons oh yeah well i just you know there's that song jesus was a cross maker but you're like oh no no there's a lot of them that we talked about before can we i have a question but i'm probably gonna i'm probably okay i'm gonna finish soon though guys all right okay all right okay okay tonight wait should i ask the question or show you you the last question and then okay okay how did you learn all of this i think i'd probably mentioned this before so it part of it is my brother material who wrote a book called the language of creation recently but when we were in our 20s we both developed this intuition at the same time and we both kind of were ravenous in our reading and our curiosity and in our discussions i mean it was just crazy it was non-stop for several years and and that's how it started really you know and i mean part of it was also just reading certain books which triggered a transformation and then discovering traditional christianity and the truth is like i can't totally account for the intuition like i can't tell you why for some reason i i can see this path these patterns i it's a gift from god i don't know whatever i don't totally know but for sure at some point in my life i i my brother and i we were able to to kind of perceive these patterns brothers mm-hmm cool there's that but you works together so it's going back to the conversation let's go back to the same spot all right guys i think i think i'm gonna go because this it i usually i rarely go for this long when conversation but it's fun as a lot of fun i really enjoyed it yeah thank you so much this is very fruitful it was nice to meet you and send me a link to the to the talk once you guys put it up all right good night everybody the audience [music]
