so let's say you've got a coding interview coming up in 14 days we're delighted to end to invite yes yes that time is fine yes and for some reason the interviewer decides that one more thing we require all our candidates to have our interviews in java but you've never coded in java before in your life why is it public static void why are they always like word things so basically you've left we know the joys apart from to give up i guess i'll have to call them back to cancel wrong you can absolutely become decently competent in any programming language in just 14 days and i know that because i did it myself using java so in this video i will tell you exactly how you can do that too including the principles i applied to learn efficiently the resources i use the exact step by step i use to learn java this quickly as well as some concluding thoughts around programming languages and how learning a new language is actually a lot easier than you think once you know what you're doing and before i get all the comments of like ah you're lying there's no way you could learn a programming language in 14 days i'm not claiming that i became a world-class expert in java in 14 days what i'm just saying is that within 14 days i went from pretty much having no knowledge with java to being able to function as a junior developer at an actual company in an actual project doing actual work coding stuff obviously i'm not an expert yet i still have a long way to go but what i wanna get across in this video is that i provided that you already know one programming language there are some very simple steps that you can take to transform that knowledge into any language that you want to learn so here's how i did that what you do need is knowledge of fundamental programming concepts like loops variables etc in essentially in other programming language learning these basic concepts is sort of separate from mastering a specific programming language as they simply apply to any language really in pretty much the same ways it's like learning the language of logic so i started my current job around two months ago and i joined my first project after my training around one month ago and i was placing a team where we are essentially working on a java based suite of micro services and at this point i had only done a very minimal amount of java in my life but basically i didn't know any of the language so while this wasn't required and the people understood that i was new to java i nevertheless decided to see how fluent could i come in java before my project was gonna start which was around two weeks from when i found out and here is exactly how i did that as a first step for all the new devs joining my company they gave us sort of a mini coding buca before we were actually placed into our projects one week of this mini boot camp was around java so i was able to essentially learn the basics through that and that is also unsurprisingly the first step of learning a programming language in 40 days learn the basics what you want to do is take up some basic exercises like basic lead core problems for example or any coding problems you'll find in any decent basic course on that language so what i would actually recommend is just pick up any basic course on that new language and just do all the boring starter coding exercises that they'll give you because while from a logic perspective all these basic exercises like using loops and all of that might be something that you already know how to do it's important to just get a lot of reps in so to speak in just using your new language this is a very boring part because you're essentially writing up a lot of stuff that's really not challenging you from a problem-solving perspective but it's getting the syntax of the new language into your muscle memory that's how your brain actually works is putting in a lot of reps the process of using that language then becomes automatic so that you when you use it again you no longer have to try to you know think hard to do it because it's just automatic for the first few days we were going through some basic algorithms and whatnot i had already written a million times in python and javascript but nevertheless i did the boring reps to get the java syntax into my muscle memory and at the same time as to do this even faster i also picked up a basic udemy java course to get even more reps in i was googling a lot it was frustrating to not know these basic things like initializing mutable arrays but it was the necessary boring work that simply just had to be done in order to move on to step two but before we talk about that i have something very exciting to tell you about remote work so as you're probably aware the world is going more and more towards remote working like literally it's thursday right now and i have not gone to the office once this week and that's great but the downside is that the tools that we have to do remote work are really not quite there yet to make the experience just as good as being face to face would be and that is why i'm super excited to talk about spatial jar who are kindly sponsoring this video special chat is essentially a virtual co-working platform think of it like a digital office when you work with your team inside special chat you essentially have three rooms the workplace to focus on projects and boost team collaboration the stage to deliver presentations and the breakout for basically socializing and networking when you want to work together with your team all of you will be in the workplace room centered around a zoomberg canvas where you can do a bunch of cool things like use and record multiple simultaneous whiteboards see what your teammates are doing in real time and interact with tools like notion mirror biasco trello or whatever your team likes to use i think what special which i have created really has the potential to boost productivity while actually making the process of remote working enjoyable rather than at all i honestly hope that my company would adopt a special job so if you're a project or a product team i highly recommend you check out special chat 3.0 from the link down below in the description i give a special time for sponsoring this video now bye for the video so step two is to learn about how their language actually works at a slightly more sort of i would i would say advanced but like an intermediate level what i mean by this is that you want to become familiar with how that language is constructed how it is run on a computer and things like that in the case of java i learned about concepts like the java virtual machine or that everything in java is an object essentially anything that confuses you or anything that you see like huh that's different to how i'm used to doing this in python i wonder why that is whenever you feel that just look things up because the more you look things up the more you'll start to understand the language you have to be at least somewhat curious this is again just a general principle to learn anything you have to want to learn things and to always go a slightly deeper than might be required because that is actually what makes you ahead of other people that makes you better than other people because at any given stage so i would just go and write down into my notion notes any things i was curious about or or that i just couldn't quite fully understand and then later on read as many articles and different stuff to like really understand everything that i came across in java that i didn't fully understand because i always believe that down the line you'll always be rewarded for having these more fundamental knowledge so in summary be curious and look up everything that you don't know until you understand it and until doing the basic actions becomes automatic step number three is to use a good ide this might sound like a sort of a strange tip how can using one code editor or ide help me learn a language faster than using another code editor well in the past the idea i always use was vs code that's what i'm used to and i still like it so i was sort of annoyed when they told us in abu camp that we were going to be using something called intellij because i hadn't used it before but it turns out i'm really glad we did because intellij is essentially really optimized for java and there's a lot of tools and a lot of helping documentation that makes writing java and you actually want to be careful with a lot of these like automated tools the ideas provide to you because at the beginning you actually don't want to be using your id as a crutch too much because you want to get used to doing these basic things manually as well but the way a good ide specifically will save you time if you're using an ide that has a lot of these features you know when you hover over a piece of code or a class or a function or something like that and it shows what that function does and sort of with a snippet of the documentation that is probably the best tool you have to get familiar with different methods classes functions that the function provides which makes you more likely to end up learning these things when you don't have to externally go and google everything every single day but at this point we do have to talk about the unavoidable step 4 which is that if you want to actually learn a programming language in 40 days even if you already know another language you do have to put in a lot of time a lot of hours during those 14 days to be honest for most people i would like i wouldn't actually recommend trying to learn a language in 14 days there's really no reason to do that unless you're a complete nerd weirdo like i am what i would actually suggest you do is just set a more reasonable target like 30 days or like two months or something like that but if you do want to achieve learning a new programming language in 14 days it is just unavoidable that you're gonna have to put in a lot of hours during those 14 days i was working for the full nine to five that i was working for my boot camera or even after that from like five till nine i then kept on learning so this is something that should probably be obvious but just to not give any false expectations of your like it needs to be said and finally as i'm a bit of a more advanced step five i would highly recommend that you actually go out and learn some fundamental computer science concepts specifically around a computer architecture and how programming languages actually work in general at a low level and how a programming language actually interacts with the computer hardware either the course called nan dota twist which you can go and order for completely free on coursera i leave an affiliate link down below doing that course probably the single thing that's helped me the most in actually understanding what happens when you run a program like when you write a program how is it possible that a computer can understand all of these words because essentially what you are writing is like text this is not something that you should focus on at the first stage but at some point i highly recommend that you do go out and learn these sort of fundamental details because i always believe that the more you know the better you'll be and in this industry because it is competitive the people who have that fundamental cs knowledge are always going to have an edge this also actually brings me to the most important point of this video which is that the real reason why i was able to learn java in 14 days is design really didn't learn another language at all even though we call a python javascript and all these different programming languages languages in my opinion they really are the languages at all they're really just different dialects of the same language like pretty much every single programming language implements the same exact logic if you learn one programming language learning another one is easy because you're really not learning another this is not like learning human languages anyone who's learned a new human language or someone who's learned like four human languages like i have knows that learning in other human language is really hard because their rules are just completely different the grammar is different the words is just so different that this is not the choice but to just keep memorizing a bunch of different stuff and just keep repeating repeating repeating obviously they can't be done but it's much more difficult whereas the programming languages is not like that at all if you're not python if you learn the core programming logic of python you'll be able to apply the exact same logic into learning java or javascript or php or whatever language you want to learn that's simply not the case with human languages so what i wanted you to take away from this video is it that if you're worried about like choosing the wrong programming language to learn or something like that don't be because whichever language you learn you're really just learning the same language the language of programming logic once you're good at the language of programming logic you're gonna just translate that same knowledge into any language you want companies realize that if you're a good programmer in any language it's trivial for you to just learn whatever language they choose on the job so it really doesn't matter that much which language you choose and that is why i was able to learn java in 40 days so if you don't feel like you quite yet mastered this programming language of logic or you're not yet quite sure that you are a good enough programming yet i actually made just the right course for you actually created a skillshare class where i go through all the principles that i myself have applied in this skillshare class i go into a lot more detail that i ever can in any of these youtube videos now the great thing is if you go down below and you get a free trial of skillshare you can actually complete my class it's not that long like you can complete that class with your free trial the first ever class or course i've ever created so do let me know what you think about it if you want a sort of a more condensed version of how you can actually learn these programming language logic and how i did it i also made just the right video for you which is this one right here i go through step by step all the mistakes i made when i was beginning and how i resolved them and how i was able to learn my first programming language so if that's something that's interesting you go watch that video right now and i will see you next time
