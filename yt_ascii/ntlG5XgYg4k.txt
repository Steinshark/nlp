of spray paint i'd recommend you don't do this at home we're probably gonna die this approve it is spray paint does work we need to wait long to make a lot not doing anything i think it's because the

microwave is a can of x-ray should i open it or leave it closed open it open it all right it is open you're doing this i you'd do anything at all so after microwaving acts for five minutes nothing
