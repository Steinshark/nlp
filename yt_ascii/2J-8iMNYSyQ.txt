there is continuously dumb takes on youtube but i don't think we have a dumb take here my friends i get this question literally multiple times a day i get emails i get whispers about it so i wanted to watch this and tj was just like you can watch it go for it i've been getting asked a lot lately about my thoughts about the future of software development whenever a new ai advance is released i get a flood of questions asking what is the future for software developers and i think the question they are not asking is will i still be allowed to code in the future obviously everything besides c will still be legal he's correct i don't know if you know this but gemini won't even show you c++ code unironically that's not me exaggerating that's not me saying some nonsense c like literally gemini will not allow you to see c++ code if you're below' because it's it's not it's not safe for work literally it's not safe for work that's kind of funny i didn't i didn't realize how funny that was until i just said it out loud i feel like the real question that they're asking is will i still be able to get paid with the skills that i'm learning while i learn a code yeah that's reason and so the first thing i want to say is i hate predicting things particularly in public if you would have asked me five years ago about if any of this ai tech if we would have it today i'm pretty sure i would have said no and i'm not talking about the crazy hyped up demos i'm talking conversational ai that returns some semence of a conversation even if it's mostly hallucinated i i i don't think i wasn't thinking that was going to be possible so i've had to update my good take right there by the way public prediction especially on tech is just like just the worst it it you're wrong 100% of the time ires many times throughout the last few years regarding ai and its capabilities and therefore its future capabilities as well so i just don't have enough hubris to think that i know what's going to happen in the future did we just get a hubus mentioned is tj just dominating us with some some thomas aquinus level speaking here maybe i guess i do have just enough huis though to post this video about my thoughts so there's two major points though that i want to talk about the first is that i think software is more than coding and then the second is that programming itself is more than coding and before i sort of go deep on those i want to just seed for the sake of argument that ai will be able to do coding tasks that a junior engineer is currently exposed to do ai will be able to perform these as faster faster and more cheaply than those junior engineers and ai will be able to do this and productionize right sort of rolled out to people sometime in say the next 5 years i realize some people in my chat keep telling me that this is going to be in six months but that roll out seems quite difficult to change the entire structure of an industry in that time this is actually a super good take because what you might be missing i don't actually even agree with tj in 5 years i think it's going to be a touch longer a i think the expensiveness of of producing chips to be able to keep up with the demand is just going to be too high and for a long time it'll just be way too expensive to have a junior engineer that is ai specifically with the amount of things that's going to continue to get wrong i think we're still one generation away from things being at least moderately useful you know we we had a we had a ban so like let's let's just calm it down flip take this part out you take it out flip who got banned i don't even remember that's how insignificant the situation was flip you can pick it up right here okay now now i remember i remember where we're at all right i actually i think the thing is i actually think tj is even off on that because just think about how slow the industry moves just like in in in all aspects how slow things move it takes a long time to do industrywide changes right it takes a long time so when people think like oh ai is going to replace all these jobs it's like you know like you still have to like i mean think about how many checks and balances and new roles and discoveries and failures and all these things that have to happen before we even know how to integrate these things in well it's going to take a long long long time i i i don't foresee anything within this decade we will probably have the time as a 32-bit 2036 problem before we have ai completely sweeping out all jobs that's my public prediction i go way way way way way further is it 2038 2038 20 2032 or 2036 2038 it's somewhere in there anyways 203 something we're going to have some issues and from there we'll we we'll work on it january 19th 2038 okay maybe that's when the a maybe that's how the ai get integrated into these workflows is that they're able to to solve all of our old crappy cobal code and all the other codes and now they can move right so you just got to remember how slow these companies move so that's just like something to just keep in your head so even if ai let's just pretend that ai today was good enough to replace a junior how fast do you think that would happen like real talk i don't think you're going to see that happen even in 5 years if it could fully replace a junior like that it would be so d complicated cuz just think about the sheer chip generation that would be needed to even handle that workload let's just pretend it's it's 100% yeah firing people isn't free it costs money it costs time you have a whole management structure that's going to have to change you have get workflows that have to change like there is just a lot of things that you have to like think about that's surround this this is why when he says that i mean just the industry change alone he's saying 5 years i i i'm adding a good 10 on top of that five right the reason i say that is cuz i don't want to fight about what i think the particular capabilities of ai are going to be instead i want to talk about that with sort of that scenario in mind and if you think any of those points are much too aggressive and your ai takes are so bad now you must explain yourself what was bad about that take literally what was bad about that take saying even if it's purely equal to a junior engineer it's purely equal to a junior engineer it's still going to take so long the amount of like dude you cannot replace a million people and turn it into into like we don't even have the machine power for that like what the hell are you even talking about what's the bad part you got to hit me you got to hit me be union hit me be union come on come on we'll let him cook hey please cook remember your job isn't by the way for those that know when i challenge you i want i want you to you can take two minutes and cook up a good response don't you don't need to cook fast okay we don't need a microwave meal we want something good okay so if your response is like three words and it's just like i think it's bad that's stupid right you you idiot the old dick twist got him with the old dick twist well that was anti-climatic this is why we just stay neutral in this chat oh you you should not you should not stay you should you should not stay neutral if you have an opinion and you think i'm wrong i don't mind like i actually like this part i want you guys to know that i genuinely appreciate when people try to say i think this is bad that's why i bring you up on the big board because i want somebody that that that has an alternative opinion to my mine your ai takes are so bad okay he hasn't responded he hasn't responded yet don't be an echo chamber i you're genuinely you genuinely like singling people out for public shaming how do you think this is public shaming how exactly do you think this is public shaming now we got two people going okay we got two conversations going at the same time i'm giving somebody the chance to say their peace i'm giv i'm given the chance right and we're even waiting we're waiting classic hell this is buling this is buling how is this bowling okay now you guys are having l takes dude is b union not going to respond did did b un did b union run away damn i think i think we had b union leave man i will say that if you're going to say something you should be willing to you should be willing to back it up you know what i mean lost a viewer that's fine if you're not willing if you're not willing to put a little behind what you're saying i i think you're being weak okay that's soft energy that's soft energy that's like microsoft microsoft vp of soft energy right there i don't think ai will take over soon either but i think your example is not a b is bad in my opinion companies mainly move slow if something does not give them a lot of profit companies are quick to lay off people but it's so much more than that like like i i see what you're saying but the problem is is you have to think about all of the other [ __ ] that has to go into this they have to set up contracts they have to have guaranteed up time they have to have the ability to ensure that if anything goes down even for an hour how does it respond how do production issues respond how do do you roll back do you roll forward who's monitoring the monitors who's actually doing all that [ __ ] that's involved how many seniors can you have per ai is committing code how long do you let the code sit do you trust the tests that are being written like it is a huge amount of like just testing and slow moving that's going to require a long long long long time before they actually go okay we're willing to hand this over because it saves us a million dollars a year right there's so much more than just simply oh it works so therefore let's go right there's there's there's a lot to it like there's so much people you have to hire so much so much process you have to set up there's so much everything that has to happen right all of these things need uh processes developed in order to work at enterprise scale the enterprise scale is the only thing that could afford to adopt this right now that's like there you go this is beautiful by the way this is the crazy ju a position that we're kind of in which is how do you like it's like building a program that requires users to submit information to make it relevant but you won't get users using it because it doesn't have relevant information you know it's like the old chicken in the egg thing which is why like a lot of these when you have the double when you have the double relationship it's really really hard all right let's see if let's see if b scale actually did it b scale i really wanted to see or b union man be union i i will say be union that was a little weak okay damn little weak little weak weak mindset i personally agree with you on ai maybe not on co-pilot 100% that's fine weak take that's a weak take that's a common l right there say it with your chest okay you got something to say say it with your chest okay i don't hate co-pilot i don't love co-pilot i don't hate co-pilot i don't think ai is terrible i think ai can be very useful but to think that the world is about to change to the point where companies are just going to be like forget everybody we're run with ai just show that either a you're completely unn knowledgeable about companies b you're completely unn knowledgeable about the skill you're trying to say that you know or c you just are you you actually think ai are magic it's none of the three right i think you're overestimating ai and you're underestimating how slow things move right favor of ai then that's totally fine my argument will just be bolstered in my in my corner the other clarification i want to make is that for the rest of the video when i say coding i'm sort of referring to this act of sitting in front of a computer typing autocom completing copying pasting a programming language into an editor and then shipping that to prod in some sense the exclusively physical act of creating software so when i say software by the way i love that tj whenever he makes arguments and stuff this is again why tj is such a talented developer and i think he's one of the best like coders out there is that notice that how he's creating this he's like setting up all the definitions and everything great job is more than coding what do i mean i'm saying people don't pay for code they definitely don't pay to just watch you cod unless you're a twitch streamer i guess then people like doing that hell yeah but what they pay for is for problems to be solved and when you're coding you're not getting paid for that code you're getting paid to solve somebody else's problems real or perceived these problems might be for a client or they could be for your boss or they could be even for other software developers right but the reason you're getting paid is because the problem you're solving for someone is valuable enough for them to part with their beloved cash this boils down to software being able to maybe provide something that's faster or cheaper or more reliable than what could have been accomplished previously and software is a super set of just those coding tasks of just literally typing into the computer because you need more than just good algorithms or a nice type system to create value for your customers not to was that o camel did we just get o camel mentioned did teach just sneak in a little bit of o camel right there by the way i agree with this entire take which is that it just happens that the we all are just solving problems it just happens that the way in which we solve it the manifestation of it is by coding and coding is an exceptionally difficult skill to get good at therefore if we could solve all of our problems with horses we would just use horses instead but that day and age of using donkeys and horses has left and now we have to use our mind and so therefore it just cost more because to be able to get somebody that could use a donkey somewhat well was a lot cheaper than someone who can communicate and take a problem from an abstract sense into a physical and exact meaning into a computer that works well with a bunch of people using it goorse mentality absolutely that's why it's just gotten so that's i mean that's why it's so dang so dang valuable right now to no coding by the way every argument for ai amounted to it's gotten this far this quickly but that's the first 80% yeah yeah this one's very difficult on this one i can't say whether you're right or wrong on this specific one meaning that is it going to go faster is it going to go far farther but why male models but like but real talk like is it going to be is it going to continue to grow this fast maybe it might even grow faster but it might also grow way slower so it's extremely extremely difficult to know what the future is going to be for ai that's why whenever i talk about ai you'll you'll typically see me say something along the lines of i think next generation ai will be a lot more useful for these reasons because i'm not saying a time period i'm saying a a a step function you know like i'm saying the next iteration right that could happen in one year that could happen in five years that could happen in 20 years we don't know when it's going to happen but the next leap forward whenever that next leap forward happen i do think we will see a much different enterprise response to how this is going to happen right i think there will be a significantly different response i think devon will probably be a lot better we won't all be saying yo [ __ ] devon we'll be saying why does devon cost so much you know we might we might change our tune a little bit when that time comes you know you know what i mean and maybe hey we could also solve how exponentially expensive these things are right like i don't want to put bounds on what we can and can't do but also [ __ ] devon yo [ __ ] devon right i don't want to put bounds on what what can or cannot happen it's kind of like a it's dumb to think that because when i was younger would i have thought that we would have our computers now where they are are no i would have thought we would have been much faster that's because i didn't understand technology and i just thought wow we went from 1.3 gigz to 1.8 ghz and like you know only so many months man here in like 5 years i'm going to have like a 5 g gz processor it's going to be awesome in 10 years it's going to be like a 20 ghz processor but that's because i was incompetent to the scaling problems that exist right i just didn't understand because i was young i was i was a young man not understanding anything say those aren't important i just wanted to play unreal tournament important just i'm saying there is more to software than that you need to be able to understand requirements and update them when things change this may even involve i hesitate to say it talking to a client or to a stakeholder you need to be able to practice communication understanding the non-technical aspects communicated to you sometimes called listening in the area of someone else's expertise and you also need to be able to communicate technical concepts to non-technical people in your area of expertise you need to be able to say no to feature creep and scope management your project can't do everything right you need to be able to say no to something you'd like to do but think the cost is more than what it's worth like maybe rewriting your front end in rust there by the way there's so many things here that is actually really really really awesome i should have paused it sooner but i wanted him to get his idea out like one of the the one of the chief goodnesses of a good engineer is the ability to say no to improvements features things that come down the pipeline and the reason why that is is it can it can become an overall bad experience for people and this would be like like imagine an ai future where you can just say what you want you could imagine that every single product that we create gets obtusely complicated everything's ffm peg because at some point you have every possible feature that some person thought about that doesn't even understand what the customer wants and now you you have literally just the most complicated everything right when we are not held back by time it it will be still very difficult i think creating a good program will be very difficult even if it was as simple as speaking what you wanted into an existence infinitely configurable exactly ffm peg is a great argument against monoliths it is it really is because ffm peg is obtusely confusing g streamer holy cow you know what i mean it's like holy cow it's difficult to be honest i am always rude to the non-technical sales who only shoot who only shoots to the moon any ai won't do that because they'll report this ai is bad and buy another ai that will always say yes to any of their needs yeah that's that's also i mean you should try not to be rude but always is also you know usually a bad argument for anything you do because i'm sure there's plenty of times that you're not actually rude you know i know you're a little exaggerating here but again saying no is a very important part of the process because what you think the customer wants and what the customer wants are often very very very different things and so to be able to constantly give them what they want is not good there's an old saying i think about democracy i forget how it goes but it goes something along the lines as like democracy is giving the people what they want and giving it to them hard right it's like this it's it's this funny hell divers 2 mentioned that's actually even better with hell divers now around dude we're giving them democracy hard right i forget who said this phrase it's some funny phrase where it's just like not only do the people get what they want but they get it hard like it's funny hell divers 2o mentioned yeah we need manage democracy immediately there's social aspects to software and to making software like list i do want to take one more thing that he said just imagine like for all those here who here uses chat gpt fairly regularly who here has been who who here is a proter okay we there's definitely some pters in here you can see a lot of prs going on in here okay maybe we don't need to know the exact number now for all of these prs in here let's just say company comes by and says man we don't even need ai is just going to build it for us we don't need none of y'all imagine how the pring is going to go right it's extremely hard to even say what you want to say to get the thing created and that's hard like me talking to another engineer that's super good like that's already a challenge it's like that is such a challenge just to get that right and that's like me and one other person both paid to be here and both actually find each other good to work with and we want to be successful and we're like oh [ __ ] i got that completely wrong why was i doing what's it called red rum why was i doing that nobody knows but you get the idea like that's it's already so dang hard so just imagine that it's like again this is why these things this is why you get paid what you pay get paid is because programming is so much more it's really good to be good at your craft and that's usually what i emphasize in this because i think a lot of people foro getting good at their craft for pursuing the soft side which is not good either right it's it's you don't want to forgo one for the other listening to feedback and giving constructive feedback there is mentoring and being mentored there's patience kindness and respect all of these things create teams that are generally seeming to be more effective at creating software and there's also asking and understanding things like how do we make money at this company the best software developers i've snapchat mentioned was that a was that snapchat mentioned right there or shall we say discord discord how do we make money ads discord is like going to show ads people how do we make money at this company the best software developers i've ever worked at were great at all of these including coding they definitely were great at writing code but they understood each of these and helped me to learn to do each of them better all of these skills will still be useful for as long as we have jobs there are skills that you can practice and hone while working as a software developer or learning to be a software developer regardless of your seniority and tex stack i like that but even beyond that i want to say programming itself is more than just coding and maybe this section should be titled something more along the lines of programming can be a superet of coding and if i'm being very reductive and i i want to be clear very reductionist i see sort of two categories of programmers there's solution copiers and there's problem solvers solution copier is not exclusively about using copypaste solutions it's about using copypaste solutions for copypaste problems without examination as a clarification there are a lot of people who primarily sort of copy and paste code and solve a ridiculous amount of problems they could be like a scrappy solo startup right and they are copy pasting because they don't have an engineer you know a legion of engineers to write a bunch of code they need to take the solutions that are available and ship quickly and iterate or maybe they're a non-programmer using excel and copy pasted python scripts to power some ridiculous real estate empire i don't know he's totally right about all this this is this is it is a good breakdown because there's a lot of just like startups that are just like they're just you know how many marketing pages are just copy pastas of another marketing page they all look the same right they're all just like we got to get log in we're going to put in clerk we need to host this somewhere put it on for sale oh we need to do this we better use this we better do that we better you know like they're just all using the same technology right it's just like just copy paast to get the thing out as fast as possible let's go know the point is i'm not actually talking about that group of people here those people are still problem solvers they're just focusing on a different set of problems and a different set of solutions yeah that that's fair i when whenever i when you know like i think of rockstar dan if you guys don't know dan he's awesome he used to do a whole bunch of startups here on twitch he's a pretty smart fell and what i see with him and and and a lot of people like that is that their focus is purely on a business and coding is incidental right coding is just like the the happy accident that has to that that exists to allow them to create the business right and so coding is like a cost center for them they just simply have to get the thing out and it doesn't matter about anything else coding is purely a means to an end that's a good way to put it coding is a or a necessary evil it's just like they just have it's the only way they can to specify what they want the solution copers they're not interested in how things work just getting passed to the next task they're sort of unaware of the ways that different libraries and language and tools can solve their problems or might not solve their problems they just copy paste the first solution from a stack overflow problem or now maybe their favorite llm until ci is green there's no concept of considering the context that they're that they're currently in but this isn't just limited to technical problems like we've been talking about it might be that they're not interested at all how their business works or how their makes money or what their customers want right it maybe that they've never considered does the structure of our own organization help us meet the goals and desires that we're setting out to do in contrast we have the problem solvers these are curious people who try to solve problems via understanding and i think these skills will remain useful even if we never write a single line of code again and this is sort of where i think people are underestimating the skills that they can once again can learn via software development right and my point i'm going to quickly pause him here there's this do you guys remember the article by lane by the way boot. mentioned it by the way if you want to support to tj and i at the exact same time boot. by the way become a backend dev support tj and i exact same time but lane made this argument which is like i had this coding problem and i had somebody try to solve it and they effectively worked around the library right and by working around the library it didn't it it did solve the problem but it wasn't actually the solve to the problem right you fixed the symptom you didn't fix the underlying problem and so instead i believe it had to do with like a squeal c and some sort of null string if i'm not mistaken and he said like if only he would have went and looked at the documentation gone through it he would have realized that the problem isn't right here it's actually how we defined the schema and we should have just taken a bit of time and fixed the schema then we would have fixed this problem and so like that's that's like a a very important problem solving skill which is to be able to take a step back and say what is the root cause and i i absolutely love that i absolutely love the root causing of things this is a good i think te just underestimating the number of software developers out there that do not want to learn anything they want to make a buck move into management and be done with it these low performers we all work with will contribute little or so little but fill the jobs sure they do fill the jobs and these are also the first people out of the door when as as ai is integrated more deeply into enterprise okay because guess what also happens can anyone guess what also happens middle management also gets trimmed as a lot of these jobs go a lot of middle management also gets trimmed and so these ineffective employees that become ineffective management become ineffectively jobless right like they they they go from one step to the next step to the next step so middle management goes first in the next five years interesting take no people no managers and so i i don't like to consider that because i first off i don't think we can qualify how big that group is so i don't want to say that it's most engineers i don't want to say that it's some engineers i don't want to say it's the plurality of engineers i don't want to say it's the minority of engineers cuz i have absolutely no idea how much of them there are i've been in places where there's a lot of them i've been in places where there's absolutely none of them and so it's very very difficult to know that number and i i i most certainly don't want to emphasize that but they do exist but again i think that people who just don't care will always be the first ones out right people who don't care will always be the first ones out here is that it's it's possible to not learn these and to not all right hold on i'm just going to there we go not practice these even if you've been writing code for a long time so for example i think logical thinking is something that we can practice while we're doing software development we can practice decomposing large problems into smaller ones for those that didn't catch it he was just saying stuff like firing is hard don't hire dogs [ __ ] your company [ __ ] ass interview i don't really know what he's trying to say just not communicating well we don't need a bunch of noise okay iterating and solving issues for customers that they're actually willing to pay for you can get better at domain analysis right understanding a problem set possible solutions and then how to implement some business logic or process to solve that you can work on predic edge cases or failure modes for those processes you here's a good story when netflix was started to do live live service games i went into some of the chats and i listened to hold on this is some of the most band streams people have been weird today you know people been weird people just being weird today you know the thing is i'm going to be i'm going to be real here for a second one step to creating a good community is you have to be willing to lose a viewer and when when people are just like really explosive and when people get really really negative it often makes everyone in chat feel a certain way and when everybody starts feeling negative you know what they don't want to do they don't want to be in this area and i've tried extremely hard to make this one of the most positive upbeat streams because that like that's what got me through all the [ __ ] in my life is being like just trying to continuously believe in the bright side of things and so that's why we do that i i i do watch the reason why i watch chat is for these reasons is that i want to make sure that people like you know y yall yall leave this stream feeling good right you feel like hell yeah i i got a i got a purpose and i got a point to what i'm doing and i want to be able to keep on crushing ass like that's that's why we do what we do people okay i forgot exactly what i was going to say here so i'm going to rewind it a couple moments we can work on recognizing iterating netflix so when netflix started doing the live service games i was i i joined some of the chat rooms because this was like a year and a half ago because or two years ago i was starting to get interested and and at that point i i built a lot of these super cool kind of test tools i thought it was built some drivers for some cool devices blah blah blah blah cool stuff and then i just was watching everyone talking about like what's going on and i saw that everybody was saying something without saying it which is hey we're kind of flying blind on some of these things and it's very very difficult and so what did i do without telling anybody without without getting anyone's consent without saying hey this is what we should do i went i'm going to start scraping this [ __ ] database which contains a bunch of data points i'm going to scrape some of these logs these cabana logs i'm going to go through and i'm going to just i'm going to really just take apart a bunch of things and what i'm going to do is you're going to give me your played game id and i'm going to come back and tell you how was your frame rate did you drop frames how was audio did you drop audio what was going on what was the server doing how much load was the server on how much things happened and then at the end of it was this a good game can i just give you a green check mark or a red x can i autod do your experience if you say i had a bad experience i can say why this was a bad experience and then i showed my boss i'm like hey yo autod do and he was just like do it and the thing about ai at least in this current generation i don't think ai can make that kind of leap right is that i don't think ai can see a bunch of people saying wow like these things are really i we really struggling here hey hey we're really struggling over here hey what was the frame rate of that last game and go you know what we actually need let's take a step back and let's try to figure out let's try to root cause the root of these problems and then give somebody something that can just give them a green check mark or give them like give them a thumbs up thumbs down right and that was kind of the goal and honestly that tool lasted for about four months 6 months and then we threw it away because better things came out we got a team started up to build like this they built it react bless their little hearts they built like this nice little website bl blah blah blah and they did that right and that's what that's what they did and that was great i didn't do that though i just built the first one which was a cli to try to help get them you know to get us into a good a good place and like that's the thing that people are missing a lot here and this is what tj is saying about problem solving being able to take a step back and instead of trying to solve the thing that is at hand you go why do we have these problems in other words not being reactive to the current situation but proactive to the next 10 situations that you can see there's some intentionality you know what i mean there's some intentionality behind it of how to how to figure it out and solving issues for customers that they're actually willing to pay for you can get better at domain analysis right understanding a problem set possible solutions and then how to implement some business logic or process to solve that you can work on predicting edge cases or failure modes for those processes you learn how to do trade-off management and understand that there exists tradeoffs that you need to manage then there's pattern recognition which is useful all around us and so each of these skills seem to me at least like muscles that you can train and get better at you can use software development as a vehicle for doing that training and all of these skills by the way very good again like the netflix story being able to identify the real problem and creating something that is really useful and you got to remember that like that that process is the exact same process as creating a successful company or creating an amazing game is to be able to see what the people want and be able to take that idea and turn it into something that meets those needs those desires those wants in a way that is both useful and enjoyable right it's like it's a skill set and it's the same skill whether you're building a cli tool for three devs to be a little bit better or you're attempting to create a company it's it's really the entrepreneur mindset right if you want immediate money make what the vcs want if you want the big bucks you make what the people want you know what i mean by the way thanks for the hype train again people okay i know we're just a little lowly just a little lowly little lowly stream here but i appreciate that okay hey i appreciate the hype train those are going to be useful once again for as long as we have jobs to do same with the soft skills that i mentioned in the software section let me give you an example sort of illustrate this a tale of two neo viers if you will and i know some people are arguing to say using neovim that's just a waste of time that's okay that's fine if you don't like neovim that's fine but i want to give a parable sort of of two different people using neovim it's not an exhaustive list just just two examples so the first person tries out neovim because of some extrinsic reason and they're hurried to get to step one of using neovim they don't take time to read or understand or explore something breaks in their config and they just post on reddit until someone posts reply with solution they might make an issue with no reproduction steps and we've seen this kind of person in every dev community and you can probably relate in my opinion this person actually is wasting their time with neovim which by the way is totally okay we all like to waste our time in different ways i like playing stard to valley with my wife and we waste time together and it's really nice pac-man users wouldn't understand however that was an arch linux joke by the way for those that didn't catch it he just dunked just dunked on your just dunked on your waifu pillow i don't know i don't know how many people out there right now are just just in shambles over the the stardew valley with wife pac-man pokem man wife pillow situation that just went on there non- sexs i know tell me your sex without telling me your sex by the way bastion i i did see it earlier i i while i'm while i'm watching these videos and and trying to stay on my no sex no sex is definitely not a sex unless if that's like one of those ironic names like little john i have a girlfriend okay anyways hey well i genuinely appreci i just want to let you know i do recognize it i do see it i just i i typically don't interact with those kind of things while i'm trying to because i'm trying to stay on track for the most part and i'm already i'm already really bad at staying on track okay you've seen me you've seen me in real life i'm not good at this okay i am not good at thoughts and success i got adhd my girlfriend lives in canada you wouldn't you wouldn't know of her teach just doesn't know pco there isn't any learning going on through this neovim experience love this which is bad if it characterizes every interaction that you have with skills that sort of are the culmination of your field compare this to someone who's enjoying using neovim they learn to understand how to read documentation they might learn a new programming language they learn new idioms and apis that can teach them about software design when something breaks in their configuration they learn how to read an error message i know controversial in 2024 they learn to debug software systems they learn about rolling back about lock files they may even create a pr to fix a problem they build solutions for themselves and are able to rapidly iterate on them towards something that solves a real world problem for them they're their own by the way i love building a solution for yourself i think a lot of people don't don't do that enough they constantly try to build a solution for everybody especially in this modern day and age of you know i got to get the best portfolio out i got to make like a a big splash open- source project i got to do something to be able to get you know you got to get all these things but instead it's just like maybe you need to build something for yourself honestly my most successful open source project had nothing to do with anybody but how i envisioned navigating files and that's simply because this was for me it was only for me it was never for anybody else it was for me by me 5.4 th000 stars that's pretty good right that's a that's a decently sized thing w selfish exactly it is selfish break it build it determine tj oace d we got oace tj oh dude even tj when i pause him gets good faces what's that about what is that about the fact that if you pause me i'm like you know i just make it the dumbest dude this man is this man's making mr beast thumbnails even when i'm pausing own customer this person has learned a lot even if they end up with exactly the same code as person one both people spend a lot of time on neovim and the but the first one though was a solution copier and the second a problem solver the skills attitudes and perspectives characterizing the problem solver are helpful in many other domains even if ai takes overwriting software for them forever and they never get to use a modal text editor again which obviously would be very sad agreed rip mo modal text editors love modal text editors they're very fantastic in the examples i gave you can replace neovim with whatever technology you want react spel rust hx xl whatever it doesn't matter the pattern and the idea is the same and my ultimate point here is that you get to choose how you're going to tackle problems and the takeaways you'll have from actually solving that problem to move from copy paster to gigachad problem solver as someone in my chat put it largely revolves around you deciding to start thinking and asking questions today and that's pretty much it then you make that same choice tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that and then you just keep doing that in a practical example in practical terms of something you could try to do this with just build something for yourself that solves a real problem that you have it's okay if someone else has already built it the point is that you're going to build it for yourself to see if you can solve this problem something difficult when making products for other people particularly in you know large businesses or with a bunch of other people working on the project it's very hard to distinguish good feedback from loud feedback it's common to have some loud feedback that seems to overwhelm and outweigh all of the other feedback that you are getting absolutely right again paused it absolutely fantastic face again totally normal looking person not sure how he does this this man is not real it is ai this might be this might be sora but he's 100% right on this one and this is again why making something for yourself so i i'm going to give you one little strategy that i personally like to do is that i will build something and i kind of do as he puts it the i have something i want to build and i like hack my way through it i find the first api that kind of works i do this i do that and i just build it and whenever i build it it's ugly i didn't like it i didn't like a lot of the things i did i didn't like the the ways i handled it i did that and that what it does is i go okay i have some things i need to investigate what it does is first iteration for me is not even learning first iteration for me is what do i need to learn so by me building this real-time engine with with with with go and neovim something that i realized i really need to understand with go because i didn't really know what to learn with go right the syntax is super easy but what do i need to learn to be effective with go well i learned that i just using channels isn't the right way i need a little bit more i need to be able to add in some context i need to be able to kind of like how do you structure a program such that when a user say closes their tcp connection or the server wants to close the tcp connection like like it has a nice uniform way clear make sure all the memory is cleared out there's no dangling anything there's no running g funks that are just forever stopped on some sort of select statement like how do i use this and how do i build something in a more holistic way that is actually useful and i would have never come to that conclusion as the thing that i need to learn about go unless if i would have first built something and just hacked my way through it and so it's like one of these things is that even knowing what to learn is such a hard hard thing to do and so by building something yourself you will learn where you're bad and what you don't understand or you will learn what you don't like why does this why does this part feel difficult i need to research why this feels difficult cuz with my current understanding in tool set i can't solve the problem in a way that feels like scalable so thank you by the way for that hype train genuinely appreciate it and you'll have fun doing it that's the best part when you build something for yourself it's fun right you got no stakeholders demanding time it's just you building something that's actually making your life better you're like i have this problem i'm going to solve this problem this problem will make me more effective it will give me something i like i will be able to have more something if i just solve this thing boom you're motivated you're happy you're intrinsically motivated which by the way intrinsic motivation is always going to be your str strongest source to finish things if you are extrinsically motivated you will often find yourself going in and out of hype cycles right because when you're extrinsically motivated and you have to do something boring you're like h and you're going to sludge through it and it's just so awful but when you're intrinsically motivated that's just one necessary step to the end and you're like oh yeah now i got to do this part here we go like i have to refactor some of my go- code do you think i'm excited about refactoring i largely don't love refactoring i find refactoring to be a lot of kind of pain in the ass it just means i didn't make good decisions to begin with it means i have to go learn a new effective way to do stuff and but i'm so motivated to do that because i want to finish my little engine so now i actually like this refactor because this refactor purpose is to learn how to use context and channels effectively and then apply it to a problem i already understand beautiful for real i love refact refactoring for the point of just simply taking a problem and changing it into a new way i often don't like because it just means typically what it means is that i i i just simply messed up and now i need to take a moment to try to make a better api and i oft what what that usually means to me is that i'm going to do this exact same operation again here in two months i'm going to do that exact same operation again here in two months because whenever you refactor what you're saying is i don't understand this problem well enough to create a solution that's going to hold or things change and so for me it's just like damn i'm going to have i know i'm going to do it again so i'm going to meet i'm going to meet this goal right here i'm going to try to refactor it into something that's going to be useful for longer and then i find that i can go longer i can enjoy the api have set up but eventually some new requirement comes in that defeats my previous refactor and so then i have to rethink about where are things at i'm not sure i've ever written something that was correct the first time i've done a couple corrects i've done couple corrects but they're always very limited the more limited your scope the more simple your your your correctness is right well tiny corrects yeah t small corrects like one time i was building a program with someone in 2016 it was a it was a it was a it was an arbitrage bot for cryptocurrencies and we did it in no js bless my heart hey just let it happen okay just let it happen and one small thing i built back then this is when pr await and async of weight was just kind of coming out is that i did a little weight function right and so you just handed it some milliseconds and it handed you back out of promise that would resolve great little api there's never a needed item again from it it was absolutely fantastic and so i was very happy about that that's an example of just building something just some small abstraction correct once but it's such a tiny problem that almost everybody would have got that correct once you expand that it just gets progressively more and more difficult i've written that six times already i dude i i actually had that function on a neovim hotkey which is space ww and it would actually just write function or a or function weight number number return promise void just just write the whole thing oh man it was funny so the nice thing about building something for yourself by yourself was the bot successful yes the bot was very successful but the problem is is that i just needed more cash to be able to do a proper arbit bot especially when you're doing cross exchanges so we did cross exchanges we did a m we did a we did a a minmax flow a max flow algorithm across graphs being able to do like a min cut and be able to do this kind of like hey you want to change through five different currencies across three different exchanges and you will make how much money the big problem came down to of course being able to transfer stuff out of exchanges and b just having enough money for that to actually work i needed millions of dollars we made i think one day we made like $55,000 it was awesome but then as things got like once you started making money unless if you had like a good relationship with these with these places i couldn't transfer out more than like ,000 and so then it's just like you're stuck and so you're just unless if you have tons of money you can't right were you arbitraging internationally i was doing it across kraken bitf bitf bitf bit bit bit something binance coinbase so you know we had four different things i dude i i made zero dollars in the end okay okay you know i bit connect bit connect bit bit bit finex bit fex bit these nuts i can't remember anyways at the end of the day i made no money with with cryptocurrency okay i some the the easy if you were in 2016 the proper thing was just a huddle okay i didn't huddle i thought i could be smarter than the market and typically whenever you think you're smarter than the the market you always lose okay i'm a loser i learned a very valuable lesson which is never be smarter than the market bisco i'm not even i'm not even playing that video self is you get to be that loud and obnoxious user and then eventually you'll get to decide if you've solved your problem or not and if you didn't that's okay you iterate as i tell my three-year-old son it's okay to fail that's part of how we learn the important part is that we use our roughness and our toughness to try again and you can translate that to any age appropriate way of saying that for you i love that we read that article yesterday where i for julia talked about how she was scared and all these different reasons with software development and how fear makes bad software and all that kind of stuff and it fundamentally comes down to a lot of people are afraid of failure and like unless if you have it ingrained in your body that failure is natural and failure really is the only way to learn then you're going to be forever stuck in this permanent this you're going to be forever stuck in impostor syndrome right it's true it's you just i it sucks it's a ch it's it's a it's an it's an unfortunate product of our society you know what i mean and we can blame it on this that and the other right some people had childhoods where they grew up and they got over punished right and so therefore they're like well you know i got over punished like but you know those things right why is it stopping you now the thing is is once you know you got to try to make corrections at all points you know and if you are afraid to do something to be brave is to to to not be not afraid it's to do something while afraid right there's a difference between the two in conclusion what i want to make clear though is that i'm not saying solution copiers are bad people or that i don't like them instead i'm trying to communicate that i would be a bit more concerned if all the skills that i've developed d around regurgitating existing solutions that to me seems an area that is more likely to be automated by ai in some fashion and more quickly than other areas of software development agreed agreed that's because there's there's the the answers are a bit clear like getting a website that has three boxes that has different price points and a log in with clerk and hosted on for sale like you're not really doing anything right at some point an ai will do that it just will now right now even maybe even devon could do that right now and that's because it's not doing something that is in itself impressive i don't like giving advice on the internet mostly because life is much too complicated for someone to explain their situation to me and then it's much too complicated for me to explain my advice to them through this medium again how many times have we seen in chat where someone's like hey should i learn x or y hey this happened at my job what should i do it's just like yo this is a bad place to get this is a bad place to try to get advice cu i don't know your situation i don't know you i don't know who you're talking about and is my life experience good to give you advice on this one right i should i ditch arch and try to find a wife yes so i i generally don't give advice but sort of despite this advice for me like be curious pay attention work hard don't be afraid to fail those have never really led me astray thinking this way once again in my opinion right gives someone the best chance at success regardless of how quickly and thoroughly ai expands into other software fields i don't know what the future is going to look like i'm just a regular mortal i put my pants on two legs at a time but i do think even discounting did tj just admit that he sits down while he puts his pants on tj sits and puts his pants on on the floor he probably is like up in the air just just putting his pants on ridiculous absolutely ridiculous pants put on sitter yeah dude pants put on dude he's doesn't make any sense here all the arguments i made throughout the video right that if your current hypothesis is that billions of new lines of code are going to be generated it seems likely that truly understanding some things about code now not everything not every language not every framework not every type system but just some things about software itself that seems to me to be a beneficial skill compared to many other possible skills you might have or might want to learn particularly if you like learning about it and you want to get really good at it i hope that this can be encouraging to you to both learn and work hard in your software endeavors and also some confidence that maybe even if we never get to write code again that a lot of what we're learning can be really useful and transferred to other domains let me know what you think let me know if you like the video thanks everybody i love you see you later it's the w it's a w by the way you should like tj for those that don't know what a weirdo if you don't know who tj tj is right here here i'll just give him a proper shout out t dv there you go there's a proper shout out with tj generally i i find that i i almost exclusively agree with tj tj is one of the few people that i would definitely echo chamber with hard very good guy please keep your pants on prime i'm trying to keep my pants on okay but it just feels so good to take him off go like this video apparently i can't copy pasta all right go like the video go give him a go give him a a sub on the youtubes absolutely fantastic someone just said in the chat that hey i left for an hour and came back and he's still on the same video yo dog this was a this was a 15minute video you think that you think that i'm taking less than an hour to watch it come on man there was a lot of sauce in there we had to think about things i want we we wanted to talk about it right you gotta talk about it you gotta think like real talk if you're watching videos by yourself you should pause them for a second and think about what is being said you know what i mean you should take a moment to think about that because it is such a it's it's it's it there's so much dense information even in simple statements and taking a moment to like argue with yourself why it's true and why it's false is really good what's the longest video i watched on stream oh man i did like a 20 some minute video and it literally was like an hour and 40 minute outcome it's why it's why i typically it's why i typically don't watch longer videos on stream just because it it it takes entirely too long for me to get through them you know what i mean you know another piece of advice that i actually thought was really good i think this one was this was given to me by alex heros which thus which which in turn got it from somebody else well actually it was given to me by my wife who was who received it from alex heros who received it from somebody else but what i got was it's not about how many books you read it's about how many good books you read and when you find a good book read it multiple times and so i find that i i like when i find a good book i will read a section multiple times there's one book that i've read a section i mean i i've done many books where i i reread something over and over and over again because i want to understand the point like one thing i've really struggled with understanding is there's a there's one of the great poets one of the great english poets his name was coolidge he was considered one of the last men to know to to know everything he had he had a degree in physic he had a degree in he he just like knew everything he's one of the last last men to know everything and that was a and he wrote poetry he wrote like a rhyme of the ancient mariner right and so trying to understand his philosophy on god and life is extremely difficult cuz he never quite wrote it down and he had a lot of rambling thoughts on it so it's like it took a a a physic physic back then it's called physic it's called physic right which isn't physics it's like that was like medicine right what's his name benjamin rush also another physic guy right founding father america for those that don't know benjamin rush very interesting story i've gone through half of his biography but anyways like going over and over again through someone's argument is really really difficult you know because you really want to understand it like i you do you do the same thing with like data structures right to understand data structures you can't just simply watch a video once like a really good example is what i want you to do is i want you to go on youtube and i want you to watch how b tree deletions work and every single video you will watch on how b tree deletions work completely skip a very important step all of them i i watched every last one of them and all of them skip a very important step and so it is very very interesting to watch how it's going how do you delete something when you have multiple intermediate nodes in between right and so like how do you rem merge up a tree they never mentioned the fact that you need to rem merge up a tree and all that and so just like watch it think about it and then how do you do that you have to take all the things they've said and reapply it into this one situation and so it's like i think this is a lot what tj is saying in this video which is it's not about the simple act of completing it right it's not about oh i read 10 books this year no it's like did you understand one book well does that make sense i'd rather understand one book well than have read 10 books yeah good times hey the name weird tangent at the end there that was a very bizarre t a very very very bizarre tangent at the very end someone said chesterton mentioned i've actually never read anything from chesterton i've only read a couple of his little little things but i would i there there will be a day there will be a day we'll see a j
