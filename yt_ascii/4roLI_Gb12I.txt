hello everyone i'm pleased to announce my new tour for 2024 beginning in early february and running through june tammy and i an assortment of special guests are going to visit 51 cities in the us you can find out more information about this on my website jordanbpeterson.com as well as accessing all relevant ticketing information i'm going to use the tour to walk through some of the ideas i've been working on my forthcoming book out november 2024 we who wrestle with god i'm looking forward to this i'm thrilled to be able to do it again and i'll be pleased to see all of you again soon bye-bye this is where i'm most optimistic it's what parents can do we've known this for you know since the beginning of time how to raise good people and we've done it and the way to do it in our over with these overtreated kids is to proceed by subtraction remove the psych meds they don't need the diagnosis you don't believe in the over monitoring over coddling over accommodation if you do that you will raise good kids and you don't have to be as afraid of the teacher in school who doesn't share your values and you don't have to be as terrified of social media because your kid is [music] ready hello everyone today i'm talking to abigail shrier i last talked to her about two years ago when i first when i first reemerged on the podcast scene she was the first person i talked to in this new series of podcasts and she had just published her book irreversible damage the transgender craze seducing our daughters so i was quite apprehensive about talking to her because i mean that's a hot topic now but it was like a verboten topic at that point and i was barely on my feet anyways we had a very good conversation which i think eventually youtube took down if i remember correctly because as you know there's nothing that you can't talk about less than the transgender issue anyways abigail has a new book coming out bad therapy why the kids aren't growing up which is slated for release in early 2024 but which is available for purchase now she moved from her concern with the transgender phenomena and the medical barbarism that accompanied its hypothetical treatment to an analysis a much broader analysis of what has gone wrong with the therapeutic enterprise as such now that's that's something about which you can talk about for a very long time and we do in fact talk about that for about an hour and a half on youtube and then peripherally for another half an hour on the daily we plus side so you can join us for that welcome aboard so i think it's about two years since we talked and if if i remember correctly you were the first guest i had on again after i more or less got back on my feet and made me very nervous because you'd written this contentious book and i was sure that we'd get thrashed to death by youtube which we did but but but what you've done is extremely useful and it looks to me to some degree as if the tide might be turning and so i don't know what you think about that maybe you could start by telling people about your second last book and then we can talk about your new one which is going to be releasing relatively soon but let's walk through let's walk through your first book and tell everybody sure thank you so much for having me on again jordan it's great to be here and so my first book was about there sudden rise in transgender identification among teen girls we were seeing this huge rise in it of course it was very contentious subject matter and i hypothesized it was part of a social contagion kids on the inter you know on social media and talking to each other their friends and therapists actually and deciding they were transgender and rushing to to start hormones and surgeries and one of the things i learned when i interviewed hundreds of parents as i did and at this point i've talked to over a thousand is first of all how much therapy kids were getting to how much parents were relying on therapists to not only help them with their kids but to guide their parenting and three i learned just how much mischief therapists were making because they often made this sense of being transgender much much worse they reified it in these kids so then i began to wonder what other kinds of mischief were therapists making with kids i see so you're you're trying to make yourself even more popular than you've already being made a yeah well you know seven years ago i started to think well i longer than that but i suppose i said it publicly seven years ago i started to think that the universities were doing more harm than good you know and that's a hell of a thing to think after you've spent 25 years at top tier universities trying to provide people with a genuine education and now i certainly i certainly believe the universities are doing more harm than good and i mean we saw a spectacular example of that in dc last week which was i thought when i watched that clip of the mit upen and harvard presidents that it was the worst thing i'd seen on the news in my life you know it just that glimpse that it gave everyone into this bottomless pit of victim victimizer false moral narrative and its unbelievably simple-minded and pernicious effects stunning but you know i have thought too increasingly in recent years that therapy does more harm now than it does good and i think the reason for that is that you know when i was at mill in the 80s and then through most of my career the clinical psychologists i knew were it was hard to become a clinical psychologist and they were well trained they were scientifically trained and they were careful and methodical especially the behaviorists you know and the psychoanalysts they were rare and generally extremely intelligent and more creative and open and so i thought the therapeutic enterprise was a pretty admirable was pretty admirable and i really enjoyed being a clinician but the whole field got invaded by people who have no nowhere near the intelligence or the wisdom to be doing what they're doing the sort of naive social worker types who are ideology addled to the nth degree and i i work i had a colleague at harvard richard mcnelly who was very concerned about the instilling of false memories by foolish therapists that started to become a real issue in the 1990s and you know and it was all a consequence of therapists who had one theory about pathology insisting that it explained absolutely everything in the universe of moral striving let's say and that that weakness that was obvious there has just magnified itself tremendously so tell so this is my fear and my shame for that matter tell me what so you broadened out from your concern the concern you started to develop in relationship to the trans phenomenon per se so let's tell me more about what you saw there in terms of the therapist's facilitating these identity disorders tell me why you became curious about that generalization and then most painfully of all explain what you discovered sure so in in in researching bad therapy i first of all i started out with a totally different hypothesis i knew that we were these kids were getting more mental health intervention than any generation prior the rising generation i knew that they were getting more diagnosis and more psych meds and more therapeutic intervention in schools but i still didn't think therapy was necessarily the problem because while 40% of them were getting therapy it still wasn't a majority and yet we'd seen their mental health fall apart we knew that the rise in therapy and therapeutic intervention was somehow coinciding with worse mental health that that of course shouldn't be the case like with breast cancer you know more access more treatment better treatment and more access to it has seen you know rates of death from breast cancer plummet and that's what we would expect to see with mental health and we're not seeing that but i still thought you know it was possibly just the way kids were being raised maybe they were being raised differently or perhaps it was just a smartphone and then i began to look into what the iatrogenic effects of therapy are what are the what are the ways that therapy can hurt you and there's a literature on this unfortunately it's not a literature most therapists want to acknowledge they want to claim that therapy has this amazing power to heal but that it can never hurt and of course there's no treatment for for which that's true anything you know tylenol can damage your liver anything that can help can also harm and so i began to look into well were these kids getting a lot more therapy and not only were the harms we were seeing in this generation the lack of agency the listlessness the family alienation the anxiety depression all effects of you know iatrogenic effects of therapy harmful effects of bad therapy but we were seeing this we were seeing this you know in in it was sorry it was being applied not not only from actual therapists but all over the schools and and from parents parents were having therapists guide their parenting and schools were having therapists do trauma informed care with all the kids so i started realizing that these kids were getting a lot more psychological intervention that i realized and that it was bad okay so what let's talk about trauma informed care and let's talk about why you concluded that it was bad i mean you pointed first of all to the fact that as there's been more and more therapeutic invent intervention you know as the schools and the universities have been turned into therapeutic hot beds the outcome is that mental health has become worse now you know obviously self-serving therapists are going to say well that's just more evidence that even despite our efforts even more therapy is necessary right that's the logical response to that but obviously you're not convinced that that's the case and you're implying at least or maybe making a direct accusation that there's something about the therapeutic industry per se that's actually making mental health worse now greg lukanov certainly has is making that case and i would say it's a case that jonathan height is probably what would you say he's he's he's supportive of of of that implication why did you come to the conclusion that the enterprise is doing more harm than good and what evidence is there for that do you think well because they're not treating the sick they're treating the well so we know that the risk of iatrogenesis of the healer introducing a harm is greatest when you're treating people who don't need the treatment to begin with okay so we know that if you're if you're gushing blood going to an r er is an important thing to do it's necessary it's lifesaving but if you have a small bruise you're likely to get you're much more at risk of getting an infection from the er picking up picking up you know a a mera or some other bacteria from an emergency room visit than you are at you know than you stand to benefit and the same is true with preventive care we we shifted from treating kids and treating adolescents with severe mental health problems to the idea that everyone should have therapy and there we exposed a vast population to risk the risk of all the known harms of therapy now you know i'm not someone who's against therapy i'm not someone who denies that it can be important and very useful and even curative but when you treat kids who are actually don't have a severe problem you're at much greater risk that they're just going to the therapist will just introduce harms and i saw it firsthand certainly with the kids who convinced themselves that they were transgender very often with a therapist the idea was reified and and i and we see that across the board from everything from anxiety depression family alienation the loss of a sense of agency we're seeing in the rise of generation they have a external locus of control in rates we've never seen before they don't believe they can improve their own life and they are highly treatment dependent they think they have to call a therapist or an adult before they make any decision these are young adults who feel that they can't make a decision in their lives so we're seeing a lot of the harms that the that therapy can cause in those are the same ones that plague the rising generation right okay so you're you're pointing to a couple of factors that play a causal role let's say in the pathologization of therapy recipients the first would be false diagnosis so for example with the kids who have so-called gender dysphoria i mean you can look at this technically and it's quite straightforward thing to do so basically when it when when anyone is in a position where they might be seeking or are likely to be offered psychotherapy the fundamental reason for that is generally an excess of negative emotion and a dir of positive emotion so what you essentially see it's very rare for people to be brought to the attention of the therapeutic enterprise voluntarily or involuntarily unless they're anxious and depressed so the first thing you assume if you're a therapist if you have any sense is that the anxiety and depression is the cardinal reality then there's a subset then you can become more precise after that you might say well for this adolescent or adult their proclivity toward excess negative emotion takes the place of bodily concern for example that's more common among women generally speaking it's more common among young women in fact it might be almost universally prevalent among young women especially at that puberty cusp and then you assume that the misattribution of the depression and anxiety to the bodily transformations is a con is the is to be the target of the most specific interventions right you don't jump to the conclusion that if the person's depressed and anxious and they show signs of body dysmorphia then they're born in the wrong body and they need surgical intervention there's so many things wrong with that line of logic that it's almost a miracle that it could ever be established right and one of the errors that's most egregious in that regard is that you don't recommend the most damaging potential and irreversible treatment when you could start with something much simpler like i interviewed khloe cole right she's a famous d transitioner she's having a rough time on every university campus she goes to and she's suing the psychopathic butchers who destroyed her physiologically and and damaged her future and she told me when i talked to her that no therapist had ever even explained to her two simple facts number one that when women hit puberty when girls hit puberty there levels of negative emotion reliably rise and that they because boys and girls have about the same level of negative emotion but it switches at puberty and then women have more negative emotion comparatively speaking on average for the rest of their life and there's lots of reasons for that but the reasons in some ways are irrelevant it's the fact that's relevant it's like well you're 12 you're confused and anxious lots of people who are confused and anxious feel that they're the only people that feel that way right especially when they're looking at everybody's facebook page and their instagram page and all they see is this glamorous lie that people put forward in relationship to their own life and then they're especially if they're isolated kids they can't talk to anyone about it they feel they're the only people in the world who feel that way so one of the things you do if you're a therapist that has even an iota of a clue is say all these things that you think are characteristic of you are actually they're normative and so you can't be thinking that there's something specifically wrong with you even though you're suffering and then so no one had ever explained that to her and which is just appalling right such a lapse of professional standard that it's that it's jaw-dropping and then they also didn't explain to her that here's one of the things that differentiates men from women is that when men experience negative emotion they tend to focus on their comparative socioeconomic status when women experience negative emotion they tend to they tend to focus on bodily image and the reason for that likely is that men are evaluated by women more harshly for their relative status and women are evaluated more harshly by men for their physiological appearance for the general appearance and so there's there's a logic to it but no one explained to her that it was highly likely in the case of an adolescent girl who was undergoing puberty and early and she also said a she told me that she recognized quite early maybe around 11 that when she went through puberty she was going to have a relatively boyish feature figure and she had kind of envisioned herself as khloe kardashian right this super curvy marilyn monroe excess you know what it's almost like a parody in some ways but you can imagine that standing forward as a as a kind of ideal she thought she was going to be boyish and there was a part of her that thought well if i'm going to be boyish maybe i could just be a boy you know which is a really kind of ai delusional 11-year-old thought that should be dispensed with by anyone credible in about 15 seconds but that was enough to start her searching down the wrong rabbit hole and then you know she got herself put in the hands of these absolutely criminally incompetent therapists and they didn't even offer her the first two bits of information that anyone with any sense would have presented to her instead they shunted her down the bloody hormonal transformation road and that's almost a certain pathway to you know longer term well trouble for sure and even surgical intervention and so god it's just it's just you just can't believe that such things are happening you know and so and some of the important things that you mentioned you know to to me is that or the salian things that you mentioned is first of all that's completely standard for therapists what what those therapists did to khloe cole is completely standard affirming increasing their their whatever they came in with agreeing with them the patient and of course altering their self- understanding with a diagnosis and when i interview kids i interviewed this one young woman nora who's at a high school here in los in in the in los angeles area and she told me that most of her high school class not only h is in therapy but they all have this diagnosis they identify with they a mental health diagnosis that is one of the classic negative effects of therapy is that a patient will come to identify with their diagnosis and we're seeing that across the board now many many people say well to me well isn't it just social media isn't this all just coming from social media i i think that's an important question i certainly am someone who you know warned about the harms of social media in my last book i certainly think it's had a bad impact on youth mental health but is it just social media no i don't think it is the mental health deterioration we're seeing and it's for few reasons in 2016 the cdc came out with a report that two that one in six kids between the ages of 2 and8 had a mental health or behavioral diagnosis one in six kids that's in 2016 they didn't have social media not ages 2 to8 they didn't and they didn't have smartphones either so the we know since the 1950s american youth and youth in the west has that mental health has been in precipitous decline and i think social media is a part of that but i don't think it totally answers it and there are there are two questions i would put to anyone who would argue well the answer is just social media the first is why why has social media been so bad for youth mental health a lot of people they talk about comparing young people's me their bodies and lives to each other certainly teenage girls do that a lot but boys don't tend to so that doesn't totally explain it and the second is why in the last eight years have we done nothing about it in fact we've given devices and social media to younger and younger kids so i i think both of those answers are intimately connected to to what the mental health experts have done we are experiencing a lot of global instability as we plunge into primary season the economy is unstable and political tensions are high there's no telling what the next few months will bring how are you protecting your family in the midst of all this chaos the fact is there is one asset that has withstood famine wars and political and economic upheaval dating back to biblical times and that's gold and don't think it's too late to diversify an old ira or 401k into gold birch gold group can help you do just that with birch gold you can create a wellth thought-out and balanced investment strategy they'll help you convert an existing ira or 401k into an ira gold without paying a penny out of pocket diversify into gold today just text jordan to 9898917350 so you you you talked about it as being standard practice you know to affirm well there's something else we should point out here too that's part of the absolute toxicity of the present environment is that it's not only standard practice if you don't do it as a therapist your college your your governing board will come after you especially if someone complains so if you're a therapist and you dare say especially you can imagine a situation where you're dealing with an adolescent and the parents have somewhat different views of the problem and you say to the family as you should say don't rush into any long-term decisions you know this girl who thinks she's a boy or vice versa the former is more common the evidence suggests that 80% of people in that situation will grow out of it by the time they're' and that the do no harm pathway forward is to provide therapeutic counseling perhaps but not to do anything precipitous now one parent takes objection to that maybe a narcissistic parent with borderline personality disorder because that tends to be the case in such situations and decides to write to the college of psy psychologists the governing body or to the college of physicians well under the current law and the current culture the probability that your life will there then instantly be turned upside down in some permanent way and that your livelihood itself will be threatened and your reputation savaged even assuming that you don't face legal repercussions is extremely high so what i've watched this has all happened as a consequence of all that bloody flag waving about eliminating the conversion therapy that was never occurring to begin with right it's all these consequences of these adle paded ideologically enforced laws and so in canada i've been faced with the spectacle of my colleagues knowing full well that everything that's happening on the transgender front is a complete bloody murderous lie being absolutely unwilling to say anything in public because if they do their livelihoods will be instantly threatened by their governing boards so it's not just standard practice it's it's you do it or else and then that's combined with the fact in canada here's another example the governing boards that that that accredit university programs that produce clinical psychologists now and this is happening with all the therapeutic endeavors are refusing to grant accreditation to any university that doesn't orient their clinical training towards social justice and so let's unpack that so now you train therapists that the world is made up of victims and victimizers and you insist that they adopt that guys and now you go out as a therapist and some poored girl comes to talk to you when she's 13 and confused and you pay a tremendous amount of attention to her when she puts your in the victim position you covertly reinforce that partly because you have to legally and partly because you've been addled by your training and one of the things you know if you're a behavioral therapist is that whatever is rewarded will make itself manifest and so these poor kids that you're talking about who take their mental health diagnosis as their identity they do that because they acrew the benefits of differential attention for doing so it's unbelievably toxic and it's such an indict of our entire education system too you imagine that what we're offering young people as a vision of the future is so unbearably toxic and counterproductive that they will choose to be diagnosed with a mental health disorder in preference to normality yeah i mean that's right obviously but but there's another problem which is why are parents handing over their kids to therapists at at the first first indication of any problem in fact any no matter how minor deviation from a benchmark they go to diagnose and medicate and the problem is not only do we not know what goes on in that room not only does the profession make no make no effort to track harmful effects of their interventions unlike doctors who are mandated you know to report side effects of their drugs not only is that going on but you know we're seeing kids have these harms and there's no feedback mechanism anxiety is worse therapists don't tra track whether their whether their treatments have made anxiety worse or depression worse for a kid and we know therapy can do that and we certainly know the therapeutic interventions the focus on feelings constantly constantly ruminating on sad moments in your life the way they're asked to in school all of that is very bad for mental health and and constantly questioning everything you're going to do before you do it all of these are the opposite of what we would want young people to do and that's what therapeutic school schooling efforts have done parenting efforts have done and and and actual therapists have done and and i'll say you know the last thing is that you know parents unwillingness to assert their own authority in their homes has been a disaster because it let therapists in the door to be that authority and unfortunately unlike parents therapists are incentivized to keep the least sick coming back for the longest period of time well i'm going to defend parents for a moment because sure well i'd like to shed light on why they do that i mean the the the narcissistic compassionate types you know so they're the ones that tilt towards borderline personality disorder let's say so we know maybe that about half the mothers of daughters who have rapid onset gender dysphoria and who move forward with therapy and treatment up to half of them are diagnosable with something like borderline personality disorder that's a big problem so one of the characteristics of people with borderline personality disorder is that they will manipulate other people in any way that you could possibly imagine to gain attention for themselves and if that means sacrificing their children to their pretentions of compassion that's no problem at all now if you're in a relationship with someone like that the probability that you're going to be able to withand that pressure especially when the system itself is is has its guns aimed on you and if you do stand up and say you know i i don't think my child should be heading in that direction that you're going to be pillared as uncaring and as a victimizer and then it's even worse because the bloody therapists and this is where i'm most appalled about my colleagues who accepted this claim emanating from the worst of the psychopaths that well you know would you rather would you rather have a live trans child or a dead child now i tell you man there's not a parent an ordinary parent like a non psychologically trained planet parent on the planet who when faced with that accusation by a physician or a psychologist isn't going to fold say oh my god this is worse than i thought there's some risk that my child will commit suicide and if i don't get on board with this in every possible way and something terrible happens it's going to be laid at my feet and then if the accusations of being uncaring and victimizing are going along with that well it's just and then the other thing too that's happening abigail is that parents just can't believe these things are happening in their schools you know like i'm seeing this in canada i i know canadians are so asleep that it's kind of miracle and i've tried to think that through it's like okay how can people be so bloody blind and then i think okay you can stay blind and assume that it's still 1990 so roughly speaking the political parties do what they say they'll do and they're trustworthy the legacy media isn't lying all the time the educational institutions aren't completely corrupt the judiciary is still intact the legal system hasn't twisted itself into knots or you can dismiss all that as some sort of right-wing conspiratorial thinking and continue along your merry path and if the price you pay for that is that the the psychopathic teachers get their claws in your child by the time you figure that out it's going to be a bit too late and i'm really seeing this in especially in canada it's like people even if you bring these things to their attention they think and i can understand this they think there's no way things can be that bad you have to be imagining it and now and then i' i've stepped back and thought well jesus you know i did get harassed by my university and my governing board which is still going on and so maybe i've got more paranoid than i should be you know and then i see what happened in washington dc with the presidents of upen mit and harvard and i think oh no i saw this seven years ago as clear as a bell and it's worse even than i think and certainly it's making itself manifest in this pathological therapeutic environment right now you said something very interesting too here's something something cool so if you do statistical analysis you can group self you can group the statements that make people that people make about themselves into categories and so one category is negative emotion and so if you have if you're high in the trait of negative emotion be associated with depression and anxiety you feel more shame and more guilt more anxiety and more depression self-referential state ments of all kinds load with neuroticism okay this is an unbelievably important discovery they load so completely that the personality test used for assessing neuroticism the the most common one the neop has self-consciousness as a subset of neuroticism so that means there's no difference between being self-conscious and being depressed and anxious they're they're not linked they're the same thing so now you go to therapy a and the halfwit therapist does nothing but make you self-conscious right well why does so and the and the implication is and your teachers in school do the same thing your teachers guide you in social emotional learning they do emotions check-ins they are constantly asking you how are you feeling it is the best way to induce depression and anxiety in kids and that's what they're doing nonstop and unfortunately parents are not only handing over their kids to these people but they're doing it themselves they're constantly checking in they're letting therapists guide their parenting instead of taking the reigns back and doing what we know works better with kids number one is parental authority which of course doesn't mean being cold it doesn't mean being cruel it just means that that the parents make the rules for the house not some therapist well we could so this also speaks to the issue of pos of identity you know and i've i've been trying to take this apart because i'm so embarrassed about the clinical enterprise now and i thought you know our whole notion of mental health is actually it's it's corrupt and the reason for that is that we think mental health is mental it's inside it's subjective right and if you're healthy it's because you're self-actualizing right and if you're unhappy it's because the self isn't properly organized as an interior structure but the problem with that is it's just it's actually not true and you can tell that's not true because you can't be happy in a miserable marriage and the reason you can't be happy in a miserable marriage is because you're you but you're also your married self and then you're your married self plus your friendships and your business relationships and your ties to the broader community and what what what psychological well-being is it's not even the right term what what human well-being is is proper situation in a hierar archy that includes the social environment and so what that implies is that the more you think about yourself the less you're focusing on how to establish solid reliable and reciprocal social relations right an intimate relationship friendship the bonds of a family and then the the the n the what would you say the less tightly [music] wound binding that you have with the broader community in the absence of all that you concentrate on yourself well not only you're miserable and depressed and anxious you're also isolated lonely and insane and that all stems from that initial presumption that all we would have to do is get your head straight and you'd be sane it's like and so you think what does that also mean for the identity of kids because we should be teaching them look you're going to have to take your place in the world you need a partner you need some friends you need an occupation you need an educational plan like you have to situate yourself in the world none of that's relevant anymore all that is is oppression it's no bloody wonder the kids choose a mental health diagnosis as the alternative to the normality that's nothing well we what we did was we g gave kids these incredibly unhealthy lives as you said these atomized lives and we told them that they were so unique in the world and separable and that that was all all that was important and then we poured mental health resources into an incredibly unhealthy life and then mental health experts pose as the solution to the unhappy life meanwhile they've been participating the entire time in in the idea that kids are weak in the idea that they can't get through a car ride without without an ipad that they need to be told constantly that they are loved and that they are amazing at everything they have guided everything in the wrong direction they have provided nothing that we know to be good for making kids feel you know actually achieve happiness happiness one of them is not focusing on your happiness and not making happiness your goal another thing is doing things for others in the world feeling part of a social fabric all those things that you said are so important none of those help have a role for a mental health expert which is why the mental health experts took us in the wrong direction yeah experts yeah well i watched the bloody social psychologists and the educational psychologists put forward psychological principles that were so appalling misguided for decades it was just painful to watch so one of them that emerged out of social psychology which is a discipline with plenty of sins on its conscience the whole self-esteem movement to me was just a jaw-dropping nightmare watching that as a trained clinician it's like i see so your presumption is that you can make kids feel good about themselves by celebrating non achievements that's your plan and so that swept through the school system like mad and so that was just as jean twang twang has pointed out that was just a pathway it was really what they were doing abigail was they were instructing children in how to be narcissistic and that narcissism was confused with self-esteem right and what's really strange this is quite interesting so technically speaking if you look at self-esteem scales there's actually no difference between them and scales of negative emotion it's a false construct so if you have low self-esteem which is not something that technically exists it's no different than being depressed and anxious and you don't lift people out of depression and anxiety by making them narcissistic which is what the social psychologist recommended and then the educational psychologist okay then they foster this dependency that you described so that children can't they can't even go out of their bloody house without asking for permission right everything every important decision has to be made with guidance right so they're fostering dependency like a devouring mother so they're teaching narcissism they're fostering dependence then they implement these this whole culture of trigger warning and protection which is exactly the opposite of what you would do if you were an actual like credible therapist because what you do to make people less anxious is find out what they're afraid of and then expose them in graduated doses to what they're afraid of you don't say well you're a victim and now you have to protected from everything what you do if you do that is you make them worse so lukanov has claimed and i think he's exactly right is that if the therapeutic community the educational psychologists and the social psychologists the social workers all included had set out to design a course of action to make children as mentally unstable as possible and they used the proper behavioral techniques to do so we would have ended up in exactly the situation we're in right now teaching them to be narcissistic teach them to be and destroy merit at the same time teach them to be dependent shelter them from everything and have them focus in a neverending process on their own feelings right it's so it's so diabolical that well it's the sort of thing that you know drives you down conspiratorial webs it's i can't believe it's happened it's it's jaw-dropping so what what have you seen as the manifestations of this what have you been writing about specifically in your new book so to take one example you know i interviewed a a woman i' i've known for a long time who runs a major by named evelyn i call her evelyn in the book who who runs a major cellular biology lab at one of our nation's premier research institutions and she tells me that the kids she's seeing aside from all their you know the anxiety and depression and the fact that they constantly in the last decade update her on their mental health regularly that's not something she's ever asked for but they now give her updates but the other thing is they're afraid to try for the first time even the most qualified kids with strong scientific backgrounds are afraid to make a move without checking with her and they're afraid to do anything on their own things that k kids with less ability less scientific grounding ought to be able to go for it they can't go for it their sense of agency has been eroded that's not from social media okay that's not from smartphones entirely if at all it's from an idea that you it's treatment dependency i have to check with an adult or exp bird before i do anything that's what our young adults now think and i do think that our therapeutic era and our therapeutic so-called experts have taught them this are you tired of feeling sluggish run down or just not your

your children to be neurotic the following okay so let's deem all competition inappropriate okay so any competitive enterprise is inappropriate okay so why would we do that well there is a thrill in victory but there is a catastrophe in defeat right and there's negative emotion associated with defeat and then you might say as well that the positive emotion associ victory is morally untenable because it comes at someone else's expense so that's an extension of the victim victimizer narrative okay so now you eradicate competition all right so why so in favor hypothetically of cooperation whatever you get rid of competitive games for example or or you dissuade them so now what's the consequence of that well we might say well why do you teach why do you encourage children to play competitive games and you might say well they can develop the skills it's fun and they have the possibility of winning but here's a better theory it teaches them to lose right it teaches them that that you do lose it teaches them that you can lose it teaches them that you can lose gracefully without a catastrophe and then you can get up on your feet and you congratulate the winners and you can go on playing okay so now imagine all of that's been taken away from you right right up to the time you're' you've never failed in your bloody life and so now you're terrified of it because you think that at the bottom of the failure pit is nothing but utter insanity well now that's true for you because you're a complete novice at failing how the hell are you going to take a risk right so part of what you know you you see this when you go see your kids in in a in a sporting event what you hope is that your child has enough sense to be a gracious loser and the reason there's no here's a problem position for you there's no difference between being a gracious loser and being resilient they're the same thing so we forgo competition in the name of the protection of the feelings of the losers and what we do is we demolish everybody's resilience along with these other four catastrophic failures that we listed and why did we become afraid why did we become afraid of competition why did we become suddenly fearful that our child would ever lose why did we the moment they ever did you know exhibited any behavior outside of of the norm maybe thought they had a a different gender identity why did we rush them to an expert why if they' never reached any d metric do we rush them to an e expert because we were afraid of trauma trauma was at the heart of a lot of this we became terrified of this bugaboo trauma now it isn't the case that any of these things produce trauma or damage to our kids the best psychological research of course shows that is it's the opposite resilience is the norm whenever there's a potentially traumatic effect you know event for a child but we parents became so terrified of trauma that they stopped trusting their instincts they stopped trusting what they knew was right what they knew in their bones was best for kids and instead became overly dependent on people who were very much incentivized to want to treat sick kids and to claim that the least sick were actually quite sick and continue to treat them and that's what we're seeing all right so let me offer you a terrible hypothesis okay because we might as well in for a penny in for a pound so behind this i can't help but see the spectre of the devouring mother so i'm going to lay out a hypothesis for you and it's a terrible hypothesis and i hope it isn't true but you tell me what you think about this okay so now we're in landscape where half of women who are 30 are childless and half of them will never have a child and 90% of them will regret it okay so that's 20% of women that's going to be their fate and according to jonathan height and his new research that fate is much more likely among more liberal women okay so that's the that's the statistical reality so now we're also in a situation where much of the direct care and administrative work that's associated with the education of children all the way through from kindergarten through university is in the hands of women from the ages of 20 to 40 now a subset of those women are going to have a hyperdeveloped maternal side that has the proclivity to treat anything in their view site as an infant so i'm thinking that part of the reason that we've transformed the entire educational enterprise which is fundamentally female dominated into an overgrown nursery is because it's run by w it's run by women who have misplaced their maternal instinct because and here's why i think this women have this terrible conundrum when it comes to children and it's a really tough conundrum and i think this is probably why human beings are parir bonding creatures so my daughter just had a baby and the baby is a month premature and she said the baby just wants to be with me nonstop it's like it isn't even want right it's absolute bloody need and the right attitude for a woman for the first year of a child's life starts to switch around 9 months so let's say n9 months the first nine months is every single need that child has is to be regarded as 100% accurate unquestionable and to be immediately responded to and so that instinct has to be extraordinarily powerful because infants who don't have someone around who are operating on that basis they're either going to die or they're not going to thrive and i mean the human infants are unbelievably fragile it doesn't take that much to disrupt that early bond and that can have catastrophic consequences okay so that means that women first of all have that proclivity it's at hand right and then it also means that they have to undergo this very difficult process when the child starts to mature the psychoanalysts called it the necessarily the necessary failure of the good mother is that you have to step the hell back right you got to stop doing everything for helpless infant even though that was the most spectacular manifestation of your love and you have to let the child bump up against the world and get hurt and that is a damn difficult thing to negotiate and to some degree that's when fathers step in you know because they'll encourage they have a higher threshold for child distress let's say especially in that transition from infancy to toddlerhood now you got to ask yourself we've had this radical trans demographic transformation that it's unfolded over the last 40 years and so most women half of women now at 30 are still childless what the hell's happening to that maternal proclivity and i would say well it's overpour into the educational establishments and you see that with the therapeutic industry as well and so because when i look at the universities i think oh i see everyone's an infant so it's like there's infants infant caregivers and predators that's the simple world of of that's the most simple basic feminine physiological world and i think our institutions have been transformed into what would you say neverending nurseries you know freud you know one of the things about freud that that that people have forgotten like freud pointed to the pathological narcissism of dependency inducing mothers as the biggest developmental impediment to human beings that's the edle situation no and that's an unbelievably accurate observation you know we we are very dependent human beings and we need our mothers but the fact that that maternal provision is so absolutely necessary also means it can go spectacularly wrong and something like you're you're you're looking for a solution right because you said well it can't just be social media it it's not just social media it can't just be the education system system like is it not possible that this is reflective of a more fundamental transformation in the way that men and women are operating in society there there's no question but we did come to see our kids as weak we came to see them as infants the problem is we had traditions of child rearing we had a sense of knock it off shake it off you'll be fine not for a kid a broken arm but for minor injuries we used to tell our kids that we remember that from our own childhoods but we stop trusting ourselves and rely on experts and they taught us that our kids were weak that they could never recover and i'll give you an example i got a call i got actually an email from a woman who loved my last book and she was a child psychologist from a very trained very wealth trained very good school she's in her 60s and she really wanted to be of help with my new book bad therapy so okay she's a parenting coach and a child psychologist and i and she told me with my last book i was doing the lord's work that's what she called it i said okay i would love to talk to you so i called her and said i said you know i'm going to ask you some questions about child why we're seeing so much pain in the rising generation can we speak on the record and she saidoh no no no absolutely not my my adult daughter if she finds out i talk to you she'll cut me off right right now this is a woman who's a parenting coach the number of people she should be advising on parenting is zero because she has raised a daughter to adulthood who if she disagreed with with her mother about who her mother talks to what journalist she talks to would cut her off you see we stopped taking the we stopped being devoted to making our kids strong and making them decent that used to be the goal of parenting but instead we thought oh no the the idea of parenting is to make them mentally healthy we're going to shoot for wellness and we did a terrible job of that and we didn't make them strong and we didn't make them decent so why okay so let's see if we can figure out why that happened you know like it it's it's often useful if you do a diagnosis of any given situation properly the first thing you do is look for contextual factors right now people generally don't do this to themselves if they're looking at why they are in trouble they'll look for a self- attribution right and there's some there's something about that that's admirable because it's taking responsibility but people are more determined by situations if they're healthy than they are by their own intrinsic temperament so the first thing you do as a good diagnostician is you think okay what are the overarching contextual issues here that are at play so maybe we could figure that out so you're pointing to the fact that somehow parents lost faith in their ability to even in their children's ability to direct themselves so let me offer you a couple of reasons for that you tell me what you think okay well first of all we have fewer children so that means every child is more precious if for no other reason that parents aren't outnumbered like when you have six kids you can't focus obsessively on all of them you just don't have the time plus they're torturing each other and raising each other to a fair degree but if you have one child you can focus all your attention now let's let's make that worse not only do you only have one child you didn't have that child till you were 30 and so you're pretty bloody attached to that child and it's your last chance right and you're wealthy are comparatively wealthy so now you're you're desperate to make sure that everything that could it could possibly be good happens to this child you're not going to get another chance and you have endless resources to pour into them okay so so just those and then you can imagine this as well the child doesn't have a lot of siblings doesn't have a lot of cousins and so that means that any proclivity for narcissism that that child might manifest naturally and that might be even encouraged by the parents is not going to be pounded out of them in the various ways that siblings and cousins would absolutely take it out of them right and then you add to that too the fact that children are more isolated than they were in terms of their play patterns they don't play freely together almost all play episodes are scheduled even if they're scheduled the idiot parents will often plop the kids down in front of a tv or a screen so they don't play that means they're not socializing each other and so that's a that's a very toxic brew and we we have no idea what you know the typical caucasian mother is now old first time is old enough to be the typical caucasian grandmother right it we've almost got to that point we have no idea we have no idea what that signifies in terms of of its effect on on reproductive patterns and also the case that we have so many kids that are only children that older mothers richer parents these are massive changes and it's and maybe maybe part of the consequences exactly what we're talking about is that the children are doomed to being over plus then there's a worse situation too because people are more atomized and so that also means that the multigenerational wisdom that might be a necessity for knowing how to raise children is also disappearing i just help my son and and and my daughter-in-law work through a disciplinary issue with their 12 12 month- old daughter and my son and my daughter-in-law pretty together people and i had i had told them what they could do but telling them didn't work i had to show them they couldn't really put what was necessary into practice without have without it being directly modeled and so we also don't know how much of the intergenerational wisdom that was part and parcel of an intact culture we've completely obliterated because of you know extreme social mobility for example so i think a lot of the factors you mentioned do play a role but i want to tell you why i think that the mental health experts in our complete therapeutic flooding with therapy and therapeutic concepts has played a big part in it okay and that is because we look at other cultures i interviewed a woman in who runs the georgetown emotions lab who looks and i asked her why kids were so young people were so disregulated in america when you look at other cultures and they're doing much better like japan they only have one child in japan and you you mentioned that might be a factor but they don't treat their children as fragile they're not haunted by the possibility of trauma that a spanking that anything could traumatize a child they're not haunted and they think independence for a child meaning going off and doing things without oversight is a good in fact in preschools in japan there are areas that the children could get hurt and areas where the teacher can't see and the idea is kids have to be able to negotiate their own interpersonal conflicts with each other without an adult intermediary they do the same thing in israel in israel at age eight kids are supposed to get on a bus and go to school you were look down on if your parents drive you it is not done in israel if your parents drive you to school why because they need to be able to negotiate how to get to a su a school bus and by the way along the way it turns out you do dr chova told me this that she followed these kids because she did research on these kids and along the way they were talking they were going into a bakery and buying themselves something they were talking to neighbors they were learning to handle themselves all the kid things that kids in the west used to learn to do because the parents gave them the freedom to do it before we became surveillance parents terrified of emotional injury we let kids be we let them go off and do things and handle their own conflicts and it made them strong er and then we became terrified that we couldn't let them because they would be because they were actually weak and this idea that anything could traumatize your child anything could leave a lasting psychological imprint that they could never get rid of this came right from the mental health industry this came right from the idea that the body keeps the score it holds on to your trauma forever you can never let it go it's not true according to many many experts i interviewed and it but unfortunately it's led to all kind kind of terrifi terror that any child childhood trauma causes adult psychopathology and and also also false that adult psychopathology is necessarily caused by childhood trauma neither is true nor is it true that being permanently damaged by a traumatic incident is the norm resilience is the norm so all these bad ideas i i believe really came through the vector of the mental health experts well thing okay so we might as well offer some definition so people experience negative emotion when some when an ob when an unexpected obstacle arises in their path okay and those can take two forms they can be obstacles that you can skirt or they can be obstacles that stop you in your tracks okay the more important the thing you're pursuing the more likely an obstacle that stops you in your tracks is to cause trauma okay and what the trauma is is the dissolution of the structure of direction that you were engaging in so here's an example this would be an example of a relatively serious emotional upset let's say so you're you decide you want to be a doctor and you work very hard at it and you take the mcat and you get your results and you're in the 15th percentile okay so that's likely to cause a fair bit of emotional upset and worse it you're not going to be a doctor that's gone now imagine you put 40% of your resources into that plan okay so now the trauma is that you have to sacrifice that 40% investment now then you might say well the the norm is resilience okay so the way that becomes not a trauma is you decide to become a nurse let's say and that works when you encounter an obstacle you've got two choices you can either figure out how to get around it and continue on your path or you can choose a new path if you're incapable of choosing a new path then you're traumatized now you might say well you know how serious is the trauma and the answer is well it depends on how important the plan was so here's another example let's say you're happily married and you have been for 10 years and you trust your husband implicitly then you find out that he's a serial womanizer and he's had affairs that stem back from before you were right right from the time you you started going out with him so everything you think you know about him is a lie okay so now the trauma is your whole past is a lie your present no longer exists and your future whatever the hell it is isn't what you think it's going to be and then it's even worse than that because if you were that bloody gullible how much of everything else you do is now up for question okay so that just does people in now those sorts of things do happen to people right and if they're unresolved they leave a permanent ho said if they're unresolved right now as you pointed out generally people resolve such things but not inevitably now the problem doesn't come so much with the notion that some things are traumatic the problem comes with being unable to dis differentiate between trauma you know like your marriage is over and falling off your when you're learning to ride a bike when you're going to a playground right is there has to be a distinction between levels of negative emotion and partly what you want to do with your child is you want to expose them to situations where they encounter obstacles even serious obstacles losses for example in a championship game so that they can learn strategies of resilience so so i don't think it's exactly fair to so well i don't think it's fair to put put the problem at the hands of people who make the claim that such a thing as trauma exists it's more accurate to put the blame at okay okay okay so so fine i just let me give you let me give you a a prior story to your story what if we welded the training wheels onto the bike so they could never be removed what if we started out childhood where we only gave the kids the softest fabrics and any foods they didn't like we substituted for foods they did like and if and if a dog scared them we we asked all our neighbors to crate their dogs whenever we visited and what if we told the kids over and over we affirmed all their worries and we dropped everything to deal with their worries because that's what the best experts were telling us to do what if we never let them choose a friend we didn't like or get their hearts broken and then we rush to intercede the moment they expressed any hurt they might show up to at college so unprepared not even to fail their medical you know tests but even to deal with any minor danger or discomfort that we would see what we're seeing kids having nervous breakdowns over the most humdrum challenges and in fact you know this this woman who's the head of the emotions robaba georgetown who i interviewed dr chova dutton when she said to me that when she look when she did research cross-culturally on emotional responses to dangers in young adults that american kids tend to exaggerate the degree of danger posed by small things like a stranger on the street looking at you funny that felt dangerous to american kids why because they' never had to face even these small risks themselves we were too afraid to let them yeah well that's the classic that's the classic edle nightmare so in the in the disney snow so one of the things you see about classic disney movies is that there's almost always an evil queen right and what the evil queen does is interfere with the development of the prince or the princess right so in snow white the evil queen is jealous of of the upcoming princess's beauty jealous of the fact that she gets a chance to establish a new relationship and perfectly willing to poison her because of her envy right and in sleeping beauty you have prince i think it's prince philli in sleeping beauty she locks him in a dungeon and tells him that she's going to keep him there until he's so old that nobody could possibly find him attractive and when he does manage to escape with the help of some feminine fairies little feminine fairies which are like emblematic of the mother who's actually useful she turns into like the dragon that's the ultimate predator and virtually burns him to the ground right well so this is this is the reason i'm i'm pointing out these symbolic representations is because this proclivity of symbolically feminine overprotection to become the ultimate destructive force is a motif that's been developed through the entire developmental history of humanity and its literature it's like that it's an unbelievable danger and for some reason as you pointed out it's become increasingly dominant in our culture and it's not something about which people can have very straightforward conversations you know but i i think the story that you described is exactly right now one of the things we do know too is that the mothers who are overbearing in that manner are also those who are more likely to show the kinds of they call it cluster b psychopathology so it's it's this weird intermingling of hyper compassion but it's hyper compassion turned for narcissistic purposes so look the mother that you just described here's what she can do she can tell all her neighbors and her family how much of a martyr she is for spending every bloody second of her whole whole life doing nothing but caring for her poor infant so now she's super mother and the payoff for her is well of course she can't pursue her own career of course she can't take on any responsibilities because she's so busy pouring out every excess resource she has into this child and so she's perfectly motivated to make her child as miserable and wretched as possible because that opens up the space for her overweening what maternal compassion to dominate completely so that she can parade her virtue to her friends and her neighbors right and child yeah and the child will end up overtreated they will end up diagnosed they will end up on psychotropic drugs so they never feel life at full force they never feel they can do things on their own and you know you started by talking about khloe cole and when i was researching about g you know the rapid rise in transgender identification one of the things a therapist never told her is that gender dysphoria like a lot of psychological issues isues that someone can have or or problems someone can have they actually resolve by growing up puberty often cures a lot of gender dysphoria so too i mean this is the subtitle of the book why the kids aren't growing up you're growing up believe it you know adulthood growing into adulthood is actually the cure for a lot of the troubles teenagers are beset with and if we gave kids the resources to grow up if we weren't afraid for them to be two steps away from us or for us not to surveil them constantly it and we let them grow up a lot of these problems would resolve on their own we're just not letting them well the clinical literature shows that clearly is that that it's 80% of gender dysphoria conditions resolve on their own by the age of' well it's also partly and i think this is tangled into the ideology like if we regard our culture as such as nothing but oppressive then taking your place in that culture does nothing but oppress you and make you an oppressor right so that pretty much takes everything that adulthood could offer off the table right and i certainly see this also in what schools do to young men like schools teach young men that their ambition is nothing but the manifestation of oppressive patriarchal power and so you basically take all of the benefits the moral benefits of becoming an adult off the table you don't say to a young man it's like well you know when you're a child you have the possibilities of the world at hand and and you're relatively free from care and privation but the price you pay for that is you have no independence and the beauty of being an adult is you you're free to have your adventure you're free to have your adventure you can you can sink or you can swim and there's real cost to that but the payoff is you can you can have your life and and you can do great things and you can serve other people and you can take your place as a husband and as a as a an honored member of the community and you can do useful things in the world and that's so worthwhile that giving up the pleasures of childhood is is the obvious thing to do i there isn't a school in the country i think maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration where that's ever made explicit to young people you know may maybe hill college maybe hillsdale college and that's about it yeah right but also not a home in the country and that's part of the problem so in other words you know when parents were felt comfortable being authorities in their own home with their own kids there was something for kids to aspire to but through this gentle parenting the therapist-led parenting that we're seeing where the role of the parent is really to be an empath to feel a child's pain and to adjust and accommodate it there's nothing nothing for a child to graduate too it doesn't look so great to be a child's slave and that's what parents have become so the p so there is no reason to adoles out of childhood and we're not offering them a reason there's no graduation well you can also understand why that's a vicious spiral right because you can also understand why young people would be more loath to have children under those circumstances you know when i was counseling young women my my my essential what would you call it ideological position i don't think it's ideological my essential position was it's good for you to have your career when you have your child because then what you're doing is modeling for your child the fact that adults have useful things to do and since your child is going to have to be an adult that's a good thing to model now it's going to be tricky for you to figure out how to get the balance right because you have to attend to your children a lot especially when they're young and you're going to want to to but that doesn't mean you should torture yourself with guilt because as an adult you have a life you children have to see that so they want to become adults right and so now if if the if your destiny as an adult is slave of two year-old well who the hell who the hell there's nothing more demoralizing than being a slave to a 2-year-old partly because they're little tyrants most of the time and you can't give into their the immediacy of their demands that there's no that's no way to live and it's stunningly demoralizing for the 2-year-old because there's nothing more hopeless and i've seen this in children there is nothing more existentially hopeless than a three-year-old who's in control it's like where the hell does he have to go he's already hit the pinnacle of the social world as far as he's concerned whatever he wants goes god and it's terrifying it's actually terrifying them to have that much power and and fear is another thing we're seeing in this generation they are terribly fear they also don't want to have kids this is the first generation where majority does want to have kids well we didn't make it look very good and and i think that is part of the problem we didn't give them something to hold up and say one day i want to be like that i can and i can do it they really doubt they can do things in the world that they are ready to raise children that's so sad you know i just talked to my son-in-law cuz my daughter just had a baby and i said to him look here's something you have to understand you need to know this that this baby that's just been born this person wants nothing more than to have the best possible relationship with you that it's possible to have with anyone that's what they're offering you is that if you're a father and you have a clue and you have a new child you are being offered the opportunity to establish the best relationship with any anyone you've ever had in your life and the person that you could establish that relationship with wants nothing more than that so that's a hell of an offer so then you can just imagine how bloody far we've w walked off any sort of reasonable pathway so that young people now look at that with dread right it's it's because that notion has become like you know i had a great career like because i started my academic career teaching at harvard and that was a pretty d good deal and that place was really hopping in the 1990s and the students were great i loved my job and i really enjoyed the consulting i worked and my clinical practice i had a very fulfilling career and i would certainly say that that was all well and good but there was nothing better than being with my kids than my wife nothing better and so and the fact that people can't understand that they see that only as a burdensome what as as a burden it's so horrible because it also means that they don't see they don't they certainly don't see the best of what life has to offer i also feel very sorry for young women it's so perverse you know because most of the notion that women shouldn't be locked at home let's say barefoot and pregnant with their little kids a tremendous amount of that comes from the left and it's so weird to me because the leftist id ideologues insist that women need to be freed to do what to enter the corporate world and i think okay well i thought you guys were leftwing how did we get to the situation where it was obvious that what a young woman should do is prioritize her slavery to the capitalist endeavor in favor of being at home with her kids especially when they're young now i know i'm exaggerating to some degree but but it's so we lie terribly to young men and we demoralize them but the lies we tell young women are of a whole different order of magnitude that the notion that career is going going to be more important than anything else and that you should forego children for that i i don't know if i've ever met anyone for whom that was actually true i i completely agree and i think that you know if we had a ro more robust confidence among parents you would see that communicated because i don't know parents for whom that isn't true certainly it's true for me there's nothing in my life that has been more gratifying or more imbued my life with more meaning than having my own children it was by far the most dramatic change in my life when i had kids and we've forgotten what a profound opportunity and sense of meaning and responsibility it is because we let the experts analyze it and we actually started taking on their oh we started describing our kids i when i interviewed parents i would hear them talk about their kids according to their diagnosis well this is my adhd kid i would hear them say you hear that now well my kids spectre me you know that's not how parents ever talk to about their children why because they were our kids and it didn't matter what the experts what categories the ed what rubik's they fell under they were they were our children and somewhere along the line we forgot that and we started looking through at our own children through the lens that these experts gave us and it's wrong and it's damaging to our relationship with them how old were you if you don't mind me asking how old were you when you had your first child 31 okay okay so so you okay so now you said know you just said that there wasn't anything in your life that had happened to you that that was i had a client very high achieving lawyer right and she was very attractive person very hardworking like she she had she was quite an admirable person and then she had a baby and she and she told me she was quite funny she said well i'd always sort of thought of children as like an fashion accessory up to this point you know is something else you added to your life and she was absolutely dumbfounded at the degree to which she fell in love with her child and she had a child pretty late you know and it just turned her love life upside down and you see i saw this with women in law firms all the time is you know they were high performing career oriented women and then they'd have a child and they'd think oh nothing i ever did was nearly as significant as this so what what what did that come as a revelation to you like did you expect that what what happened in your case i'll tell you a moment where i realized it when my sons were four years old they were they had started u playing piano i have twin sons and one of my sons we got to the recital and he was very nervous and they had the kids get up there and say my name is jack and you had to say your name and i and uh identify the piece you were going to play and he started to get very nervous he didn't want to get up there and i didn't know what to do i thought this could be catastrophe should i take him out maybe it's too young and my husband said to me just let him let him be and i did i just backed off let him do this he was very nervous i didn't know if and they called him up there and he he announced to the crowd as loud as as as could be my name is jack and i'm going to play and announced his piece and i can tell you it was the proudest i've ever been in my life there's nothing i've ever done that brought me more pride than that moment and i got the first glimpse in that moment that maybe they could my my son would be able to handle himself in a world with people well that was so cool a because that means that's so cool because there's there was a conjunction there that was a that was a true moral conjunction right so first of all your husband said the right thing so he played out his role right second of all you listened and you backed the hell off third your son stepped forward right and so those things all came together beautifully and and that meant that you could see that he was on his way right and there isn't any you know and that's such a that's such a integral element of deep human motivation it's part of mentoring there one of the things i loved about being a university professor was the opportunity to do that with young people who weren't my own children it's like because what you want to do is you want to find someone who's got some wherewithal and provide them with the opportunity to manifest what's next in them right and i don't i really don't believe that there is anything that's more satisfying than participating in that and it makes sense right because it is part of fostering the maturation process and and helping other people aim up but it's so cool that that's not only an instinct that can manifest itself within a family but that can generalize to your relationship with other people and in not being able to be a part of that you know the great men that i've known great women as well but i guess i've probably seen it more in men and maybe it's somewhat more surprising in a way most of the great men i knew i i knew who had established remarkable careers remarkable in every way one of the things they took prime pleasure in maybe at the top of the hierarchy was finding young people who had ability and fostering their development you know i have my brother-in-law jim keller great engineer as he's got older that's become a bigger and bigger part of his life to find really promising young people and just to lay out opportunities for them and to watch them grow and thrive and my graduate adviser robert peele he was like that man i mean i went to his fest shrift which is a celebration of his academic career and he had like 30 of his students there most of whom done who did very very well and to a man and woman they said you know bob did everything he could to foster our careers when we worked with him and you could see you know that was just an endless source of delight for him and the fact that young people don't understand that that possibility is sitting in front of them in relationship to the children they might have is like that's a cataclysmic indictment of our culture it's so awful well they haven't been raised to be loadbearing walls see when we used to raise kids to be loadbearing walls they said i can handle it and now we've raised a generation that doesn't think it can that has been taught by so many experts to second guess itself to check in to have an adult oversee everything they do they don't believe they can and and let me just say you i'm i'm not someone who's against therapy i talk about therapy i've had in you know in in in my book but i will say something it's very different with you're when you're an adult in therapy because you have the ability to push back on a therapist you can say to a therapist listen i think we're blaming my mom a little too much you can say to her you know i'm not sure i i gave you the right impression it's much harder for a child to say i don't think it's fair to call what my mom did abuse it's much harder for a child to do that so there's much more potential for it to be undermining of the the child's sense of agency and efficacy and power in the world yeah yeah well okay so something you just said there we haven't taught our children to be loadbearing walls and so a bunch of ideas ran through my head when you said that one was that's a matter of lack of faith right because you actually you have to offer the proposition that you can bear a load before you're willing to hoist it onto your shoulders right i mean we're in a culture where people assume that you need evidence at every step of the adventure and that's actually fundamentally that's false because when you encounter something new you have no evidence that you can manage it you can you can use induction based on your previous success and to some degree that's relevant but induction is famously fallible and you can assume you can bear a load and then not right so you can even if if you have the evidence at hand that doesn't mean that it's incontrovertible means you have to have faith and you're you made you implied that you have to have the faith that you're loadbearing you know i've been writing this new book called we who wrestle with god and i'm looking at the psychological significance of the symbolic landscape at the base of our culture you know and the fundamental the fundamental presumption of our culture is that you should bear a load that you should and you can and you'll find your destiny and that that's exactly what hoisting your cross voluntarily means right is that not only can you take a load you can take the ultimate load and even better than that that you find your true calling and destiny in your willingness to take the ultimate load you know and that is an optimistic message because life is an unbearable load and the only possible medication for that in the final analysis is that you're an infinitely loadbearing creature because otherwise how can you manage it and you might be you know and and it seems to me the adventure stronger yeah continually able to bear more yes yes right and that that's the way to build muscle in every sense and that couraged is to be praised right that those are the things willing that that are to be praised and and that's that is what we need to be telling our kids and i think when we were left to when parents were more or less left to their own devices parent family tradition wisdom that they had from their parents other people who had raised good kids to adulthood that's what we knew we remember that that you were part of a family that your job was to do well for others and to do the best you could not to be praised for things you hadn't done or things that were frankly easy to do right and and i think that they they grew up with a much more sense of meaning and purpose and ultimately even happiness than we're seeing today all right so we've walked through all this and you've spent a lot of time thinking about it you got any ideas for a way forward i mean i look at the educational system rit large and i think oh no it's done like it's so corrupt the faculties of education are absolutely intolerably in corrupt and they have been for 60 years and during that time they've done nothing but deteriorate the teachers that are being produced by these faculties are not only incompetent they're absolutely addled ideologically and the universities are are they worse if it they's certainly no better generally speaking and they might be worse and so that's a damning indictment and well you know you started looking at one misapplication of the therapeutic mindset embedded in this broader ideology and then you broaden to think oh well this is happening all sorts of places it's like okay fair enough what do we do about it practically speaking you know like a return to what was it's vague you know what i mean and it's it's it's got that that conservative tendency to to to offer the past as a solution and there's something to that but where where do you see bright lights and possibilities moving forward absolutely this is where i'm most optimistic it's what parents can do it's what we've always known how to do okay we've known this for you know since the beginning of time how to raise good people and we've done it and the way to do it in our over with these overtreated kids is to proceed by subtraction remove the psych meds they don't need the diagnosis you don't believe in the over monitoring over codling over accommodation over avoidance of everything unpleasant and give them more responsibility be the authority in your home transmit your values and stop allowing intermediary to come between you and your children if you do that you will raise good kids and you don't have to be as afraid of the teacher in school who doesn't share your values because your kid is armed and you don't have to be as terrified of social media because your kid is ready by that by the time you you finally allow it and that's what i think we need to focus on okay so you might say well why should a parent have any faith in their own ability given the confrontation they have with expertise and and i say look parents here's something you got to understand is that if you love someone you are going to be as powerfully oriented as you can and so are all your instincts in the right direction you know like if i have a child i genuinely love i want the best for for them that's what love means and that means that even if i'm not particularly educated or maybe even not particularly perspicacious i am likely because of my motivation to see the right pathways forward and because i care for that child that's going to make itself manifest to me the problem with the bloody experts is that they don't love your children and may and they can't you know i mean we have a limit to the degree to which we can shower maternal true maternal or paternal love on other people i mean suppose if you became a saint like love your children right they they don't believe in them and they don't believe in them they see them as weak they see them as damaged they see them as a somewhere on a spectrum of dis function they don't know what they can do but parents do cuz they're with their kids and they know what people can handle because it's what they could handle as kids if you could survive a car trip without an ipod ipad your kid can if you could survive a heartbreak without a therapist your your c child can too she can survive the death of a bet without pro working it through with a therapist all those things that we've known that kids can you can get through and emerge stronger on the other side and there's all kinds of people around including very many of our own parents who raised good people people who were productive citizens other people could rely on ask them for advice but not the experts whose whose own you know recommendations what what the fruits of that are anyone's guas well we're seeing what the fruits of it what the fruits of of it is and and it's not good it's not good yeah yeah so how has writing these last two books transformed the way that you live your life it's it's funny they really have especially this one this one was much more close to home because it's three kids i'm raising i i didn't have a kid with a gender transgender identity or anything like that but i do have three kids who are in this rising generation and it changed me in a lot of ways i talked to a lot of parents a lot of psychologist a lot of psychiatrists who are very good very respected academic psychologists including you and and one of the things i started doing was when my 9-year-old asked if she could walk home from the bus stop alone i started letting her even though i hated it i hated it i still hate it but i let her and one of the things i learned from parents is if you curtail kids independence too much at some point they stop asking they get used to the cage they know that it's no triumph to walk home alone at 13 but it is at 9:00 and i started giving my kids more chores because it was only none of my hectoring helped make them more responsible but when i sent them with a backpack and a credit card to the store for me and they had to come back with the right items and if they didn't i sent them back they started paying attention to getting it right and no amount of yelling at them had helped them pay attention to those details before but this did and they got to know they got to be able to talk to people on their own other adults and navigate things like the grocery store on their own and that was better for them than any number of lessons i had given them summer camp was another thing i did sleep away camp with you know which was a no technology sleep away camp this was phenomenal because the opportunity to be away from my supervision frankly was incredibly good for them and their sense of s self-esteem but there are other things too extended family making sure that even if i even if i thought extended family didn't say the right things or didn't give them the right food to let it happen because you know what i don't know what situations my kids will fall into none of us knows but we do know that these web of connections that they have are very important in a stable and healthy and happy life and even if i don't love all the influencing com or all the comments made to to them or all the jokes even if i don't deem them all you know the most appropriate at that stage for my kids that there's something bigger at stake there that my kids feel connected to a larger family and a larger community and set of stable connections and i let i started letting it happen and that's what i think we need to get back to so what what has that done to your children's attitude towards you well you know so far it it's so good i mean you know i don't think they have any doubts that you know i'm not their friend but but that means they really treasure time with actual friends they don't rush to confide everything in me and i think that's okay i you know i need to have give them that space to even be a little defiant if they want to or even reject some of my advice but the most important thing is that i give them my values that i communicate you know we're the only culture america and i think north america even are they there some of the only civilizations that don't think and in the west actually in general we didn't do a great job at communicating our own values to our kids everyone else seems to know this is the most important thing i i was at a i was in invited to speak at a university recently and it was a very it was a conservative group that had invited me and one of the gentlemen who his host said to me was joking about how his daughter at college is a communist he said because of course you know you send them to college and they all become communists and he was sort of laughing about that and i just thought wow we're so comfortable in the west with the idea that someone else will come in and interpose their values with our own children that should be step one is making sure our kids share our values not that they you know not that we oversee everything they do or every interaction they have but they pass on their values so they become good and independent and decent people and that doesn't require expertise that's why the mental health experts you know certainly the therapists in general don't tell you that but that is what actually leads to a meaningful and good life well abigail that's probably a good place to stop so let's stop when is your book coming out now is it's available now it's available now okay so for everybody watching and listening you can pick up this book now and hopefully it will foster your willingness to let your children take the dangerous risks that are necessary to imbue them with real confidence i'll tell you something that happened to me in rome well i went to st peters you know and the peda isn't st peters and i think michael angelo carved that when he was like 23 or something you know some some crazy feet of utter genius and it's very interesting that it's in st peter's right because well you know that's a sacred place obviously a central sacred place and i spent a lot of time thinking about the role of the feminine in the landscape of the sacred you know and and our central sacred figure in the christian west forever has been some variant of the crucifix right but the the problem with that is that it's a male symbol and you know that's well that begs a question like what's the primary female symbol of union with god in the ultimate sacrifice and i think michelangelo captured it in the pi and i think that's why it's in st peter's because what you have there once you understand it it's really something you know you could imagine that there are two kinds of sacrifices that you could make in the world that are the most difficult sacrifice and one would be to sacrifice yourself and you might think well there's nothing worse than that and i would say yeah there might be sacrificing a child i think that most parents would sacrifice themselves before they would sacrifice their child and so that implies that sacrificing your child is worse is harder and that's what a good mother has to do and so what you see in the peda is this it's this terrible image of mary who's larger than life in the representation and she's holding the broken body of her child in her arms and what that means is that that's what you have to do as a mother you have to offer your child up to the world that's part of the sacrificial gesture of eternal motherhood right and that takes courage you know and it manifests itself in these small decisions you know these horrifying decisions you let your daughter walk home when she's nine it's like really really what if something happens it's like right yeah that'd be that'd be bad you'd never forgive yourself for that right right but you have to realize that something's going to happen either way so either you so shelter a child she'll never be independent never be able to navigate herself never know to recognize real dangers never know how to calibrate her response or we or you know either way something can happen and the question is do i want to raise a kid who's always dependent and weak or do i want to raise a child who's strong who can individuate one day and i think the answer should obviously be the latter right right well that's the right sacrificial gesture right yeah well so congratulations for figuring that out very nice talking to you again great talking to you too thank you so much jordan congratulations congratulations on the birth of your newest grandchild oh thank you very much thank you very much yeah yeah and so all right everyone watching and listening thank you very much for your time and attention i think you should rush out and buy abigail's new book especially if you're a parent and you're struggling with the necessity of being brave enough to allow your child to place themselves wisely in danger right cu that's life that's for sure that's the adventure of life so we all have to bolster ourselves up and accept that as a necessity or celebrate it for that matter which is a wiser thing to do i'm going to talk to abigail for another half an hour as i do with all my guests on the daily wire plus platform and i'm going to walk her through well her developing interest in the issues that she's been covering over the last couple of years and so cu i'm curious about that and you all might be too and so if you want to join us on the dailywire plus side that'd be fine that way you can provide them with some support too in their attempts to generate another enterprise of communication and entertainment that provides an alternative to the idiot legacy establishments that we happen to be saddled with at the moment so thank you very much abigail thank you [music]
