hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about the world's most powerful four-cylinder engine that is currently used in a production car now a huge thank you to toro for sponsoring this video we'll get more into that at the end of the video but know that there is a link in the video description to save 15 dollars off your first trip so the engine we are discussing is the mercedes m1 39 engine it is the successor to mercedes ml 133 engine which is used in the a45 cla 45 and gla 45 vehicles this 2-liter engine produces 416 horsepower giving it about 200 8.8 horsepower per liter over 200 horsepower per liter for this engine very impressive and so in this video we're going to break down how it's able to make that much power and some of the differences between this engine and the previous m 133 engine that this replaces and some of the unique characteristics that mercedes pumps in to this very impressive engine now one of the first things they did is they simply rotated the engine'0 degrees so the engine is laterally mounted within the engine compartment and looking at the previous engine you've got your air coming in up front it passes through the compressor side of the turbocharger back to an air to water intercooler and then within the intake passes through the engine mount the exhaust through the turbocharger and then the exhaust pipe is routed down and then underneath the engine and then to the back of the car so with the new engine that air intake once again of course up front goes back to the inlet side the compressor side of the turbocharger then back up front through an air to water intercooler and then through the intake through the engine to the exhaust and then out the back now there are several benefits for doing this mercedes says that that by doing this by switching it around they're able to get the flattest front section of the vehicle and part of that being from that exhaust being rounded underneath the engine they can now move it lower and so they can improve the aerodynamics by reducing that height of the hood at the front of the car now mercedes claims that by switching this around they now have a shorter length and fewer diversions for both the intake and the exhaust now looking at them here pictured it seems fairly difficult from my simplified drawings that they would have a shorter intake now the turbocharger is at the has to go all the way back and then upfront but they claim that it is shorter for both the intake and the exhaust and they have fewer diversions so helping to improve the response of the engine and i also think it gives it a cleaner approach where you have the cool side of the engine up front where you've got that cool air coming in and then you have the hot side of the engine at the back towards the firewall and then leading out to the rear of the course so i think they cleaned up the design with this looks good and they say it improves response from the engine and allows that better aerodynamic design next we get to the turbocharger and for the first time mercedes is using roller bearings within this turbocharger so versus journal bearings these roller bearings are going to have less friction and it means that turbocharger is going to be able to spool up quicker now it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to reach a higher rpm or provide more boost it simply means you're going to have that boost earlier on so if you look at a graph of the turbochargers rpm versus time and you floor it you give all the throttle to the engine then you're going to see that the turbocharger here in blue with that roller bearing versus here in red with the journal bearings so at any one given point in time the roller bearing is going to be at a higher rpm until you reach that peak rpm of the turbocharger so you're gonna get better response from it and better low-end torque as a result of this that turbocharger spinning all the way to one hundred sixty nine thousand rpm now this is also a twin-scroll turbocharger so if you look at the turbocharger itself it has two separate scrolls which are parallel that feed that same turbine which then spools up your compressor wheel and so what you're doing here is you're separating your exhaust pulses so if you look at an engine that has cylinders one two three and four and a firing order of one three four to you pair up cylinders two and three and cylinders one and four and you give them separate scrolls that they're feeding their exhaust to and so as you can see cylinder one fires then cylinder three fires then cylinder four fires then cylinder two fires and so you have a space in between those exhaust pulses so you don't have any overlapping where one exhaust pulse could be affecting the next cylinder that's opening up so it's not going to be pushing that exhaust back into the engine you separate them out you reduce those negative effects and in doing so you get better response from your turbocharger you get better low-end torque and in this engine they are running thirty point five psi of boost of the previous m1 33 was running twenty six point one so crazy high boost levels in this engine now obviously if you're running crazy high boost you're going to need a very strong engine and so on top of forged pistons and a forged crankshaft you have a closed deck engine block and so what this does is instead of an open deck where you have coolant jackets all the way surrounding those cylinders which is great for coolant flow however it reduces that block rigidity you have little coolant passages and oil passages with little holes throughout that engine block so it's a much more rigid design and it's able to withstand those very high pressures that you're generating within these cylinders as a result of that high boost level and so as a comparison you know one of the differences between this you might say well what are the cylinder pressures like a hundred sixty bar or about two thousand three hundred psi now does that number mean anything to you i don't know so as a comparison the eight hundred forty horsepower dodge demon which is a 6.2 liter engine the internal cylinder pressures peak combustion pressures are 135 bar or about nineteen sixty psi so over 300 psi higher than the eight hundred forty horsepower dodge demon engine that you're running so you need a very strong block obviously to be able to withstand these pressures and as far as the coolant flow they use a high performance electric coolant pump so they can vary the amount of flow through the engine you know if the demand is low it doesn't have to circulate all that quickly for example during startup and then if the demand is very high because you're running high power high rpm high boost then you can very quickly rotate that coolant through the engine and through the cooling system next we get to the cylinder head and there were some very significant changes that took place here versus the em 133 engine that this is replacing so if you look into the cylinder head you can see that they have changed the location of the fuel injector and rotated it a bit and as a result they were able to use larger exhaust valves so of course with this added pressure within the engine they need to be able to get rid of all of that spent gas all of that exhaust out and so in doing so they've changed the size of these exhaust valves which helps for better flow throughout that exhaust now they also have variable valve duration on the exhaust so there's two different cam profiles that this exhaust can be on so you know depending on the engine load up it's a low load and it doesn't need the exhaust open very long then it can do a short amount and then it can switch to that higher cam profile for the higher rpm and make sure you have time and lift to get all of that exhaust out of the engine now another unique change versus the m1 33 is they have now added port injection so it used to be just direct injection now it is both port and direct injection so stage one they say they just use the direct injection that's at 200 bar or about 2900 psi that it is injecting that fuel and then stage 2 is injecting through these port injectors which are in that intake manifold and they say peak pressure there is six point seven bar or about 97 psi and so they say that the reason they had to add these port injectors was due to the fact that they needed more fuel obviously if you're making more power you need more fuel to do it they said this was the way that they were able to do so i also think there's the added benefit of having the port injectors to help spray those intake valves and help keep them clean so great overall that they have added these pour injectors crazy amount of fuel that it needs to inject into those cylinders to make that 416 horsepower and finally we get to nano slide which is mercedes twin where arc spray technology so this is their spray-on cylinder liner and the advantage of it it's very thin it's very wear resistant and it has extremely low friction and one of the cool things about this cylinder liner you know if you sit there and look at it has a mirror-like finish it's very reflective there's actually a micro porosity to it so it has these really small pores on that surface and what's great about that is that when you have your oil injecting oil on to those cylinder walls then it's going to stick to these very tiny pores and as a result it's going to be really well lubricated and have very low friction and low wear and so you know the advantage what are the advantages of this of course being that these are going to weigh significantly less because they're so thin so you can save several kilograms versus a cast-iron cylinder liner but also the big advantage being friction so mercedes claims that this reduces piston piston ring and wool interaction friction by up to 50 percent and they also claim that at low loads when the engine is running at low loads up to 25 percent of your fuel of the energy used from that fuel is used simply to overcome friction within the engine so you can make a big impact if you can reduce friction on the cylinder wall and piston on that interaction and reduce the friction within the engine so it makes a big impact using this twin wear art spray on the cylinder liners now again a huge thank you to toro for sponsoring the video it's a service where you can get into all kinds of different cars and there's three reasons why i enjoy using it first it's generally cheaper than the typical car rental companies second it's a car sharing service where you can choose super unique vehicles that you might not ever get to drive otherwise and finally if you're in the market for a car and you want to try something out for a couple days i think it's a great option without having to worry about a dealer hassling you during a test-drive you can access toro on the web or on mobile devices and you won't have to wait in any lines at a rental counter you can sign up using my discount link in the video description and you'll save $15 off your first trip if you have any questions or
