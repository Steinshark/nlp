schedule that i'm really looking forward to not   having that tomorrow so i can do kind of just 
what you said just walk around yeah like give   yourself a day yeah exactly but okay back to you 
i'm really excited to have you here today i've   been following you on tick tock for a while and 
now on instagram as well and i am so inspired   by your career journey you have worn so many hats 
but maybe let's start tell me a little bit about   yourself and your career journey thus far yeah 
first off i'm very inspired by you too and i've   been following you for a very long time so i'm 
excited to be here with you and everything but   yeah i'm nick pelina i am originally from detroit 
michigan i have lived in new york for five years   and i don't know i guess i'm a content creator but 
i'm also i just call myself a tech nerd because   i've had like a bunch of different jobs in tech 
and i don't really know what to necessarily call   myself right now i'm a user or my most recent 
role was a user researcher for google classroom   i was recently laid off so we can kind 
of talk about that too but i'm starting   to create my own business and maybe do some 
freelancing so that's really what i'm doing   right now in terms of what my career journey was 
i always kind of describe it as i really started   my tech career when i was in college i had no 
idea what i wanted to do but i always said that   i wanted to like help create the future strategy 
for companies but i didn't know what that meant   and it was junior year i still hadn't picked 
a major and it was like a couple days before   the career fair and all my professors were 
like you have to pick a major now and my   intro to information systems professor like 
pulled up on the screen all of the different   companies that were coming to the career fair and 
showed that for the first time ever tech companies   had like higher paying jobs and more jobs at 
the career fair than finance did wow and i was   really liking my intro to information class 
and that kind of just like struck me as like   i didn't want to go into finance and i was like 
oh like i mean i want to get a job there's a lot   of jobs available and that sounds interesting 
so i asked my friend who was a senior and she   said she loved being an information systems 
major she interned at ge and she absolutely   loved ge so i went and changed my major that 
day and i went to this women in tech event   which i had never gone to any event like that 
either and i met one of the c-level individuals   that worked at ge and we just really hit it off so 
i applied there the next day and and the rest is   kind of history into how i got into tech but 
in terms of why i create content around tech   and that's kind of been like a new journey 
that i've been going on for like the past two   years i feel like when i first started at ge and 
in tech in general it was like i'm sure you kind   of felt this way too like eight or nine years ago 
when i first interned or made the decision to go   into tech it was not like shown that really women 
worked in tech in general now i feel like that's   really changed but i felt like the experience 
when i first like was in tech was pretty male   dominated and honestly they made it seem very like 
complex like yeah i feel like i didn't have anyone   on my side that was willing to kind of explain 
things to me in a really easy to understand way   so that was really my mission when i started doing 
content creation and the rest is kind of history   with that as well so yeah i don't know if that's 
like helpful to explain my career trajectory but   worked at ge for two years after school came 
to google five years ago and then reason was laid   off and now i'm doing my own thing i love it and 
then when you started at ge what was your first   position you held yeah so what i was in was called 
the digital technology leadership program so it's   basically this program where they get i don't 
know i would say like 20 out of college students   and they basically want to put them into this 
like rigorous program where you get to have four   different jobs over the span of two years in 
tech which was really cool and it's basically to   create their like next leadership in tech but 
i got to be a software developer a like i don't   know like data analyst implementation specialist 
i don't really know what to call that one job   but and then salesforce developer and then my last 
role was like a ux research kind of like assistant   in a way for those for those four roles did you 
were there others to choose from or were those   before that they were kind of rotating between no 
so there was so many to pick from and it kind of   was based on your seniority in the program how 
well you were doing in your different rotations   and then just like what your own preferences were 
too and they were located around the country   i was in ge aviation so it was primarily located 
in cincinnati but i did go to south carolina for   one of the rotations too so holding and this 
is one thing i went on your linkedin and i was   kind of blown away to be honest 
about all the rules i was like   this this individual is incredible how quickly you 
can pick up new skills from going from software   development to data analysts or whatever that role 
entailed and so one of the things i really wanted   to ask you is how was your experience or how are 
you able to navigate between roles and pick up   those skills do you have any advice for picking 
them up quickly or learning kind of on the fly   i think that's a really good question i 
feel like it was helpful to do this so early   on because it just pushed you into that and 
really pushed you out of your comfort zone was   like you're gonna learn all of these different 
skills and some people did choose to do like   software development role after software 
development role but i really wanted to   use it as an opportunity to explore all the 
different like corners of tech basically yes   but i guess like a story to kind of explain 
that when i joined the program i was one of   probably the least technical people that they took 
on because i was majoring in information systems   which is more i guess like the business side of 
tech rather than computer science which most of   my peers in the program were so i told them to 
put me in the most technical role that they had   knowing that it was going to be really hard 
but since it was like my first rotation i kind   of wanted to have the space to like mess up a 
little bit and then see how it went but i think   i don't even know if i have this type of energy 
anymore but i was just like so into it and so   excited to learn that before the rotation started 
i took like classes on code academy and i was   like watching just like youtube videos and just 
reading books about they told me that it would be   like javascript and like specifically no jazz so 
i was doing a ton of research and learning about   that so when i came into the role i felt like a 
little bit more prepared but i still had never   worked in like any sort of software development 
environment i didn't know anything about like   sprints or like anything like that so i feel 
like every day after work i would like still work   on the projects that i was assigned and i don't 
know i guess it paid off because ultimately like   the proof of concept that i made for that specific 
rotation got sent up to the cio of ge wow and then   i was i think in that role i was the first first 
rotationer to win like this outstanding detail   p award so it kind of just gave me the confidence 
from there to be like okay if you really put your   energy into learning these concepts you can do it 
over and over and like i do think after time as   well a lot of these things start to meld together 
even right now in my current user researcher   role in my past i guess my most recent user 
researcher role i was like assigned to interview   more technical users because i kind of understood 
the language because i had used it originally had   been a software developer so i feel like the way 
that you like play these roles off of each other   i don't know it really all comes together 
and it comes full circle and i feel like it's   helped me understand my peers roles when 
you're working on a product team better   but like in terms of advice i would just say 
like really put your energy towards looking up   these concepts online and i think that's like 
what i want to to reiterate to people when and   i think you do this really well as well like on 
my content creation i'm like i just want people   to understand that they can look up these concepts 
and learn them and do it themselves and it doesn't   need to be this like super exclusive you have to 
get into like this school and major in this and   it doesn't need to be that way i don't know do 
you feel that way 100 and i i can relate to you   so much when you said that a lot of your peers 
going into going into kind of the program   at ge where computer science graduates or had 
that background and you're like throw me in the   most technical roles which by the way i think is 
i mean incredible for you to be so brave because i   think a lot of people claim yourself i don't even 
know i don't know if i would do that now i know i   feel like when we're starting out in our i don't 
know what it is when you're when we're younger or   have i don't know it taking those risks seem less 
scary yeah but they're always the most rewarding   but back to what you were saying i i had a similar 
experience with or in the sense of a lot of people   that i was around or in my first job were computer 
science graduates and i always put them on a   pedestal and i'm not this is not taking away from 
their like credentials exactly like it's it's   amazing but if you come from a background where 
you maybe didn't know that this was something you   wanted to do or you discovered it later in life 
and you don't have time to go back to school for   another four years or spend that money to 
go back to college again it doesn't mean that   you could never learn it exactly or that you're 
less than or anything that's something that i   really had to overcome because i always put them 
on a pedestal of like well it makes sense why my   male colleagues get paid more because they have 
a computer science background but totally but   if you're doing the exact same work like really 
right so just kind of you know taking a step back   i can completely relate and and that was 
actually one of my next questions for you was   through holding various roles were you able to 
apply some of those skill sets to your current   one which you you explained to me that that you 
have and then i guess one other question i   wanted to ask you was for anyone who maybe isn't 
certain of what role they're interested in but   they know they want to kind of to quote what you 
said and i i can't remind me word for word but   build be building the future essentially or what 
did you say at the beginning i feel like yeah like   i wanted to like build the future of companies and 
like yeah their future strategies and stuff and i   just like didn't know like what that was but i 
think it's tech like yeah when i really think   about it it's like you're building the future 
of like what that company will look like yeah   you know what what advice would you give to others 
who maybe want to do the same but don't know what   role they want to get into yeah i mean i think 
that opportunity is unique but there is a lot of   large companies that have rotational programs so 
if you are coming out of school i would recommend   looking into rotational programs because it just 
gave me one like what you're saying like it gave   me so much confidence just to myself obviously i 
learned the technical skills of being a software   developer being a ux researcher but at the same 
time i also gained a lot of confidence of oh i   can learn new skills and ramp up quickly and meet 
new team members and like all of these soft skills   that really mattered i felt really confident in 
myself once i had finished that program because   i had done it four times so i think i had you 
know the confidence to even apply to google at   that point because i had been able to be like okay 
i can i can do this like i can join a new team not   know anyone and ramp up and within six months 
you know it gave me a lot of confidence yeah   so i think if you can do a rotational program do 
that but if that's all realistic i think the best   thing you can do is you know look up things online 
honestly like look up what different roles mean   i don't know if it was someone i kind of think 
it might have been you like that posted all of   these different types of roles that you can have 
that are technical and non-technical in tech and   like really went through each individual role yeah 
um apparently i gotta figure out what's wrong but   i that is do research on roles and 
then the other thing i would say is   i would jump into a role like figure out what you 
want to do like focus on building your skills for   that specific role get that job and then once 
you're kind of in a tech company no one's really   going to say oh don't try to help out with this 
other piece there's been many times even when   i was at google where i would do side projects 
outside of my typical role just to get a taste   of what that would look like and what that felt 
like being in that specific or using that skill   set or being in that specific role so i think 
there's opportunities if you ask for them and i   feel like a lot of times we you don't need to be 
in a rotational program to experience a different   type of role in your own company if you're just 
like willing to ask i don't know what would you   say i love that i think you summed it up perfectly 
there are opportunities if you are willing to ask   for them yeah that's exactly it and i think a lot 
of times especially earlier out in our careers we   are nervous to ask for those or just write it off 
that note there's no way my manager will let me   do that but oftentimes more than not they're it's 
looking looked at as a positive that you want to   take on more responsibility or try out different 
things or continue to learn totally yeah okay   let's get to let's get to the the hot topic not 
only for this this conversation but for i think   the tech world right now which is there's been 
so many layoffs going on right now and i know   you recently went through one at google can you 
tell me a bit more about that yeah so in january   i was laid off from google it honestly was 
a big surprise because i feel like of all of   the big tech companies google was definitely one 
that hadn't necessarily mentioned that they were   going to do layoffs or if they had it was like 
a little bit more i don't know vague i guess   but i i do think a lot of people i guess 
i should just say also i i don't believe that   the way that google handled it was bad i actually 
feel like i've had so much support from my manager   my manager's manager my director they're all 
like helping me try to find a job and i had   like the best five years at google so i lit i have 
nothing bad to say about them but yeah i mean it's   definitely unfortunate especially for people like 
you and i who are really advocating for people to   get into the tech field and like trying to show 
that this is an accessible field that anyone can   learn without going to college or whatever it may 
be to see all of this happening and to see it   happening to my peers or people who i even helped 
get into the tech field is really unfortunate but   i think one thing that i feel super confident 
in and why i would still encourage anyone to   get into the tech field or learn technical skills 
like this is i feel so set up for the future like   whatever that may bring i feel like i have the 
skill sets ready to take whatever that might be   on and that's like learning how to work with 
technical concepts honestly and learning how to   even understand the basics of coding or the basics 
of ux design it's all going to be so important   i kind of think like while we see tech as this 
specific industry or this specific field i don't   know if our kids are going to be like oh this is 
tech like i think all jobs are just going to have   a technical aspect to them yes so while this 
feels super unfortunate and like oh no is tech   ever going to be the same i think it's just gonna 
really spread that technical expertise around to   all of these different fields which needed to 
happen anyways and we'll really see that these   different industries maybe it's like healthcare 
or retail or whatever it is really get elevated to   become more of these like tech based companies 
and i don't i really don't feel like this is   going to be a detriment to the people that were 
laid off i feel like their skill set is going   to carry them forward into the future and and 
any company that they ultimately end up joining   they're going to be the ones pulling them into the 
future too so i feel like it's an exciting time   i'm not looking to go back into corporate 
anytime soon but it really like worked out with   for me personally i think i was ready for that 
next challenge and it was more just a sign for   me from the universe or whatever you want to say 
that like it's time for me to just try something   a little different and yes a good five years at 
google so yeah i love that i you summed it up so   well on how and that's something that i think i 
always try and advocate for as well it's tech is   in such an interesting perspective the way you put 
it tech is not just an industry it is building our   future for all industries when you think of 
uh retailer when you think of nutrition any in   any industry needs technical individuals or 
technical soft skills or hard skills however   you want to look at it to be successful nowadays 
they need developers they need ux ui researchers   inside they need all product managers in 
order to scale and grow i mean i'm definitely   sure there's some industries that don't but it's 
continuing to go in that direction and i like   that how you put our kids generation won't look 
at tech as just an industry but more so it's just   the skill set that maybe you should have just as 
like we thought we should know how to like use   microsoft word or something yeah you know what 
i mean exactly wow that's that's i love that   perspective speaking of your next steps and not 
looking for another job in corporate what what are   your next steps that's a huge question i feel like 
it's such a big question i feel like it's only   been two months so i'm definitely still trying 
to figure it out but really what i had set for   myself in terms of a timeline was i was hitting 
the five-year mark at google you know when i   started this content creation stuff i feel like i 
was saying this to you just before we even started   talking here but like once you get the taste of 
that entrepreneurial like i don't know it's period   i guess and if you have that in you it's like 
wow i can really like run my own thing and i can   manage these partnerships or i can manage like my 
own time and my own deliverables and i think that   like really excited me and i'm really using this 
time to see if i could build my own business i   definitely had that content creation piece but i 
want to build my own technical consulting company   and i really wanted to focus on like 
ux research and ux design for small to   medium-sized businesses because i think it's 
the missing piece for a lot of these small to   medium-sized businesses honestly where they're 
doing all of the things but they maybe don't   have the time the expertise the bandwidth to look 
into ux design user research or even like digital   marketing social media so i really wanted to 
focus on women-owned small to medium-sized   businesses and work with them on really what 
i'm calling a digital makeover digital glow   up i like that yeah so we'll see i mean i 
have i just got my first client so that   was really exciting congrats yeah i think it's 
so exciting so we'll see where it takes me   but i'm really excited to i i loved 
my consulting role at google so i was a   ux consultant at google and i got to work with 
all of the like top ad clients that google had   so you could think like a sephora or ace 
hardware or like different colleges and things   like that and i loved that like going in and 
out of companies and really like diving into what   they care about and their industry and learning 
all about it and then providing ux recommendations   that's going to elevate the experience for their 
users and understanding their users better like   doing rapid research for them so i wanted to 
take what i had learned at google and really   just try to apply that to smaller companies that 
i think could really benefit from it and have that   i guess scrappy ability to to make those 
changes quickly too yes congrats again on   your first client that is such a big win and so 
early on too i know no it was it was random my   mom met this person in florida found them for me 
so shout out to my mom sometimes that's like how   it's gonna be 100 yes it is it's all about your 
community and your network and just continuing to   to build that as you go along totally nick i 
could i feel like i could ask you questions   for hours but you know to wrap up this 
conversation one question i wanted to ask   you that i ask at every conversation is what 
advice would you give to your younger self question i feel like when i think about my 
younger self and this is like late teens early 20s   i guess i just like worried a lot like i feel 
like i was always like questioning my decisions   worrying like who am i gonna date whom like 
what's my good what's my job going to be is   it the right decision to move to new york all of 
these things and i spent so much time worrying and   i wish i just like embraced being like my young 
20s and just kind of like lived my life a little   bit more i mean i definitely lived a lot i got 
to do so many things but i wish i just took away   that anxiety and worry that like came with it 
and then i guess like you're just like never too   busy to i i honestly this is like more personal i 
guess but like i lost my dad a couple months ago   like six months ago so i guess like the biggest 
advice that i would give to my younger self is   just like make time for your parents like get 
to know them as much as you can and like you're   never too busy to like call your grandma call your 
mom call your dad like i feel like those are like   things that you always hear but like it really 
is true and that's definitely advice i would   give to my younger self 100 it's so thank 
you for sharing that and i'm so sorry that   we i'm sure these past months have been a lot so 
i'm sending all my love your way thank you i'm   gonna give you a hug right after this podcast 
recording but thank you for sharing that   and that advice and i think it's so true 
when we're in our early 20s and we're so   consumed in our in our our growth and what's 
going on in our lives we sometimes you know it's   like we think we have all the time in the world 
which is not the case and it's totally it's you   know family is everything so i really appreciate 
that advice yeah it's finding the balance between   like not worrying too much about the future 
and like just being very present and i think   that will help like just being present yeah i 
love that i needed that thank you yeah thank   you this is great i know i know nick i'm gonna 
link link everything all your information down   below for your socials where individuals 
or companies can find you for your consulting   services all of that is linked down below and 
yeah thank you again thanks so much for having me [music] thank you
