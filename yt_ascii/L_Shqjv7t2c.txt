welcome to the top 15 smartphones that you can buy right now for $500 and with what we've seen in the last few months it's becoming really hard for me to recommend spending more than this and so in 15th place we've got the vivo v15 pro and for 399 you get not disturb contemporary design but a super amoled display that fills the front of the phone a powerful 48 megapixel triple camera and even a pretty good battery life the main caveat being a mid-range snapdragon 675 chip but at the same time it's kind of amazing that were at a stage where my main complaint with this mid-range phone is that it comes with a mid-range chip that's just how competitive this market is right now and it is great for the consumer okay so then we've got sharm ease me mix three and this is one of these slickest phones thanks to the super amoled display on the front with its dual front cameras being activated with what might be the most addictive sliding mechanism on a phone to date and don't be fooled by the fact that this is last year's phone the snapdragon 845 chip inside of it is every bit as powerful as the mid-range chips released this year number 13 is the lg g 7 think you and this is gonna seem like a really weird choice but lg smartphones have maybe the worst value retention but that also has a flipside whilst it made almost no sense to buy this phone at launch i've seen this thing brand new online now for two hundred and eighty dollars two hundred and eighty for some of the best hardware of 2018 a good camera a powerful speaker and a quad hd plus display the battery is on the small side though at 3000 milliamp hours the honor view 20 really set the bar high for 2019 it released right at the end of last year with a flagship grade keren 980 chip a pretty high-end forty eight megapixel camera and was one of the only phones in the world with a punch hole display now that a whole buncha phones have come out with similar features it doesn't quite stand as the mid-tier king but is still a very well rounded phone alright now we're on the subject of honor and huawei though you've probably heard about the fact that they've been blacklisted from working with us companies which includes google so their future viability is uncertain so for this my advice would be that if after watching this video you decide that an honor or hallway is the way that you want to go then just hold off for a few weeks just don't buy anything for now and i reckon within months time we'll have some sort of clarity or some sort of public statement from the company the samsun a seventy which comes with a massive 4,500 milliamp hour battery combined with the fastest charging samsung offers at 25 watts it even has a six point seven inch super amoled display on the front the main compromise here being a mint here at snapdragon 675 chip but for a lot of users that's great the poc affair and f1 is pretty good at everything performance camera and battery even a year after its release are still comparable and so the fact that it's now even cheaper than it was before is a bonus the honor 20 is amazing value for money and is actually one of the only situations where i recommend the standard version of a phone as opposed to its pro counterpart the standard honor 20 is still powered by a flagship grade chip and is one of the only phones with this kind of power that is compact enough to be used in one hand it has this side mounted fingerprint scanner which is really tough to part with once you've got used to it and a quad camera setup although one of these is just for depth sensing all right next up is the pixel 3a xl and i'm gonna preface this by saying this is not a phone for a tech ed this is not a phone for a gamer this is not even a phone for the person who wants the most beautiful design but what it is is one of the cleanest and one of the easiest android experiences the software is blissfully like to use and the camera captures amazing photos effortlessly oh yeah and battery life on this is off the charts a lot more than its 3,700 million per capacity would suggest mind you that is already a pretty large cell but it's more the fact that the phone's hardware puts very little screen on the battery you might know that when the wall we make 20 pro came out late last year i completely fell in love with that phone and whilst that doesn't fit into this price bracket what does is the standard while we meet 20 and this one makes sense for a lot of the same reasons as the honor 20 you've got that flagship kirin chip inside you've got a proper triple camera with an ultra wide lens and a telephoto camera and the kind of design and materials that are usually reserved for flagship phones but what i think makes more sense if you're gonna go down that route of buying an old flagship phone instead of a cheaper newer one is the s9 plus which software wise is very similar to what the samsung a 70 offers but you can't shake that feeling of this being a flagship as opposed to a mid-range phone you get a flagship grade metal and glass body flagship great display and flagship grade dolby atmos speakers and so when you combine that together that's quite a tough combination for a newer mid-range phone to beat okay top five and in fifth place the red magic three completely blew me away if you're happy with having a phone that weighs over 200 grams and one with above-average sized bezels it doesn't get much better than this having the most powerful components is only the start with this thing it has a massive 6.6 5-inch 90 hertz amoled panel an incredible five thousand milliamp hour battery which can pull through two days of medium use and a ton of features to appeal to the gamers you've got a customizable led strip over here you've got proper shoulder buttons and probably the coolest thing is that this phone has a actual dedicated fan to keep temperatures down it also has more or less the same a 48 megapixel camera as most of its rivals but it is let down a bit by a mediocre camera software and image processing one plus seven and don't be fooled by the fact that this phone has only one main camera and a second for depth it takes both amazing photos and amazing videos especially after a new update that's just dropped but that's not even the best thing about the phone the software it's running on oxygen os is incredibly fluid it is light it is fast and this time around the companies also added stereo speakers in okay then we have was it on ok charmese me9 and people have been telling me that they found it cheaper but the best price i could find for this was four hundred and seventy dollars and compared to the one plus seven you do miss out on oxygen os which i personally prefer to charlize me why skin but it is cheaper while being just as powerful and also comes with a more versatile triple camera setup at the same time though whilst it really is a great phone it doesn't make much sense to buy the me nine right now because we're phone all come to very shortly any in second place is the asus zenfone 6 and this phone is not what it initially seems on first impression you see this rotating camera setup anything okay this is great yet another one of those phones that's really interesting to look at but that i wouldn't actually spend my money on but right here asus has got a device that walks all over that notion the battery life is exceptional with a mega 5000 million power cell the ui is snappy and bloatware free and that camera is not just something to ogle at but it takes amazing photos and videos on not just the rear by the front - and then in first place and you might have seen this coming is the redmi k20 pro or the xiaomi me 90 they're both basically rebranded versions of the same phone and in almost every way this is shani's me 9 but better it is cheaper has a much larger battery and a display that fills the whole front of the phone no notches thanks to this motorized pop-up camera which also looks pretty slick thanks to the built-in leds ok so that is the $500 mark covered but if you did want to spend more than that if your budget can stretch there are 4 small phones i would recommend right now you've got the oneplus 7 pro which is a no compromise phone at under $700 and there's the iphone 10's max if the apple ecosystem is something you enjoy and you want to carry on investing in then this is still the best apple has to offer plus it's just about to get a lot better with ios 13 the huawei p30 pro is the most impressive photo camera on a phone period whether your subject is a hundred meters away whether it has no lighting or whether it is right up close next to your camera the p30 pro can do it and i would say the word versatile that doesn't even quite cover it but just remember if you're planning on buying a hallway phone then just hold on it doesn't mean to rush out and buy a different phone instead just wait for about a month and i think we'll have some clarity and then if money is no object the s10 of 5g is the best phone out there right now in my opinion it's the phone i choose to carry around every single day the s10 plus is a really good option too if you want something a little bit smaller and don't care at all for 5g and if you want to spend less there are another four phones that i can recommend you've got the moto g seven which is a really well-rounded an especially well-built phone for the price you've got the me nine se which is a smaller trimmed-down me nine but considering the price discount the fact that it still retains an ultra-wide and a telephoto camera is a real plus then there's the samsung galaxy 850 which feels very similar to the a 72 use but a little smaller there are some compromises like a slightly weaker processor and camera but considering how close the experience feels for almost $100 less for many this is actually better value another option is the redmi note 7 pro maybe the cheapest smartphone to have a 48 megapixel i am x58 6 powered camera that is the same sensor as on the 1 plus 7 pro and it's also just all-round a wellspect phone if you enjoyed the video a sub would be massively appreciated my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music] you
