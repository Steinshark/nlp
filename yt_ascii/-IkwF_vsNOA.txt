okay so we're back for the third video in this series if you're just joining us my name is jason i'm a software engineer at microsoft and i'm going through all of my very important resumes the one that got me my first software job the one that got me into microsoft as a full time and my current one after all of my learnings over six internships so you're listening to tech and turn guys i would really appreciate if you subscribe and like if you get any value out of this video if you don't that's fine shoot me a message tell me what you want to hear and i would love to talk about it i'd love to help you out and we're also going to be doing resume critique giveaways so i believe there's one going on right now please go to the channel find the video subscribe to the channel like the video you'll be entered in an opportunity to actually get a resume critique from me we'll talk about how we can optimize your resume for the job that you are looking for now let's jump into it so i went through my first one i went through the one that got me into microsoft we're going to look at my current one and kind of compare it to the last one so i redacted a lot of the numbers from this resume just because i didn't want to release some stats or something that i wasn't supposed to but all of the numbers are actually in my real resumes so i will try to fit both of them here okay so off the bat before anything this one utilizes space better than any of them you'll see that there's a little bit of color splashed in there all of the icons from the companies i worked at are there all my contact information has little icons too it kind of makes it a little colorful makes it pop a little bit without being overly done so let's jump into it you'll see my experience here my team develops in c sharp i talk about exactly what it is cloud service responsible very first point off the bat developed a feature that does this this is the impact very first one off the bat tell them exactly the impact i had at the company that's great integrated and maintained several cloud azure resources i want to tell them that i know exactly how azure cloud works i've been working with it for a long time so that's great constantly taking ownership of new areas of code and being accountable for their failures this is important sometimes we get very wrapped up in the technical components but just being a team player and being accountable is something that employers value so much so i actually really like this point and you'll notice you're starting to notice that i bold things i want people to see now the average person looks at your resume for six seconds so if i bold and show them exactly what i want them to see that's going to increase the odds that i get the the callback so i want them to see that number i want them to see i'm accountable and as you go down you'll see more of those you'll want them to see the number of customers how many users customer obsessed mindset blah blah blah you'll see those throughout the entire resume let's go to the next one full stack development developer intern now if you watched the last video you'll see i had two jobs at toast and here i've squashed them into one just to save space and you know what i looked at some of the projects and said both of these are kind of just designing rest apis i don't need to have them in two different points in two different jobs it takes up so so much space so i threw a two in there to show i did two of them and i talked about the rest api stuff some people might not like this but honestly it saves so much space it allows me to talk about stuff that i would rather them look at developed a rest api for managing user reward data and how many customer customers it impacted yeah that's pretty good you know i want to tell them i know rest api i developed this entire thing this is the impact again right off the bat with the impact i'm not telling them you know all the technologies i worked on first i want them to know how i affected that company it's more important to me than them knowing that i know java for example design a system to store and use sensitive credit card data using java play and angularjs the top point was from the second internship the bottom point was from the first internship see how i squash them together and just talk about them all in one it saves me a lot of space front-end develop front-end developer intern at yahoo mail i wrote and maintained redux react on a product with an estimated 200 million users that's true yahoo mail actually has 200 million estimated users i put that in there to remind them just the breadth of the company the breadth of the product that i worked on how many customers i actually interacted with and i actually affected their lives and had code run for them that's important for me to to show especially if you want to get into a company like microsoft so created a recent suggestions recent searches feature that touched this many percent of users this is something i talked about my last video i got way too wordy with it this time i didn't get wordy with it i told them exactly what it is they can infer what it is and how it works from just the context collaborated with ux designers and product managers with a customer obsessed mindset again not everything's technical customer obsessed is important when you're working on a product so i'm customer obsessed i have examples if they ask me about this in my interview i have examples where i can say yeah this was a time where i said no i stood up i put my foot down and said this is not right for the customer that's great i put it in there and i bolded it then we're down to projects of course i talk about the tech intern podcast because that's something that i started six months ago it grew fairly quickly and that is why we are doing this youtube channel and it's not technical at all but it shows again the impact that i'm having i'm trying to help people i'm going above and beyond to do things in my spare time and then of course we talk about lead party lead party is an application if you haven't heard we actually use it in a few of the videos but lead party is an application where you can leak code against your friends kind of compete against each other see who can solve with the better runtime memory better memory usage and you can also view each other's solutions that you can learn together it's actually a pretty good resource for studying it keeps me motivated at least because i can get pretty bored with lead code so here i talk about the number of users i talk about you know the the technologies i used i kind of talked about the fact that i envisioned the product the reason i do that again i want people to understand that i kind of take initiative in the last two resumes you'll see i talked about how i took initiative i'll say that very explicitly now i don't want to say that now i'm just saying hey look i created this thing out of my own like idea it was an idea and then i put it down and it's got real users i want them to kind of infer that i'm taking initiative to develop products because that might be useful for a startup for example last resume my education was four bullet points this time it's not even one it's just one line university of waterloo this is the degree i got with distinction six internships there you go done move on last but not least i put languages separate from programming languages on here not because i think it's going to help me get a job but mostly because i actually study french in my spare time because you know it's something i want to learn right now i'm learning spanish in my spare time so it just kind of tells them a little bit more about me and it could come up in an interview again i separated the programming languages from the technologies that's something i talked about in the last video check it out and yeah this is the difference between my resume now and my resume that got me into microsoft and my very first software engineering resume you'll see the progression from all the failures i had i've learned i've become better i want to help bring that same learning to you i don't want you to have to make all the same mistakes as i did so i really hope you guys enjoyed this episode please like if you got any value out of it please subscribe if you want
