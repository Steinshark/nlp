this is looks impressive okay so i've got a model of the iphone 11 right here and i've also got a bunch of other 2019 flagships so we're gonna go up to people in the public and see how they would rank them because let's face it the design is a little controversial in terms of how the phone can presented the packaging looks pretty much identical to an iphone 10s max box so opening it up inside taking the seals off and you can see pretty much what you'd expect to design by apple in california the smartphone itself and then pretty much the joke of a charger underneath that with a total of five watts of power the earpods and then of course the charging cable which is lightning and then the phone itself comes with this sticker which has the olympic rings on for some reason so here's how it's gonna work i'm going to ask people to rank these three phones and then we're gonna give them points based on how well they've done so let's see which one wins just before we jump into that let's take a quick look at some first impressions as well as what people said when comparing it to past iphones okay all right so this is a this is a prototype of the iphone 11 this is the iphone 10 which one you think looks better between the two for me yeah this camera so you actually think there's nothing wrong with this where it's not very much yeah no it's not we decided to go with this massive square camera but and do you hate it yeah yeah i think it looks ugly it's quite big that it's only looks the cameras a bit weird cameras look a bit weird i'll give you that i mean i think it's a bit too big obviously squared-off yeah i think that looks a lot better than that okay now for the rankings what i've done is gone up to ahora two different people showed them the iphone at the huawei and the samsung and then asked them to rank the three phones based on appearance alone first place is gonna score two points second place one point and then third place and new points at all so let's see which device can get to 30 points first so this is a prototype of the upcoming iphone in terms of design how would you rank them that is weird but it's still better than that yeah is that because it's apple yeah maybe how would you rank them in terms of how they look you don't like a second second okay so looks look looks at say one samsung is the shiny one is lovely white one and then the beige one now this will expect reason barrel-aged okay now that right there is interesting the guy said that the iphone is better quality which in itself no real qualms with that but this is not an iphone made by apple this is an $80 if that prototype model of one see if you just rank the design [music] yes i think the way we've got a nicer yeah then iphone and enter then something samsung and then iphone just because i think that's too in-your-face and it's still nice boys a bit blonde and political that make sense yeah i still like the iphone more so i probably put samsung first huawei second either people opinions are all over the place of this that was the best something first then between those three how would you rank those phones just look yeah so huawei number one so even though you're not a fan of that it's still better in sunset microchip shown ok the sampson's about the microchip is awesome i think that looks very nice hmm i give this one a silver medal something i match the bronze medal what okay this one right then this one while way then something yeah this one looks for me this one that's the nicest yeah that one that one one two so even though this isn't the final design and we may end up seeing a non blacked out camera module i actually think that looks worse than this and even then the results of this test are saying one thing pretty clearly that the design of the iphone 11 is not particularly light if you enjoyed this video i've got a ton more like this so i'll link them from here my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music] you
