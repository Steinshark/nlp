hello everyone and welcome i'm not really a big fan of turbochargers because from a driving perspective they're not really ideal but i recently drove the porsche 911 turbo s and porsche uses a really clever solution here in what coincidentally is the quickest car i've ever tested flying from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 2.5 seconds the first time i tried it in sport mode it's bonkers fast and it uses really clever turbocharger technology in fact back in 2006 the porsche turbo was the very first gasoline production car to use variable geometry turbochargers and it still uses them today it's brilliant tech and one of the best mechanical solutions to turbo charging so how does it work so to start off we need to talk about why turbo chargers suck and they kind of do i mean they suck in air through the intake that's for the dads out there i'm not a father but the real problem with turbochargers is that the process takes time they're not as responsive as engines that are naturally aspirated or perhaps supercharged and so why does this happen well if you look at your throttle you've got atmospheric pressure sitting on one end you know the atmosphere the air that we're all hanging out in and then on the other side you've got your engine and you're going to send that air into that engine so when you floor it and you open up this throttle valve well that atmospheric air then rushes in then that air is burned within the combustion chamber it goes through the exhaust and starts to spool up this turbocharger which then starts to pull in more air forces it through the compressor side of the turbocharger through the intercooler to cool it down and then stuffs it in the engine and then you start to make more exhaust so you can spool this up faster so you can pull in more air so you can stuff more air in the engine and make more power again this process takes time it's not a snap your fingers when you open that throttle you don't immediately have all that pressure stuffed inside of the engine so you lose response and that's a lame driving experience when you have to wait when you put your foot down to when you actually get power so what do you do about this well there's some decision making that you can do in order to change the responsiveness characteristics of a turbocharger so if you select a small turbocharger well then it's going to be fairly restrictive in the exhaust but that restriction means you're going to have high exhaust velocities and spool up that turbocharger wheel very quickly and thus have a responsive turbo charged engine the downside is that your torque is going to fall off as you get to higher rpm because that exhaust is so restrictive so good for low rpm torque and good for that really quick response but unfortunately that small turbo is going to you know kind of fade off as you get into really high rpm so for a high rpm application where you want big power you might choose to use a big turbo charger which doesn't have as much restriction going through it so you can flow a lot of exhaust through it and that gives you high power with low back pressure but it means that turbo charger is going to take a long time to spool up and it may not spool up until higher rpms so you may have to wait until those later rpms to get good power so what does porsche do well they use a borgwarner variable turbine geometry turbo and this turbo has adjustable vanes surrounding that turbine wheel and so you can adjust the angle of these vanes and change the amount of back pressure that you have within this turbo so if you position these veins so that they have a really small gap this is great for low exhaust flow because it creates a restriction and thus forces that air passing through the veins to speed up and thus spools up your turbocharger really quickly so you have high back pressure but you have high velocity and you get that thing to be very responsive of course once that turbocharger spools up you don't want to have it be really restrictive so you then open up those vanes and allow for more space between them so that you now have less restriction through the turbocharger and you can get high power and high flow through it in an efficient manner now it's worth pointing out that there's not simply two settings here it's not just super restrictive or super open you can vary anywhere in between however you're not going to stay at this small gap position very long because once you start spooling that turbo up it immediately becomes restrictive so most of the time if you're using a good amount of throttle it's going to be in the mid to open position to allow for less restrictive exhaust flow and maximize power and efficiency so the first use in passenger cars with variable turbine geometry was in 1997 using diesel engines but it wasn't until nearly a full decade later that it was put into a gasoline vehicle to porsche turbo and it's still fairly rare to be used in gasoline engines so why did it take so long to get put into gasoline engines and why is it still rare to see so the big challenge with gasoline engines is that the exhaust temperatures are significantly higher than diesels so diesel exhaust temperatures can be around 800 850 degrees c versus a gasoline exhaust temperature around a thousand to 1050 degrees c or about 200 degrees celsius higher i spoke with boer warner engineers and they told me about the two main challenges plus one more that are associated with these high exhaust gas temperatures in gasoline engines so first of all you have to deal with creep so that's the material elongation over time this isn't related to thermal expansion it's a separate thing it's basically the permanent elongation of certain parts and it's more prominent when you get into really high temperatures of course that's an issue if you have these really small fine controlled parts and you need to make sure they're never binding and always doing the proper thing you also run into oxidation and corrosion as an issue when you start to get into really high temperatures and finally you have thermal expansion so you have these really small parts and then of course there's larger parts when you're looking at this item and some of these parts you know are going to warm up quicker than others so you need to make sure that no binding occurs within it one of the interesting things boardwinner also said was that the soot in diesel exhaust actually acts like a lubricant of course you don't want too much but some of that diesel soot actually acts like a lubricant for this variable turbine geometry so it's kind of neat that there's a benefit there to that diesel soot with the turbocharger again you don't want too much but a slight help there and so one of the things that makes all of this very challenging is that it's difficult to find materials that satisfy all of these requirements so i was asking boardwalk engineers about what some of the unique materials might be and they told me about pm 2000 this is an iron alloy that's very difficult to obtain go ahead and google it and try and see if you can buy some it's difficult to acquire it's a very rare very expensive material but it has really good properties so it's super strong it doesn't have creep and it has minimal thermal elongation so it's perfectly suited in this application but again that means it's expensive right and so if this is a complicated expensive thing then it makes it less likely to be prevalent within gasoline engines that's less of an issue when we're talking about a 200 000 sports car so in this specific application we have a 3.7 liter six cylinder some may refer to it as a 3.8 cylinder but it is not it's three point seven four five liters so four you know would round down it's a 3.7 liter engine so 640 horsepower at 6750 rpm 590 pound feet at 2500 to 4000 rpm and that range may not seem all that great but consider at 67.50 rpm where it's hitting peak power it still has nearly 500 pound-feet of torque now this engine has a redesigned air intake system and the routing is pretty interesting for the engine there are four air intakes one on each side panel and then one additional intake on the sides of the intercoolers so that air makes its way through the filters which are located in the rear fenders through the compressor side of the turbocharger through the intercoolers to cool it down through the throttle valve into the intake manifold across and then down and into the cylinders and then finally out the exhaust through the turbocharger and then out the exhaust on the back of the vehicle now because it's turbocharged we need intercoolers so these draw in air from the top surface of the car and then it passes down and through the two intercoolers the air exits in four locations two of the exits are directly below the intercooler leaving through the middle of the bottom of the rear bumper but there are two more exits on each side to assist with airflow porsche says the intercoolers are 14 larger than the previous model and have a 13 increase in cooling air flowing through them thanks to the new design the new air intakes located in the rear fenders have a larger cross-sectional area and thus offer lower resistance and greater engine efficiency it also has electronic wastegates for the turbochargers one benefit is when you cold start the engine the wastegates are completely open so your exhaust gases essentially bypass the turbochargers and go directly to the catalytic converters to heat them up quicker now the exhaust routing has also been updated to allow for a symmetrical design of the turbos so instead of the previous generation where we had our exhaust come out and then the turbochargers were spinning in the same direction now because again they're on opposite sides of the engine you have a much cleaner flow where you don't have this kink and then rerouting of that airflow so you've got less drag for your turbochargers there they've also increased the size of the turbine wheel by five millimeters to 55 millimeters and the compressor wheel by three millimeters to 61 total millimeters overall this is a pretty special machine it's something that's effortlessly insanely quick and that's probably the most mind-blowing part of it the speedometer can be reading double what you think you're going and it all feels remarkably chill it's fun to drive and yet highly refined at the same time if you're going to spend over two hundred thousand dollars and drive something that doesn't look faster than everything around it but is and all in reasonable comfort this is a pretty solid way to go about it thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments
