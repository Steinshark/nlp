ladies and gentlemen it is my great pleasure to welcome you to the 14th round recap of the 20124 candidates tournament many of you left comments on last round's recap round 13 saying it was the best recap and best chest video that some of you have ever seen well today we are going to try to top that off the candidates tournament crowns a champion and that champion plays for the world chess championship either later on this year or in 2025 on the women's side kongi of china leads by one point a draw clinches first place in the open ges from india has eight and a half he's with the black pieces against hikaro nakamura who has eight fabiano carana has white against yan pishi and they both have eight if gash wins he wins the candidates if gkes draws against hikaru the other game matters and if hikaru beats ges the other game matters and i know the title is to crown a champ ion but we very well could have tie breaks tomorrow we'll get into that later now out of respect to all the candidates i'm not skipping any games even if they are not meaningful for the standings because they all made it to this event and despite your best efforts to get me not to cover games i will cover everybody because i respect them and you should respect them too ali resa fuia versus vid ganti finished their game in three minutes which means they both were just very happy to go [music] home we start with a little you know like you go to a fancy restaurant and they give you like a little free thing cuz the rest of the meal cost like $700 that's what this is and before i continue to talk about games in this recap for fuja this is a forgettable event and this is his second candidates and we can only hope for higher expectations moving forward vidit finishes with six out of 14 he had a very up and down event he was in the running for a little bit but two unfortunate losses put him out of the running but we'll be curious to hear his reflections as well gino was in the running for a little bit nul salimov a very talented international master the youngest player in the women's candidates played a filor defense against the much more experienced gachin and these two actually played the world cup final go look up women's world cup of 2023 they had a blistering final and here in the final round of the women's candidates they put on a blistering game from the opening nul was in great shape had a great position but very quickly gachin a yeah 2550 gm multiple time national champion world chess champion challenger she had a good position but nuru defended very well and ultimately this game as you can see despite white being down upon black is not going to be able to get out it took a little while but they ultimately made a draw on the 59th move now lagno versus vali vali lost four games in a row and now one four games in a row lagno russian grandmas she is very very strong 2540 but not her event but in this game she sacrificed the knight with massive pressure on vali and vali walks her king to play defense some gangster behavior from her and then launches a counterattack on lagno by the way look at lago's time she hasn't thought she hasn't thought okay probably because she has an early flight and she sacrifices a piece but black defends really really well and emerges with counterattacking pressure and ultimately lands a very very nice tactic it looked like white was building up a nice advantage bishop f2 messing up the coordination of the white position and rook g7 the counterattack comes straight down with knight f4 and vali ends this tournament in one of the craziest streaks i've ever seen in my life so white is completely stuck she's going to lose material d4 you can't move the knight vali loses five four games in a row and then wins five games in a row i don't think that's ever happened in any tournament at a high level ever like straight up like if any of you can find what she ends the tournament with seven and a half you know who else has seven and a half leting yeah and she needs to beat humpy koro to at least time for first and none of that even matters if tanong yi wins or draws her game and in this game leting put the knight on d6 and then sacrificed her queen and then threatened rook b7 and got the rook there and now the key idea here would have been bishop e3 and bishop e3 threatens bishop g5 and you cannot take because knight f seven but you also cannot take with the rook because rook h8 you can't stop checkmate so you play like knight f8 i take on f7 i'm going to win the queen i'm going to win the rook this is insanity unfortunately for leting j she doesn't see that and she goes on to very quickly get a completely lost position first it was equal then it was unfortunately just lights out and humpy was very precise very meth ial and it was very exciting for a moment but lei fought and fought and fought and she ultimately goes down as humpy wins the game with the two rooks and the run has come to an end and tan droni made a draw tan ji played a a sicilian and she actually played an offbeat sicilian because she was still trying to win her game and white actually you know got not much out of the opening actually tanong was quite a bit better but but she ultimately just completely killed the game off she knew that a draw was getting her first place and the players repeated in tandi wins the women's candidates and she is going to play j and june for the world chess championship n versus prog out of respect to all the players i will cover all of their games this one was a kings indian defense from prague it was a night bd7 e5 system and this game was a long game it got interesting when abasov put his knight into the center of the board neither of these guys playing for first place but prague playing for a 7 out of 14 50% finish and he had an advantage knight versus bishop for a little while ultimately looking for a pawn break to infiltrate the white position he lands that pawn break and applied consistent pressure throughout the middle game ultimately getting a completely dominant advantage past the time control he was methodical he was slow and he got upon a into a rook end game and here aboss have resigned because he's going to lose more pawns and that was that so a convincing win for prague and that brings us to the two most important games of the day and i do not understate when i say the two most important games of potentially the next decade of chess here are the situations yanomi could win against hikaru ges could draw excuse me did i say hikaru against fabiano gash could draw tomorrow they play a tie break nepo beats gukesh nepo gets a rematch of all the possibilities that is maybe the one people are like ah we just saw that right fabby can do the same thing as nepo play against gcash in the playoff he could become the first american world champion since bobby fer and that would complete an incredible story hikaru going on that same path as fabby would be nuts and gesh the youngest ever player to ever win the candidates every story is incredible all right without further ado here we go d4 what hold on a minute what happened to e4 e4 was the move he c play the whole tournament i guess he didn't like something right i yes he he wasn't certain how he was going to play for a win against e4 e5 maybe he didn't like the way gukesh approaches the italian maybe he didn't like the way gukesh approaches bishop to b5 not right now but the spanish and kukesh rather than playing knight f6 e6 which by the way i'm not going to toggle much between these games both must win games had d4 on the board so that's interesting right because someone needs to win in fabbi versus nepo so kukesh however plays the queen's gambit accepted when i booted up the game this was already a shock to me not the queen's gambit accepted but the fact that hikaru played the queen's gambit because there are a lot of openings for black that can kill the fun so i was very curious what was the idea now this position has been explored so much and the line here goes c5 castles a6 right there's either the endgame line this position has so many white has so many possibilities on move and six etc and then gukesh in a position where a6 c5 has been played 99% of the time plays bishop e7 what he didn't play and this move is deep because he got hearu to think for two minutes and then for 12 for 12 minutes that's crazy on move seven so what was the preparation what did hikaru have in store against the immediate c5 or against a6 c5 something clearly must have gone wrong and maybe hikaro will explain maybe there will be this very obscure move which in reality doesn't even make a whole lot of sense because if you're going to play c5 on the next move what if i take now you just lost the right you lost the tempo so what is the big idea well the big idea aidea is that gcash then play c5 what and now the computer on a depth likes a move like e4 energetically playing for the center a lot of positions have reached here but the players reached something like this and now this queen e2 system trying to put the rook on d1 is played kukesh plays b5 takes on d4 and hikaru even here could have maybe considered rook to d1 pinning the pawn to the queen and then trying to take with the knight or maybe even with the rook right but hearo has to win no other result for him is satisfactory so bishop 282 gukesh takes hikaru takes with a pawn the idea is to create an isolated pawn imbalanced pawn structure right and in an imbalanced pawn structure white puts pieces around the pawn and then puts pieces like this and supports them and you know we'll play like bishop g5 or bishop f4 maybe rook d3 rook h3 and go for an attack kukesh calls the bluff on all of that and plays b4 and says you know what hikaru we're going to force something i'm going to clear off the queen side and the idea is that after pawn takes b4 you're not taking back with the bishop what isn't that the whole point no the idea of b4 is that once hikaru oops once hikaru takes on b4 now black plays knight c6 and takes the pawn with the knight and he has has that luxury because after that he blockades white's isolated pawn and he targets the bishop and if white plays b5 oh great good luck after moving your pieces b before is a high level idea it was such a high level idea magnus carlson himself while doing commentary praised this idea said it was very clever from gkes and so now hikaro goes 94 gkes still is able to trade the pawns and now it's complete symmetry kukesh has to not lose that's it and then the winner of the other game plays him in a tie break bishop to b7 yaro plays knight back to c3 after spending 13 minutes he he did not like knight c5 knight c5 could have led to a little bit of an imbalance but nobody says that after knight c5 he has to beat zen bishop d5 gkes is going to trade every mirror image piece hikaru's time is ticking tick tick tick knight back to c3 kukesh plays knight d5 again looking to trade mirror image pieces once hikaru starts running out of them he's not going to be able to create winning chances tick tock tick tock bishop to d2 from hikaru keeping the tension kukesh methodical getting rid of hikaru's pieces one by one all right hikaro plays bishop to b1 creating a a checkmating idea puts the bishop back on d2 but kukes is better he's better because isolated pawn is going to get blockaded and now karu decides to go bishop d3 and bishop d3 is one of his early admissions that something has gone wrong and something needs to give now what i mean by that is that gukesh will take on f3 and take on d4 hikaru cannot take this pawn on a6 because he would lose a bishop and then a second bishop and now iaro is just a pawn down what does he have imbalance he has the two bishops so therefore in some end games he will put a little bit of pressure on gukesh and he putting a little bit of that pressure right let's not forget all right queen b5 take take if kukesh gets to this end game he might you know he might be in trouble but ges is not going to lose his pawn he's just the pawn up rook c1 king f1 now ges just needs to trade the pieces but here's the crazy part the crazy part is that hikaru knows he won't win but he doesn't know if one of them will win one of those guys if hikaru wants to play for a win because the draw gets him nothing he could lose karu is like thanos if he snaps kukesh wins the candidates maybe he doesn't like nepo maybe he doesn't like fabiano but like this is the reality but in a position like this doing that would be pretty unportable like doing that would be kind of insane even though a draw does not win him the tournament hikaru has to play and he has to keep the game going but he's not going to like sack all his pieces because then he's going to lose and he's down awn and my friends kukes goes to the opposite colored bishops he hikaru gets the pawn but there is absolutely nothing here and i am fast forwarding a flank pawn versus a central pawn is created even rook and bishop versus rook is a draw you could lose all your pawns and your bishop but none of that happens hikaru fights until the bitter end and this game in the 60th move clears out both guys go on a pawn race rook f8 aa queen gukesh holds his hands together like this like this holding on for dear life you cannot get rid of that he karu gives up the rook for it and gukesh has drawn against hikaru and all this means right now is hikaru can no longer win the candidates and as much as he gave interviews beforehand that content creation for him is bigger it's the profession there's a lot less pressure on him for a second candidates in a row as a person who was cheering for hikaru i'm heartbroken and i have nothing but respect for gukesh and all of his fans i can't say that every single person in india let's say they say gukesh is billions over a billion fans in india probably two billion worldwide kukesh noxi caru out of contention to win the candidates and all eyes are on this what a performance from gukesh 9 out of 13 and who would have thought that game against fuja that he lost even a draw would have won him the candidates let alone a win he almost won the candidates with 10 points how is that even possible but the winner of this game catches gukesh knight c3 fabiano carana invites a nso indian but we have d5 we have an exchange queen's gambit decline bishop g5 bishop b4 and yan gets aggressive kicking out fabiano's bishop bishop goes back to g3 knight comes into e4 applying some pressure we could be looking at the final game of the 2024 candidates if this game ends in a draw gukesh wins if one of these players wins this game tomorrow they play against gukesh in a rapid tiebreaker which by the way breaking a tie in the candidates without the two people playing each other seems crazy so we make them play each other i just find like i i don't know how we break ties and chess 15minute games is wild to me queen c2 h5 going for h4 f3 kicking the knight out of the center now your bishop can't get trapped and neppo plays bishop e6 and fabbi thinks for a little while bishop e6 is a move that has been played but it is very rare as you can see very very imbalanced position black with the bishop pair black with overextended pawns white with a strong cluster opportunity to play f4 e4 this is what you play when you need to win this is what you play when you need to lose it's one of the rarest cases in chess where somebody must win this game if these guys draw think about the result of this game when it's unknown hikaru winning and a draw on the other board doesn't matter draw on this game doesn't matter gcash winning doesn't matter so somebody has to win this game bishop d3 c6 long castle knight d7 f4 fabiano aggressive but down 20 minutes early clearly sur in the opening by yan who immediately makes a mistake apparently the best move here for black was just to take this pawn but that seems kind of insane and then go here he didn't like something about that instead he goes bishop to g4 knight f3 queen e7 attacking this pawn but fabby shreds open the center this is on fire that's on fire somebody is coming to the e file to target the queen on e7 now yan has to start getting rid of fabiano's pieces which control the center the best move there might have been once again to take and once again to take on f4 but instead of that he plays bishop c3 queen c3 gets rid of the other knight both bishops are gone for the knights chops down the center once again chops down the center once again that's four captures in a row for yanomi and a very nice move here from fabiano g4 it's going to be bishop it's going to be knights black's king is still stranded in the center of the board so it's going to be under fire and i'm looking to create an outside pass pawn so in this position neomi plays long castle but it would have been better for him to first play h4 because then fabiano would play king b1 and then long castle d5 knight e5 guards the pawn but what happens in the game is that he long castles and fabiano attacks him right away now yan plays h4 gambiing the pawn on c6 completely what is he doing doing it's completely spinning out of control for jan he's completely losing i mean if bc6 queen c6 is literally mate so yan facing this absolute destruction of his king's castle playing knight c5 fabiano plays bishop f5 check forcing the king to b8 king to be one on the board the only thing fab has to be careful about is this pawn this pawn is going to get there at some point in the end jan's best line here is to play rook d1 and start trading and defending an endgame but he knows that if he does that he can't win the candidates so what does he do keeps pawns on the board absolute psycho this pawn is two squares away from queening and in this position fabiano kowana can disconnect the black pieces like this and then play rook e one probably play b4 kick the pieces out play queen e5 and gets c7 on the board knight d7 there is c7 fabby does that but in a more flashy way rook to d7 what a move you cannot take with the knight because c7 check i win the rook oh my god but fabiano must be compl completely winning rook takes d7 c takes d7 you cannot take the knight the pawn with the knight because i play queen takes rook rook d8 queen d4 knight d7 rook d1 the game is over it is absolutely over you can't move you can't move the knight you can't move the queen you can't move the rook you're going to lose everything as it turns out you can queen c5 what well if bishop d7 takes takes oh my god you cannot both defend the pawn and the bishop and a draw is no good so fabiano plays the best move he takes on f4 with check the queen goes back the queen goes back now yan's pawn is two squares away from queening but white is still completely winning white is still completely winning he plays bishop e4 setting up queen d5 and a nasty infiltration to the corner of the board which is why yan kicks out a window and he is now officially down by four on the stockfish evaluation if we count the material it's equal it's plus 4 plus 5 but it's equal fabia plays queen d5 because it's a fork of checkmate but it's also a fork of f7 fabiano carana is completely winning but he doesn't know that and neither do you right because there's no evalar so white is applying a lot of pressure but white has 7 minutes and 40 seconds to make seven moves or he loses the game and there's a pawn a square away from queening on the edge of the board fabiano now plays queen h7 with pressure on the knight king b8 unpinning and enabling the movement of the knight now fab plays a cold blooded move a3 but he burned almost half his time on that now the king has no problems on the back rank queen e5 played by yan fabiano has five moves 3 minutes and 50 seconds queen h6 an excellent move trying to go here and play queen b7 mate yan comes back to c7 f fao has 2 minutes 2 minutes for four moves if fabby plays rook h1 in this position black plays knight c5 let's say you play queen h2 rook d1 you cannot take because you lose your king queen a2 king a2 there's no queen f7 because you're pinned so then there would be queen h2 rook h2 knight e4 f4 rook g1 you got to win this rook end game put the rook on e2 and try to win this end game or maybe rook h4 oh my gosh bobby finds g5 which is the best move let's just go rook g8 now look at this move rook h1 he stopped everything because the rook can come down but fab has 54 seconds for two moves knight c5 and in this position if fabby retreats to c2 if fabby goes to f5 he's in good shape but he decides right now is where i'm going to make my stand bishop to h7 and black is busted black is busted because where do you move if you play rook c8 i trade we trade queens this is easy but what fabiano had missed this rook takes g5 sacrificing the rook and winning the bishop with a check but what's very important is that now fabiano has half an hour and still a winning position so it was dangerous this pawn is scary but he's going to win it and advance this pawn fabiano sits back he has 30 minutes he takes a sip of [music] water and he throws it all away king to a1 was the wrong move and it was the wrong move because you had to go king a2 induce the check then go to a1 and then in this position king b1 and the queen does not protect the pawn anymore that is what he had to go for that's very tough to see queen f3 there's a lot of drawing potential queen e5 check is the key idea before you lose your rook and then in this position you take with the queen you bring your rook you bring your queen not there but just in general and then you win this is not a perpetual because king a2 queen c4 queen c4 etc bobby has thrown it away queen c2 and the position is back to equal queen g8 why is it back to equal because of this move protecting this pawn the white queen has to protect b3 and has to attack the pawn right away and in case that's not obvious to you that is not possible you cannot do that king a2 pawn to a4 that's it that is the nail in the coffin fabiano carana has blown the game but he's going to keep going f4 the idea of f4 is relatively straight forward black has to make a move you can't trade the queen and this move looks nice but it doesn't do anything and this is the move that yan played advantage fabiano the the winning move the the drawing move was king a6 for some reason just basically saying don't touch anything don't put the knight on b3 don't block the diagonal to the king now it's white's turn to make a move you give a check king b5 the king is safe there's much deeper lines here but knight b3 allows this and allows this oh my god fabiano carado is winning again queen to c3 and the point is that even though your rook is about to get removed from the corner this is a check and the rook escapes and you cannot queen because this is checkmate incoming black is up two has two queens and queen and with his mates rook to e1 and suddenly jan is back to square one queen f1 fabiano carana protects against the promotion and the pawn is just going to go queen d5 check king to b1 this time he doesn't make the wrong move queen f5 check the king goes to the corner the queen returns just trying to be close knight to b3 fabiano advances three squares away from queening and enough time on the clock not to screw it up may i remind you when he had no time back on move 38 he had no bonus time but now that he plays f5 he is completely winning oh my goodness yan yapishi is not going to be able to sleep tonight knight to d3 a valiant attempt that's checkmate rook to b1 valiant attempt that's defense knight c5 but guess what fabiano doesn't have to repeat moves tick talk now white's pawn is two squares away from queening and guess what black's pawn is not it's not knight to b3 check knight to d2 did fabiano blunder a fork no queen h1 check escaping the king goes to a7 fabiano plays rook c1 and jan gives a check and plays queen e6 what rook c7 knight b3 is a problem this pawn is hanging but you can't take it you can't take this pawn cuz knight b3 okay well that's easy just play rook c7 and that's exact but fabiano does and loses his entire advantage what it's the most natural move well apparently the winning move was rook d1 and then walking the king back out into the open and allowing this check and then you go back and the point is black has to constantly come back to this but there is no threat there is no threat knight to d2 king a one there is no threat and the best that black can do is return to this position and every time you return queen c7 every time you return it's white to move so you're stuck in this carousel this neverending marry go around but you're a move short so fabby had to go rook d1 or rook e1 he goes here and now it no longer works he cannot take because queen e1 is mate you could lose so he plays f7 and now knight b3 king b1 and yan pishi there is a draw in this position somehow the angel of death just watches over it's just it doesn't allow nepo to lose you play knight to d2 you play king to c2 and you let your knight die and in this position down a rook down a promotion and down potentially mate it is a draw you cannot walk your king to the c file because i take your rook with check the rook can't be taken otherwise because of f8 but it's a draw king b1 knight d2 is just a draw but yan pishi doesn't find it and fabiano caruana is winning again king a2 knight back to c5 and fabiano has check here check if the king runs forward you lose so you have to go back from there and there i give this check on a2 and then i win the pawn i'm winning the pawn on h2 and and you can't take my pawn because it's protected the only thing you have is queen d5 or here queen d5 but wait a minute wait a minute how's how does that work wait a minute how does that work how is that going to work queen a8 king b5 queen e8 here queen e2 it's going to work like this black can't go here because it's mate so black has to block and then there is no access to d1 that is how he wins fabiano carana is winning queen a8 queen e8 queen e2 queen h2 he wins the pawn fabiano plays queen a and he repeats moves once he repeats moves one time he does this so now he gains time now he gains 30 seconds king to b5 queen e8 queen e2 he goes here and now if fabiano gives this check that is the third time that position happened and it's a draw so he can't so he goes here and it's back to equal after queen f1 my heart can't take this queen c4 is a threat of a perpetual h1 queen is a threat queen here here check here check here check king goes back you can't give this check you can't play rook e one because of queen c4 what do you do you also can't make a queen because you lose so fabiano does what he can gives up the rook takes a pawn with check takes the knight with check and in this position he gives a million checks and into this endgame up a pawn after one of the most unbelievable games of the calendar year and maybe of the decade fabiano carana is in a queen in two versus queen in one end game this is winable when the pawns are up the board but we very quickly find ourselves in a situation where white can't make progress because they're just simply going to be weakening their king and there is nothing that you can do and the player shuffled we have now officially made the 100th move ladies and gentlemen this game agreed drawn on move 109 which means damaraju kukesh of india is the youngest ever player to win the candidates tournament at the age of 177 with nine out of 13 triumphing over hikaru yan bishi
