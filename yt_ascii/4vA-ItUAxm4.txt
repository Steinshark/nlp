so hello everybody i'm very happy to be here with two more v's many of you have seen his work you've heard his music two more v's has made many many fusion of music with audio clips and part of that has been going through some of my talks and recently he went through one of my first public talks which was called pentecost for the zombie apocalypse it was given at an oca at an orthodox church meeting with all these priests and the bishop was there as well and it was it was a moment that was very unnerving to me because it was the first time that i was talking to all these bishops so i took a lot of time to prepare i really wrote it down and i memorized it and re-memorized it and and i know that that marvin is is his actual name marvin noticed that that he was very prepared and so i think he kind of grabbed on that and thought it would be a good idea to bring it all together and to make almost like a musical out of my out of my on my talk so i was really impressed with what he did and i'm definitely looking forward to talking to him about it and you know what the choices that he made and the decisions that he brought about in this in this in this musical this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [music] [applause] [music] so marvin it's really good we've met before on on not in person but in zoom so it's good to talk to you again i'm really looking forward to hearing about about how what your decisions were maybe you can start and tell us what it is that made you want to do this because it was a massive project right so generally what what what made me go into this kind of music this we call it flo-fi akira the dawn for example who also made a song with your co calls it meaning wave but is is that and you talk about that in your talk too is that there is this hunger for meaning and i feel that in myself and i see that also in the world and in my friends and it it seems like it's so most of the music and entertainment culture in general is is meaningless there's nothing that you can grab onto it's nothing that you can let's say say use to to also learn about the world and learn how to how to act in it and i felt the the the strong urge to kind of participate in in changing that especially after i found out about what akira is doing and after i worked with him for for a bunch of like i think six months or something like that and i started with with petersons with jordan peterson's works because that's also how i got into all of this in in general like his interview with kathy newman of course and then his biblical lectures which also brought me on the way towards the church and then i was talking to jacob and lisa who both loosely work with you on your channel i think jacob's a moderator lisa manages the clips channel right yeah exactly and i think it was lisa who mentioned the pentecost talk to me and said it's it's it's really it's standing out from from everything else that you've done and so i gave it a listen and i instantly heard what she's what she said and you mentioned it too that you prepared it a little so it's it's it's already a little segmented and it's already a little like like like poetry i think i would say and that that also made it really easy so i just i listened to it and then i cut it up into into the different pieces and then i said okay let's see how much how how far we get with this you've been working on this for like a year and a half maybe like it's been a while yeah about i think i started cutting it up in in maybe march last year or something something like that and then i but but then i focused on a a album i wanted to do from from peterson's talk who dares say he believes in god because i thought to me personally personally it was a a preparation for going into pentecost and the icons themselves what you talk about so i thought it would be better to release that first but we i had some problems contacting jordan again after he gave me his initial okay obviously i think it's yeah and and so then then i just i just thought okay then i'll focus on the pentecost album because i had the preparation that i needed from the album so then i then i could get get into your stuff yeah and you put it out on pentecost it came out on pentecost day which was which is a nice little nice little move on your part to have that yeah right right i initially wanted to get it out on on halloween last year when we did the live stream but well it didn't didn't quite work out but but that's good because then i had the time to you know finish the songs properly and and and all of that and then yeah i'm i'm very i'm very proud of of what what came out of it and also surprised that it worked out so well so i'm going to surprise you with a question so before we go into some of the songs on the clips if you can resume the talk like because i guess you've listened to it so many times now like if you can resume the talk into into a short into a short sentence or short statement what would you say that the talk is about sorry to put you on the spot there no no no problem no problem i would say christ is here for everyone and and and without exception for everyone everyone can come to him i think that's that's the message and that's definitely the message that i got from it and yeah i get a little emotional thinking about that to be honest because your your whole emphasis on saint christopher for example like the monster that wasn't able to pray or fast or abstain from anything in the end being able to carry christ across the river and to join the church and to become the same that's so that's it's so intensely moving because i also i wasn't i wasn't in a very good place let's say for for a long time and also still still not really when i when i yeah when i when i started engaging with your content you know drug use and all of that like a modern world stuff and i didn't i didn't think that there would be any place for me in the church and so there was also no no no real motivations why would i change anything really because how how would i fit into that and yeah but but that i mean i was wrong with that and then and your your talk show showed me and i mean now i am part of the orthodox church and i'm i'm even considering becoming a priest that's oh my goodness i didn't know that well we've got the beard already so yeah you got that going yeah that's exactly what my priest said to he said you've got the beard so you're you're right that's amazing oh goodbye the congratulations how when would you when would you received in the church i don't i don't remember when that happened it was in i think march 13 so so it's like three to four four four months now okay and yeah yeah that was and that was a big chunk of that is because of you and your content for sure so so thank you very much on on this on this note for for a second yeah well glory to god that you that you that you came that you came through the threshold so i'm happy to hear that right yeah so i think that's the that's the sentence that i would bring a bring bring it down to it's like crisis there for everyone and everyone can join and everyone can be saved yeah that's awesome so you prepared some of the songs or some of the clips from some of the songs that we can kind of listen to a little bit and then we can talk about so go ahead set it up and and we'll we'll we'll go in there awesome we'll do so we live in a time of monsters i announce this to you but i think all of you already know that we only need to glance at popular culture to realize this at the narrative level of our culture and our stories we've become obsessed with monsters with the strange alien the marginal with the glorification of the exception things that don't fit most of us here probably grew up with sesame street where we were told that monsters are our friends and it's no longer in fiction by now the monsters [music] have left the dark spaces under our beds they have left our nightmares to come out into the open [music] at a social level we can feel and see all around us the growing polarization the acceleration of what we can only call the the breakdown the decomposition of culture a progressive dissipation of the center which rallies us as a society right so that was yeah the clip from the first song monsters and the second coming i think this one came came about a little later in in in the whole process except for the the intro which when when you listen to the album you you'll see that there's like a minute of of introduction to that song which this is just weird sounds like like ufo sounds and like ominous robotic breathing and stuff like that which then culminates in and the drums you know getting getting into it just just to make it a little eerie and set the tone yeah there's something there's definitely something even in the way that you kind of parse out you modify the the the rhythm you know that there's this this kind of slow there's this kind of slow move it makes reminds you of some of the like some of the music that i was listening to in the in the late 90s this kind of this kind of intense slow movement you know this this this guitar but is how can i say this kind of bringing you bringing you somewhere but in in this intense slow manner and so that's what i was getting from that when i listened to the first time nice yeah that's also what i was trying to try to cause the listener to feel let's say when i was doing that i like that when it's when it's it is slow but it's it's you know this this this kind of unstoppable even even though it's slow like it's going to going to go forward anyway yeah that's a good that's a good image like this this kind of slow but unstoppable movement that's coming towards you definitely that's a good way to describe it and so that was it's funny because when i listened to myself i can hear because i was i was i had i was reading and i had memorized at the same time and so i can hear the mistakes that i make like just in terms of grammar i can make a few gram grammatical mistakes which is totally fine this is where people realize sometimes that i'm not a native english speaker even though people think i am i make these strange grammatical mistakes and the way i'm speaking sorry that that's what i'm hearing it's hard for me not to hear that when i'm listening to it no i understand it i think if it were the other way around i would notice that too because i'm also not a native speaker like my native native native language is german but it's there are even some a few moments where because you made a grammatical mistake that that's what made it possible to have it aligned with the rhythm of the song so i'm just i'm happy about that i think you guys like i was actually what i was actually doing was changing the grammar to you know to fill the beat that's what i was doing yeah it was all it was always all deliberate from the beginning so so yeah so so and so that's the first song and that's really just my kind of my introduction talking about monsters and just kind of getting people because i was dealing with a lot of people at that time if you have to think that this was like in 2017 i think right so we were dealing with people even i think it was the early late 2016 maybe dealing with people that had never heard my content at all and so i was going in cold for most of the people in the audience and trying to kind of paint a general image of something that paint a general image of something that was maybe they had never ever thought about and so so it was yeah it was really nerve-wracking so trying to get little images of sesame street and these monsters that kind of pervade our culture to get people to realize something they never realize even though it's so obvious once you've seen it write it becomes so obvious but a lot of people don't don't see it they they just live imbibe their culture so yeah even even our buses they have these little machines where you check in your your ticket and they they are called ticket monsters now and they are also you know painted in that way that that it's like a little monster that you have to feed like it's it's it's literally it's everywhere yeah exactly well once you start to see you start to see the the let's say the pattern of what's going on then then it's hard to turn back you just it just you just notice that it's and it's increasing too it's just the the things like the things that i talked about in 20 it's funny because this year if kobit permits who knows but in in the fall i'm i was asked to come talk to the same group so the same oca it's the diocese of the south and they have their their kind of meeting of all the priests and the bishop together so they asked me to go speak at their their assembly again and it's just so funny because everything i said which was in almost was there but now it's like times it's times 10 now and so i don't know how i'm gonna deal with that in terms of doing this a talk again to all these priests as i i've been thinking about it like almost obsessively okay so how am i going to outdo myself now with that talk that i did four years ago that is i'm looking forward to that then then we'll have a part two have a part two of the musical indeed right that's hilarious how did how did they how did they react to it because for me it was easy to accept all of that because i was on the outside and i was kind of a monster so so i liked hearing that but people who are you know on the inside might not what was the reaction i would say at least my my impression of what happened was extremely positive like it was it was i would say that at some point i felt like i had the the audience kind of hypnotized i don't know what else how else to describe it you know at first i was kind of looking out and i was seeing puzzled faces and then as the talk went on all of a sudden i could see people get into the groove of what i was saying and and then by the end of the talk i think there was really like a buzz i don't know how to explain it like a buzz in the audience and so i really it was overwhelmingly positive i would say in general my the reaction that i've had from my hierarchy has been overwhelmingly positive obviously i've been worried about that because i'm talking about things in a way that are a little surprising to some and maybe are not from the same angle and so i was i was always worried that people wouldn't understand what my purpose was or what i was getting to but i haven't felt that i've really been supported by my own bishop and then by you know just by the the hierarchy in general so that's been that's been wonderful yeah that's that's awesome to hear also i'm i mean i'm not i'm not completely surprised because the orthodox church is much more embedded in in all of this mysterious stuff let's say than than well the different the other churches but but yeah that's that's that's really great to hear and also reassuring let's say yeah and i do i do still get some pushback because of the icon of saint christopher and i sympathize with that i totally understand that some priests are not happy that i am making images of that icon or just talking about it or you know posting about it because it was condemned in a russian late russian council in a council that is under peter the under peter the great peter the first and it's but the most interesting thing about that is the reason why they are angry about me promoting the icon is actually the reason why i'm doing it because they think that they think that i am demonizing the other that i am that i am you know kind of portraying this idea of the alien as a monster and all of that and i keep trying and i keep trying to help them understand that it's a saint it's like it's an icon of a saint and the people that love that icon that i've encountered are people who feel like that monster right it's not it's not it's not like i'm saying all these evil monsters is that that image is actually calling people who feel in them an aspect of of marginality or misunderst of being misunderstood of being they identify with that and that's that's like the weirdest thing for people to understand that that that you know some people really do we all to a certain extent have that in us you know like an aspect of the gargoyle in us but i think some people in some more some people in particular have feel more that way and so i think that that icon is playing the opposite role of what he thinks it is he thinks it's pushing people away but i think it's actually it's actually attracting people that are the weird and the and the strange because it's it's still an icon of a saint and they can they can identify with the story of not being able to fully fit in but then nonetheless having a place and having a role to play in that in that story so so it's a funny it's a funny situation but i still i sympathize with people who are annoyed with me that's like the biggest thing that i've gotten in terms of pushback has been about about the icon of saint christopher that's interesting i thought that if you were to get pushback i thought it would be because well they themselves wouldn't like the icon like i don't i don't like to see this as part of part of the tradition i thought that would be the problem but yeah i get that too well that's why they don't like it because it's it's suggesting it's because it's talking about the stranger as a as like almost like as a monster and you know and also because they don't like the idea of dehumanizing you know this idea of kind of dehumanizing people which is right they're totally right it's like they're completely right but that's the that's the whole mystery of this encounter with the strange and how we are able to then ultimately find ways to to to bridge you know the that's what a saint christopher ends up being is a bridge from the inside to the outside so it does always have a strangeness to it so yeah which is also i mean also mystery itself is is like part of part of i've been talking about that to a friend of mine mystery itself is kind of part of of being and part of the pattern it's not not like mystery is something that's only not revealed it's like mystery itself is as is a as a stone that fits into the wall that we or something like that you i think you get what i mean yeah exactly that that there is an aspect of reality which is not properly represented and because of that it appears to us sometimes in in these in these types of strange forms let's say you know and so on the edge of the world you encounter a dog-headed man but then at the edge of the holy of holies you encounter a beast with four wings it's like humans with wings i know it i know you think it's it's not as weird to have a human with wings but it's still weird like just because we're used to it doesn't mean it's not weird like a man with a headed with a dog-headed face it's like those are those are weird images too they're images that are pointing to something like you said which is not fully graspable in our category so right i mean just think of of the i think the ophanim like this these wheels within wheels which have like with eyes on them like what what is that you know if yeah if if that if that isn't weird so so yeah i i get what you mean it's it's it's yeah we're just used to the image of people with wings i would say that's just it's more normal to us because we see it more often yeah we see more often and we think that it's that it's similar but it's like a lot of the angels are are warriors too just like saying christopher they they're just they're just it's almost like their reflection saint christopher stands on the edge of the world and the the angels stand between us and god they stand on the edge but the on the other edge right the edge the bridge between the higher and the lower and so they both appear as warriors they both appear as a form of hybrid but it also makes sense that their hybridity is different you know that they would have something like the head of a human and then the the body or the wings of a bird whereas on the other edge which is the very edge of the world then you would have something like the head of an animal on the body of a of a human it's almost like the the reverse but it's also showing the place in the hierarchy in terms of of strangeness yeah right right i hadn't even noticed that yet this this turning it around but yeah you're right okay yeah we could we could get into the next clip yeah go for it as the narrative fabric of our world begins to fill in quantities that are barely possible to believe with images of the monstrous as we feel the world being torn apart by fragmentation and conflict we are simultaneously as individuals being constantly assaulted by images images with the purpose of awakening our own desires we've come to the point where we most of us so many of us have been accustomed to the constant exposure to the stranger and stranger fringe of desire whilst being enticed by the siren song to indulge to give into the to waves into the mire those two things the edge and the end they represent the same structure they're the same thing in our stories those two things the edge and the end they represent the same structure so even when he is a zombie man is a microcosm yeah i don't know if you notice but the the the the image that i used is kind of it's not explicit but but you get what it what it kind of looks like right yeah i thought i thought it was funny i was i was walking walking outside of my outside of my house and just saw it i thought yeah we can use that we can use that and so i really i really like i like this one a lot just because also there's more surprise in the way that you played with the words and everything and and listening to it really really made me remember what some of the things that i was able to do because it was so written it was i was able to to to constantly move between the analogy you know between the desire you know the monsters the edge all of this trying to kind of play between these different levels to help people see what i was talking about you know like allude to desire and then to siren songs and to to these monsters that are on the edge but that are participate in your your desires and so i was like i was like yeah yeah i was trying to do that i remember now and it worked out very well you it like to now to me it seems like you you were starting different different threads in the beginning and then bringing them more and more together and the more you progress the more you so oh yeah he talked about that like two minutes earlier and then and then it's it's it's referencing ref referencing back and forth and that's it it also makes you have this these these aha moments where where you when you get the connection between the the different levels of symbolism let's say yeah that's that's always been what i've been trying to do all the time is to try to surprise people by these connections that they don't expect and that kind of comes together but you know the with the way that you described it makes sense also make sense of the puzzlement the puzzled look that i was getting at the beginning right it's like where is he going where is he going because it that's that's exactly what you said it's like i'm kind of pulling on these threads and i'm i'm pulling them together but you can't see yet you know what the with the image is and then slowly it kind of builds up towards towards with something that now you're like okay okay this is what is going on or this is what is happening so yeah so that makes a lot of sense yeah yeah it's it's yeah it's it's it's very very interesting also very helpful the whole notion of of the of the different levels when you when you start to recognize oh this is actually that and that's also this and this and this this is kind of what made it impossible for me to to push away chris the christian story christian pattern anymore because you know at first you're like oh yeah yeah that makes sense okay cool but but all these other things also make sense but when you see how how how how close let's say it is like there's no it's it's it's all encompassing wherever i look when i when i think about it hard enough or when i when i read the right things then i then i then i get the the connection between the between the things and i never had that with any of my my adopted world views let's say it was you know i was engaged in all this new ag stuff and and maybe a little buddhism here a little hinduism there and oh yeah that sounds nice yeah yeah yes and but but it all it all stops making sense when you stop when you when you start thinking about it really hard and try to compare and and and all of that but that's not the case yeah and mostly the mostly the layering is the issue is is one of the problems of the kind of new age movement or the the new age direction is how it is so individualistic it ends up being in very individualistic and there isn't the natural kind of hierarchy of patterns that lay themselves on top of each other and then create this web that you can live in and so it either ends up being completely idiosyncratic like you know everybody who takes like you said a little bit of this a little bit of that they put it in a pot and then they they have this breathing technique and this yoga practice and you know this and that and they have a singing bowl or whatever and they burn us this this this you know they'll burn a certain amount of incense or whatever but it's all kind of this convoluted thing so it ends up being idiosyncratic or it's like a guru and like a bunch of devotees and then it's it's like this this weird little tyranny that usually doesn't last like it ends up breaking down because it's it doesn't it doesn't participate in these bigger bigger stories and so and it's also it's even sometimes the way that we understand even christianity people want to represent it as a revolutionary thing but we need to re remember that if you read in scripture it says that the disciples went to the synagogue every day right until they were chased out of the synagogue the disciples didn't think they were starting something new they really thought like they were just part like revealing or kind of manifesting something which was already there but they were participating in its revelation and so that's also that's important to understand and that's why like you said that's why christianity ends up once you take it seriously and you realize that it it it connects different levels of reality together you understand why it why it's held the west white held the west together for for millennia so yes the only thing it's also like especially this aspect is something that after jordan talked about it obviously but something that i so much love about nietzsche and and and his writing is because he he understood that he he understood that that's like if you take god out of the equation then everything else falls apart too it's it's impossible to to remain like this what's it like this humanist idea that you you can just be a good human being without having any basis for it yeah that works as long as it's not tested but yeah and as long as you try as long as you take for granted that being good me basically comes from christianity because i love it when people say that you can be good and be an atheist i'm like no you don't understand it's not even whether you can be good and be an atheist it's that what is the ground for which from which you gather the good like even the good itself you know it's so you so you're usually they're saying something like i can be an atheist and still basically follow christian values with a few modifications it's like it doesn't work but it works for a while like you said and then it then it peters out and it kind of runs out of steam and becomes idiosyncratic or tyrannical so yeah i mean what's what's the use why not do the things that you know you shouldn't do but but there's no there's no moral basis for why you shouldn't do it it's just yeah convenience let's say yeah convenience or power like some kind of state enforcement that you know those two sides end up getting stronger right yeah so so that's that's that's that's very interesting for sure yeah i would i would play the next clip go for it awesome the garments of skin is seen by the church fathers [music] as all that is added to our nature in the world of the fall the layers of society of technology those are the flip side and in a way they're of the same nature as our weakness and the passions which come from the world of death saint gregory of nisa tells us that the hairs on our body are a symbol of death they're without feeling dead and appear as our spatial extremities the very limits of our garments of skin just as death appears as our temporal extremity of this earthly life of this earthly life the giants in the bible those that appeared before the flood with a sign of confusion and mixture wrapped in inappropriate sexual desire wrapped in inappropriate sexual desires in the tradition of enoch they're seen as the origin of technology and magic they were known to create hybrids they were full of excess prevailing in conflict until absolute chaos could no longer be held at bay and the world was undone in the waters yeah what interested me in that is that there are so many there's like like three or four melodies in that little part like you keep switching from like so from from different even not just melee but just like the actual tone or the the the feeling that's in the music so it's like the first is this kind of almost like heavy metal heavy guitar and then it moves into something which is almost like it's almost light or it's lighter you know and then you so i don't know i i'm curious to know like what how what's your decision-making process when you're kind of bringing this together i i don't i don't know how how common that is but when i in in general but but especially in music when i when i work on music i experience it as a as a almost visible landscape that that maps that kind of kind of maps on on the landscape that i see with my eyes and it's it's like when i when i go through different melodies it's it's like going through let's say an alley where where it's like all a little it's it's it's dark there and and and maybe a little little wet on the floor or something and and then i then i get into more open spaces and i and i kind of i even i see the the let's say the buildings or the plants or whatever and the colors and that's that's how i try to navigate through that is when i play a note or a melody or something and then then i see yeah yeah that fits but if that it needs a window there or something like like like that let's say and with for example the when you when you talk about the giants and their inappropriate sexual desire like i had a the the the sentence wrapped in an appropriate sexual desire that that caused caused me to feel something specific and then i got my guitar and i tried to try to translate that let's say i feel like the the riff that i play not the heavy metal stuff but the the the palm muted stuff that's in the in the lighter verse it sounds kind of sticky to me yeah yeah yeah yeah interesting yeah kind of kind of yeah that's a good that's a good way of understanding it that makes sense interesting so you listen to the music you listen to the words and then depending on where the music where the words seem to kind of bring you into a different space then you'll apply like a different melody to that to that that's what i'm getting yeah yeah definitely i mean it's not that i always listen to the bit first and then make a start making music for it i oftentimes have a rough beat where i feel like yeah yeah that's that's kind of where where where jonathan's moving here is that this is the same space so i bring it together and then i adjust it and i adjust your speech and i adjust the music again but yeah that's that's kind of my my way of navigating through through that and just out of like i'm just curious to know how like how long does it take to put together a song like this it depends i mean there are some songs that i had to work on for for like a year even to to get to where i wanted to but there are others where where it takes a few weeks to and maybe like there are even ones that i that i have almost done in two days but then then it's it's mix and mastering is is coming and then maybe i'm adjusting it to to sound more a little bit more like the other song so it fits together but yeah that it really depends that's it's from from two interesting definitely and so what is it that fascinated you with this because you said you were kind of the idea of the garments of skin because it's it's definitely one of the most important i mean for me it's one of the most important images i use to help people understand the modern world let's say and understand technology and understand this kind of world of this world of layers so i'm just curious about what like what is it about that idea that that kind of resonated with you on on one hand it's it's again it's showing the symbolism that's it's everywhere like man is a microcosm and and it showed me that so that that yeah made it made it even more more apparent how all encompassing these patterns are and also how this is i would i would say that the the that it's all a even even musical instruments that that we use and also the skin that we have and and all all that we do all the technologies that we have a consequence of the fall like i wasn't i wasn't i was never aware of how that's because we're where we are like i thought yeah yeah we fell that's also a thing that happened but it's that's the reason for history at all and and and so that's yeah that was so strange to to realize yeah but and it's interesting to see how in scripture once you understand that you can notice how god is constantly recapturing let's say the space of the fall and kind of transforming the the fall into into something else you know and so making making technology you know making singing into something which is directed towards him making architecture you know into something which is also a temple and directed towards him so this kind of movement from all these things that are developed by the lineage of cain in the fall then end up being kind of turned back towards towards god of course and then the ultimate image is the new jerusalem in the end of this this kind of filling up of the world with a city but that a city that is shining this glorious city which is this double inversion that you will also talk about later and right right yeah which yeah that's i always have to laugh when i think about that because it's so i don't even know no no worry to describe it it's it's it's so funny because i would would have thought that there's no double inversion that that's just things are wrong and then you then then they are set right and that seems so authoritative and and so but but it's more like i mean like like saint christopher tricking the devil into into revealing christ to him like and and this is funny i can't i cannot not laugh at that yeah especially that story and then then ultimately like the ultimate irony of the story of saint christopher is that he wants because you have to always remember that he wants to serve the strongest person that's what he wants and so he goes out and he serves these different characters that finally kind of reveal christ to him but he still doesn't get it right so he he's there on the side of the river and then he ends up serving the weakest person right so this child his little baby comes up to him and so he he he he serves the weakest person but then it's actually it's actually christ tricking saint christopher into serving him right that's what's going on it's like he's like just carry me across the water and then as he's carrying him across the water he's realizing what's going on and it's like okay this is not what i thought it was going to be this is not what i thought and then and then finally once he reaches to the other side then he realizes that he the thing that he wanted from the beginning which was to serve the strongest man or the the the highest king he ended up doing it without even realizing that he was doing it like it's part of also he was kind of he was kind of saved despite himself you could say you know so it's a it's really an amazing it's such an amazing like every time you look at it you end up seeing how there's a lot of other stuff going on in that story that maybe you didn't notice at the outset yeah it's very often like this this idea that you have to let go of something when you're when you're clinging too much to it let's say but then you like not not always but but sometimes it god just gives it to you anyway after you let go of it after you you know start your your detachment to it let's say exactly like when you're too attached to something it makes you lose it and then if you if you if you're willing to be detached from it you find it again in very surprising ways you know sometimes not in the way you expect it but it definitely comes back to you yeah i mean that's that's even something that you you can you can observe in human relationships when you when you're clinging to a person let's say a friend or girlfriend or or something like that and it's yeah that's it's very very very interesting yeah i can i can play the next clip oh no before that the the i don't i don't know if that worked maybe tell me when i when i made the the music for desire i that was the last song that i made for for the album and i wanted to do like i wanted to have a sexy song let's say you know where it's like did that work out well i don't i do because the problem is that i don't remember the names of the it's it's not the last one we heard but that one before where you say like the things the etch and the end represent the same structure and all that i don't know if i would have okay so i wouldn't know if i would have recognized it that way maybe it's also because i don't expect it to be that and so i'm not sure i would recognize it that way sorry yeah no problem no problem yeah i'll i'll play the i'll play oh i think because of the funky bass as the narrative fabric of our world begins to fill in quantities that are barely possible to believe right with images yeah you're right you're right i did it's funny because when you played it this time i did notice the bass and i'm like he's got this like funky bass to go in in there and so but i didn't connect it which is obviously which makes sense because that's also what funk was always about kind of like that you know what's his name barry white or whatever with like the the this kind of low bass and so no you're right now that you say it and i remember that it's kind of low base coming in i'm like yeah okay i get it i get it oh nice yeah thank you awesome okay okay the next one is the the seventh song the ultimate unexpected it's very short and i made it so short because i want people to want to listen to it twice the monster is both encountered with the surprise of the future as we move forward in time so to encounter the unexpected the monster is also the encounter with the surprise of the edge as the church expands to the dark corners of the world but also the dark corners of our own lives as the spirit of god transforms us for most of us there will always be foreign elements monsters hiding in our garments of skin so here in pentecost this monster is represented as not yet in the church in the church [music] but as part of the potential into which the church can grow as part of that which can hear the gospel in its language as part of the potential into which the church can grow as part of that which can hear the gospel in its language i really like that one i think it's probably one of the most musical ones that has that has more more melody and the idea of kind of singing over my voice as i'm saying things i think it really is effective it really does something and it also it almost makes you hear the mu the melody in my own voice as i'm talking and you can hear the melody being sung behind it you know it kind of fuses together with my with my voice i really think it's probably one of the best ones in terms of the terms of the song element of it yeah i think it was also i gotta say the maybe the most fun to record at least the singing stuff because it yeah it moves very nicely and also you mentioned it yourself like that you have an inherit maybe everyone but you especially have an inherent melody in in the way that you talk and it it thank you it makes it rather easy to do this kind of stuff yeah that's funny i don't realize i wonder like i wonder if if i have the same melody in french as i do in english i'd be curious to know like if the language you speak will affect the way like the the the tonality that you use i'm one i don't know i have no idea i might i mean i don't i don't i don't really speak french like only a few sentences even though i had it four years in school i just i wasn't very good at it well what about you between english and german do you feel like it's a different melody in terms of the the sounds that it's bringing about it's more melodious in in english than in german i would i would say that's that's something that i notice in in general is that german is a very technical language it's not it's not ugly to me but it's very technical and english is more i wanna call it an emotional language or or a fluid language more than more than german so i but i but i think that the reason why you're you have so much inherent melody in the way that you talk is because you're you're a french canadian maybe yeah i think it comes from that so yeah friends canadians are definitely like our french is very sing-songy it's you know like there's some it's like old like this old pre-revolutionary french and so it has a lot of we have a way more yeah we have way more tonality and than the parisians do we have more sounds even than the parisians have in their in their in their french so i might look at one of your you started doing french content as well right yes yes yeah like every two weeks with jp maxwell we're doing some french podcasts yeah nice yeah i won't be i most likely won't be able to segment that myself but but if you at one point or maybe lisa i don't know how well she speaks french or whoever is is cutting out of that like a three-minute piece that's that's that's that has coherence to it i would i would try to i would try to make a song out of that just to just yeah that'd be interesting yeah that means the more you say it the more that i realize you're how right you are in terms of tonality because the the french like we have up and down in our in our sound so so like the french will go up and stop and then we'll go up and down in our in our in our tone so it's like a a french from france for a house we'll say meson and then we'll say may zone like i'm exaggerating but it's like it goes i'm exaggerating a lot for french canadians might hear this but it will go like up and down and like that so it's more it's it has more yeah yeah i never thought about that interesting yeah it's do you because you say for most of us there'll always be foreign elements monsters hiding in our garments of skin that's that that kind of ties into the idea of theosis right because we're being transformed by by the holy spirit in our lives and trying to become more holy and and grow closer to god is there like do people do do people finish that in their lives or is it is it always something that christ finishes when you enter or before you enter paradise i mean some some saints definitely reach theosis in their earthly lives there are different examples of that so so it's possible but i would say not for i would say for most people it it's not that it's it's it's kind of can something which continues after your body like after the resurrection let's say something like that and it's also described in sanct in saint like saying gregor of nisa theosis is not described as something that you kind of arrive to in a static way you know it's rather this kind of ongoing this kind of glory to glory a notion where there's an indefinite there's like an infinite glory that you're attaining and so it's it's non-stop it's like a it's as if like the pattern is is going up it's constantly moving up so it's not it's not just like you know this image of the angel sitting in the cloud where it's like you've got you've reached and you're there and you're just kind of there it's it's more of this this continuous synergy of ascent that is that is constantly going on that's very interesting so so so you say it's continuing even after the resurrection and and after well well after the apocalypse and after where we're technically saints in heaven oh well that's what that's what at least that's my take on it like i'm sure you'll find people who disagree with me but at least that's my take on what i get from saint gregory at least that it's it's just this kind of this infinite this can this infinite ascent into into the life of god so which also seems more more logical let's say because it's it's not like god is finite so if if we if we learn to be in god and learn more about god even after all of this stuff is done it would make sense that it goes on for forever yeah yeah that's at least that's the way that i that i see it in terms of it's in terms of saying gregory is especially because he's my my guide for most of this is he your your your patron sync too no my patron saint is maximus it's same max with the confessor yeah that's nice that's actually my that's actually my my name like that's my orthodox name is maximus and so but i don't use it i stopped using it very soon after my baptism just because like even my bishop kind of just stopped using it and then i just kind of happened but recently my bishop when he gave me communion he came to the spoon and he said he said don't you have another name and i looked at him and i was like yeah it's maximus so he said so maximus received the blood and body so i was like that's awesome so i need to reappropriate that maybe and start using it again like you can i'll change my name on the channel it'll be like maximus pejo or something nice yeah i'll i'll incorporate that when we when we make new music that's kind of cool but it's definitely like i would say my my my patreon is a maximus but saint gregory said ephraim and saint christopher are obviously the saints that i'm the closest to and that i feel the most drawn to and most taught by you could say in different ways saying that from the syrian yeah definitely he he wrote him on paradise yes right yeah yeah but just in general his his theology and the and the syrian fathers saying isaac this hearing as well their theology is very is very powerful because it it it's more non-dual in the way that i present it you know like saint isaac the syrian is the one who said things like you know that the hell and the fire in hell is the love of god and those types of statements you know so i you know saint ephraim talks about the womb of god like the idea that the the sacred womb out of which the the the out of which god kind of comes out of and so they're they're more non-dual in the way they describe things and so it's closer to i feel like they get the pattern more not more but they just get it they just present it more succinctly let's say yeah i understand what you mean when you when you focus too much on the the the duality let's say then you become agnostic in the end so yeah no no i think that's very helpful to bring it together again because it also it is together it's not like i the way i understand it it's not like there's real there's there's a real that sounds dumb but i don't think that there's a real duality i think that's more how we perceive it then you know god is not it's not it's not it's not different it's it's it's not cut up that's yeah i mean the best way the best way to understand it is that is that duality is contained in unity but it doesn't have an autonomous existence and so it's that so that duality is fine as long as it's always moving towards unity and contained in unity you know and so that that would be the sin the fall would be something like perm completely inhabiting duality you know and that's what that's why it's the knowledge of good and evil but it brings you into a world of duality in which you see that as the highest as the highest thing you know because god creates with duality it starts right away at the beginning god created heaven and earth there's the first duality right there in the beginning of scripture and so so duality is definitely it's it's mostly the whether or not you move into unity or whether or not you see duality as the the final step like the final step in in the world yeah i see thank you for for clearing that up i'll play the next song yeah go for it next the next clip i might have three favorite songs from the album but this is definitely one one of them it's cyanocephalus waiting for crumbs it's the most punky let's say or a rocky song maybe on the edge of the church maybe on the edge of the world [music] this one is not a canaanite but a canaanite that might seem like a really bad pun but i assure you that it will cause modern interpreters to cry foul in reading these ancient accounts and will say that all of this question is just a matter of bad transcription i don't think so [music] i don't think so all these foreigners in the icon of pentecost culminating to the impossible monster are the surprise cover on the edge of the church anticipating maybe waiting for the crumbs maybe waiting for the anti-dorans we can imagine flowing out of the church so that even those we can barely recognize as our brothers can have a foretaste of the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of heaven yeah yeah that was the that was when it was also in the talk when it was like i felt like i was moving into tricky territory where i was going to start to say things which which would which would make people feel uneasy when we're the other but in the end i don't think it did that but i could i knew that i was starting to talk that it was getting into a weird in a weird place let's say so the punk music makes sense that kind of this kind of punk vibe makes sense in that moment for sure yeah i can imagine that it's it's it's when i when i when i go through the this this bit of the the talk when i when i when i went through this bit of the talk when i was checking if there was anything i wanted to change and i also when i when i adjust the rhythm of your speech i speak it myself to the music and then see where i should put the words so it's like i'm rapping with you [laughter] and and that's all like when when i when i then later on thought about this bit and and and when went a little further and and started exploring this these let's say these sentences or these these notions it's very easy to get into a form of anger or something like something like that because peop some people are so unwilling to to have that be part of the tradition like the modern the modern historians for example as you said yeah no no that's just a misunderstanding of ancient texans that it's no it's not yeah because it's like the analogies play themselves out so perfectly that to say that this is just a misunderstanding is completely insane like it's completely insane and it also that's one of the like one of the main strategies that i've been trying to give to people to help counter the counter the scholarly way of interpreting is is has to do with attention and memory and it's a very sound argument which is that mistakes happen all the time and it's almost like it's weird because it's almost it's close to like an evolutionary argument right it's like there's a mutation and then that mutation it continues and because the mutation continues you can't discount it you can't say well that's not what it was it originally was like no what are you talking about there so even if you say it's a mistake it's not a mistake because it was remembered and it was transmitted and it grew and the analogies accumulated around it and so it was actually inciting it had the insight into something which was true you know even if it is just a mistake in transcription it ended up being a better insight into what was going on in that story and and you can understand that all the time these types of these types of let's say one of the things i talk about in is that in as stories last longer in time they tend to snap to the pattern like even memory the law the older the memories you have the more they tend to to kind of snap to the pattern because it's like it's a golden thread that you can follow that kind of joins you together you join things together and so when that happens that's always when the scholars want to tell us that no this isn't what the christians originally thought or whatever that is and yeah so it's it's just to me it's that type of argumentation has become completely irrelevant and useless and hopefully people can use that argument sometimes too like people can take that type of thinking to to resist the temptation that we have to give in to this kind of iconoclastic modern scholarship yeah that's this idea of there is no literal interpretation of the biblical stories right that's because it doesn't it doesn't matter if if if saint christopher was a man with a dog with with a dog face or if he was a a giant or if he was just someone who looked normal but but had this monstrous way of acting it doesn't it doesn't we don't like first of all we don't have access to that and and it ultimately it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't matter because it's those aren't just aren't the categories the category that was used was the appropriate category it's the it's the best category for explaining what he is so that we can understand it later in time and so that was the category used and it's that it's the same with acenocephalus xenocephaly in general which is that it was the best category to describe the experience of something so strange you know that it looks animalistic to us and so that's a universal experience any any tribe any group can have that experience of something that is so other from themselves that it looks it's it's it's connects to animality let's say and so in that sense it's it's still the best category and just like i argue even in the in my text about the the idea of hippopotamus it's probably one of the best way of describing it's like a hippopotamus means a water horse and so does it mean that there's a genetic relationship between the a horse the way we understand it and hippopotamus that's stupid that's a stupid way of thinking and so why do we want to now impose the same thing back on the idea of a cenocephalus and think they were idiots for thinking that there were height that they were dog human hybrids and so it's like you know who knows maybe there were i don't know because there seems like there's some on the horizon for us now like it seems like we're gonna have human dog hybrids at some point so it's like it's so that you shouldn't completely discount it either but you also shouldn't get hung up on that because that's not the that's not the point of the that's not the point of the story so yeah yeah i totally agree i mean it's interesting when when we when we we one can think and talk about yeah maybe there even were real dog-headed men and all that and yeah but but it's it's not it's not important really it's just it's it's interesting but not important it's not it's yeah it's not it's not i mean it's not useful to you to to kind of go down that route almost it's the same even with the whole everything that's related to ufos and to aliens and all this stuff it's the same problem which is that people they they miss the force for the trees they don't they don't understand what it means as a as a manifestation in a story and kind of this social moment and are hung up on you know like how did they get here and what are their spaceships and you know are they interdimensional beings or are they interplanetary beings or are they just projections of our psyche or are they this or that and like yeah okay whatever that's fine i mean whatever but let's try to first of all understand what how this fits into a bigger story and what it actually means that whatever those beings are that are poking their noses into the world like it doesn't they they're aliens like they're aliens in the strict sense they're like the ultimate strange that is that is coming into reality and so it actually tells us a little bit about about where we are in the story when that starts to happen right so there again is this unwillingness to to recognize the christian story like this whole postmodern notion of there is no overarching narrative there's no no right or wrong there's no strange or familiar really and aliens are just just the same as human beings or the animals that we know anything and yeah it's it's it seems to me that and we i've been talking about that with with people from my from my parish a few days ago is that we but it's hard to talk about this stuff it's definitely difficult it's not difficult also because there's a there's this there's right now a social stigma of even addressing this question right there there's a it's like to to even acknowledge the experience of the strange is dangerous it's like dangerous because people attribute it to like to racism or to some kind of social pressure but it's a universal experience right it's like it's not it's actually not it's not one which you can limit to one people it's just a universal experience of strange and if you deny it you're denying a very important aspect of what it means to even recognize any identity of anything it's i think to me it's better to talk about how we can integrate the strange properly and how we integrate the strange improperly that's much better much better way to talk about this than just try to deny the category itself because it's a you're you're denying and you're denying what it means to to to be human forever universally denying it and that's not that's not a it's not useful because it'll it ends up coming back secretly it ends up coming back strangely in like in kind of unconsciously and pops up in ways in hypocritical ways that people don't even notice right they end up doing it but without noticing they're doing it and then it just becomes very very odd that's funny because like yesterday i saw a sticker that said space invaders against speciesism or something like that my goodness that's amazing like you know that people are there like you know the people are there but it's nuts that it's nuts that that even the trope that somehow let's say being suspicious of aliens like of actual like let's say science fiction level aliens right like mars attack like being suspicious mars attack is a great example of like of a play a joke on that where it's like they want to be so accepting to the aliens that the aliens just walk all over them and they basically destroy the world and they're like oh no we don't wanna we don't wanna we don't wanna in trouble maybe we misunderstood them like maybe it's like no man that's it's that's nuts that's yeah i i'm not surprised but i'm i find it hilarious that we that we're there i did i did i did remember the the thing that i wanted to say earlier is that yeah what i what i was talking about with the people in my parish is that there's this and and i mentioned it earlier this unwillingness to notice the christian pattern and so what science did is it took everything that christianity says and all the explanations that christianity gives and just put it aside and then say okay it can't be that so it has to be something else and then they come up with all these weird theories and and ideas yeah is that i mean am i am i being unfair to them is that really unwillingness or is that it's actually mostly it's actually mostly it's it's mostly a question of levels is what it is it's it's a confusion of levels of reality it's one of the biggest problems between a traditional worldview and a scientific worldview which is that the the scientific worldview move towards kind of an analysis of phenomena rather than the meaning of phenomena and ex and seeing the world through meaning as the alt as the first lens let's say and wanted to analyze phenomena and then what they did is they mistook stories that were talking about meaning for stories that were talking about analysis and then they they decided this has no value because it's not properly talking about let's say analysis of phenomena in a way like to analyze it and quantify it in a way that you can reproduce it right that's that's what science is all right and so when they see descriptions that aren't like that they want to discount them and they're and the worst part of that is that they're they're across they were in the 19th century especially across from christians who who wanted that too who like wanted to take the traditional stories and make them into these these silly analytical quantifiable descriptions and so it's like you so so they are lost right because that's not what they are and so they lost that fight and so now we're still dealing with the consequence of that but i mean it's kind of petering out and you can see like people like john vervicky and jordan peterson and and these kind of people these people that are looking at consciousness and the science of consciousness it's petering out because they now now that they've reached kind of the end of the rope of what materialism can offer they have to reconsider you know the problem of meaning and the problem of description without meaning is actually impossible and that scientists all along were functioning with implicit categories of meaning that were given to them and but as you kind of push that and you keep pushing and you push the meaning stories to the side then things start to fragment and to crumble and you realize okay wait wait a minute i i'm in trouble like if i don't recapture these this meaning manner of telling of of describing the world so so it's not really the case that science is let's say in the wrong place it's it's more that it it doesn't acknowledge that it also let's say has to work with meaning and if we were to incorporate that again then science also wouldn't wouldn't let's say cause the problems that it does now exactly science wouldn't necessarily be problematic if they but it's almost like this is the trait it's like a secret it's like a secret of reality which is often to increase power you actually have to sacrifice meaning to increase power and so for cain to become stronger in physicality he had to move further away from the garden and this is kind of the the re this is the reality of it you know you have to you have to you have to give up meaning to increase power and you can see it like you know you could you could you could see it in all kinds of ways like you could see that you would get an army and the bigger the army is right the more difficult it will be for you to maintain the centralized meaning of what you're doing and then your army the bigger it gets the more powerful it is but the more danger it is that it's going to start to break apart and fragment as it gets bigger like example alexander right that's what happened to alexander's legacy right is that it was got so big that once the the meaning the the let's say the person holding it together died then it just broke apart because it was too it was too powerful and too big so that's a trade-off that's real and it's but it's a mystery in the way the world cycles and the idea is that as you move away and you move towards the end then something happens and it gets again it gets restored or returned towards the the glory and that's the new jerusalem is the last example of that where all of this movement to the end of the world gets changed into these glorious you know walls of of of jewels and of gold to kind of manifest how they're participating in the in the glory that's fascinating so marvin thank you so much for doing this and for all the work you do like i'm constantly amazed at what you come up with and i not only that but i feel very humbled that that that you're that you're out there kind of spending the time to to to make what i'm saying beautiful and to kind of make it in a way that people can enjoy and can celebrate and participate in and so i feel very humbled and very fortunate that that you're doing that so thank you for all the work you do yeah my pleasure really thank thank you for for for allowing me to do that and giving me the material because it's yeah it's it's it's helped me so so so much to to move towards this i would have never thought that it it'd be possible for me at all and it yeah it made my life better in so many ways yeah thank thank you so much glory to god and yeah yeah thank you so everybody go look in the description we'll have all the links to his different channels to youtube channel but also to the different places where you can get his music we can stream it where you can buy it and so so i wish you the best in in the future and we're looking forward to seeing what are the next things you come up with yeah thank you also all the best to you and i'm looking forward to talking to you again all right thanks awesome
