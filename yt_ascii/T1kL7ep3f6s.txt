ladies and gentlemen at long last after years of talking and calling out these day traders one of them has called me out cameron foose who you may know because i made a video about him a few months ago i'm excited to say that he finally responded and i can't wait to watch with you guys let's take a little peek and see what we're in for woo i'm excited he's going to address the concerns guys i may be i may be taking an l here i may it might be the first l i've ever taken in my life i'm ready to take my lumps okay cameron give it to me but first before we get into his whole his whole take down let me remind you about what i originally said about cameron so first i called him out for a fake woke transformation successful people aren't happy happy people are successful wow where he realized that suddenly he didn't need all this money and flashy lifestyle because honestly he's still selling the same success he was before but recently he's just reinvented himself under the guise of minimalism and being like super tan which objectively hey it's true it's true man but he's still selling the same dream to people that he said he was no longer going to be selling and specifically recently it's taken the form of a forex bot which automatically trades forex for you and achieves wild returns it's basically the same bs passive income claims we've been hearing forever that you can make above average returns in the market with zero extra work or risk but instead of being explained by drop shipping or youtube automation or better yet magic the reason we hear this time is of course robots did it now to be clear trading robots do exist but bad trading robots also exist and robots in ar are buzz words that people often use to make crazy claims and not get called out for it like if i tell you that i could make you 20 a month in the market consistently you're never going to believe me but there's a bunch of people promising that right now with an ai expert make a wild claim robots did it baby so in the last video i pointed all this out and said that if cameron really had a bot that he could make two percent a week with like he was advertising in his link tree he could have stuck a hundred thousand dollars in the account and become a billionaire within 10 years the fact that he's not doing that instead selling the bot to you should tell you everything you need to know about the actual usefulness of this bot i wrapped up the video by pointing out that the broker he was using was unregulated and therefore dangerous and overall it was a pretty normal coffeezilla video taking down yet another one of these millionaire day traders that's been around basically forever so with that context out of the way let's take a look at his video and see what he has to say about my arguments and how he argues against this forex trading bots i can't believe i'm actually talking about them because they're so controversial and stupid i even got coffeezilla coming after me making a whole video about me talking about forex trading bots and i haven't even made a youtube video about it wait wait a second you definitely did in my video i'm literally responding to your youtube video about iq trade the the little trading bot you have this is my first one but i don't blame them i actually haven't even watched the video it's probably pretty funny wait what you're responding to my video without watching my video what is this dude is this the response it's just you didn't watch it and you're just gonna blindly make a video defending yourself without watching my video this is insane what that's why i haven't even made a video about our iq trade bot that i'm partnered with again yeah you did he's gonna say i'm partnered with iq trade but that's fancy language for i co-founded iq trade and that's why i am behind this company and i am the co-founder of iq trade wait are you behind it or did you found it there's a big difference i'm a big fan of the product also i created the the product that's really important because he's going to talk about how he uses iq trade and he just likes the bot but to be clear he co-founded the company you know it's like it's like being the inventor of the iphone and being like yeah i really like the iphone not biased or anything i really like it because we were beta testing making sure everything was set before i could actually come out here and comfortably talk about this even though copyzilla somehow found out about it through my instagram or something i don't know you made a video about it this is not complicated yeah i talked about it briefly in another youtube video and it is went full-blown on me again hate to be a little critical of you cam but you're saying i went ape on you but you you didn't watch the video so i don't know what to say i could have said you were a wonderful dude in that video and you'd have no idea which is hilarious coffeezilla i'm a fan i think you're funny i take no offense i would make a youtube video about talking about forex trading bots as well but now oddly enough i'm actually using one but only because i tested it and it was actually making me money ah this is really important guys he would be making a video about how big of a scam trading robots were except he used it and it's making him so much money or is it because he co-founded the trading robot i mean i mean guys i always thought selling overpriced courses was a scam and then i started one and then i realized they're totally great i mean that line of reasoning is so bad like you're literally saying hey i've always said that these things were a scam but then i built my own version of the scam and it isn't a scam anymore so watching through the rest of this video i'm sort of amazed at the cognitive dissonance because he seems to anticipate just how ridiculous it is for someone who's been talking trash about forex bots forever to suddenly flip around and make one and he also anticipates how ridiculous his whole scheme sounds but he doesn't even try to cover for it if you followed me for the last 17 years of trading you would know that i've always been a big proponent of talking about forex and especially talking about automated trading because that sounds absolutely ridiculous listen if that actually worked everybody would be making money and we'd all be rich and nobody would have to be doing anything yeah so what's your argument against that because you'd think i could press play right now and he'd give me a good argument for why his bot is different instead the argument is her der robots are less emotional than people here's the problem with humans as traders is one we are emotional wrecks especially when it comes to money in greed the good thing about a forex trading bot if you set it up correctly and if you have the risk parameters set to protect yourself there's no emotions involved you give them a set of rules and they actually follow it and they don't break those rules sometimes those rules can be broken if i seem stunned right now it's because i'm i'm in awe of the ability to both like say why it's a scam be like yeah automated trading is ridiculous if it were real oh we'd all be no one would be working like how could this exist and then also simultaneously be selling automated trading without ever defending yourself it's incredible look i am stunned i am i'm blown away and the worst part of all of this is that he shills this unregistered broker again we talked about this in the last video he pitches you on something called hey forex an unregulated forex broker so not only are you paying cameron 125 a month for this ridiculous unproven bot but you're also told that cameron has partnered with hey forex as their broker what is up guys brief interruption here i got some big news iconic fx and cam foose has just partnered up with hey forex.com the number one trading broker in the game and let me tell you why first of all all of you guys want low deposits we got low deposits all you guys want big leverage we got 500 to one and not only is this a forex broker you can trade forex you can trade crypto you can trade stocks you can trade cfds which means you can trade gold silver oil basically every asset never miss a trade again by partnering up with us and joining hey forex broker i just joined as well now this is super important nothing he said is that great 500 to one leverage will get you wrecked in the market people don't know that getting getting those kind of account leverages it's so easy to blow up your account but as you'll find out that's not that big of a deal they kind of want you to blow up your account in america there's limits on how much leverage you can offer offer customers because people will inevitably blow up their accounts if you offer them too much there's regulation around this issue and then there's this point about low deposits so who are we appealing to i guess poor people with low deposits they can put in that's who you're appealing to with this forex broker none of this makes up for the fact that they are unregulated unregulated brokers are never to be trusted if you take anything from coffeezilla it's lack of regulation in banking or finance is a bad thing ladies and gentlemen it's how con man thrive who's behind it nobody knows right let's say tomorrow they freeze your assets what are you gonna do well your only option is to go to saint vincent and the grenadines a caribbean offshore tax haven you literally have to fly there and try to beg these people for your money back this is where it's located on a world map ladies and gentlemen good luck let me just say that good luck and you could be mad at cameron foose but really you should be mad at yourself for falling for one of these unregistered brokers so the point is why would cameron be doing this why would he partner purposely with an unregulated broker who's using the same location as many other scam forex companies this is really important offshore caribbean islands are constantly listed as the location of scam finance companies whether it be forex whether it be crypto whatever in just one list of scam finance companies i found six other companies known to be fraudulent that we're listed as being at st vincent's and the grenadines so why would cameron partner with an unregulated exchange well the answer might be in their affiliate program where they offer revenue sharing with the affiliate because every time you trade on a forex there's obviously a fee for that trade a spread on that trade and the exchange makes a profit if you get wiped out from a margin call whatever the exchange is making money right and when they make that money they offer affiliates a whopping 30 commission on all of those trades doesn't matter the amount traded 30 goes to your account ladies and gentlemen so the more you trade the more fees there are the more fees there are the more money the exchange makes and the more money the exchange makes the more money the affiliate makes who in this case is cameron so are you guys getting it yet cameron is financially incentivized for you to trade a whole bunch and sign up with hey forex who's gonna split that money with them so then combine that with the fact that cameron wants you to sign up with a trading bot which can trade as often as iq trade wants which he co-founded so no matter what happens he wins if you get wiped out he wins he gets kickbacks from hey forex and iq trade if you get lucky and make money cameron also wins and he gets kickbacks even if hey forks refuses to give your money back cameron still makes money it's such a ridiculous scheme that it would almost be laughable if i didn't know that people are definitely probably putting their money here and then unfortunately this guy sits back and profits but maybe you shouldn't listen to me guys all this talk about affiliate schemes and offshore unregulated brokers i mean after all guys coffeezilla videos according to cameron foose are just full of a fan base who are all the losers who tried to escape the nine to five and failed gave up and are bitter so don't listen to me guys be a winner don't be like those bitter losers who work nine to five jobs instead you need to be like cameron foose because if you watch this channel there's a very good chance according to cameron foose that you are a a bitter loser but maybe it's not just my fans that are bitter losers maybe it's a cameron's fans actually because in this video he uploaded he had to delete all the comments and remove them because apparently they're getting so brutal that he now there's just one comment on the video and it's just cameron there's 24 000 views and only one comment because apparently all the other ones are being deleted maybe maybe his fans are also bitter guys bitter perhaps because their icon cameron foose the legendary day trader sold them out for a quick cash crap look all in all i would say i'm disappointed in cameron he had a chance to actually address concerns about his sketchy bot forex partnership and instead he chose to ignore criticism double down and delete comments and not really address any of my video because he didn't watch any of my video if he had maybe he would have had something more interesting to say instead it was just another sales pitch for iq trade which is not his this bot that he just happens to be you know interested in he co-founded the bot he makes money when you but get into it he makes money when you go to hey forex an unregulated broker in some offshore tax haven which good luck getting your money back from that so i don't know all in all this doesn't any none of this sounds like the actions of a successful and well-meaning day trader but that's just me i don't know i'd love to hear what you guys think out of this exchange who won who lost did cameron foose take us down a peck are you one of these coffeezilla bitter losers who just works a nine to five all day let me know in the comments below and that's basically it i'll see you guys in the next one
