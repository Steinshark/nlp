what i see here in our theory is our theory of combination will get us to ever bigger and bigger infinities but there's no limit and so i can't start with a theory of the one big consciousness because i can never get there what i can do is have a theory of conscious agents that sort of is forever approaching the the highest level but but at every point my theory will say you're not there because oh you're now at level 50 of cantor's hierarchy now you're level 100 but there's an infinite number of levels so what's interesting about this scientific theory is that there will be no room for hubris or dogma because the theory itself will be telling you there's infinitely more steps to go and you're only at step one one billion but there's an infinite number so this is really a very very when you do this you get the fractal notion that you were talking about but you get the mathematics coming back and saying exactly how the fractal works and also telling you be very very humble because your mathematical theory will never get to the the final description there's no scientific theory of everything even a theory of consciousness yeah and it see that seems to really fit with the idea that most mystical systems are apophatic that is if you if you read many of the the more famous mystics or if you look at different non-dual systems they tend to always have this it's an infinite regress there is no positive statement of the infinite it's always a a constant denial of that which was or a constant shedding of that which was below but there is no reaching the point even saint gregory nisa talks about let's say the ascent into god as being infinite that infinite in the sense that there is no end to it it's not a it's not a stasis you don't become an angel sitting on a cloud you know with wings and a harp there's this kind of infinite movement up up the hierarchy of beings and so it seems to show this this this this hierarchy as being as being infinite similar to what you seem to be described absolutely and so once again i think that there's there's no contradiction between what i'm saying and these these other spiritual ideas the the idea is to simply take them seriously enough to make them precise this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] hello everyone i am very excited to present to you my discussion with don hoffman don often is a professor he's a scientist at the university of california irvine many of you watching this will already have seen interviews with him will know a little bit what his theories are he is known for his work on cognitive science the science of perception but he is also working on a model of reality a mathematical model which would describe reality as emanating mostly from consciousness and i've listened to many interviews with him and i've read some of his work and i'm very fascinated to see where his ideas connect but also disconnect with the ideas that i'm presenting to you in the symbolic world and i was quite surprised i kind of pressed him on some of the questions he answered very graciously and i was very surprised to see the places where really our ideas connect and you will notice on your own the places where they didn't totally connect but i was surprised how much of his ideas are attuned to what we talk about at the symbolic world it is in a way a continuation of my recent discussion with cognitive scientists like ian mcgillcrist and also bernado castro and i think you will enjoy it tremendously what i'm hoping to do is i am not a scientist and so i i'm more of a religious thinker an artist and so many of your your pronouncements and your formulations and sometimes i would say they elucidated me wonder and excitement and sometimes they lose they bring out in the confusion and sometimes in frustration and wonder so what i'd like to do is to look at the way you formulate your theory ask you some questions about the way you formulate the theory and so not going into the i will trust you for the mathematics because i'm not a mathematician and so it's mostly about trying to understand how how it's formulated and see if we can understand if you can understand things and connect them also to to other you know to ancient religious thought i know you've already mentioned that that it does in some places but maybe explore that if that's okay with you sounds good sounds like fun all right and so the way that i understand your your thought there seems to be two basic threads you could say that is one is to is to argue against the the relationship between our experience of the world and something which we could call objective reality or fundamental reality that there is a disjoint between the two that because we've been evolved for fitness we don't have access to the most fundamental aspects of the the objective world we could say so that seems to be one thread that you follow and then there's another thread which is to rebuild a vision of the world which would be something like conscious realism that is seeing consciousness is fundamental and rebuilding let's say mapping back out to the different sciences and the different ways of thinking based on that on that on that theory and so the first thing i'd like to ask you is how do you connect those two together it is how do you how do you connect the one thread which is to in your latest book the case against reality especially to to help people understand that we don't have a perception of reality and how does that lead you to this consciousness theory great question so so they are two separate steps and one might by the first step and not the second or vice versa so they are in some sense independent propositions the the first about evolution and our perceptions and whether sensory systems have evolved to perceive truths about objective reality whatever that reality might be that's a technical question right that's that's really saying we have this theory of the mathematically precise theory of evolution of natural selection it's we have evolutionary game theory so it's it's really a technical question what is the probability that any sensory system has been shaped by natural selection to to see any aspect of the structure of objective reality whatever that reality might be and to my surprise there are very deep reasons within that theory why sensory systems are not shaped to see objective reality as it is the structure of objective reality i had some ideas going into it about why some reasons there for some reason we might not see reality as it is but when i my students and my colleagues started really doing the math i realized that the answer goes far deeper it's really in something as deep as what's called the the payoff the fitness payoff functions that guide evolution they simply don't contain information about objective reality and its structure so so that's that's the real deep reason why we're not so once you you go there and you realize okay what evolution is telling us is that sensory systems have evolved to guide adaptive behavior period we thought most of us thought that to do that they would of course shape the evolution of shape or sensory systems to present the truth because of course you need to see the truth to be fit and it turns out no no it's just a useful guide the the sensory systems are a useful guide for adaptive behavior period and so so then this forces you to step back and go okay if they're not showing you a window on the truth you know how should we think about our sensory systems the attitude is that i took as well the best metaphor that that i have right now is something like a user interface or a virtual reality headset those are two good good useful metaphors but as soon as you you say that that we don't see reality as it is and what we're seeing space and time and physical objects and shapes and colors and motions as soon as you see that that's not the truth according to evolution and by the way i'm not dr near about evolution i'm not saying that evolutionary theory is correct i'm just saying that it's the best theory we have no competitor right now there is no theory anywhere near the sophistication and prowess of evolution financial selection so there's just not no other game in town for a scientist in this role that's why i studied it i thoroughly expect that in 100 years we'll have a better framework so so i'm not at all dr near about evolution but as a scientist it's my duty to take the best theories we have right now look at them so then the next step is if evolutionary theory tells us that our senses are just a headset or just an interface the question is an interface to what and and it can't tell you that it it's telling you that you don't see the truth but it can't tell you what the truth is so now you have to take a leap beyond that theory and this is typical in science you look at your scientific theories you find their limits and then you have to take creative leap where the theories can't tell you where to go now what they can tell you is you you say okay i'm gonna make this leap and i'm gonna propose this mathematical theory then you can look at this projection for example back into space and time and then it better look like evolution by natural selection so so the theory can tell you if you're wrong about your your leap right but it can't tell you if you're right and it can't tell you where to look for your leap so i decided there's you could imagine various ways to try to leave i'm very interested in consciousness and what's called the hard problem of consciousness how is consciousness related to physical systems like our brains or or possibly artificial intelligences and and so i decided instead of starting with physics and trying to boot up consciousness since evolutionary theory tells me that space time itself is just a user interface let me start the other way i'll start with a theory of consciousness on its own terms so a mathematical theory of consciousness consciousness so not most of my brilliant colleagues and friends who are working on this are starting with mathematical models of what physical systems must be like to create consciousness or to be consciousness and evolutionary theory makes it clear that that game is dead those things aren't even real they don't even they're just interface symbols so i'm not going to start with trying to postulate what does a system in space and time have to have so they could create consciousness i'm not doing that i'm saying let's start with a theory of consciousness on its own terms what do i mean by consciousness what's the minimal mathematical posit that i could make to boot up a full-fledged theory of consciousness and so that's where i and my colleagues chieftain prakash when you sing robert krantner chris fields and and others that i work with have come up with this idea of conscious realism and started working on this mathematical model of consciousness and ultimately the goal then is to show how the dynamics of conscious agents where we're assuming that that's the fundamental reality for now right by the way i don't think science could ever give us a full theory of truth so we so there's no final theory of everything from science but we can talk about that later but but right now this this this theory would then be the as far as we've gotten so far and we would have to then show how space-time and what we call physical objects arise as some kind of projection of the dynamics of conscious agents so we would have to get back all of quantum field theory we have to get back evolution by natural selection or or our theory of consciousness is wrong so that's sort of the the two-step picture and it's good that you start with that because a lot of people here's one objection that i've gotten from a friend of mine and a very very brilliant philosopher philip goffy he says look on the one hand you're saying that evolution says that we don't see reality as it is on the other hand you're saying that when i look at someone's face i can get genuine insights into their conscious experiences that seems to be a self-contradiction and and you can see now why it's not evolution tells us we're not seeing reality as it is then i say okay next step okay what is reality well if it's consciousness then the interface would be an interface to consciousness so it wouldn't be a surprise that we would have some true insights into consciousness if that's what the interfaces do so that's that's that's why it doesn't self-contradict the first is a theory about theorem from evolution the next is a leap beyond evolution but but the constraint is this leap better project back down to space time and give me evolutionary theory as a special case that resolves that kind of apparent contradiction okay so i think that i think that my my biggest question then comes in relation to what you you've just explained that is if if our perceptions if our capacity to proceed doesn't give us access to reality per se or objective reality fundamental reality per se and that in order to fix that or in order to find a solution to that problem you're looking at consciousness as the originator of phenomena as the the basis of a phenomena why do you continue to to posit this reality why do you continue to say it doesn't give us access to reality i don't know if you understand it i find that that it creates in me at least a lot of confusion which is that other people that i that i'm interested in very much who seem to see the fundamental consciousness of the fundamental let's say axiom will take on something like a modified phenomenological approach which is that they will take phenomenology as a basic framework which is that being presents itself to me being presents itself to me to my consciousness and i engage with it with something we could call conscious agency that is care you know the thing about heidegger in particular like something like care something like desire something like purpose all of these these categories will then generate the world and so you know the idea for example that objects don't have identities apart from the their purposes in consciousness something like that and so what i find difficult is that when you when you continue to say that a consciousness doesn't give us and you could say something what i hear from you often is that consciousness doesn't give us access to reality and then you you turn around through our perceptions and then you turn around and you say consciousness might be the fundamental axiom of of of phenomena i don't know if you understand the the quandary that i have in the formulation i think so it gets back to the first thing that we were discussing and and that is i should say right up front i don't know whether our senses show us reality or not i don't know all i know is that evolutionary theory tells me that they don't right and also physics tells us that space time isn't fundamental which is the sort of the foundation of our current perceptions so all so those theories may be false but they're the best that we have so far so as a result of those theories i'm saying that those theories tell us we don't see reality as it is now i take another step when i say okay well i'm not going to say that there is no such thing as reality and i like the kind of thing that you're talking about the phenomenologists and heidegger and so forth that's perfectly fine with me and there's nothing in what i'm saying about consciousness that would contradict them what what i'm doing that's different from the phenomenologists and heidegger and so forth is i'm saying if if we want to say that consciousness and and and psychological and in in conscious experiences and so forth are fundamental as a scientist i know that that has been said for thousands of years by various religious and spiritual traditions so in some sense there's nothing new what's new from the science point of view is we're going to take that mathematically seriously we're saying that consciousness is fundamental if that's the case then we owe a precise mathematical theory of what we mean by that because in some sense we would like to have a falsifiable and testable theory and we'd also like to avoid dogmatism we would like to just not spin our wheels in the same circles for thousands of years we would like to actually find out where we're wrong as quickly as possible so that's why i go for this mathematical model of consciousness so i don't think that it's at all contradictory to phenomenology or or many philosophical points of view in some sense it's saying let's take those points of view seriously enough that we're going to actually turn them into mathematical precise theories that we can test and find out their strengths and their failures so i just say that so far it sounds like we're on the same page all right and so i think that that that was in a way that was my my biggest question because so i've heard you formulate things for example so i this is these are the types of questions that i that come up when i listen to you and so sorry i'm not focusing on the more exciting parts of what of what you're saying because those i get and i'm excited about and it's more the questions that i have and so the so i've heard you say something like you know when you look at you like you say you look at a car and then the car exists and when you turn around the car ceases to exist and so this these types of these types of of let's say formulations really boggle my mind that is because one aspect let's say one projection of consciousness is something like memory and and when i when i say memory i mean it also almost in the platonic sense that is i don't want to argue let's say for the for the theory of the form but there's a manner in which we we commonly remember identities and we we all we in consciousness that they across each other we participate in identities so for example the identity of a car is exists across my consciousness and my relationship to other consciousnesses because i have right i learned what a car is from my parents i learned from a car is from and so the idea that the car ceases to exist when i don't look at it to me is is a very it seems like a very very bold statement and so maybe you can you can expand a little bit on on that and and and or let's say in what matter does the car continue to exist when i don't look at it because at least it exists in my memory you know at least it exists in let's say my my my knowledge that other people also know that the car continues to exist right so so i'm not denying that there's some aspect of reality that continues to exist whether or not i perceive it there is some reality it's just that what i perceive in my senses is not that it's just a it's just an interface to that reality and what my interface is doing is very much like if you're if you have a virtual reality headset on and you're playing a game like grand theft auto and virtual reality mode and you you i turn my headset to the right and i see a red camaro well in that context in that metaphor that i'm using the reality i'm interacting with is a supercomputer with lots of voltages and magnetic fields in it and so forth and when i'm actually turning my steering wheel and turning my head and looking around i'm really toggling tons of millions of voltages rapidly in some supercomputer but what i see is a red camaro now there is no red camaro in that supercomputer so that red camaro only exists when i turn my headset and create it and then when i turn my headset that way that that red camaro existed nowhere else except in my perceptions so it and since it's no longer my perceptions it doesn't exist it might exist of course in my memory as you point out but as a as a current sensory experience it will no longer exists and i'm saying that that's just what what's obviously true in virtual reality is in fact what's also true in everyday life we're wearing a headset from an evolutionary point of view our senses evolved to be a headset not a window on the truth and just like any headset you render what you're looking at as you need it and then you garbage collect it when you don't need it anymore and you get rid of it and and that way you don't keep all this structure around the fact that we tend to agree like suppose i play a game of virtual reality tennis with you and i hold up a tennis ball and you say yeah i'm ready and i hit the tennis ball and you hit the tennis ball back it's it sounds as though there's a single existing tennis ball one in the same tennis ball that you perceive and i perceive but in fact there's not i in my headset i'm i'm looking and creating the tennis ball as i need to you're creating your tennis ball when you need to there's no green tennis ball inside the computer the supercomputer that's running this whole thing but it coordinates our perception such that we have the useful illusion of a single tennis ball so so that's sort of that that i hope that that helps to demystify the kinds of things i'm saying would be almost in inconceivable except that we have these wonderful new metaphors of virtual reality and user interfaces that we didn't have you know a few decades ago that sort of helped make it easier in fact my take is that that my generation has a hard time but the next generation that's raised on the metaverse will just sort of yawn and say so what of course so i think so i think this is again so let me bring up another let's say bring up another metaphor to try to to to crack this for myself um and so so i think to me the idea maybe it's the idea of existence that is that is that that we're that i'm struggling with that is and so there is you could say something like i tend to have i could i'm fine with the aristotelian notion of potential i think there's potential out there there's something like potential for existence and then it it encounters consciousness or encounters mind and in that encounter there is a adjoining of heaven and earth we could say you know to use religious terms and then there is phenomena appears as that but there's also a sense in which that is not idiosyncratic and i think you're not saying that it's idiosyncratic that it's somehow you know just me or just my my but that there is so so most religious theories will posit higher beings like they'll posit transpersonal consciousnesses and the patterns that we share in common will be held by these trans-personal consciousnesses and that is what that is what let's say affords their possibility across each other right so you can imagine things like angels or bodhisattvas or different versions of these where there is a way in which so when you say for example that the car ceases to exist when i turn around that is intuitively to me that it's something it's something like unacceptable or that or that the tennis ball that i am hitting and the tennis ball that you're hitting is not the same tennis ball there's a manner in which it becomes the same tennis ball in communion with you as i am in communion with you that's when it becomes the same tennis ball i don't know if that makes sense because i'm i'm trying to yeah sorry yeah very very very good point so so first i would agree that that i don't believe in solipsism so i don't think that i my perceptions are the only thing that exists and i don't rule out many many other forms of consciousness in fact countless other forms of consciousness that are beyond my imagination and and to say that they're perfectly real and also that consciousnesses can interact and that i could be very much right now unaware of all the kinds of interactions that are that are going on there and in fact all of these things are actually forced on me by the mathematical model that i'm working on right now it it actually forces me to posit a whole hierarchy of of interacting conscious agents or heterarchy might be a better word and you know what is the difference between because that because this is really interesting so what is the difference for you between the hierarchy and the hierarchy well so in a hierarchy there's a strict upper and lower right so this is above that this is above that in a heteroarchy there could be some hierarchy but there could also be things that are just sort of sideways from each other and and not above or below that [music] so that so a heteroarch is i would say just a little bit more general than than restrict hierarchy in the way that i was i was using it but the i so far again i think we're on the same page i'm simply trying to take these ideas and make them precise right i want to actually show precisely how conscious what what my technical term is called a conscious agent that's the mathematics of conscious agents so for me conscious agent is not an informal term it's a mathematically precise thing in terms of measurable spaces and markovian kernels and so forth and it when i look at the mathematics it it suggests an interpretation along the lines that you were talking about like potential a potential like aristotelian potential and somehow that potential becomes actual in an actual experience that one has and then one can have a mathematical theory about okay how do conscious agents communicate and share experiences can can conscious agents actually combine into new unified consciousnesses and the answer is yes and the mathematics shows how to do it i just presented a talk a couple weeks ago to a workshop on mind and agency with a lot of quantum theorists and and philosophers and so forth where the mathematics provides a brand new and compelling approach toward actually taking separate consciousnesses conscious agents and showing how they literally fuse the mathematics for forces you to conclude that in this case the two consciousnesses literally fuse and experiences fuse to create new brand new novel experiences from the interactions so so right now i'm on the same page with you my only thing is let's make this precise all right and so this is something that really interests me as well is that you seem to be one of the the the model that i'm experiencing with is the notion of fractal consciousness or fractal agency that is the the idea that even me like let's say as a person i am i'm made up of a of a series of capacities for attention or a series of of conscious agents that join together into what i call jonathan but that i that this could scale up where i participate in a family i participate in a city i participate in other things that aren't so let's say it's easy to say family and city because they're bound in space but there are other types of agencies that i could participate in which would be transpersonal but that this also scales down within the person but it doesn't imply a kind of pan psychist idea either like it doesn't it's not the idea of that that let's say consciousness is just a you know a quality of of matter and that they join together but there really is a also a bottom-up and top-down re relationship between these fractal agencies so i don't know if your model has has thought about those types of things oh it's it's baked into the model so so fractals are are self-similar structures they they as you look at different scales you see the same structure repeated and nested and the the mathematical framework that i'm using of conscious agents is is precisely self-similar at all scales it's this is the same structure when agents combine they form new agents at a higher quote-unquote scale but it's the same structure so you have the self-similarity going up all the way and you know one interesting technical question that i'm working with my my colleagues right now is that as we take a you know suppose i have what's called a countable set of of these conscious agents so you can pair them with the integers so there's an infinite number of them and each has its own say conscious experiences well it's a theorem of of our theory that when it when any number of them any subset of them interact they form a new agent so that means that you have what's called the power set which is the set of all subsets of these conscious agents you have a new collection of conscious agents which is has the dimension or the the the actually the cardinality is the technical term the number of them is the power set of the the first it's a bigger infinity and once you then you then if you take the power set of them you get a new set of combined agents so this is your fractal idea with mathematical precision now what we're doing is climbing up what's called cantor's hierarchy of infinities there's not one infinity there's an infinite number of infinities and each infinity that's up higher is infinitely bigger than the one below it and so what i see here in our theory is our theory of combination will get us to ever bigger and bigger infinities but there's no limit and so i can't start with a theory of the one big consciousness because i can never get there what i can do is have a theory of conscious agents that sort of is forever approaching the the highest level but but at every point my theory will say you're not there because oh you're now at level 50 of cantor's hierarchy now you're level 100 but there's an infinite number of levels so what's interesting about this scientific theory is that there will be no room for hubris or dogma because the theory itself will be telling you there's infinitely more steps to go and you're only at step one one billion but there's an infinite number so this is really a very very when you do this you get the fractal notion that you were talking about but you get the mathematics coming back and saying exactly how the fractal works and also telling you be very very humble because your mathematical theory will never get to the the final description there's no scientific theory of everything even a theory of consciousness yeah and it see that seems to really fit with the idea that most mystical systems are apophatic that is if you if you read many of the the more famous mystics or if you look at different non-dual systems they tend to always have this that's an infinite regress there is no positive statement of the infinite it's always a a constant denial of that which was or a constant shedding of that which was below but there is no reaching the point even saint gregory vanessa talks about let's say the ascent into god as being infinite that infinite in the sense that there is no end to it it's not a it's not a stasis you don't become an angel sitting on a cloud you know with wings and a harp there's this kind of infinite movement up up the hierarchy of beings and so it seems to show this this this this hierarchy as being as being infinite similar to what you seem to be described absolutely and so once again i think that there's there's no contradiction between what i'm saying in these these other spiritual ideas the the idea is to simply take them seriously enough to make them precise and and you know it's an open question whether the mathematics that we've got right now will even allow us to posit that there is a final unity i i i doubt it myself i think that the description you gave that is the so open-ended and and you can never get to the top is is probably right but but for me i actually put this out to my colleagues and my mathematical colleagues that we want i want us to look at this mathematically and see what kind of progress we can make on on asking is there one any way to think about a final unity of all these conscious agents into one big conscious agents in the limit as we go to the top of the cantor hierarchy and right now i don't see it but that that's that means nothing i'm not a mathematician so we'll we'll see but but we do have big hints like from girdles in completeness theorem that that no scientific no finite accidentization of mathematics that's rich enough to do arithmetic can ever have all truths girdle says give me a rich enough system of axioms i'll show you a statement that's true but can't be proven it's true given your system but it's not provable from your actions your theory cannot get it and if you add my new true statement to your axioms i'll show you another statement that's true but you can't derive it and so what's telling me is that scientific theories in principle will only scratch the surface of the truth yeah and you might ask well why are you doing it then and and part answer is i don't know but the other part of the answer is it seems like consciousness needs to spend time in various specific form domains like space and time right now and here here we are in this virtual reality with this you know 93 billion light years across and trillions of stars and galaxies and so forth and and we get lost in it consciousness gets lost in it and then wakes up and finds out no no i'm not a little you know 160 pound entity in this vast universe this universe is nothing but a headset that i'm wearing and i can take it off so so somehow consciousness seems to to need to project itself into various forms various formal systems if you will and explore them get lost in them as a way of knowing itself you know if consciousness is really about knowing itself it does it by losing itself in a particular like space-time system that we're in and then waking up and saying is as beautiful and rich as that is i'm not that i'm beyond that and that's how it comes to know itself by knowing what it's not so that that's one reason perhaps why these kind of scientific theories are important that's sort of part of the whole process of consciousness waking up to itself by knowing precisely what it's not i'm not just that i'm more than that but you can't know that you're not just that until you can stay precisely what it is that you're not just and then you can transcend it and so one of the one of them let's say in many spiritual practices not all not all the spiritual traditions but in many spiritual traditions there is a sense in which there's a double movement you could say so there's a movement an apophatic movement which is similar to what you're saying which is that these perceptions that i have they are not ultimate reality they are they are somewhat if compared to ultimate reality they are something like an illusion there's something like like a dashboard the way that you talk about but then that even that illusion let's say has to originate from something it it it nonetheless is a projection of consciousness and therefore it also does offer us reality at the level at which we are that is it offers truth to the level in which we are perceiving but it also at the same time hides truth because i think when i listen to the way you present your system and when you talk about the headset and how it doesn't show reality i struggle because it it it feels like this there's an arbitrary layer and where does that arbitrary layer come from if everything is a projection of consciousness i know if you understand my question well that that's a great a great point and again i agree the headset is just a metaphor that i've helped people to wrap their heads around the idea that you might not see the truth and that might not be bad but but the notion of projection is the one that i'm really working with so i have a mathematical model of consciousness and for example that model may not be have any notion of time in it in the notion of increasing entropy so we in our mathematical model of consciousness it it can be a timeless dynamics of consciousness in the sense of there's no increasing entropy but you can prove it's trivial to prove it's a three-line proof that any projection of that timeless dynamics will by the act of projection lead to the appearance of an evolution in time so you get time evolution as an artifact as as something that's in introduced it's not real about consciousness itself it's only an artifact of looking at consciousness through a particular viewpoint then you get the notion of entropic time and and therefore probably more general limits as well i mean the consciousness itself may have might be cooperative no limited resources no competition but when you take a projection of it now it looks like limited resources competition and you know competition in time so so so in that sense it's it's it's you could say that this is all the truth but it's truth of a projection and it's not it's not a deep truth of the thing that's being projected from right and and in fact there are artifacts of the projection that aren't deeply true about the thing that you are looking at so it may be that there is no entropic time and consciousness you know viewed broadly but from any perspective of consciousness you get the notion of anatomic time so that's so you can see how i hope what you see from from this is that i don't think that i'm contradicting the basic ideas of these spiritual traditions i'm trying to take them very very seriously and make them completely rigorous i'm hoping eventually to have a synergy between science and spirituality where both sides are going to be shocked there are sides things that both are going to thought think that they knew were true and we'll find out as we go along that well those were best poor approximations to some better understanding but i think the two will be a synergy that you know with the proper humility and the proper openness to you know proceeding wherever the our theories our precise theories may lead us and of course not taking our theories as the final word but but as the best we have so far we will be led to deeper and deeper understandings of the spiritual realm that maybe many of the spiritual teachers in the past knew sort of by intuition but most of us aren't theirs but with the tools of science many more of us can begin to start to grasp these ideas and get help with them so i think that again maybe i'm i'm i hope i'm not pressing the point too much but if let's say if time and space or a projection of consciousness you know then how can i say this would they not necessarily be a true aspect of consciousness in in projection that is true that they are that they are true manifestations of consciousness within the frame that that we are perceiving the frame that we are existing and i say that it's in for me it's impo there's you could say there are two big spiritual traditions in regard to this right there is a kind of idea of maya excessive idea of maya where everything is illusion nothing this is real you know and then there's something which would be more like an incarnational vision which we definitely find more in christianity which is that not all this is unreal in comparison to god but to the extent that it is real then it is real it can be something like transfigure that it can put that it can that it can lead us towards mysteries let's say if we if we engage with what we what we see properly but the so what i with the the let's say the headset thing and the way that especially when you use the image of from the headset to the ones and zeros in the computer it's a it really is pure disjunction between let's say the fundamental the more fundamental aspect and then the the projection of that in in our perception right so i agree that is fair enough to say that that the projection has a reality of its own and so for example we talk about sunrise and sunset and it's perfectly fine and it's true you know that the sunrise was at such and such you know 5 55 a.m this morning or something like that but from a higher perspective you know if you take a rock and get off planet earth then the very notion of sunrise and sunset is is sort of irrelevant the sun the sun just shines so so it's you know it's true of a particular perspective that the sun rises at 5 55 a.m in irvine california and of course that wouldn't be true even in seattle it's a different time in seattle and so forth so so yeah you can talk about truths of perspective the and i think that there's not in the way that i'm thinking about our perceptions in reality as you can see when i say that consciousness is fundamental and and that conscious experiences are our fundamental part of that that our conscious experiences of space and time and so forth are experiences so they are part of this deeper reality of of consciousness so so when i'm talking about the headset i'm really trying to bring home what evolutionary theory is telling us evolutionary theory is telling us that our perceptions are are not isomorphic or homomorphic to reality so with one exception something called measurable structures but other than that there's no homomorphism from from the point of view of evolutionary game theory so so to bring home the the meaning of that theorem from that scientific theory i use the headset and try to make the point that is utterly alien but then when i go to this deeper level of consciousness there is a rapprochement now i say okay i mean i now want to transcend evolutionary theory the reason i take the headset seriously is that's our best scientific theory in this realm so let's understand what it says it says that this is just a user interface and you got to live with that now with this deeper theory there is something of rapprochement because i'm saying there is conscious agents with their experiences that's part of the objective reality now even there you might say that what's really interesting is the potential for conscious experiences not the particular conscious experiences that you have and one could could debate that i mean but but the way i view it right now is the the mathematics lays out there there is this potential and then when we actually run the mathematics we see the actual you know play of conscious experiences that that potential gives rise to so i don't see the two as terribly divorced but the one the potential is is stunning i mean that that and and there i should say this as as much as i'm you know praising science i want to make very very clear that i think that there will always be a fundamental mystery forever that our science there is no scientific theory of everything and for what it's worth my own take is that we can't ultimately know the truth through scientific theory we can get rid of our misunderstandings of the truth through scientific theory that is really really helpful but in some sense we can only know the truth by being it we can know it if we're not divorced from consciousness and consciousness is fundamental then we can know it in silence with when we let go of concepts but we can also know something about it from our conceptual analysis we can know that the consciousness is no less rich than the concepts that we've had so far and we can know that certain of our concepts are just flat out wrong or they're not rich enough so they're helpful in that way so so no this is really helpful for me because it's really helping me understand you know i think it's helping me more understand why you say the things you say the way you say them and and how and how in a way i'm realizing more and more that what you're trying to do is to say well here's evolutionary theory this was presents you know and this is the limit because it actually creates a disjunct in the the person listening because it it there's something to us which is appalling or repulsive about the idea that we don't have access to reality and so then you bridge into saying well here's a way in which i can talk about reality which will afford us some connection to reality but is with his centered unconsciousness and not centered on the idea of of cold objective let's say perception of of facts let's say something like that yeah that's a that's a very good summary and then the other thing about this approach then is to say that to really close the loop when we propose this deeper theory we have to show precisely how it projects down into a space time that leads to evolutionary theory where that theory says i can't see the truth so that we that way we close the loop that's why we that's how we see how evolutionary theory says you can't see the truth but from a deeper point of view you can see the truth and you can explain why the the more narrower theory tells you you can't see the truth see that's that's and that's how science progresses we we take our theories to their limits they tell us where they stop and then we take a creative leap beyond but whatever the new leap is we don't throw away what we've already done we keep we treasure those scientific theories they're they're wonderful gems but we have to show how they fit into the as you're saying the fractal or the self-similar pattern at a deeper level all right so i want to come back to something we're talking about before and and so scientists love the the idea the bottom-up part let's say you know the idea for example as you formulated it that consciousness can join together and then they then appear as a higher form of consciousness but have you studied or thought about the manner in which higher consciousness constrained lower consciousness within a fractal hierarchy which is that do you see causative relationship moving down from higher beings into into their constituents or do you just see it as a joining and then and then see it going up let's say well in one word yes but i'll unpack it a little bit physicists themselves recognize that the standard reductionist approach is doomed so reductionism strictly speaking is the claim that as you go to smaller and smaller scales in space-time you get to more and more fundamental entities and more and more fundamental laws and that has been the idea that space-time is fundamental and that physicist reductionism going to smaller scales gives you more fundamental laws and entities has been a very very useful framework for centuries in in science but the glory of scientific theories is to tell you their limits and space time has revealed that it doesn't go very deep it only goes to 10 to the minus 33 centimeters and then it fails not 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters only 10 to the minus 33 so i'm not terribly impressed so so that so so reductionism has a finite lifetime it can only go so far and in fact the physicists now are looking at these what they call uvir interactions so the ultraviolet is as you go into smaller and smaller scales but ir is going is going to the bigger and bigger scales and and before we used to think that as you go the uv direction to smaller and smaller scales that's where you get more and more fundamental laws but no it turns out that it wraps around and as you were talking about the global tends to affect the small as well as the small affecting the global within this is just within the physicalist framework of space time and and and this this is state of the art issue in physics right now the physicists are trying to wrap their heads around this they're trying to understand how this uv ir interaction is happening but brilliant physicists are making real progress on this let me be very interested now that's doing it within space time i'm i'm trying to work on this kind of thing outside of spacetime where the notion of spatial scale no longer holds there is a different notion of self-similarity in terms of for example the number of conscious experiences that an agent can have so you can you can talk about combinations being higher in terms of this this this conscious agent has all the experience of these agents and more and and there i also see what you could call uvir interactions where yes bottom-up interactions of agents in their asymptotics leads to higher level agents but those at those agents and their asymptotic interactions also affect the low-level dynamics of the agents below and that's a very very rich mathematical area that that is going to i predict occupiers for centuries on exploring all those possible possibilities of bottom-up and top-down interactions there is the riches and you know i just see the the riches and the distance and i would love to explore them but you know it's my guess is that it's going to be an infinite exploration definitely ah and so because the we experience it in ourselves right that is the reason why i say that is that we we experience it in ourselves in the sense that we notice at least i do like i'll notice things that have agency in me that i'm trying to constrain you know that that seem to to have some kind of agency and then i'm trying to to let's say bring them in line with my higher agency or my my higher consciousness and i can and if i apply that fractally up from me then i notice the same in something like a city where a city is is of course made up of all the people that constitute it but it has laws it has it has ways of constraining those members in order for them to participate appropriately in their higher in their higher being let's say and so you know i tend to use very practical examples but i don't know if the practical examples map on to your theoretical examples yes so there's both the emergent properties as you so that's a word of a bottom-up kind of thing so you can get emergent properties the city is not just the people and the cars and so forth there is something more but that you could think of that as a bottom-up kind of kind of thing but then the city itself constrains what people do and and it affects you know the fact that i'm in irvine as opposed to manhattan changes my lifestyle considerably and how i would live so there's going to be these bottom-up and top-down things and as you alluded to in our personal lives right we we notice that we're not just one self-consistent consciousness ourselves that we we you know you may be aware of the split brain work the literature so if you you have two hemispheres a left and right hemisphere and if you if they're joined by a band of fibers called the corpus closum 225 million axons roughly and you cut that cut those actually a friend of mine joe bogan was one of the surgeons who who did those colostotomies cut the corpus callosum and another friend of mine yes ramakantan we call him rama rama one of the patients that he studied the left hemisphere i believe believed in god in the right hemisphere was an atheist the left hemisphere might want to have a desk job in the right hemisphere what wants to be a race car driver and they can even fight the right hemisphere controls the left hand the left hemisphere controls the right hand and they can fight you know the left hand might be trying to make an omelette and the right hand doesn't want an omelette and it and it throws a full egg into you know with eggshell and the whole bit into the omelet to ruin it so so we it the kind of thing you alluded to we have concrete evidence of multiple agencies within what we call me and that's what this theory of conscious agents that i'm working on with my team is really one of the things we're interested in is how okay how do these agencies interact and form new agencies and yet preserve in some sense the original agencies and and what happens when you cut the corpus callosum what does that do does it is there a real disunification how how does that work that we could just unify previously unified agencies and and also in spiritual traditions when they talk about you know the false self versus the deeper true self and and when you spend time in meditation and in just everyday life and are aware of the the false self and its need for trying to be special and more important than other people and and its tendency to complain about everything and and to worry and so forth and to think about the past and future and never be in the present moment versus another part of you that that says you know relax be here now and and you and you see both going on in yourself at the same time once again you get this notion of multiple agency and almost the sense that the fall itself is some kind of it feels like some kind of autonomous thing that that is going on of its own accord and and that you know it in some sense by paying attention to it and not giving into it but just in some sense embracing it it eventually dies but it but it's it it's a painful death for it so so that that whole and christianity when jesus said you know if you want to follow me take up your cross daily you know deny yourself take up your cross daily and follow me well that that that denying yourself is really what i was talking about this this false self that's complaining and and worrying and and wants to be special and more special than everybody else and be important you know when people put you down and you want to snap back and repair that false self right and and get back you know someone honks at you when you're driving and you and you want to honk back when you don't and you feel that part of you that that's angry and you let it die that's what jesus is talking about is daily letting that false self die so it is very much like a another conscious entity that that has some autonomy that actually has to be killed so i would love right now i don't have a mathematical grip on that but i would but but see you can see where i want to go with it i would like to take these ideas that are informal intuitive and and give them scientifically you know deep attention and try to to model what what's happening in the left and right hemisphere what's happening what we what we call the the false cell how do conscious how are their autonomous consciousnesses how do they interact how can they be united and separated because one of the things we've been talking about in this like circle let's say a conversation that i'm part of is the idea of parasitic agency that is that we we can notice that there are some there are some consciousnesses or some agents agents that seem to exist you could say something like exist in service of their higher participation and there are some agents which seem to close off and become parasitic a good a good image is to say that they become prideful right they become prideful they want to self contain and in self-containing that is when they become something akin to what you call the false self is that they they're becoming capable of noticing their higher participations or even their lateral contact you know because you know in in this theory of consciousness i imagine there's also a sense in which we share in consciousness that is there is one ultimately one or there is consciousness is shared among amongst agents and it isn't something that closes itself off and becomes a a completely hermetic system let's say right in fact i think that there is one sense in which i could say that that you and i are the same consciousness right that there is in some sense a unification there on the other hand this false self that we were talking about seems to be where when consciousness has put on a headset and it doesn't recognize that it's a headset it thinks it's the truth and it's when it and so when consciousness it lets itself get lost it loses its own identity and it thinks that it's some little thing so i'm a little 160 pound six foot thing in this vast billions of light years across space time so on this tiny insignificant thing and i really believe that i so identify with that that that form that that that experience of of the body as being just this tiny insignificant thing then then of course it makes sense that i'm going to be spending my time trying to figure out how to get myself sick how can i be how can i be significant you know what can i do i have to compete with everybody i have to be smarter or more famous or whatever it might be or have a better car richer but whatever i have to do something because i because i'm believing a lie and and so in some sense that false self is part of is is is part of the one big consciousness but it's the one big consciousness that's letting itself identify with an illusion and and that but and so it seems wrong at one level and it seems perhaps evil at one level but at a at a deeper level it may be part of the necessary process by which consciousness really wakes up and knows itself by letting myself get completely lost and doing evil things competing and and and all that stuff and then waking up eventually i realized that i transcend that and i you know i take my headset off and the others take their headset off we find out we're the same we shake our hands and move on yeah well i mean i think the idea let's say the idea of repentance if you if you apply it within yourself i always try to move across the levels in order to kind of understand the analogy so within you you will have you will notice those things so it's like let's say hunger is a good one it's like so hunger is an aspect of agency which is is good if it participates in its in other with and let's say collaborates with other aspects of agency within myself but if i but if it takes over and becomes parasitic and sees itself believes its illusion right believe that it's all it exists then i can become then i can like say my higher self can actually become a slave of that lower of that lower agency and then i start to serve it you could say and so i live for eating and i you know eating becomes that which drives all my my motivations and so you can see how this this false this smaller false self that they within me right is an image of how at even at a higher level i can engage in in these let's say false cells that that will capture my my attention completely and cut me off from my higher participation in consciousness right and we can ask why does consciousness do that to itself why does it allow itself to get lost that way and and i don't know and i think that that's a deep question that that that we'll want to pursue both on just a spiritual level but also on this mathematical scientific level and i suspect that we'll be talking about it for a long long time but one idea that that i would throw out as part of that long conversation is you do notice in some people that you when they have a limitation and they face it and rise above it they they become better in some sense so you know people who are in the paralympics they might be they might be missing a limb or they might be paralyzed or something like that and and you watch it the ones that or like a stephen hawking right he you know motor neuron disease he's completely paralyzed and he faces it and transcends it and we look at and go holy smoke look at the potential of the human spirit you could be completely confined to wheelchair unable to move and you can become the greatest the most famous physic physicist in the world at that time and and so that may be one i'm not saying it's the final word but just one aspect of what what consciousness is doing by putting itself in these various situations now here i am a selfish murderer and and and then you learn about you you learn about your potential and and so forth by putting all these these yourself in these confines and then eventually you the murderer on death row waking up and realizing and and realizing who they are before you know for example before they're executed well consciousness woke up and it it so there's a so again i'm not at all proposing that it's good to murder or anything like that but i'm saying that there's some deeper point of view that we're gonna i think ultimately have to understand about what consciousness is letting this this happen and it may be like the stephen hawking model maybe one aspect of it yeah but i think that i think that makes up it makes sense because what what can happen can i say this well it also there's a playing out that say when when a the 10 agency becomes self-serving then it'll play itself out right let's say the food part like if i just eat like it'll play itself out and i'll become sick i'll become overweight like all these things will happen and in the consequence of that as i see it unravel then that is the point like that's the moment when i am capable it's like you know it's a cliche but it's like hitting rock bottom right and and that is the moment where i you know to use the words of jonah right it's like i remember the lord i remember the way what is above all of a sudden there's a there's a possibility of of connection again because this parasitic process has ran its course and now it's devolved into like it's broken down because it didn't have what it what it needed to it was it was acting in a way that was reductive and was was was killing itself let's say ultimately yeah i agree it seems that consciousness does have this built-in mechanisms such that it lets itself be diluted but but gives itself feedback painful feedback like hitting rock bottom bottom to help itself wake up and and again the question is well why does consciousness bother to go why does it just stay awake and and there's there seems to be some important reason why consciousness lets itself go to sleep and it and and you know we've talked a little bit about it but i think that there's a lot of gold there that we haven't yet dug yeah and there's some mysterious statements like there's a there's an interesting statement by us i think it's saint gregory of nazianzis who says that there are the angels of the right hand of god and the angels of the left hand of god that the angels of the left hand of god are the demons and that they think that they're acting completely out of their own will and that they are completely self-sufficient and even thinking that they're acting against the higher will but ultimately they're not it's almost like a trick on them where ultimately it's a surprise and they'll end up participating in the giant pattern despite themselves right and then they wake up and realize that that the evil that they thought they were wasn't what they were at all that was just an illusion that they were under yeah i think that that's definitely at least it seems it seems to be but it's difficult to pierce that of course because you know it it's difficult to pierce it like you said without saying something like the murderer is doing good the murder isn't doing good the murderer is is acting against consciousness in a way but how can that be if that's the source of all things there's like a deep there's a deep paradox in that problem one way out of the paradox may be that it's it's mathematically impossible to take a projection of the one consciousness without necessarily inducing these things as artifacts that would be wonderful if we could actually prove if we if a mathematically precise theory of conscious agents could prove that even if the one the is in some sense without any competition all loving and and so forth any finite or or projection of it that doesn't include the whole will necessarily lead to what we call evil that would be that would be a very interesting theorem that would that would resolve the question that we're raising here we would show that that what we call evil is a necessary consequence of not looking at the whole as the whole as soon as you look at it just from any particular perspective evil is necessary and maybe the waking up process is emerging from a perspective back to the poll well definitely that's something that at least from a christian point of view that is definitely a difficult proposition because you would you would say something i think the way that i would formulate it as a as a christian would be something like that multiplicity you know is in multiplicity is the is the possibility of evil because of its disconnection from the one but that the multiplicity can also be filled with the one ultimately that it can be filled with the with love and that if we see it's not that we abandon the multiplicity for the one but that if we see the manner and this is why the headset thing is sometimes is an issue for me because if if we see how the multiple is connected to the one memory is the image that we see for example in in i think for sure in the christian tradition but in other traditions as well the idea that in distance from something remembering it connects you to that and so it's not that you and all the distance is that you remember and so you can think of it in terms of time but not necessarily you can think of it in terms of just ontological hierarchies where you know i'm a soldier in an army and we're a bunch of guys and we're goofing off and then suddenly we remember that we're soldiers and we are we are in this order let's say of principalities and that is how i even though i'm not the general right i'm not the president i'm a soldier but by remembering then i'm able to reconnect and kind of reconnect these levels together in a proper way so it means that multiplicity would not would necessarily have the possibility of evil but not would not net would not necessarily have to produce evil if it remembers i don't know if that that might be using language that you're not used to so i'm sorry if i'm kind of pushing you a little far in the way the language i'm using i think those are really fascinating ideas and and you can see why as a scientist i would like to take them and make them mathematically precise so that we can actually start to prove theorems about this this kind of thing because the these are the kinds of deep questions that that that actually deserve that kind of respect that deserve to be taken seriously enough that we we start giving mathematically precise answers to them but but you know in the bible jesus talks about a deep unity between all of us when when when he he says you know for example when he talks about heaven and most of us typically think of heaven as some glorious place that we're going to go to after we die and and so forth but but but jesus was very very clear about he said the kingdom of heaven is within you now the kingdom of heaven is within you and if we really this is actually the kingdom this is the kingdom part that i'm talking about kingdom is memory because kingdom is the effect of a principality on its possibilities right so it's like the reign the kingdom is the capacity of the king to reign over a set of people and so the idea of king heaven and the kingdom of heaven are not the same kingdom of heaven is something like memory of heaven that is it is our capacity as multiple beings to all look towards the king and follow the king and therefore exist as a body like the idea of the body of christ let's say and so that's what i mean by memory is that so when christ is the kingdom of heaven he's not saying although other statements that he makes seems to actually imply deification but in that particular statement he's saying we we are able to be a body of heaven the body of heaven like the kingdom of the kingdom of heaven the body of christ all these images that are used in scripture to to talk about this memory between levels and so the reason why i'm sorry i'm insisting on this so much is just because it's again the the the difficulty of formulating a relationship to consciousness as false or as at you know that multiplicity is an illusion all these types of things because there is and there is also a there i think there is a little bit of a danger sometimes in that because gnostics that's what they that's what they that's the way they presented the world right like all this is an illusion in a certain manner all of this is evil right so we have to escape this we have to escape this in order to enter the one and often that created very strange behaviors in people whereas the idea of memory for example or the idea of connection between the levels is admitting for the possibility of breakdown and evil and illusion and all that seems to to fix the problem of just positing our experience as illusion let's say right so you know my understanding of the spirit spiritual traditions on this is that we don't want to fight what is we don't want to fight this moment we the the the bible's very very clear to give thanks always for all things right that's pretty clear so that means that i i'm hungry i should be grateful i have a broken leg i should it makes no exceptions it says give thanks always for all things so so any anybody who says that we should be you know angry and fighting this and and so forth you know if i see disease i should and i'm a doctor i should go and help treat disease and so forth like and if it's a scientist i should go find ways to but but in in the process i should be grateful for the situation that i have right now there is this disease and it gives me the possibility to find ways to ameliorate disease and so forth so so there's this it's it's a subtle thing but it's on one hand not resisting what not fighting what what is on the other hand then choosing to take actions out of out of love and so forth but but the the issue of you know jesus tried to use i think metaphors to point to things that are that are difficult like the the kingdom of heaven i think might be translated the realm of heaven and heaven just meant like spaciousness i think that he was pointing more to what you might just call a sense of spaciousness or being that we all share and and you know i think that he suggested that all of us have this in in when he was confronted by some religious leaders at the time who wanted to kill him they were getting stones to throw at him to kill him because he said i'm the son of god and he said well look you know in the psalms it says i have said you are gods yeah and if they call them gods to whom the word of god came why are you trying to kill me because i said i'm just the son of god jesus is making very very clear that that he's not better from than the rest of us we're all and equally sons of god and gods and and so when when he says the kingdom of heaven is within you i think he couldn't be more clear that saying we're all essentially you we're children of god but a children of a person a children of children of humans are humans children of god are god and and so i think the the message from from the bible to me is that we are one and you and i are god under a veil under a projection and we'll take the veil off and and greet ourselves and recognize that we are that one yeah but i think that i mean maybe there is there there would be of course a few little there would be point of differences let's say with official christian theology people watching will know let's say what i think about that but i don't i don't want to insist on it but there is so there is a difference like and you see it and i think you totally agree with me because you talk about this idea of self-sacrifice or you know there is a difference between the taking off of my veil let's say or the grabbing of the apple that we see in grabbing divinity for ourselves which is what we see as the fall and this rather canotic mode where i actually empty myself of my of my false self and in doing that that is when i let's say encounter divinity or that is when i am deified uh but that there is there is a difference let's say between those two movements and and i think it's for me at least it's important because there seems to be a a tendency a normal human tendency to want to grab that for themselves and say oh we are gods and so yeah that's mine like i am i am god let's say in that way right whereas i think what jesus and by the way i should say i'm not a theologian so that's okay as an amateur but but but my my take on is that that when jesus said you know if anyone wants to follow me let him deny himself take up his cross daily that is really letting go of identification with your form and your your space-time location and so forth all the stuff that you identify with and and then competing with everybody else and trying to be better than and so forth letting go of all when you let go of all those identifications and in some sense jesus was saying recognize that this is just a headset and you're wearing the headset you're not a little thing in the headset but but if you think that you're some little player inside the game inside the headset you have to let go of that illusion and recognize that that you're not that so so here i am in a virtual reality grand theft auto game right and i don't know that i'm just completely lost in the game so i get really angry when someone hurts my car and i want to to go and hurt their car and i then i want to grab all these i want to get this mansion and i want to but eventually i realized holy smoke that was just a virtual reality and i was all worked up over nothing and if i if i just understood that this is just a virtual reality headset that's the deep spiritual insight all of a sudden i would have equanimity you want to hurt my car hurt my car you want my money here's my money because this is just a game and that's that's what my my take is that in some sense you're not you're taking up your cross and denying yourself is recognizing you are not your avatar in the game recognize that that avatar is just an avatar that you have when you have the headset on don't identify with that avatar and as soon as you do that that's complete spiritual realization and so maybe i'll ask you last question what do you see as the the what do you hope the future will be in terms of especially maybe in terms of the discussion we've had in terms of the man in which your theories will connect both the scientific world and the more philosophical or spiritual traditions what do you see let's say in in the future in terms of of those types of discussions well i look forward to really productive discussions between science and spirituality you know the history it's been bad galileo imprisoned by the church house the rest and so forth the spiritual traditions christian and eastern mystical and you know sufism and so forth have for thousands of years said that space time isn't fundamental that there's a deeper realm science but but they haven't had any rigorous they haven't had mathematical models of it they so they've had they've had the the deep and i think in many cases correct well of course not completely correct but in many cases correct intuitions science on the other hand has stuck to space and time for the last few centuries and things inside space and time but they've sharpened these amazing tools of mathematical precision experiments and then the scientific method where you actually then take take your theories to task and find out where they're wrong and then transcend them the two have been separate strands strands now it's time for them to to meet because the science is now recognized that even though focused on space time for centuries space time is not fundamental space time is doomed but they have the tools it was good to study space time so well that we developed the mathematical tools and the experimental tools now as we step outside of space time we're stepping into i think the realm that the spiritual people in saying is there for all along but they haven't had the tools the scientists now have the tools and so the two can start to work together constructively and that's why i say it's going to be both exhilarating and difficult on both sides because we all have things that we deeply believe that will end up being shown to be deeply false or or not nearly as deeply true as we thought on both sides and so that but that's how we learn and grow we we wake up from our dogmatic slumbers so donald thank you so much for your time and for let's say accepting my my my freaky questions to try to kind of understand you're thinking i really appreciate it my pleasure and my apologies for my amateur theology i have no i have no sense of the sign so there's i think your your theology is better than my science so thank you so much thank you very much jonathan okay
