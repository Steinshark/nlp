hello everyone and welcome if you are a fan of the letter n then you're probably going to be an enthusiast of this i'm sorry i did that we are sitting inside of the hyundai ionic 5n and this is hyundai's launch into the world of performance ev so this is what they believe a performance ev should be and as a result it has a lot of really cool features and a lot of customization that you're able to do so in this video we're going to be looking at 10 features all of which start with the letter n and how they're allowing for so much customization in the world of electric cars now you can hear as i tap the paddle shifter yes and an electric car which only has a single gear reduction it downshift right and i can feel the torque as i upshift going back into my seat and so this is called ne shift and i know this is going to be the most controversial one and so that's what we're launching right into and the whole idea is kind of they wanted to think okay they are electric cars out there that are fast but the engagement is reduced how can we increase the engagement in an electric vehicle and this is one of those methods and when you're a kid you take a little card and you stick it in your bicycle wheel spokes and it makes that loud noise and it makes your bike experience more engaging and so this is like just kind of doing that it it's creating a way to be involved but you know not in a okay we threw it in there and and now it works and it makes these sounds and and that has gears it is extremely well thought out and it is meant to behave just like an 8-speed dual clutch transmission that it's replicating and so you actually do have a rev ler for example you'll have fuel cut off as you get to the top of that [music] gear you have torque so when you upshift you lose torque from the electric motor and then it slams you with torque really quickly so you feel that shift and it does actually feel like a real shift you have a rev limiter of 6,750 rpm unless you're in end mode in which you can increase that another th000 rpm so while the electric motor revs all the way to 21,000 rpm you are replicating an engine here that revs you know about 6800 rpm much like a hyundai n vehicle would rev to if it had a combustion engine and so you're adding in these features that people love about combustion cars with the sound so that is called called anactive sound feature number two and that is adding in the noises and it's completely dependent on you know what speed are you at where's your throttle position what gear are you in all of these things are changing and with each of those gear shifts you do have less torque so if i put it in sixth you can hear it lugging as i'm trying to crawl up a hill but it doesn't have the rpm to do it i'll go even lower and now we're in eighth trying to crawl up this hill and you can hear it blah blah blah blah blah burbling along trying to accelerate versus if i i go down into a lower gear it gives me access to more of that electric motor's torque so i can actually accelerate so it really is duplicating exactly how an engine would feel even in ways if it hinders you right like you shouldn't be in a high gear and trying to accelerate but it's saying well you chose that so that's what you get if you downshift at the wrong time in a corner you know it'll it'll kind of slide out the vehicle a little bit punishing you for doing it at the wrong time so it really just acts like an automatic transmission with a ton of thought a ton of programming so much effort has gone into it it's not just you know a card in the spokes so much effort has gone into it and so it is actually kind of fun to play around with i mean it's like if you're a kid and you like being you know silly playful fun but now you're an adult so you can't like that it has to be real right it's like they did so much effort into the program then it feels very real okay so let's take ne shift out onto the track and see how it feels [music] so now we are going to try out an e shift on the track and as you can hear if you let out on a downshift didn't do it there there's a little crackle from the exhaust there's a speaker up front and a speaker in the back there you go there's that exhaust crackle [music] i mean it's coming from behind you [music] so i wouldn't say it sounds completely like a combustion engine i mean there's an artificial nature to it but it is based off of hyundai n you know engine sounds real engines and so it's close and i think if you weren't like a dieh hard enthusiast you could be convinced that this had an engine now as far as feature number two that enactive sound plus there are three different modes you have the combustion engine which you can hear there if you know combustion engines it doesn't sound purely like a combustion engine if you didn't perhaps you could be convinced you can even have it in park and have it in neutral and just rev the engine you know rev the engine you're just making the sound so it is kind of interesting you've got that combustion mode they also have evolution mode where they are taking sounds directly from electric modor from an electric power trin and then amplifying them and creating this what you know they believe like the future of performance evs will sound like so it is taking real noises not from this car it's it's then put in through the speakers and then you you get this sound of you know the evolution of the car so then we have supersonic kind of sounds like maybe an airplane going by okay enough of that we're moving on to number three n battery preconditioning so this is a really useful thing if you're going to go out on a racetrack so there are both drag mode and track mode drag mode you're targeting a temperature of about 30 to 40degrees c for that battery it's going to use the hvac system of the vehicle cooling system of the vehicle and try and get the battery between 30 and 40degrees see that's ideal for maximum power deployment so you don't get it for a really long time but you get maximum power now still on end battery preconditioning we have track mode which this is trying to lower that temperature even further so that you can have longer sessions out there on the track so it's targeting about 20 to 30degrees cus and trying to ensure that when you go out there you can maximize your time on the track okay so from n battery preconditioning we go out onto the racetrack and now we're using number four and race mode and here once again we have two different choices we can choose between sprint and endurance so if we are in sprint we're going for maximum power this has an 84 kw battery pack about 3 to 5% of that reserved so not usable and then you also have 600 horsepower so at any point put your foot down in sprint mode you have access to that full 600 horsepower now maybe you only get you know a 20 minute lap session with that end sprint mode where you have maximum power and then you go charge and you come back and perhaps you do it again now with in and race mode if you switch over to endurance mode well you're now limited in power you don't have as much but the whole idea is you're not using as much energy you can spend more time out there and you won't have to worry about thermal drate on your battery because you're going to be keeping things at lower power levels but really the whole idea there is you're extending how much time you can spend out on the track okay let's get off the track and move on to number five and pedal which actually you could use on the track so one of the cool benefits of electric cars is that you can have one pedal driving so n pedal is taking that a further step because with one pedal driving if you're driving around passengers you don't want to let off the throttle and then suddenly it slams you with all of that braking torque from the motor's regen so you have a separate mode for when you're driving you know perhaps with some friends you just want to be comfortable as you let off the throttle pedal it eases into the braking the regenerator braking and it's not that high of a regen setting with nend pedal you know say you're spirited driving and you want to have some of that load transfer to the front of the wheels as you turn in or you're driving on a track and you want to have that load transfer occur to the front so that when you turn in it's very quick you don't want that long delay of when you let off the throttle and when you start to get regen you want it immediately so n pedal allows you to adjust how much of that regen you want so if you're just on the first setting one just point 2 g's second setting. 29 third setting 36 gs so a lot of regenerative braking just by letting off as you can see it's quite an aggressive slowdown then in addition to this they increase the amount of regen that the brake pedal is doing so with your brake pedal as you get onto that you can have up to 6 g's of regen which i believe is the highest of any electric vehicle out there so as you get really hard onto that brake pedal up to 6gs you are still using regen so it's not using a lot of the mechanical brakes and part of it is if you have more cooling and they do they have upgraded the cooling of this versus the ionic 5 they have a completely different cooling strategy up front more air flow different radiator strategy it's designed to handle more heat which of course if you have regen and more power like this does then you have to deal with that another thing they do is that even if you get into abs they are still using 2gs of regenerative braking to slow you down even at full max you know whatever it is 1.2 gs that you're slowing down at with full abs on they're still using that regen and then once you dip below out of that abs region then it goes again back up to as high as 6 g's with up to 320 kw of power that they're able to send into that battery pack using the regen the real cool benefit of nend pedal to me is just that you have that responsiveness it's a really responsive one-pedal driving map rather than the comfort mode where you know you're coming up to a stoplight you don't need to like crush on the brakes just so you can come up to the stoplight you want a smooth transition into the regen this is a much sharper response into it and each level one two and three increases the ramp that you get into that that high regen now number six is a really cool feature n torque distribution and so you can actually select this as a motor up front it has a motor in the rear and you can choose the bias that you want to have and how much torque you want going to the rear how much torque you want going to the front 100 z 0 100 you can do now if you get all the way on the throttle and you ask for maximum power it's going to actually use both motors to ensure that you can get maximum power but up to a certain point you have it so that it biases one side whether that's the front or the rear so if you're out on the track and you want a little bit more bias on the rear you can have that 7030 split and it sends more torque to the rear as a ratio versus the front so that you have that more lively characteristic feel aociated with you know a rear wheeel drive vehicle now of course if you're thinking about all of that torque going to the rear your mind might be going towards drifting which brings us to number seven n drift optimizer so this is basically the cheat code to help anyone be able to drift and they're using all the stability controls and trying to help you pick that slip angle and then stay at it and drift around and it even has something called an torque kick which is essentially like a clutch kick where when you hold both paddles then release the paddles what it does is it allows for some weight transfer to the front so you take off the weight the load on those rear wheels and then it immediately slams them with torque so that it kicks out the rear much like you would while clutch kicking so so they've really thought about you know how do we make this much like the manual car experience as far as initiating a drift they have built that into this end drift optimizer number eight is n grin boost and so i mentioned the car has 600 horsepower but there's this little button on the steering wheel ngb standing for n grin boost and if you push it you get in you smile that's what it makes you do it makes you smile you get an additional 40 horsepower and so you also seems to have a bit more ramp up in that acceleration so when you put your foot down in end grin boost mode it is very immediate the response of that throttle pedal and it is very fast 640 horsepower most of that coming from the rear motor but what a fun mode to drive in so end grin boost lasts for 10 seconds then you have to wait 10 seconds in order to get it back and we've got it back we can get back on it so just a way you know perhaps out on the track a little push to pass or have a little bit more power if you're coming out of a corner and you've got a long straight ahead of you press that n grin boost and get a little bit extra power number nine is n launch control yes so there's different levels of grip you can set the car for whether that is low medium or high and it will target higher level of slips as you have more grip in order order to give you the maximum possible launch as we just saw there yeah quite good acceleration from this thing 0 to 60 in the low threes and finally number 10 is n road sense and apparently i guess this camera is looking for one of those squiggly line signs that says hey the road up ahead is really curvy and it automatically puts it into end mode because it's like yo you're about to have some fun overall this is a really difficult vehicle to get a good summary of in a short amount of time like just driving this vehicle in one day is not enough time to fully understand it because there are so many features that are accessible to the driver and that's one of the things i absolutely love about it because people will have different styles of what they think is cool right if you don't think exhaust sound inside of an electric vehicle is cool you can turn it off if you do you can turn it on if you don't like regen you can have it so it coasts when you let off the throttle pedal if you want a lot of regen you can have it do that you have all these different levers that you can r buy on or pull away from disable enable and you have so much choice as a driver to what you want the vehicle to feel like and that is really wild and really cool because usually the manufacturer says we know this is the best setting that's the setting you get off you go or they throw in a little sport mode and not really much changes there is so much customization that is possible with this thing as far as the driving modes and you have different settings here so you can select and create your own and just easily switch between them really quickly so it's really cool how much they are trying to say you know what enthusiasts can get into this world of electric cars and have a good time and we're going to give you all the tools you need to make the vehicle exactly what you want it to be i appreciate that i need more time with this thing to fully understand it but overall i have really enjoyed it it's fun to drive it's fun to drive on these roads it's fun to drive on the track it does show the weight yes it's a very heavy vehicle it's a little over 4600 lb so on the track you know you feel that heft but they're putting in features to try and mask that weight like that end pedal driving where you have more of that load transfer to the front as you let off the throttle very quickly and help with turn in so there's different things that they're playing with the torque slider so you can have the rear kind of kick out and get silly that's really cool i love all the features they have packed into this and that it's all optional right the driver chooses what do they want it to be overall i've had a great time driving this if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for [music] watching i keep being in the wrong gear and then i can't keep up because you're actually limited in torque as you're in a higher gear and at the wrong time the other thing is they asked me if i was comfortable driving on this track and i said yes because i've driven on it before but that means they put me with all the best drivers and it's like well if you're with the best drivers and they're not trying to film and you are trying to film yeah doing both at the same time is never something that's come natural to me so here we are giving it our [music] [music] best those exhaust crackles are pretty hilarious
