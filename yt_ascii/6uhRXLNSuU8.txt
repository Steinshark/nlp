videos spongebob vpn psych i have a meeting to talk about this for a while i have been vpn companies pissing me off it's just ridiculous i have seen so many advertisements for vpns that are claiming security and it just drives me insane for a couple reasons in my opinion there are only two use cases where you should be using a vpn and even then there's no need to be pumping your traffic through these random vpn exchanges what is a vpn so right now you're watching youtube whatever whatever you're doing your traffic right is hitting a bunch of different routers along the way and you are saying hey there computer i am me i want to go to twitch.tv okay and all of the routers in the middle they tell the other routers how to get you to pitch.tv and after a couple hops boom ta-da you were at twitch.tv what a vpn does is you for some reason don't trust someone in the connection between you and twitch.tv or netflix what a vpn does is it points your traffic first at somebody else and it says i want to go to vpn server and norway ireland or in australia and then from there i want to start in ireland and then go to twitch.tv so that i can bypass the person that's trying to spy on me going to rule34.com if you are pointing all of your traffic to sketchyvpntm.com what you're doing is you're saying effectively that i trust that person to spy on me more than i trust arbitrary threat model that i've made up between me and twitch.tv you're literally handing over your all of your internet traffic and again there's some caveats to that to these vpn companies you are saying i don't really know who's watching me but somebody's watching me so instead i'm gonna let you watch me i think that is ridiculous there are so many sketchy vpn sites some of them are like giga cheap i'm talking like dollars a month and others are it's like literally free there is no way for these companies to exist through run vpn infrastructure that is pulling in gigabits or terabits a second and then pumping it acro the internet they have to be selling your data literally have to be in my opinion there are only two use cases where you should be using a vpn and the first is if you are in a straight up authoritarian regime there are there are a couple countries where like yeah you probably should use a vpn okay and that is like one of two use cases the second use case is if you are long around the world you're in a you're in a different country and you want to just anonymize where you are and if that's the case you don't need to use one of these vpn companies it is so easy to buy an aws instance it costs you ten dollars a month you spin up openvpn it takes you 10 minutes you sudo app install openvpn and then you set a psk that is a password that you memorize in your head and then from there you can use that psk point it at the ip address of your amazon vpn and then boom that's it you have created your own vpn that you can turn on and off whenever you need to there's absolutely no reason to be handing over your privacy your security to these companies that claim we want to protect you now dude just wanted to get that off my chest because dude i've been i've been getting blasted with vpn ads it's insane it feels odd yeah i don't know makes me a little sketched out anyway go watch this video see ya
