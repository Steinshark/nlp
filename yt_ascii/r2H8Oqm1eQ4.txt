hello everyone and welcome we are sitting inside of our mercedes s560 cabriolet, and this thing is just a technological marvel i mean the amount of technology the amount of features packed into this car is pretty mind-blowing and this kind of brings me to the discussion that i want to have which is about reliability and expensive cars and wild unique features in cars because one of the most common comments that i get on my videos that are explaining you know unique interesting pieces of technology, and how they work is it's super complicated. why would you ever want that it's going to fail? it's unreliable that's that's a nightmare for reliability and the point i kind of want to make with this video is that you know whether or not a car is reliable, uhh these expensive cars don't need to be reliable and i'm not saying that this car isn't reliable or that, i dislike this car i think this s 560 is incredible it's an awesome vehicle, and you know the engineers very well could have made all of the technology that's packed into this last a very long amount of time, so i don't want to give that impression but i'm saying that they don't need to necessarily make it last a long amount of time purely based on who the consumer is so first i want to talk about some of the cool things in this car and i'm going to start with climate control and you're thinking why is he going to talk about climate control? how could climate control ever be interesting, but just hear me out they've done some pretty cool stuff with this so there are not only exterior but internal temperature sensors for the climate control system to make adjustments it automatically knows whether the top of this cabriolet is open or closed and will adjust the climate control system accordingly there are solar sensors multiple solar sensors which are looking for radiation, and it will adjust the climate control based on that radiation there's an air quality sensor for the climate control system which is detecting you know is there harmful gases that are coming in and it will make adjustments accordingly it's kind of activated charcoal filter, and also has fragrance that it can inject on top of this there's a dewpoint sensor for the front windshield so it's monitoring that the front windshield won't fog up in total. there are 12 sensors and' actuators just for the climate control system in this car i mean, it's incredibly complex, and that's just the climate control system you've got all kinds of crazy features look at the size of these two screens. i can push this button here and suddenly i've got a night-vision camera in my center display right there very cool and actually a good frame rate on that night-vision camera you've of course got adaptive cruise control but it goes beyond that you can turn the system on and it will do the steering for you even on a road like this it'll it'll use not only radar but also gps in order for to navigate you on the road and do the steering for you you of course have to hold your hands on the steering wheel but it will adjust your speed your braking on your cornering for you in the event of a rear collision this will actually flash a light saying that you know it sees that a cars coming up on it too fast it'll flash the brake lights at the person behind you to help notify them it'll also lock your seatbelt to hold you in place and it'll lock up the brake, so you don't go shooting out and it minimizes whiplash in doing this you know you don't run into the car in front of you or pop out into an intersection whatever it may be it'll hold you in place and minimize the amount of whiplash that you're going to get if this car rolls over there's essentially explosives for the rear anti-roll bar which will pop up so that if you do flip over you're not hitting your head the car will bear that load there's all kinds of insane technology in this vehicle. they have these energizing comfort modes which are pretty wild and it's a selection that changes based on what mood you want so would you want to be refreshed and it'll turn on you know the cooled seats? it'll it'll play some refreshing seaside music. it'll adjust the climate control accordingly it'll adjust the lighting in here, which you can't see quite as well right now since it's daytime, but at night time it'll adjust the lighting for you you can change to vitality to invigorate you as it says. it'll change the music you've got enjoyment, it'll give you a seat massage, so these seats have built-in massage elements within them to massage you as you're driving around. it'll change the music so you enjoy yourself. it's got well-being so all kinds of different absurd selections just in you know just using the climate control taking advantage of the interior lighting the massage chairs this car is truly just packed with insane amounts of technology and i find it awesome like i think it's really cool, and that leads me to the point okay, if i were to review any one of these devices everyone would say oh my god. that's so complicated. that's crazy. why would you ever buy that car all that stuff's gonna break? well, here's the thing over half of luxury cars are leased over half so whether it's mercedes audi bmw if you got a car like maserati, that's even above seventy percent of the cars are leased and so people own them for three years. they want something. that's modern that's cool that has this sweet technology in it and then they want to trade up for the next greatest thing just like you do with your cell phone except it's the exchange program for the ultra-wealthy that can afford you know this car as tested that we're in right now is one $155,000, which is an absurd amount of money and i'm sure the lease is quite expensive but if the car lasts wonderfully and you don't really have to do anything maintenance wise you know you bring into the dealer once a year twice a year whatever it may be if the car lasts under that lease program for the three years that you have it do you really care about what happens to it afterwards, so let's think about it from the manufacturer standpoint well they sold the car so they're happy and then from the consumer standpoint the you know the first person who's actually buying this the new car buyer they don't care that in ten years. maybe some of this stuff will break and again i'm not saying that this stuff is going to break but there's certainly a mentality that things that are overly complicated do tend to fail just because of the sheer number of complex items that are within this vehicle so i think the point to be made is that you know manufacturers are building for the new car buyer they're not necessarily building for the used car buyer and for companies like toyota and honda that of course want that reputation of reliability that you can buy this car you can use it for your lifetime you can you know run it 10 15 20 years, and it's going to support you and then you pass it down to your kids they want that reputation because that helps with their new car buyers, but in the luxury market people like to exchange cars they want the latest and greatest they make these impulse emotional buys and they want what's cool and of course in 10 years. you know the next s-class is going to be way cooler than the current s-class it's going to have all kinds of crazy technology and so as a result you know people are going to be trading up so i think the thing just to keep in mind you know what i'm saying ok this technology is like super bizarre very cool. here's how it works it's just that for some buyers they want cool tech, and it's not about reliability not everything has to be about reliability and i am with you 100% and that i think you know things should be designed to last and that's a great thing to have but for people that just exchange these every three years honestly thinking about you know are my seat massager still going to work in 10 years time with this energizing comfort that's not as important it even has like a training plan where i guess you can exercise while you're in the car and they'll walk you through exercises so that on your way to work you can i guess you know pump some iron the equivalent of whatever that is for an executive driving an s-class perhaps just squeezing the steering wheel i don't know what it is but it's got a training plan in there to do exercises as you're driving it's got ways to you know try to keep you awake. it's got that scent to inject for you very cool very complicated and perhaps reliable, perhaps not who knows i think it's sweet though, and and i understand why cars like this exist people like cool features. they're not investing in it. they're not worrying about the depreciation. they're leasing it they're enjoying the new technology because perhaps they have too much money and don't know what to do with all of it, and they want to have something exciting to drive whatever it may be who cares i'm not i'm not trying to judge that decision it's not a financially smart decision but you know it may be an emotional decision that improves their happiness and so so be it oh my whole point with this is is that expensive cars don't need to be reliable purely based on who's buying them and very often the cases they're just leasing it and owning it for three years. so thank you all for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below, and now i'm going to see what this twin-turbo 4.0 liter v8. is capable of.
