okay have you ever started learning something especially something technical and had great enthusiasm at the beginning only a few weeks a few months later you wonder where that went why all of a sudden do we always seem to find ourselves stopping to learn what we started especially when it comes to something new in your career technical or otherwise well first off you're not alone in fact 80% of people who start learning a new skill quit within the first 3 months according to studies but what if i told you there was a way to break this cycle and this video came to me as i'm sitting here in my hotel room in seattle i'm attending the microsoft build conference i'm someone who's currently focused on learning and studying ai and machine learning and doing so well on a work trip and you know not in my normal environment is the last thing i want to do but i know i need to this brought up old kind of thoughts or behaviors that i personally had where i would start learning something new because it was hot trendy whatever the case may be or i thought it would help me with my salary or my career but then i just fall off and i mean learning new skills in today's environment is more important than ever we are seeing technology evolve at a faster pace than we ever have to keep up with it we need to continuously be learning now it doesn't mean to constantly be you know overkill with learning new things but finding what you are passionate about and when you do then actually taking the the time to understand what you are learning to become an expert in it and not just something that you start and then stop i mean let's take a look back in history learning has undergone significant changes in the past education was often limited to privileged individuals and focused on memorization then came the advent of the printing press yes these big old things that allowed for knowledge to start becoming more accessible next up was the internet hi that's what we're communicating on right now that was that was a bad joke you get what i mean though where knowledge became accessible to the masses i mean anything you want to learn is available online and the challenge really has shifted from gaining access to this knowledge to having so much knowledge that we don't know how to stick with something we don't know how to focus and continue to learn what we want to actually learn we just get overwhelmed and shift our focus again now there are many reasons so many of us end up quitting what we are learning i mean from stting a family to lack of time well i guess that goes hand inand to lack of resources or feeling that way anyways maybe you need a tutor or a community or even yet the absence of a clear learning path not really knowing where to learn and yes that is very possible actually almost more so than ever now online which is kind of it sounds counterintuitive because nowadays there are so many resources available online you think it would be the opposite but in reality it's this information over overload that we are constantly bombarded with but there are solutions there are scientific back solutions that have really worked for me i'm going to share with you that will help you be able to focus when you are learning something new and stick with it that is the most important part whether it be a technical skill whether it be a skill related a soft skill related to your career as well anything like that these tips are things that you can apply today now the first one is called inter leave practice and this is really interesting inter leave practice involves alternating between different topics or skills during your learning sessions so for example say you are learning a concept within ai say you are learning about supervised learning you're studying it you're wrapping your head around it with inter leave practice what you would do is then switch into a different topic so maybe it's something more so focused on deep learning or machine learning whatever the case is now i didn't say unsupervised learning as the opposite you know of course to supervise learning this example because you want to take something that is still a little bit intertwined as to what you are learning but not so much that it feels like you're just continuing on it's a continuation it needs to feel different and this is really interesting there was research conducted in 2008 by cornell that found interl practice actually enhances retention and learning compared to block practice which is focusing on one skill at a time and why this works is because by switching between topics it challenges your your brain it keeps it active it keeps it awake to make connections and develop a deeper understanding okay the next one is really cool it's called elaborate interrogation so listen to this elaborate interrogation is a technique where you ask yourself why questions while learning and this one has helped me significantly okay so here's some data behind it a study by denski in 2013 showed that elaborative interrogation improves learning outcomes by encouraging a deeper processing of information so here's an example say you are learning any concept when as you are learning it and you're going down this path take a step back and ask why is this important and i remember the first time this was shared with me it was a manager when i worked at ibm actually and i was talking to them about angular at the time and they said well tiff why are we using this framework why are we using this technology and it took me back a sec i thought well this is just what the client picked this is what we're supposed to use but when you really take a step back and uncover the why why are you learning something why why is this concept important to understand that is a very tough question to answer and when you are able to answer that you will unlock so much learnings within that okay next up this one is called dual coding and no it's not coding related but you can use it to learn different technical topics and this one is interesting because it involves the senses i guess so what this is is this was a study done by meer and anderson back in the '90s but it's still very relevant and spoken about a lot today and they found that presenting information in both verbal and visual formats would lead to better learning outcomes so both verbal and visual so how would this work this is a great example of when you are learning something creating visual aids such as diagrams or using them to help you learn and then using these diagrams to complement your notes make sure they're physically handwritten notes as well because that is such a big help versus when you are typing you actually it's proven by so many people that not just people scientists that when you tpe when you write out your notes it is so much more efficient in retaining information than when you are typing so this is key and the other thing with this too is verbal so actually speaking out loud i mean this is where the rubber ducky method rubber duck method comes in where you are actually just speaking out loud into the void if you will about what you are learning because what that will do is it will show if there are any holes in your learning because often times whether you are explaining it to the void or you explaining it to a person there will be gaps in your knowledge you might think in your mind as you are studying that oh yeah i got that this is great but then especially if you have the opportunity to share your learnings with another human versus the void and they start asking questions they don't know anything about this topic it will really help retain it okay those are the four science back techniques that will really help you be able to focus in on your learnings and not only that but when you are using techniques that help you focus retain information it is more motivating to keep on going the reality is a lot of us give up on when we are learning because it's challenging nothing seems to stick we aren't making progress you know we can use excuses of lack of time resources etc but if you were to spend a few minutes every day or throughout the week to learn something new using these techniques and you actually see yourself making progress it is significantly easier to carry on with it long term and also get excited about it knowing that you are making progress you can know you can sense that you have come such a far away from when you started versus constantly having to go back because you don't have a plan and action you don't have these techniques in action and you always are going back to the beginning to learn again all right those are my four techniques i use them all throughout learning different things i i love them all and i just i love merging science with different techniques for studying because these techniques have been studied for so long you can search up any of them that it's proven methods that work for so many different learners and types of individuals and it's exciting when you find something that will actually help you learn long term on that note what are you learning right now leave in the comments leave in the comments what questions you have what videos you want me to create i mean that's how i make this content is for you for what you want to hear about all right check out this view though this is how we'll end it oh oh pretty cool bye everyone oh hit that subscribe button [music]
