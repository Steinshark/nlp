- is there something else that
you've been excited about, like reusable rockets
perhaps, that you've seen in the last few years? - yep, well the re-usability you had, the re-usability is awesome! (laughter)
i mean it's just the best. now, we have to remember the
shuttle was a reusable vehicle. which, the shuttle is an amazing,
as an aerospace engineer, i mean the shuttle is sill
just the most gorgeous, elegant, extraordinary
design of a space vehicle. it was reusable, it
just wasn't affordable. but the re-usability of
it was really critical because we flew it up, it did come back so the notion of re-usability,
i think, absolutely. now what we're doing with
we and all, the global we, but with spacex and virgin, sending the rockets up,
recovering the first stages, where if they can regain 70%
cost savings, that's huge. and just seeing the control, y'know, there couldn't
be a control on dynamics, just seeing that rocket
come back and land, - oh yeah, that's-- - it never gets old, it's
exciting every single time you look at it and say "that's magic". so, it's so cool. - to me, the landing is when
i stand up and start clapping. just, just the control. - yeah, just the, the
algorithms, just the control, and hitting that landing, it's, y'know, it's gymnastics for rocket ships, but to see these guys stick a landing.
- pretty well put. - is just wonderful. like i said, every time i
see, y'know, the re-usability and the rockets coming back
and landing so precisely, it's really exciting. so it is, actually, that's a game-changer. we are in a new era of lower cost and a lot higher frequency. and it's the world, not just nasa, many nations are really upping
their frequency of launches.
