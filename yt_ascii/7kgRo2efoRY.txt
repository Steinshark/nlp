today we are talking about one of my literal favorite topics which is online learning i think almost all the success of success i've so far had in my life be from learning to code or literally learning to make these youtube videos are all thanks to today's ability for us to just go and learn things online and in this video we're specifically focused on how to learn coding and computer science online using moocs and how to do it in the best way because in this day and age is so possible to essentially almost teach yourself a whole entire degree just by doing online courses that you can do for either free or a very cheap price i have hand-picked five online courses from coursera that i think every self-taught programmer should do and pick them in a way that's gonna take you from a beginner and give you a very varied and sort of a broad range of knowledge about different areas most of which most beginners actually ignore so you have that to look forward to and also at the end i'm going to share my entire full online computer science curriculum which i've essentially been following since the day that i started teaching myself computer science online i have a whole notion template that you'll be able to download if you watch till the end of this video and on top of that i'm going to show you everything i know about how to actually not only pick the right courses but also use them effectively and in the right way this video was made possible by coursera but more on them later first let me just give you some brief inspiration about the power of online learning and how it literally helped me change my career [music] when i first became interested in computer science i was still finishing my actual university degree which was an economics degree i had essentially come to the conclusion that i did not want to follow the same path as most of my fellow economic graduates which essentially meant going into like finance or consulting or something like that so essentially i came to the realization like okay if i don't want to do this that i've now studied for three years what can i do then i discovered the tech industry and for various reasons i determined that literally changing my career to tech would be the perfect decision for me not only the pay grade the work-life balance is also great but obviously because i didn't have any experience or a degree in this area my first instinct was like well okay i guess i'm gonna have to do a master's then but the more i look into the industry the more i realized that maybe i should just try to teach this to myself on my own that's what led me to start studying programming online i became so passionate about it that i also wanted to teach myself essentially like a whole curriculum of computer science and i'm obviously not finished yet but even now i am already working full-time as a self-taught software engineer so i just wanted to share that to sort of explain to you why online learning has such an important place in my heart but before you start doing this we have a problem even though all these resources are out there most people actually don't know how to use them effectively and i think only 10 of people who start online courses end up finishing them so how can we fix that first thing you need is a purpose you need a strong reason why you're wanting to learn the things that you're learning and trust me i can tell this from experience because i've tried learning so many things online in my life and there's only a handful of them that i've actually been able to stick to for example i've tried teaching myself graphic design i've tried teaching myself chinese but i didn't end up sticking to those things because i did not have a strong enough reason and strong enough why as to why i wanted to put in hour after hour every single day to master these topics there will come a time when you hit this thing called the dip which i talk more about in this video which you can watch right after this one it'll be linked down below but essentially what happens is that this early excitement goes away and things become hot but the good thing is that this excitement does actually come back but it only comes back once you're actually really good at the thing that you're doing but the only way to bridge the gap between these two states of excitement is by reminding yourself of the reason why you're learning the thing in the first place and that is what is going to be able to push you through this tip of through the hard times into actually becoming good at what you're doing and into actually finishing the courses that you're taking essentially when i decide that i want to learn something let's say i want to learn c plus loss what i'll do is i'll search up best c plus course on google i'll find some online recommendations i'd make a short list of like three to five then i do a second search on youtube where i see if other people have done reviews of these courses and then i do a third search course name reddit see what people on reddit are saying because that's a good place to get like a lot of different opinions in one place very fast the other thing i look for in the screening process is credibility if you're just learning the basics of something this is not as important i even often find that someone who's just gone through the basics is better at explaining the basics than someone with like 30 years of experience who can be out of touch with like the basics but if i'm trying to learn something very complex like i'm trying to teach myself machine learning it really matters that the person teaching it has the credibility to know what they're talking about to know to teach all the things that i need to know in the most logical way and that is why for learning new areas within programming and computer science i really love using coursera who are the sponsor of this video a great thing about platforms like coursera is that in order for a course to be placed on the platform it has had to go through some like checking process it's not like anyone can just upload a course on coursera i think all of them are literally made by actual universities and because these courses have the name of the university behind them you sort of know that it has to be somewhat good because otherwise those universities would literally be hurting their brand if they were releasing some terrible courses so in case you've been living under a literal rock and you don't know what coursera is they're in my opinion the best provider of university level courses online most of the courses i've personally done in my own learning path are from coursera and that is why i was so excited when they wanted to partner with me to make this video i strongly think that this day and age everyone should have access to learning education should not be hidden behind exorbitant tuition fees and that is why i just love coursera because that is exactly what their mission is to to make education available for everyone most of them you can literally either audit for free or pay a very small price to get access to official certificates and problem sets and the price is ridiculously low when you consider that these courses are literally taught by actual universities and by some of the best professors in the world so i love course there are and as promised here are five courses from areas of programming that i think every self-taught programmer should do at some point and at this point if you are getting value out of this video i would really appreciate it if you could hit the like button down below in the description it's completely free to do so you might as well do it because the more people like this video the more people the youtube algorithm will show this video too so why don't we together help spread the good word of online education by hitting the like button down below in the description and i say thank you for doing that as always here is a picture of a very cute puppy for you to enjoy now let's get into the courses [music] number one is python for everybody and this course especially holds a very special place in my heart because it's actually the first ever programming course that i personally did and to this day is one of the courses that i recommend most people start with before i started this course i had literally never written a line of code in my life and at the end of it i had a very solid foundation in python and it's no wonder that it's literally the most popular python course in the world and i think python is also the best language for most beginners to learn because the syntax is very easy and it's just a very good place to start to learn some very fundamental programming principles the course is taught by dr chuck severance one of the most reviewed python educators in the world if you do it and enjoy it there's also follow-up courses that you can literally just continue on from and learn a bunch of other things the second course which is really interesting to me is the meta backend slash meta front end developer curriculums and that are taught by actual meta staff which sounds really interesting to me so i haven't done these myself but when i found them they sort of caught my attention and i think they're super super popular in coursera so because i'm personally more interested in back-end i think i will actually end up taking the back-end curriculum just as a refresher on a lot of basics and because i'm really curious as to what this course is like it goes through everything from python syntax web frameworks like channel linux git rest apis and finally how to prepare for interviews and after that you can start getting into some of the more advanced concepts because you actually get a job at companies like meta you will eventually have to learn data structures and algorithms and this is the point where most beginners make a big mistake where they simply just go on leads code and start memorizing a lot of lead code problems long term it's a much better approach to actually pick a good comprehensive course on data structures and algorithms that takes you from the basics to learning all the theory behind them and because you understand them you can then just sort of apply these frameworks into any problem that you're solving the most comprehensive one i've done is the algorithm specialization by stanford university is a very theoretical approach to algorithms but trust me if you go through it and you actually take the time to understand the theory you're gonna be such better off to actually approach interviews and to approach these coding problems obviously as long as you also practice them next we have a coding for everyone c and c plus plus another thing that people like me who started with a very high level language like python often ignore is going down and actually learning a lower level language like c or c plus flaps and here's why this is important languages like python and javascript are really great for beginners because they allow you to not worry about low level details like memory management for example and just focus on basic programming fundamentals but eventually if you wanted to be the best programmer you can actually become quite important that you actually understand how to optimize for a lot of these low level details so that is why at some point learning a lower level language like c or c plus plus becomes very important i've learned some basics of c in the past but i've sort of been putting off learning it properly so this is actually a course that's very much on my list of to do courses very soon and yes this one probably starts with like the basics of programming which i sort of already know but it never hurts to get a refresher on the basics especially when you're learning a completely new language last but not least is the machine learning specialization by andrew ing so with these four courses that we just talked about we'll have a very solid founding in programming so after that you can start thinking about what are the sort of specific areas within programming and computer science that you're most interested in that you might sort of want to try and specialize in for me this area was machine learning and ai and i made a video about this in the past about i'm self teaching ai and machine learning the educator andrew ing is probably the most prominent name in the machine learning education industry i think he's also like one of the co-founders of coursera so if machine learning interests you and you have some python fundamentals down this is really the course that literally everyone does this is like the entry point into self-teaching machine learning so i cannot recommend it enough and right after that i plan to take his second specialization which is on deep learning which sort of continues on from machine learning basics so after you choose a course the important part now is to figure out how do you actually use it properly and stick to it literally the most important piece of advice here that i can tell from personal experience is to stick to a routine i know that this might sound crazy but literally like most of my success with learning online can probably just be attributed to the fact that i simply built myself a schedule where i do the same things every single day at the exact same time over and over and over again it's an actual neuroscientific fact that we as humans have very limited stores of willpower so the less willpower you have to expend to get started every day the less likely you will be to skip on your learning sessions and so when you've literally made a non-negotiable rule for yourself that at 7 pm every single day you are going to be studying you don't have to expend the willpower to start studying because it's just obvious that you're gonna do it right so literally just think about what would be a realistic schedule that you can make for yourself that you can actually stick to every single day and then just follow it religiously every single day and of course sometimes things will come up like you'll have to help your mom fix the freezer or something so obviously you won't be able to stick to it a hundred percent of the time obviously even if you just stick to eighty percent of the time that's still 80 better than not doing it at all and then during your working hours you want to keep in mind the right metric the goal here is not to just finish as many courses as possible the goal here is to learn the concepts that you want to learn the way you learn is by not skipping parts that seem hard so make sure you're absolutely honest with yourself at all times have you actually learned the things that you're learning or are you just sort of finishing them without properly learning them it's not about rushing through as many courses as possible it's about learning to enhance your learning process even more as an ex-video gamer i found that sort of gamifying the process and sort of making doing these courses almost like achievements or trophies that you might think about from a video game can make the whole process a lot more motivated so this as well as the desire to just keep all my learning organized is why i crafted my own notion template for my full computer science online degree that i've essentially built for myself it's essentially a notion template which you can go grab for yourself for free from the description if you want to follow the exact same path imar and this is based on an actual real curriculum that you would study at a university if you were to do a computer science degree i started by copying all the courses from this open source society curriculum online but it's now quite modified from this point and something like this also really keeps me motivated because i can sort of take off courses and like move them in the completed column but at the same time it also allows me to see just how much there is still to learn which to me is exciting because i'm excited about learning these things so if you have a schedule you keep yourself accountable and you're organized you're studying intelligently while making the process as fun for yourself as you can i know that you will succeed in learning you don't have to rush it like you have all the time in the world and this whole process is literally going to make your life more fulfilling because you know that every day when you wake up you know that by the end of this day i'm going to be smarter than i was yesterday i'm going to know something really exciting and cool that i didn't know yesterday i'm going to know how to build new things and i'm going to be one step closer to my dream career if that is the reason that you're doing this for but after all of this there is still one piece of the puzzle that you must understand which is what should you actually do during your learning sessions to sort of maximize your efficiency and because this video is already probably very long i've been talking for a bunch of time i'm gonna direct you to this video next where i go into all of the details and in this video i teach you to literally learn more by studying less so before you start go watch this video
