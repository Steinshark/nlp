the latest 6.5 inch dynamic amoled screen for gi hot smartphone okay so with a grand total of'0 dollars and eighty two dollars for shipping we have all the items we need for our wish investigations exactly just how real and how good of a deal some of this stuff really is hello my friends and welcome you know what stuck me out with that one alright okay so these are the supposedly real sennheiser ie 800 headphones now this is actually the entire reason why we did this video because we originally take a look at another pair of these on a wish mystery tech a couple months ago and they were incredibly incredibly authentic they came in the box everything i thought we had bought this with the box this was supposed to come in the original packaging wasn't it the packaging straight up looks real i mean even like magnetic and then we have the headphones themselves so again just like the last ones these look very authentic however i think to really properly test well we're gonna need a we need to do something a little painful i think and by painful i mean i'll spy up here so these are the real deal ken how much do we pay for the real ie8 hundreds well they would have been $700 $700 boy but so they offered us the ie 800 s which we turned down for the sake of accuracy we spent this much money on something which is now no longer useful for our comparison i guess i'm gonna compare them anyway because i'm gonna do a non side so we've got a very similar looking carrying case like i mean straight up this looks the same so they look very slightly different than the texture of them are a little bit different than the standard 800 s so i've actually heard rumors that part of the reason that these headphones even exist is because the original ie 800 s were so thoroughly counterfeited across the spectrum that they were just like let's just make a new pair so they did this oh and so just so you guys know i am using the standard rubber tips i'm not gonna use any of the comply foam or whatever because that's standard across all these guys i put blindfold on thank you look sometimes in life you put a blindfold on first and ask questions later okay i switch headphones i think yes what's going on with these things like i put this in my ear and immediately rolls back like whatever the deal is with these like i don't know if they're the knockoffs are their little quality but like the tips just roll right back i've got a good sense of these i think let me let me try the next one oh these tips feel different actually this is immediately a better seal bass seems a little less harsh on these perhaps it's not a big difference it's a little bit more booming on the last ones ah that's the best deal in the world but i think i can get away with that these sounds just like the first ones like the bass is slightly overpowering and the seal also they're a little bit better on this one but they're just not as good as the second one you want to be fair can we get the same comply tips that came with the real ones and just put them on all and it's gonna like take a little bit of time but i would actually wanna have like a proper seal with all these because i don't think it's a fair comparison right now so my same thoughts from previous while i have a better seal now the base is a little bit much on these it's tighter the main difference here is the base feels tighter both sound good it's only when i was really cranking it out that could tell the difference between one and three which i'm pretty sure are the same versus two but i'm gonna say that these are the esses and the other two are both the knockoffs finish all right so i've laid them all in order for you just a reminder the orange ones were the first fake ones that we got the blue ones are the new fake ones that we got and the greens are the 800s okay so i wanna see the green in the middle otherwise i'm wrong oh it's really bright oh these to me sounded very similar in the fact that we actually paid 700 ollars for these and we actually paid like fifty dollars to these and i could hardly tell a difference that's wild so i don't know what we've really proved here beyond the fact that we're bad at scientific tests yes and that we should probably have spent more time and not done in a single blind test i guess my fake headphones on which these feel like fake shoes i believe these are the nike air react to 70s or no thanks max to 70s how much were these nineteen so thirty bucks well the first thing is the logo that looks like a slightly different swoosh look at the little like thing on the top it also says fashion on them i don't think the originals say fashion let's put these aside for one second i have you will be so kind purchased a pair of real air to 70s and a grand total of one hundred and fifty dollars it's like potato gaming vs. real gaming so you can see that it's got like a nike swoosh and roughly the same spot you got one here it says air 270 the text on the back is very different like so this actually has like the the black sole which you can see looks really cheap and fake i mean that's that's really the real key right here the main appeal it has a bump noses a real bubble the but it's not it's not the vivo it's not the bubble it is a bubble i mean they don't feel like the worst thing it's it's a cheap shoe if you've ever worn a very cheap shoe like i grew up for a lot of years wearing then it's it's okay i mean the few of its not the big issue but the the actual legit nike it definitely has like a lot more like flexibility i'm bubbling right now wish stop selling knockoff shoes these oh look just nondescript white boxes they totally don't have something to listen inside oh it's an iphone so unlike the things that we take a look at in the past which or in the past i mean unlike the things that we look to go look at two minutes ago this is supposedly a real iphone i have no reason to doubt that but the main selling point here is that this is a refurbished iphone so okay so it actually is in very good cosmetic shape there's some very minor little scoffs by the camera but it looks like a tiny chip on the top i would say this is still in very good quality i there's a little bit of wear by the port matt how much was this iphone success wait no wait this is just not a good deal like straight up without even turning it on assuming that it works fine which i would hope it is it's dead 135 bucks is like basically what you could buy a new or iphone success at least one from a more reputable retailer than some random person on wish let's let's get this charging and look at the next thing so this is a fourth generation ipad so the first thing with anything used refurbished i'm always looking at the quality a little bit of weird some very minor scratches but again i would actually say that the quality is pretty solid man i forgot how like chunky ipads used to be like this is like some thick boy it's gonna power up for us now well lucky for us they include the exact same accessories of a jim jim usb cable and the world's slowest usb charger for an ipad it'll be charged about four hours be right back what's a unsatisfying bump oh oh is this our fake galaxy s10 i'm very excited this is gonna be bad i got to tell you look at the box it's just a smart phone well apparently it's new 5g it has a questionable tattoo on it it i was about to say that but i didn't want to be offensive haha how dare you talk good about sally like that so may i first draw your attention to the fact that you can see it looks like it's got the infinity hole punch whoever you a little bit higher you'll see a actual front-facing camera in the bezel of the phone so we just remove that illusion right here oh i just realized we look to have three cameras on the back and they all look identical oh this is gonna be fun welcome oh look it's our fake camera it's part of the look it's so good i can't believe they actually legitimately put that in so putting the fake one side by side with the real one obviously the bezels are much larger here i can't get over the camera so on the s10 if i open up the camera oh it does it what what touchscreen fingerprint this is not about to work is it this is actually have a fingerprint sensor no this is not a real thing there's no way they put a fake fingerprint sensor in it wait this is just scanning my fingerprint data and uploading it to some nefarious whatever yes so i popped unlock okay so wants the pen if i don't do the pen no no way no i pull on oh i do a different finger okay that's scary for a second that is definitely not a real fingerprint sensor that is all a fake now looking around the phone they actually do look very sullen right so the camera bumps are finished in the same spot it doesn't happen samsung logo but usbc headphone jack speaker the buttons are all on the same sort of position this is like a legit fake should you buy it absolutely not whatsoever like under no circumstances but i mean they put some real work into this like this looks and feels a lot like a galaxy s 10 but so after a bit of charging and some set up we have our ipad and iphone fully functioning i can't confirm as far as i can tell they look completely legitimate they're just refurbished the downside though is that we paid a little over $100 for this including shipping and that's like not really any cheaper than what you get on something like ebay or amazon and if you want an old ipad this is an old ipad it runs ios 10 so it's definitely a little bit behind and apps are starting to not support this anymore the thing is like the hardware actually doesn't feel bad i mean like the way like if you want to use this like an e-reader or something like it actually feels pretty good in the hand the screen is actually just about as good as like the current base ipad but considering that this is $100 and you could spend a little bit more to get like a much newer ipad it's kind of a harder sell however what i do think is a little bit of an easier sell as the iphone 6s because this is actually fully up to date okay let me clarify if i ran a software update and didn't want to wait 30 minutes port to install this is still fully supported on ios 13 what you're getting here is the most powerful iphone with a headphone this was the last of the breed you also get this wonderful pink color and the camera is pretty decent like this is still a very usable phone here in 2019 2020 2021 whatever you're watching this video at its 2020 right now though december 4th
