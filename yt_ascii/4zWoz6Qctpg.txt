team gothamers.com link is in the description now let's go now magnus carlson is involved in today's video because i want to give you an update of his team the canada chess bras as well magnus's team was going up against the garden state passers and in the final round magnus played the french defense against sam sevilleon that is kanovitz i don't know why that's his username but it was a very very tense opening and magnus went on a big aggressive opening of the position with pawn takes d4 he traded knights he traded bishops with savion and he put his knight very comfortably on the e4 square now savion had a nice position early he played c3 and a5 and it looked like things were going swimmingly he could have played queen h6 and just started maybe going for it with rook f3 obviously gonna stop knight f2 but the position looked really really dangerous bishop takes b5 is what sam went for in this game and magnus immediately started creating counter play for a very brief moment there was a chance there that white would have been up two pawns but white went wrong a little bit here magnus got in on the queen side and suddenly didn't seem like there might have been as much of an attack sam kept poking but look at this the brick wall of pawns built by magnus carlson sam's sacrificing a knight and trying to get in but it ain't enough queen d4 breaks centralizing the queen and winning the pawn and it was magnus leading his canada chess bras to a close eight and a half seven and a half victory over the garden state passers magnus once again goes 4-0 so magnus is just obliterating all right he has like multiple matches of being perfect and who is the only other player who is the only other player in the entire league who can even compare to when magnus is on it's hikaru now remember the average rating of the four players in the protest league has to be 25.50 there are little things like if you're above 2700 you just count this at 2700 if you're below 2200 you count as of 2200 they've done this in specific ways so that every team has a woman who's every team has to have minimum one female player and the average rating has to be 25.50 as of november 2022. so we fielded hikaru vladimir faresayev international master and soon to be grandmaster alina kashlinska and nicola bortnick also very strong international master and he's 3 000 rated online and folks hikaru early was playing the board four of china aka the shanghai tigers this is yiping luo and you know from the early going it's difficult to get a bad position when you play white and when you have a lot of time on the clock and so hikaru what he did is he opened up his opponent's king and he won a pawn but sorry he he sacrificed the pawn to open up his opponent's king and he got the following position like this balanced pretty balanced game you know white brings the king out and queen like this one inaccuracy rook c8 rook to c8 and the board four is gonna have some questions to answer here on this c4 pawn rook takes c4 take take and it was light squared pawns to counteract the dark scored bishop that can't touch anything bishop down to d2 white tried his best but hikaru just came forward like a buzz saw like the hydraulic press that doesn't stop and he just kept moving he got it down to a one rook end game he's gonna win the b4 body doesn't even need to win it he's gonna push his deep on forward and here comes the king and hikaru getting it done in clinical style here to open up the scoring the first round against china was close it was two to two the top boards won the the bottom boards lost it was very very close in the early stages and hikaru just kept just just kept firing away i mean you put him up against actor's shoe actor shoe is he's like a 20-something year old grandmaster and he is a beast he is a very very solid player he's drawn a lot of 2700 feet guys so how does hikaru beat a guy that doesn't lose who plays the petrov right this guy has a very solid repertoire well hikaru puts the knight on d3 was which is a very non-traditional way of retreating in the petrov and then he plays queenie2 and knight f4 and essentially the idea is like look we can trade queens but i have more development so obviously i'm going to be a little bit better so let's see how kikaru shows the level difference between a young 2500 rated grandmaster and one of the best blitzen bullet and rapid players in the world as well as a multiple time candidates participant and that is of course hikaru so black plays this move h5 and hikaru plays in a way where he goes long he castles long and his opponent does too why is white so much better here can hikaru show us i don't understand why does white have such a massive advantage but what what is what is happening here right bishop d3 take take this that's the problem the problem is that the black king is exceptionally weak and you've got all these pieces that are going to go over there somehow b3 b4 i meant to highlight b3 i know my squares i promise you also have rookie one you also can put a queen in front of a bishop put the bishop back there and go give oh my god what is wrong with me there we go can't draw arrows at all hikaru plays h4 why does he play h4 because now there's nobody that's gonna go to g5 so black tries to trade off dark squared bishops hikaru is like nope how does black stop this and that i got news for you he can't he can't he has to make massive concessions like give away the bishop for the night and then go here and then go here so at any moment hikaru might play this move he doesn't have to do it right away that knight is being controlled by one pawn the rook is dominant nobody even cares that hikaru's king is in the center of the board after bishop takes the two king takes d2 is such a disrespectful move king takes d2 is ridiculous he took with the king he could have taken with the queen or with the rook it actually would have been the same king bro this dude really play king takes d2 and then he played b3 and then he went here and then he went here and then he went here and then he went in and then you just took and watch as white's king goes for a jog for he doesn't go backward look at the time can anybody look at the time please it's 7 minutes and 20 seconds versus six seconds can i go back 10 moves look at the time when h4 was played six to eight hikaru not only defeated a man that doesn't lose in emphatic style showing the level difference right that's what you need from your board one hikaru won this game with force made on the board and seven extra minutes hikaru spent about three minutes on this entire game as black literally cannot prevent rook b8 if he moves his knight he cannot prevent rook a7 look at this look look at this crazy no i mean hikaru was just just unreal by the merch support your gotham knights seriously we might be a championship contender crazy stuff all right but folks when i tell you it was not just hikaru i mean that our board three very close board three four our new player alina kashlinska she's she's definitely gonna be a grand master i don't know if she has all her norms but she's like 24.95 i think that's like her feet she's very very high rated player there was a round that she was beating away she was beating the highest rated player on the chinese team and like overall the number three ranked player that that is in china he's like 2 700 feet he ended up swindling her it was a it was a very very close and tough game very hard fought game so alina kashlinskaya plays against right he's the he's the the board for and she plays the grunfeld right and watch what she does in this game she plays h4 she's very very aggressive player her opponent i couldn't understand if queen h5 was a mouse slip but she just went here and then she went here because her king is actually completely safe and her opponent offered a dark squared bishop exchange which visually looks really good right it it looks very smart to have boom boom boom as you can see the computer didn't like white trading okay didn't like the fact that white actually made this trade it thought white had better options okay now in this position alina kashlinska played the move h5 okay for the move h5 trying to go for a big attack the computer says that black should take this which just seems completely deranged the computer's like yeah just take i mean who cares if you have doubled age pawns in an open king it's yeah it's fine now played this move which i found much more human she took and from this position forward she played like the terminator she played like she was an evil villain in a movie or is he the protagonist i don't even remember and she was coming to you know to hunt down the opponent alina played bishop d5 which is a move that has two reasons number one you block the rook from seeing your pawn so that pawn is not hanging but number two is that if black goes there you go here and here you actually want to trade why two reasons again it stops the pressure off of your pawn and you damage your opponent's structure and kind of this bishop is stuck behind enemy lines that is the idea behind bishop d5 he went knight b4 attacking her bishop she moved and then she targeted his knight and sent it backwards and went queen to g5 making sure that the rook the the knight cannot take the pawn because it would stop defending the rook and from this position she did one of the most disgusting things i think i've seen in a chess game in a while she played the movie five what's so disgusting about the movie five you might say this her idea is literally to come here and then to come here and then to come here to trade queens and black's king cannot stop getting mated her idea with e5 is she shuts the door she's gonna go here and here and here and i got news for you i've got news for you black can't stop this plan there is literally nothing that black can do in this position to stop this play this plan is unstoppable you know it's coming you know exactly what your opponent is going to play rook h4 rook h1 queen f6 and there is nothing you can do he went here she went here and he realized wait a minute i literally can't do anything so what did he do spent four minutes took on d4 tried to do his best but knight takes d4 rook h1 and a clinical conversion as she gets in queen h6 and boom mate if you take i go here and i'm gonna take everything knight takes e6 alina kashlinska wins a monster game in her matchup against yipping rule and folks it was more of the same big fish big fish that is not a fitting username for mr big fish he is not a fish at all vladimir farissay of 2668 classical but 27.50 rapid over the board chest playing against wei yee i he plays a semi-slav position is balanced that's complicated way he gets really aggressive opposite side castling in from the early opening it looked like in a way he's got a little thing going on roji one looking like he gonna play a little g4 g5 take the fight to fatasev you know what i mean knight e4 though take take and now you'll go knight e5 all right we trade i'm gonna try to kick you out like a very difficult position here for black to play because he doesn't have a lot of pawn mobility but he plays f6 he's like i'm just gonna stand up to you what are you gonna do to me ain't got nothing knight g5 knight bank to f7 wei captures but it looks like suddenly feta saves figuring things out he doesn't have a lot of pawn mobility on the queen side but he has a nice situation in the center of the board and in the future he could consider breaking in with b3 knight b6 played rook a7 and feathersay of just very calmly takes upon so what are you gonna do i'm taking a bow what are you gonna do you gonna attack me come attack me let's go pawn takes pawn takes way he plays rookie one looking to get in on the on the e file rookie 7 g3 trying to deflect the queen away from the defense of the rook and that is safe just goes here we have queen d3 and queen takes pawn wage is down two pawns has had enough resigns the game better say of our board too went 3-0 he beat everybody everybody they put in front of him he went 3-0 you might say aren't there four games you might say aren't there four games and the protest league doesn't every player in the pro chest league play four games and i will tell you just hold on a second because mikola bortnick was also unstoppable nicola bortnick played this game against jew and june this was one of the most insane games of chess i've ever seen it was a catalan it was an insane catalan it opened up early as the e-pawn walked into the black position he played king f8 he's up a piece jew and june played the move d5 and lost a piece but opened up the black king and in this position when all hope seemed lost it looks like the black king is getting mated this man nicola bortnick with pressure everywhere bishop e6 rook here he plays the only move in this position black is completely lost unless black plays the top engine move queen a6 the idea of queen 2a6 excuse me i have a i don't know what's going on but i can't seem to oh there we go there was a little glitch on my end the move queen a6 sacrifices the knight to put a rook on the d file to take back and mikola in one of the more completely ridiculous games of chess that i have seen in a long while sacrifices a piece well i mean sacrifices the safety of his king forces juan june to sacrifice a piece and she has to go for this completely nuts attack just total pandemonium on the chessboard and bishop e6 check f3 and he just closes the door on the white position and when the dust settles folks black has an extra knight black is under some pressure but watch as mikola walks his king king d8 king c8 and now he says what that's it that was the attack terrific my turn queen c6 rookie eight rook b8 both rooks in the game knight c5 queen b5 rookie two winning game over mikola bordnic from the top rope every player contributed and the team we rounded all the way back who's the big man it's really nice when your team is led by a magnus or a hikaru because when you look at games that these guys play just the same way magnus has been scoring four points every single week for the bras ikaro has been unstoppable he plays a bogo indian against jew and june she had to play mikola and then hikaru i mean the protest league is tough and you know from an early opening he got this very imbalanced and interesting position where he has a bunch of pawns on dark squares it was a very equal game but look at his dark squared blockade against white's light squared blockade right he plays f5 activates his bishop rook f8 just beautiful stuff honestly like a symphony of pieces look how much time he spent to play like 20-something moves and jew and june was doing all right hikaru was just trying to ask questions of the position she played knight e4 it was an equalage game he had a four minute time advantage he had a little bit of pressure he was definitely slightly better and he was gonna try to you know put a lot of pressure on these weaknesses his knight is just bulletproof his queen is going to come in he's gonna try to play g5 she went here and that allows rook f3 and even though she's gonna get two rooks for the queen anytime somebody asks you what's better two rooks or a queen it depends on the position and in this position not only is this pawn falling that night is coming right back to c5 and there is just nothing that black that will stop black from winning this pawn winning any of these pawns and promoting the lot of them and hikaru just marches into the white position as if he has rent to collect with his king and his queen and juan jun resigned because she's not going to be able to stop queen a4 she's not going to be able to stop the pawns and ladies and gentlemen the gotham knights of the protest league defeated the shanghai tigers i keep wanting to call them the shanghai sharks as my friend pointed out i think that's their basketball team in the chinese basketball association we defeated the shanghai tigers by a score of nine to three hikaru three fedes three mikola bortnick two out of three as the board four with one out of three but i don't give about i don't care about no one out of three that doesn't mean she underperformed she was beating wei yee crazy we won 9-3 they didn't even have to make us play a fourth game because even if they won four games it would have been nine seven nine three is the biggest victory of the entire pro chesley campaign this season and maybe ever especially against a team like china i was worried about their team they have wei jew and june they have two other 2500 rated grandmasters they are one of the only teams in the league that shows up every week with four gms we fielded two gm's two ims but i got news for you our ims deserve honorary gm titles for the way that they competed in this match the gotham knights qualify to the playoffs any team that wins three matches qualifies to the playoffs we won three out of three the indian yogis are there with us we're probably going to be the two seed entering the playoffs i think that's already determined so when there's eight teams in the quarterfinals the gotham knights are gonna probably play the seventh seed we've already locked up a minimum of 7 500 just for making it to the quarterfinals as a team that will be paid out to the players but also we're not gonna stop in the quarterfinal this is a juggernaut this is an insane squad of players we just fielded the death lineup and i'm not sure we're ever gonna stop shout out to hikaru for being just a beast winning like 10 games in a row at this point magnus holding down his team and we're gonna see which other teams make the playoffs in the next couple of weeks folks we won the match that means we are doing 50 course giveaways 5-0 i'm gonna
