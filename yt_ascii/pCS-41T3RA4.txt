i want the future to be at least as good as the recent past and yet things look much more ominous now than at any time since the early 1940s and i don't think we're going to fix it by surrender whether it's economic surrender whether it's military surrender surrender is not the way a a decent and self-confident approach is is going to be best for [music] everyone hello everyone watching and listening today i'm speaking with australian journalist and former prime minister the honorable tony abbott we met before once in australia and and this will be a followup to that we discuss australia's role on the world stage the problems facing the australian economy and culture the broader problems that face the west how the quasi cult of carbon threatens in particular the poor in the developing world why new religions propagate where traditional faith has been abdicated and the looming threat of war as china destabilizes and putin pushes forward against ukraine we also discuss our joint involvement in the alliance for responsible citizenship the ark which is a new venture grounded in london designed to put forward a positive vision of the future that everyone could in principle be on board with voluntarily so mr abbott let's start by talking about australia as a whole i mean what role do you think australia plays on the international front now like h how how do you think australia should should be conceptualized by people outside of the country well jordan i think australia is one of those wonderful countries which is big enough to be interesting and significant but not so big as to be intimidating and threatening and australia's history is such that there's really no one anywhere in the world who has a grievance against us and that's not true of so many other countries you think of the united states you think of britain you think of france you think of germany you think of italy you think of russia you think of china there are grievances that different countries have against all of those countries that all of those countries have great strengths as well but australia is one of those happy places which has been a welcoming home to migrants from all over the world yes we fought on britain's side in two world wars and we fought as america's ally in just about every conflict over the last 100 years that america's been in and yet we've managed to do that while retaining i think our global reputation as a country which is free which is fair and which wants to be a good mate to the people and the countries of the world wherever we can so that at least in principle lays open the option for countries like australia and i suppose this was true of canada for a good while too although i don't know if it is any longer to play a role in what would you say being a good faith partner in brokering peace for example and so what problems do you think australia faces at the moment what and what and h how how are the issues that are broadly besetting the west say on the cultural war front making themselves manifest in australia well the problems that every country has all the time are essentially how do we maintain our prosperity how do we maintain our security and just at the moment this is perhaps a little bit more acute than usual we've got all of the challenges which all of the western countries currently face we've got u the risk of recession we've got highish inflation we've got all of the supply chain issues which arose from the pandemic and then the conflict in ukraine then the degree of decoupling with china so we've got all of those issues we've got a particular problem with energy while we are abundantly bless jordan with with coal with gas with uranium we don't have all that much oil but because of the emissions obsession we are not using these blessings sufficiently to our own advantage so that's a particular problem that we've got we're exporting our coal and our gas to the countries that are still only too eager to get it but we're not readily using it as much as we should here and then of course being in the asia-pacific region obviously we're very conscious of china in particular china under the communist party and the challenges that that poses i keep saying that the disruption that has been caused globally by the russian attack on ukraine is small beer compared to the disruption that would be caused globally by any attack from the beijing regime on taiwan given its much greater significance in the world economy and given the effective security guarantees that the united states has always given to taiwan so so look th those constant challenges of security and prosperity are particularly acute right now you ask about the cultural issues which are afflicting the west we may be maybe 5 years behind america maybe 3 years behind the united states uh the united kingdom but we have them here too jordan our universities are are are more into brainwashing than the best that's been thought and said our schools they're nice places in the sense that they want to teach our kids to be nice to each other but i'm not sure that there's that much rigorous learning going on or as much as it should all right so let's let's dive in we we we outlined a number of potential issues there of of concern let's dive in first to what you described as the emissions obsession and so this is something that australia and canada share particularly canada is blessed on the fossil fuel front and we have vast reserves of uranium as well and we are doing everything we can at the federal level in canada to scuttle the oil and gas industry in in favor hypothetically of renewables which is a really bad idea in in a country like canada which is massive and completely in inhospitable to human life and in australia you guys have the same issues in many ways ambivalence about utilizing your natural resources but strangely enough very little compunction in sending them to china coal in particular and this strikes me as extremely peculiar given that the chinese as far as i know breathe the same atmosphere we do and if the chinese are building coal fired plants like madmen which they clearly are then what difference does it make to us in the west let's say except in terms of prosperity whether or not we use our technology to produce relatively clear clean say coal fired plants or the chinese do it in china like what in the world is the pos rationale for that as far as you're concerned well jordan i find it as mysterious as you do we are inflicting gratuitous economic damage on ourselves without doing any good to the global environment by refusing to use coal and gas in this country while exporting as much coal and gas as we can sell to others particularly china and the interesting thing is that while we are fastidious in measuring and reducing our emissions we are fastidious in making commitments to the wider world that we are determined to keep we're oblivious to the fact that emissions are going up and up because russia china and india for understandable enough reasons are making no such commitment so so this is really an act of economic self harm that we are engaged in it's a kind of virtue signaling on a national scale and i very much regret it i regard myself as a as a as a conservationist i i accept that we only have one planet i accept that if you look back over what we know to have been the history of the planet there certainly has been global warming there has been global cooling there've been hotter times there' have been colder times so climate change is real in that sense although you can argue about the contribution that mankind's carbon dioxide makes to it but certainly the efforts that we in this country are making to reduce emissions are harming us and they're not actually making any difference to global emissions and i just think that's pretty irrational well it seems to me that you could make a case that not only are they no doing no good on the global emissions front that in places like germany these idiot green policies have actually made the emission situation worse and so you know one way you could conceptualize this that sort of cuts across the political argument problem is that if the green policies that have been implemented by countries like germany fulfilled their own mandate at minimum you could say that they have some credibility so you know you could look at germany and you could think well electricity is more expensive and it's more unreliable and the germans are dependent on the russians and and other relatively autocratic states to provide their energy but at least carbon emissions have gone down but in fact in germany partly because they've had to turn to burning lig night and they shut their nuclear plants down which was an active unconscionable stupidity they're actually producing i think it's 10 times as many emissions per unit of electricity as france and far more and they're far more polluting on the energy front than they were like seven years ago so not only have they failed utterly on the economic front they're actually doing worse by their own criteria and the same thing has to be true of countries like canada and australia when you look at it globally if we export our resources to china and they do a relatively bad job of generating electricity especially given the immense corruption in countries like that why in the world wouldn't we do that in the west where we could do it you know with a certain degree of let's call it finesse and so i cannot see that there's something wrong with my reasoning when i walk through the problem in that sense and so what do you think about that is is there something that i'm missing say in relationship to germany or is this is foolish as it appears to be well jordan i think this is monumental folly i think it is self-destructive folly but i think what we are dealing with here is something more akin to a new religion than ordinary considerations of rational self-interest and even ordinary stock standard idealism as i said i'm all in favor of doing what we can to protect the planet but i'm not in favor of doing things which harm us and don't help the planet and plainly that's what's going on right now one of the many reasons why i think there's a religious dimension to all of this a kind of a almost like a cultish dimension to all of this is that the same people who are most insistent on the urgency of emissions reduction are normally deeply hostile to the only form of emissions free 24/7 bas power namely nuclear now if it really is absolutely essential that we move rapidly to a zero emissions world and if we do want at the same time to maintain our standards of living there's really only one way to go and that's nuclear which is proven reliable safe it may well be somewhat more expensive at this time than alternative certainly than coal and gas and oil but we know it works and we know it's emissions free we know that france has been generating something like 70% of its electricity from nuclear for the best part of 40 or 50 years they haven't had any significant accidents so why not do something like this in other countries if we really do think that that emissions are as important as all that the the the religious cult idea so i think i want to pick up two streams of thought there i'm also puzzled like you with regard to attempting to conceptualize the opposition to nuclear power because the the bitter pill we're asked to swallow constantly is that climate change in the caused by excessive carbon dioxide production poses an existential threat to mankind and so that's the ultimate shth let's say with regard to the radicals on the left or people who are utilizing radical left ideas for their own nefarious purposes let's say and if that is the case then and we're willing to contemplate tactics like geoengineering because i know the biden administration for example is toying with the idea of blotting out the sun like mr burns in the simpsons and if we're willing to go to that extreme or even to look into going to that extreme then why in the world wouldn't we turn to nuclear and the answer has to be as far as i'm can tell tell and tell me if what you think about this is that there's actually an anti-industrial ism and an anti-humanism at the basis of the climate apocalypse claims and so the anti-humanism is something it's often expressed in the form of the claim that there are too many people on the planet you know and that we could only and you hear more extreme versions of this where the claim is well we could really only tolerate in an ecologically sustainable manner a population of about 500 million which is a big problem given that there's 8 billion people and we'd have to figure out what to do with all those excess bodies and that even if we did have 500 million those people would have to live you know basically at a subsistence level so that we wouldn't be scraping the surface of the planet too with too much diligence okay and so i have a lot of problems with that standpoint not least because there's an element of it that's genocidal and then there's a kind of naive rousan anti-industrial ism that seems to go along with that which is part and parcel of the claim that all human activity is somehow pathological and that we're violating some essential state of nature and then that all that mess because that's a mess also is allied with something that i think is even darker which is this attempt by the hypothetically a religious radicals on the environmental front to reduce the entire panoply of human problems to one issue and that's of carbon dioxide and then to claim for themselves an elevated moral virtue that goes along with well opposing carbon dioxide at all costs so to me that's you know one of the commandments is that you're not to use the lord's name in vain and that commandment means that you shouldn't claim divine virtue or even moral virtue when you're actually acting in a manner that's only benefiting yourself and i see that as the cardinal sin of this new religion which is all morality can be reduced to the claim that i'm a good person because i oppose carbon dioxide and to hell with the cost and i'll add one more thing to that which and which is that from what i've been able to understand if you can help the world's poor raise their average income on the gdp with gdp as a measurement to about $5,000 a year which pops them out of basic subsistence then they start to be able to take a longer term view of their future and their children's future and to attend to environmental issues spontaneously so my sense is that we could we could have a planet that was full of thriving people with a large population if people were rich enough and that would mean that they would have to have access to cheap energy and if we did that globally then everyone would spontaneously start to evince concern for the environment so we could have like a flourishing population and a planet that works and so what the hell is wrong with that why isn't that a good plan well well nothing's wrong with that jordan it's a very sensible plan and if you want to look at environmental devastation the places where you will find environmental devastation are the poorer countries where they can't look after their forests they can't look after their paddocks and fields where they can't afford to worry about the conservation of native animals it's really only the better off countries where we can take all these things seriously because in the other countries they're embarked in a constant struggle just to stay alive and this is why as you say if if we want a better environment and if over time we want the world's population to stabilize and perhaps even reduce a little if you look at what has already happened in many of the more developed countries let's do what we can through trade and through the encouragement of better governance let's do what we can through the encouragement of decent education and and and the liberation of minorities let's do what we can to try to bring what are currently the most impoverished countries up to as you say a better level of life i mean you're right once the country gets up to about $5,000 us per person per year in in national income things start to transform and if you look at some of the countries of africa which have got to this level they are very very different countries in in a host of ways to what they were just a couple of decades back the october 15th tax deadline has just passed i know many of you might be dreading the stress of filing your taxes f filing your taxes can be a long

tax network usa.com peterson today right well i know that you have recently agreed to participate in this alliance for responsible citizenship conference and movement that we organizing in in london in in october and i mean part of our vision on the energy and environment front well it's it's two-dimensional the first proposition is stemming off of what we've already discussed is that we don't have the moral right to sacrifice the world's poor either in the west or in the developing world to our to our narrow green agenda especially because it's not going to work anyways and it puts all these people at risk and so you see this this very strange conundrum right because the left in principle historically has been the voice of the oppressed in the working class and a particularly let's say strong voice for the poor but when you see now what's happening that that the the radical environmentalist types in particular seem to be willing to sacrifice the world's poor at the drop of a hat to not make any progress whatsoever on the planetary salvation front right like i said it would be different if they could point to any what successes whatsoever on the alternate energy front that have actually produced a positive outcome instead you see germany you see the uk where energy prices are much more expensive than they were before and much more unreliable so how do you understand and this is maybe where we could start touching on issues broader issues of faith you know you characterized this anti-industrial environmentalist movement as a religious enterprise it's like how do you and you are you know you've been involved in the political game for a long time how do you understand the fact that these policies have st have started to become dogmatic doctrine and that they're being pushed so hard you know across the political spectrum the tories in the uk are worse on the net zero front than the lefties or at least as bad so how do you understand how this happened given it's that it's so preposterous well that's a very good question jordan and let me just give you one little anecdote which i think might be telling the other week in london i went to the famous farm street jesuit church we got to the prayers of the faithful and one of the prayers of the faithful was about the rapid decarbonization of our society now don't normally stand up in church and object and i wasn't going to break the habit of a lifetime on this particular day but i did suddenly decide well buger it i went online found the parish website and sent a note to whoever was the parish recipient of this thing saying why the hell are you doing this the other day father dominic sent a response to me saying that we have a a moral obligation to reduce our emissions as quickly as possible to which i said well sure don't we also have a moral obligation to try to ensure that pe poor people in rich countries and and poor countries more generally have access to the affordable energy that they need in order to have a decent life now i don't expect to get a response from father dominic or anyone else from the farm street jesuit church but i do think that what we're seeing here is one of the many byproducts of the decline of what i would regard as a more substantial faith because we human beings tend to be creatures of faith maybe it's because we need faith maybe it's because there's just something out there drawing us to faith if if if we don't have faith in our countries if we don't have faith in our god if we don't have faith in the religions that have stood the test of time we'll find new things to have faith in and even in the heart of catholicism we now have this green thing which i think is strange unsettling fundamentally foreign and it can lead nowhere good so i've been thinking about this issue of needing faith for a very long time you know and the the classic objection of the rationalist materialists i' say the atheist rationalist materialists is that you shouldn't have faith in anything for which there isn't proof and you know there's a certain amount of you can give a certain amount of credence to that viewpoint because it helps protect you against believing evidently counterproductive ive and foolish things but i think the idea that you can't have faith or that you don't have to have faith in anything that isn't factual is misguided and here's why so tell me what you think about this well the problem with human beings or a problem with human beings is that we're fundamentally bounded by our ignorance and so for example if you embark on a marriage you have to take a vow and in principle it's an unbreakable vow and the reason you do that is because you have to jump with both feet with your partner into a kind of abyss and the reason you have to do that is because what the hell do you know you don't know what's going to happen to you in your life and so you take this person and you say as a show of good faith we're going to bind ourselves together predicated on the assumption that we'll be able to handle what comes at us better as a honestly communicating and loving couple than we could do with sequential relationships or alone now we don't know if that's true but we're going to spend our whole life giving it our best shot okay well that's an act of faith because you don't have the evidence for what's going to happen in your life in front of you right okay you do the same thing when you take a new job right whenever you make an important foray you have to say i believe this could work if i abide by this particular set of principles and that's an act of faith okay so that's ineradicable then you know you said there's something drawing us to faith and so this is how it looks as far as i can tell that first of all some things have to be more important than others because if they're not you can't do anything and the reason for that is that if you're going to do something you have to do that thing instead of all the other things you might have done or instead of nothing so you have to prioritize and as soon as you prioritize you have a hierarchy of value and that means that if your hierarchy of value is internally consistent there has to be something at the top of it now the the classic judeo-christian answer to that conundrum was that something like truth and love the spirit of truth and love should at the pinnacle and that should be expressed in honest discourse for example that's part of the worship of the word and and now if nothing is put at the top then well then there's nothing at the top and you have disunity and confusion and so there's there's no there the only alternative to organizing your perceptions and your actions in a hierarchical manner with something at the top is confusion and disunity there's no third choice so i think that's what draws us to faith is that we're drawn to integrate our perceptions and our actions under a single scheme and that helps stabilize us psychologically because then we're not confused and hopeless but it also unites us socially because you know you and i for example right now we can sit and engage in civil discourse because we've agreed on a unifying framework right we're going to talk for 90 minutes we're not going to play any tricks on each other and we're going to see how that goes and that means now we can cooperate and compete in a peaceful manner okay so i don't see any of i don't see that any of that is replaceable now you know you pointed out that if we don't have faith in one thing we're either going to have faith in nothing or in something else and i it does seem to me to be the case that you know gia the earth mother has risen up as an alternative to let's say yahwa and the and the classic and the classic uniting god of the west and that doesn't seem to me to be a reasonable replacement well i i agree with you jordan and look the things that really matter can't be proven certainly they can't be proven in the way that a mathematical formula or some scientific experiment can be can be proven we can't prove that the people close to us really love us they can't prove that they are really loved by us we have to take all this stuff on trust and similarly we absolutely need an important purpose to our lives which is above simple survival simple pleasure just the basic satisfactions that an animal might seek we need to have a purpose and whether the purpose is looking after our loved ones whether the purpose is being very good at a at a necessary but quite possibly simple job that we do as well as we can whether the purpose is is love and respect for the god that we think is our creator every single human being to live well needs a sense of purpose to his or her life once upon a time it was i suppose civic mind ess in the case of some it was family commitment in the case of others it was a sense of the divine in the in the case of still more but all of those things are much weaker today across the west than they were a generation or two back but because we are faith focused people we will seek other things and it might be money it might be pleasure henis in all its forms or we might find some alternative a kind of green cult if you like or a climate cult if you like saving the planet not from the devil but saving the planet from a climate apocalypse that might fill that gap now again i say i think all sensible people should be conservation minded i don't want to see beautiful buildings demolished readily i do not want to see our flora and faa devastated i take infinite satisfaction and delight in the waves rolling in at manley beach when i get down there every a morning on my longboard i love to see the dolphins in the distance and occasionally the spout of a whale magnificent absolutely magnificent but you can't worship that and certainly this idea that we should fixate on man's contribution to carbon dioxide emissions i i just think is is odd all right so let's let's walk through this a little bit more conceptually so so about 40 years ago 50 years ago psychologists started to analyze the manner in which the way people describe themselves aggregates and they were looking at the underlying statistical structure of self-descriptive language so here was the idea we're going to study personality personality is reflected in language if we could analyze the statistical structure of language we might be able to understand something more about personality and so psychologists did this they they they aggregated great bodies of descriptive phrases and sentences and adjectives and found out by statistical analysis kind of an early application of ai by the way that temperament had five dimensions extroversion neuroticism agreeableness conscientiousness and openness now neuroticism is the is the dimension on which all the negative emotions aggregate so if you're more sensitive to anxiety you're more sensitive to pain and frustration and disappointment and guilt and that's like a baseline sensitivity to life's challenges and so the higher in neuroticism you are the more units of physiological preparation you undertake per unit of stress right and it's kind of a guess okay now one of the things psychologists discovered at the same time was that all of the emotions associated with attention to the to the narrow self we're indistinguishable from negative emotion so self-consciousness is actually a facet of neuroticism and so to the degree that you focus on yourself this is quite a stellar discovery to the degree that you think about yourself that you're concerned about yourself narrowly you are simultaneously possessed by pain and anxiety right now you kind of know that because if you're out on stage and you're addressing a crowd and you get self-conscious it's very uncomfortable you blush you lose your place you stumble the same thing happens to musicians if they're performing and so self-consciousness is actually a disruption of the natural flow of events okay now when people are looking for something that unites them let's say and that calls to them they tend to look for superordinate identities that are outside the self so you could say well you could find meaning in an intimate relationship in with your family with your local community with your state with your nation and then maybe there's something upon which the integrity of nations itself rests i think that's the word in the judeo-christian tradition by the way and so you nest your identity in these superordinate elements and that's also an element of faith and that takes you well the benefit on the hope side you know you said people have to have something to strive for if you don't nest your identity in these superordinate social organizations then you end up impulsive and hedonistic and self-focused and that makes you hopeless and miserable correct so that seems to be a bad solution okay okay so so all right all right so we're we're in agreement on that so okay so let me ask you something more specific then you know you are very intelligent person you had you you won a road scholarship that's a very difficult thing to manage you studied a at oxford and yet and i'm saying this as devil's advocate you're also you're you're also a man of traditional faith and so i might say well why how is it that you have been able to balance your intellect which tends you know the intellect tends to have this corrosive rational doubtful element that can demolish traditional faith for example which is certainly something that's happened to many people and happen more broadly culturally why did your faith remain for you a central element of your being and how have you reconciled that intellectually well this might sound a bit odd jordan but i i think that humility is incredibly important to a successful life i i mean you've got to in a sense lose yourself to find yourself you've got to in a sense forget yourself to fully flourish and i i guess one of the things that i'm very conscious of is that i don't have all the answers i don't have all the experience i don't regard myself as morally or intellectually superior to my for to my forefathers and i might have personal doubts but i think it's important to be sufficiently immersed in the tradition at least to the at least to the point where you respect it and you allow it to work it's it's magic on you and look uh you know my personal faith waxes and wanes one of the many reasons why i never further pursued something that i did for a couple of years namely the catholic priesthood is because i didn't think i had enough of a personal relationship with with our lord and master jesus christ to be able to communicate that toh to people and persuade people that they too could have it but nevertheless the fact that my faith was insufficient to move mountains doesn't mean that i don't respect it it doesn't mean that i don't strive after it and it doesn't mean that such that i have doesn't sustain me i mean the bible is the root of all wisdom inspiration and spiritual nourishment the hallow app

talked about the role of of moral and intellectual humility on that front so okay so so i've been reading i've been writing about the book of exodus and i conducted a seminar with a variety of people people on that book i was reading this section the other day where the burning bush appears to moses and it's it's really a compelling section e because at that point moses is outside of egypt so he's no longer concerned with the tyranny or the pharoh or his strange heritage he's gone off to this place called midia mid is mid midia anyways to a foreign country it's midia he's out with the midianites he's married a woman there he's taking care of his father-in-law's flocks they respect him he's got himself a life you know and it's kind of hassle-free and he's wandering around near near mount si interestingly enough when something attracts his attention right and he decides to turn away from his path and to go investigate and so to me what that story is reflecting is the fact that in our lives we'll be in a relatively comfortable position position and something will beckon to us that we can decide to investigate and if we decide to investigate that will well god only knows what'll happen and that's what happens to moses he goes off the beaten path he he goes to investigate the burning bush and the burning bush is a symbol of life and transformation at the same time right because fire is a transformative element so he goes to investigate being that's life and becoming that's transformation and as he investigates it more deeply he finds that he starts to walk on sacred ground and god tells him he has to take his shoes off that's humility right and so and then as he investigates even more deeply the god of the old testament speaks to him and says that it's the same voice that called to jacob and isaac and abraham and so this seems relevant to the issue of respect for tradition and so you could imagine imagine that there's this spirit that unites the great acts of history right it's all a manifestation of the same proper orientation towards what's highest that's represented in that story as the spirit of yahwah and that part of what you do if you're called upon to be a leader which is of course the next thing that happens to moses is that you bow down and have respect to that guiding spiritual principle that's operated over the entire corpor purp of history and so you seem to be making illusions to something like that when you said that for some reason you had a kind of intellectual or moral humility now why did you have that given the fact that you could have been you could have been inordinately proud of your own intellect i mean it was of stellar quality and you were definitely rewarded for it so how do you think that humility developed and why do you think people who are listening should give it some credence well jordan that wonderful story that you've just so well developed for us is one of the great civilizational stories of our culture and of our history and part of the modern tragedy is that we know so much and yet we know so little about the things that have really formed and shaped us as as peoples and there's there's almost an amnesia now about the bible stories whether it's old testament or new testament there's an indifference to to the great history whether it's the greeks the romans the history of of of the development of england and so on and and how the great ideas spread from these places throughout much of the world there's just this ignorance mixed with scorn which i think is so sad i mean we can know all about artificial intelligence but if you don't know anything about the culture and the civilization which has made this possible you are intellectually impoverished however clever you might be in so many areas now now this is this is part of our part of our problem now i i guess i was blessed if you like by this sense of respect verging on reverence for our history and for our traditions when i was very young my mother would probably on a weekly basis bring me home the now almost forgotten but back in the 1960s and70s very well known ladybird books which popularized great historical stories mostly from british history i hasten to add but you know there was alexander the great and julius caesar and plato and aristotle and all these as well in there and i just soaked it all up and so i guess from a very young age i i i wasn't scornful of these things i was appreciative of these things i wasn't rejecting of these things i was respectful of these things and i guess that's what sustained me for better or for worse all the way through all right so so that's very interesting observation so you were exposed to biographical accounts of greatness when you were a kid and those affected you now i think and i was and i was lucky i was lucky jordan as a as a as a youngster i had nuns teaching me when i was in in infant school i had jesuits who were presiding over my primary and secondary education these were the days before the western church had been afflicted to the extent it ultimately was by i guess the religious self-doubt u that seems to have been associated with elements of the second vatican council these were impressive human beings whatever foibles and faults they may have had they were impressive human beings certainly they immensely impressed and helped me as a youngster and i've been lucky to carry all that throughout my life thus far i have had wonderful exemplars of of courage of faith of inspiration of insight and that's brought me along carried me in its wake and my challenge is to be worthy of this great benefaction that i had right right right well you you also said that your mother brought you these stories and that's kind of interesting psychologically and symbolically because what that means in a sense is that your mother brought you tales of the great men of the past which indicated that your mother that so the primary feminine influence in your life was someone who believed that that greatness of spirit actually existed now you could imagine the counterpart right because because you could have had a mother or female teachers who were bitterly resentful about the patriarchal oppression of the past who believed that every heroic figure was nothing other than a patriarchal oppressor and that was anti- masculine in the most fundamental sense in that manner now you know you see this there's lots of women and this is increasingly true and i think it's increasingly a consequence of familial breakdown there's no shortage of women who have never had a positive relationship with anyone masculine in their whole life you know now i talked to this leftist scholar naomi wolf a while back on my podcast you know and and she's she wrote the beauty myth and she's been a pretty powerful voice on the left on the pro patriarchal oppression front right i mean that's a narrative she buys but you know she was raped when she was 11 and then she had a pretty dismal experience with someone who was supposed to mentor her in university and it left her fractured and with a permanent animus against men you know and and you can see that sort of thing spiring out of control but your mother had respect for these historical figures what was the relationship between your mother and your father like on the personal front look you know i i don't clim to have seen every intimate moment so to speak but my mom and dad had a long and i think pretty successful marriage and they raised four kids who have turned out to be okay all of us respected well my mom's still alive uh all of us respected our parents very much and have done our best to honor them but look i absolutely ely accept jordan that again to use a phrase that the jesuits used to use back in the day in a sense we are all the product of those who have loved us or failed to love us and i guess if if you've come from a from an affirming and supportive intellectually curious capable family you are more likely to turn out with a certain set of attitudes than if the opposite has been the case and yeah i can fully understand why someone whose experience of of others has been bitter how they they might be less optimistic and outgoing but if you believe as i do that most people most of the time are basically good and if you think as i do that the challenge is every day to try to come closer to being your best self well that's that's a good way to live your life because even if it's not perfect at least you won't be concerned with bitterness yeah well that that's something that can stop the tragedy from degenerating into hell so that's at least a it's least a door stop against the catastrophe of life you know i' i've thought that through a lot partly as a consequence of working as a clinician you know i've and i've seen people in very dire situations and it's certainly the case that if jik tragedies come to visit you in life you can make the situation a hell of a lot worse by becoming bitter and resentful you know and you could point to the catastrophes and say look i have every reason to be bitter and resentful and the proper response to that is well be that as it may and you could well be right if you go down that road tempted towards it by the weight of your suffering all that will do is make your suffering much worse and universalize it yeah see that's that's what the book of job concentrates on so in such an interesting manner because job has absolutely every reason to lift his middle finger towards the sky and to curse god i mean god literally bets with satan that satan can't take job out you know and that's that's a pretty rough situation right and but i think the moral of the story is something like no matter what happens to you in your life and this is a this is a of a thing to say you know no matter what happens to you in your life no matter how deep the degradation and the suffering you are called upon to maintain faith in the essential goodness of being and to orient yourself upward you know and that's that's a hell of a thing to ask of people butre the alternative seems to be degeneration into a kind of hopeless and bitter misery exactly right and and one of the books that i read as a youngster was victor frankl's famous book from death camp to existentialism now i didn't know too much still don't know too much about the existentialism but i do know that he survived that by virtue of focusing on the love he had for his wife the love he had for his family because if you have a why as he kept saying you can bear any how the tragedy is that the modern world while having less and less in the way of objective difficulties has less and less of the why that will eni us to endure the how so you talked about humility as a precondition for your development of a certain kind of respect for the accomplishments of the past and you know we we could also talk about so so one of the one of what something i've learned about the religious enterprise is that the emphasis on virtues like humility is allied with a sense that that has to be practiced so the practice of faith in that regard is to actually practice to to to consciously adopt an attitude let's say of humility and humility might be in principle you know i still have something to learn i could learn to listen better i could learn to attend better to the treasures of the past i'm an ignorant creature i should conduct myself in that manner i should seek wisdom and and there are all sorts of counter positions that the full play of the rational mind can produce that will fight fight against that impulse but it is something you can practice and the same thing seems to apply to let's say an attitude of gratitude that and and this is also the part of the problem with the idea that of you the fact that you of the idea that you could orient yourself by mere facts like if you look at the conditions of life especially when things are not going well for you you could easily proclaim like the anti-natalist proclaimed that life is so bloody miserable in its essence that it would be better if it didn't exist at all that's mephistophiles by the way in fs in in girth is faou right is the whole enterprise should just be scrapped because the suffering is just too much well the alternative to that is to attempt to practice finding what's good i suppose even in the darkest spots you know like when my wife a while back my wife was afflicted with with what she had been told would be a terminal cancer and in fact the cancer that she had had only been reported by 200 people and every single one of them died within 10 months so it was pretty damn dismal you know and i watched her nearly die daily for like nine months it was rough and then she had surgical complications that you know the surgery probably it was certainly one of the factors that saved her life but it also put her in great peril you know and she what did she do to cope with that well she turned to the things that she had in her life that were positive right she really opened herself up for example to the love of her children in a way that even though she had been a very good mother and had a very close relationship with her kids she found a dimension of love of of that maternal love that was fathomless i would say and that really helped her you know and she also decided when her father her father had to cope with the long-term neurological degeneration of his wife she had prefrontal dementia and she deteriorated from the age of about 55 to about 70 you know in the in the way that neurological diseases take you out piece by piece and he did that he was stellar he took care of her like a champ and like he was a real man about town but he's he just reoriented himself in a selfless manner that was something to behold and he was also willing to accept help and that's another thing that happened to tammy when she was ill is that she abandoned a lot of her pretensions and she allowed people into her life to support her and that was also part of that practice of being grateful even even under dreadful circumstances and jordan this is where suffering is not ever something that we should go out and seek but if suffering finds us if we if we react rightly to it it it is in its own way or it can be at least in its own way ennobling and u i'm thinking of a of a good friend of mine whose wife ultimately died of dementia for four or five years she didn't know him but he went every day even so and you could say well why did he bother well just in case she did know and because that was the duty of a husband for a wife in extremis and we can say well let's try to you know baptize the suffering let's try to make the most of this or we can say it's all too hard and we can euthanase people we can institutionalize people and and i just think it's important that we choose the better way as as far as we humanly can we should choose the better way and again if we go back to the to the teachings of of holy mother church i mean it's best if you get something out of the sacraments but even if you don't you should keep going because you just never know and maybe even if you don't think you're getting anything out of it you might actually be getting something out of it which is is beyond your comprehension but is nevertheless making a difference well you know when when i was a kid 13 or so and starting to turn away from the protestant church church that my mother in particular was part of we didn't have a particularly religious home but she went to church every sunday and she liked to sing and she like the community and i got pretty skeptical about probably about my emerging understanding of the conflict hypothetical conflict between say evolutionary views of the origin of man and the views that were being put forth in the church and decided that it was appropriate for me ethically to stop going which caused my mother a certain amount of distress now part of my cynicism at that time i suppose was the kind of standard petty observation of weekend about the criticism of weekend christians right people go to church for an hour a week and they proclaim their allegiance to this virtuous pathway and then they go back out into the world and do exactly what they were going to do anyways and you know there's some truth to that i suppose in that everyone can be hypocritical but that was also true of me and i had an insufficient understanding of that at the time but i would also say and this is to your point about what the practice might be doing for you even if you don't understand it is that you know even an hour badly spent contemplating your own inadequacies let's say in the form of sin and trying to aim upward seems to be an improvement over never doing it all at all for even a minute and which is seems to be the alternative right because once you scrap the church and this is the sort of thing that people like richard dawkins and the atheist types would have us do will'll just dispense with all that and his plan was that we'd all become enlightenment rationalists but we tend to degenerate into polytheistic pagans instead and then we don't even give a second's thought to anything approximating a higher moral endeavor and and then these weird quasi religions grip us and pull us down exactly right look you know i do not claim to be a particularly virtuous person and i certainly do not put myself on any kind of a pedestal but i am confident not that faith makes us good but that faith makes us better and i am sure that i would be even worse but for the fact that u i had a wonderful early beginning and even now pretty imperfectly i try to practice it all so when you were when you were the leader of the opposition that was 2009 to 2013 and then you were prime minister for two years now you you said that you didn't regard yourself as a sufficiently developed person on the moral front let's say to to enter the priesthood you you you studied as a catholic seminarian and so you you took the devil's route into politics let's say i saw the do you yeah you saw the dark okay well so so tell me about your experiences as the leader of the opposition and as prim minister i mean you got to see how things operated at the highest level both nationally and internationally and so what did you learn about people and what did you learn about the kind of machinations that go on at the highest politic ical levels and i'm i'm also curious about your experiences on the international front like with organizations like the world economic forum and so forth so what what conclusions did you derive from this time that you spent so integrally involved in the political landscape well i i think the important thing is to say what you mean and do what you say and it doesn't matter whether you're the local cobbler or the local school teacher or a professor of law or indeed the leader of a country i just think you've got to say what you mean and do what you say and there were some leaders that i interacted with who i thought were brilliant and capable but i never really sensed that they were being fed income with me and there were others who were probably less brilliant uh in some ways but i got the impression that they were being straight with me and always that's the test can you be straight with someone and do you think that person is being being straight with you and and i guess knowing that the world is made up of all sorts of different people some of whom will try to be helpful some of whom will not try to be helpful you've got to try to to conduct yourself in such a way that the people whose welfare it is your duty to advance are as best as you can manage it having their their their wellbeing advanced so as opposition leader it was my job to try to work out what the then government was doing wrong and what i might do that would make it less wrong or perhaps even more right and then in government it was my job to try to ensure that to the extent government can it's it's making bad situations better making good situations better knowing that you're never going to make it all right there are some things which you probably can't even begin to improve so you've got to know what's within the purview of government and what's not really and it and it's a question i suppose of applying your insights and your judgment hopefully i guess helped by such character as you've managed to develop over the years in in in ways which make sense and make a difference and look i can talk about different different policies but in the end the job of everyone in public life is first to do no harm and then to try to respond intelligently to to the exigencies of the day all the time hoping to nudge things in a better direction as best you can tell that's the duty of everyone in public life how how would you analyze the narrow and broader success of your attempts to play a straight game when you were prime minister i mean you're you're you you ran into a lot of opposition and and and your faith ran into a lot of opposition as well and you know a cynic might look at your record and say well if you would have being a little more instrumental in your tactics a little more mellan let's say you might not have run into so much difficulty in opposition i'm not necessarily saying that's the case i'm asking in retrospect know you attempted to play a straight game in some ways i think you were a man out of time you you you know what i mean is that your the qualities that you brought to the position weren't necessarily the ones that were being demanded loudly and publicly at the time you know and your catholicism for example is certainly something that exists in opposition to the new environmentalist ethos arguably so at least and so so do do you think that attempting to play a straight game worked for you and if so how and do you think that politics tends to attract people who are more likely to play a crooked game than other modes of interacting with the world business art culture well jordan i think it would be generally thought or conceded that i was a a very ive leader of the opposition in that i brought my side of politics back into government in record time now i did that by i suppose ruthlessly focusing on the mistakes of the then government and coming up with what i thought were feasible and principled and effective ways of of of improving that now i got into government and it would generally be thought that i was less effective as a prime minister and i guess the fact that my own party replac me after two years would would provide a certain validation to that but nevertheless i did my best toh try to temper the emissions obsession i did my best to stop the border protection disaster and i think pretty much completely succeeded in that i did my best to get taxes down in fact abolished a couple of taxes big taxes the carbon tax and the mining tax did my best to reduce the regulatory burden did my best to honor and respect the traditions and the institutions which had stood the test of time now now because i was probably against the zeitgeist in a way that most contemporary politic itions are not i did attract a kind of visceral dislike including from people inside my own party who were happy enough when i was a successful leader of the opposition to put up with this more traditional conservative approach to things but decided once we were in government that they they could do better but look it it's just it's just one of those things i mean so why do you think why do you think you were so so like universally claimed as effective as leader of the opposition and that that was then flipped on its head to some degree when you became prime minister when you became the prime minister itself right it doesn't exactly stand to reason so what do you think happened well well jordan the leader of the opposition has effectively one job to get his team into government the leader of a government has many jobs you you've got to try to ensure that everything which is the per in the purview of government is is handled as well as it can so so running a government is much harder than leading an opposition it is and it's particularly difficult at the moment given that we are more fragmented and more polarized in the west than we have been for a long long time and i suppose i i i think it was more difficult as a conservative because there's a sense in which you're against the zeitgeist you're out of sympathy with the temper of the times but rather than conform yourself to the so-called signs of the times i think the important thing is to push on with what you think is right and do your best to be good enough to overcome the the difficulties of of of these times and not withstanding the fact that i was only there for two years i think it was probably the most successful two years of the nine years of the recent coalition government in this country so you know i talked to bb netanyahu about issues that were similar to this and he made himself dreadfully unpopular at one point in his political career by pursuing a round of radical uh measures aimed at transforming israel economically and as far as i can tell those worked but they took about 10 years to bear fruit and he was sort of in the political wilderness that entire time but he certainly came back with a vengeance and so one of the things i'm curious about is you know are you pleased about the fact that you stuck to your guns and if so why given the defeat on the electoral front and also what did you learn le from suffer from and benefit from as a consequence of being attacked in the manner that you were one of one of the phrases i think i used on the night i was ejected from the parliament jordan is that it's better to be a fighter than a quitter and if you're not prepared to lose in a good cause you're not really prepared to fight for a good cause and and and so look i'm i'm pleased that i did try to resist the emissions obsession i did try to get the government less burdensome on people's lives i i did try to ensure that our country had a degree of integrity in its borders i did try to ensure that our country was a was a was an effective and valuable ally to to our friends and and look there are a few things that i guess i might have done differently everyone makes mistakes but but fundamentally i think what i was trying to do was good and proper could i have been more amoliant from time to time with colleagues of course could i have lavished a little more time on some people sure might i have expressed myself better in different circumstances well absolutely i've done plenty of dodgy interviews over the years who hasn't but but i think what i think i think the the project if you like the purpose if you like was was good and right and i'd do it again in a heartbeat what and what made you prepared to lose do you think well in the in the end it's it's about trying to make a difference and if you want to make a difference you've got to strive for it and if you're prepared to sacrifice that would you are striving for in order to win it's not about the cause it's about it's about you and this is the problem in our public life right now too many people seem to be about preferment promotion it's it's about them it's not about the country it's not about the cause they would rather stay in office than make a difference yeah it's a very narrow it's a very narrow conception of self i mean one of the problems with so if you look at the life outcomes of psychopaths and psychopaths are particularly interesting a because they're they're completely self-interested in this in the narrowly selfish sense but one of the interesting things about psychopaths is they betray their future selves just as badly as they betray other people so like a psychopath will take momentary gratification whenever he can get it and the problem with that is that there's always a price to be paid and so psychopaths are completely incapable of learning from experience and they're much more likely to end up in prison and the reason for that is that that impulsive narrow focus on the demands of the self actually turns out to be a very very bad medium to long-term strategy even if you're thinking selfishly right because you're not conceptualizing how you're going to be interacted with by people over for any span of time it's all about now you know and when we talk about the power mongerer types being selfish it isn't just that they're selfish it's that they're stupidly and narrowly selfish in a manner that can't sustain itself yeah one of the things that i often used to say to myself was no unnecessary enemies now there are some necessary enemies because if you want to do something that you really believe is right for the country and others oppose it they are going to be your enemies and you just can't avoid that but but let's not gratuitously offend people because we can i mean that's the mark of the bully it's not the mark of someone who has at least tried to be a statesman yeah yeah well no unnecessary enemies that's sort of like the doctrine of minimal necessary force oh it's a good doctrine let's turn our attention if you don't mind to the international landscape and so you have given a lot of thought for example to the issue of china i'm not a big fan of the ccp not least because they support north korea and i would say that any state that supports north korea is let's call them questionable on the moral front to say the least and so and you guys in australia you have to deal with china in a way that's even more immediate and threatening and promising than than than say those of us who are a little bit more distant and so what do you see looming on the international front visa china their economy doesn't seem to be very stable they seem to be degenerating into a very comprehensive surveillance state tyranny the our hope in the west that increasing material wealth would liberalize china doesn't seem to be bearing fruit although you know the chinese aren't starving and there there's something to be said for that and we've had a lot of cheap goods as a consequence so what how do you how do you conceptualize china the west's proper relationship with china what what are your views in that domain well i think it was the the current american secretary of state blinken who said that we would cooperate where we can we will compete where we should and confront where we must i think that was the formula he used and i actually thought that was quite a good formula in my time when mh370 disappeared into the wast of the indian ocean with 240 people on board of whom about 150 were chinese nationals australia put everything we had into that search because because that was the right thing to do and i think the chinese government appreciated that by the same token when china declared unilaterally air defense identification zones over parts of the east and south china seas we flew military jets through that there because again that was the right thing to do when china was trying to create this asia infrastructure investment bank against the wishes of both america and japan our very good friends and allies we were prepared to join this although we insisted on changes to the governance structure because we wanted it to reflect the kind of governance structures that global bodies typically had rather than being simply a proxy for the communist government in beijing so so look i think in my time we did pretty well we successfully secured the first free trade deal between china and a g20 country but prior to 2015 i think it was still possible to be optimistic about china and to think that even under the ccp economic modernization was going ultimately to lead to a degree of political liberalization and that over the the dec ades there would be some kind of of of convergence if you like unfortunately as we discovered in the co period if there was any convergence taking place we were getting more like communist china than they were getting like the liberal like the liberal west so so my my attitude to china and to the ccp i think was fair enough overoptimistic perhaps but it was fair enough back then my my view today is is is quite different china is increasingly oppressing its own citizens it has crushed the freedom of hong kong one of the world's great cities it's being monstrous towards its weager its own weager citizens it's bullying and threatening all its neighbors and it's now particularly focused on on taking taiwan by force if necessary now now i i think that if the beijing regime believes that it will be 1.4 billion chinese against 24 million taiwanese at some point in the near future they will strike and i just think it would be horrific for 24 million taiwanese to have their lives surrendered into the hands of a brutal dictatorship and while no one wants conflict i think it is important for free countries like australia to join with our partners and allies such as the united states such as japan such as the united kingdom to say very clearly to beijing there will be the most severe consequences if you try to alter the status quo by force across the taiwan straits as i said earlier jordan the ukraine war has been a catastrophe but it would be any war over taiwan would would be several orders of magnitude greater and i think we have to do everything we can to deter that but i think strength is much more likely to deter than weakness and so you seem to be quite concerned about the probability of chinese assault on taiwan and so you know in my darker moments i think well if i was running the ccp a little distraction to take my citizens attention away from the catastrophes on the domestic economic front might be quite welcome there's nothing that unites a fractious population more than a targeted enemy it's pretty easy thing to use propaganda to to you know to agitate for a vision of a unified china as it should be and so it would be a lovely distraction and so and you said you know you you take a peace through strength approach let's say and you talked a little bit you you made some illusion a little bit to deterring china like what do you think that the west could do on the deterrence front that wouldn't increase the probability of a cataclysmic interchange between the west and china see this the terrifying thing about china is that they're likely more willing to sacrifice their citizens than we are right and god only knows what they'd price they'd be willing to pay to to invade taiwan for example especially if that gave them a purchase on power for another five years so that's a very hard enemy to deal with right because if they'll light themselves on fire to singe you they're that's a pretty difficult thing to contend with i i i i take your point jordan and i take your point and i and i i particularly take your point that a dictatorship in trouble is a more more unpredictable and dangerous dictatorship than a dictatorship that thinks that its best days are ahead but likewise i don't think that free countries can be blas about the fate of what is practically a free and independent country i don't think that the democracy should depart from the one china policy i don't think that the united states should change its strategic ambiguity as such but i do think that back channels and certain practical steps ought to be taken to try to ensure that beijing is under no illusions about about the magnitude of of the challenge it would face and and i'm not necessarily president biden's greatest fan but on this particular issue his statements repeated now i think four times that the united states would defend taiwan may well have sent a strong message to beijing even though when officials have subsequently walked them back they have stressed that the posture of strategic ambiguity has not changed i mean i think he has actually changed what strategic ambiguity means without abandoning the term what are your thoughts sir on the on the situation visa russia and the ukraine well jo i know that's a complicated topic and well look again i i don't say this is easy but i think what putin is doing is monstrous i think it's monstrous he regards ukraine as a rebel province just as beijing regards taiwan as a rebel province and unlike taiwan which has had a a kind of a legally ambiguous situation now for for decades ukraine has been fully and legally independent for 30 odd years putin has never accepted that even though ukraine was no threat to russia even though nato was no threat to russia he sent his army across the border expecting a rapid victory expecting that his death squads would find and eliminate president zalinski the ukrainians have turned out to be much more united much more heroic much better prepared much more imaginative much more creative on the battlefield and so for the last 15 months they have at worst stalemated the russians and in some ways bested the russians notwithstanding the fact that russia has has vastly more resources vastly more manpower vastly better weaponry and i think it's the duty of of free countries such as mine to try to avoid escalating the war sure but also to try to do whatever we can to help the ukrainians into the most advantageous possible position in if things went optimally let's say for the ukrainians and but realistically optimally for the ukrainians and for the west how do you you think like what do you conceptualize as an ending you know because one of the things i've really tried to puzzle out is well what's the endgame here like if we got what we wanted and by we i mean the west that's supporting ukraine if we got what we wanted what would that look like do you do you have a sense of that well ideally it would be ukraine regaining every inch of its territory and driving every last russian so off its land ideally that would be what it looks like now in the end i think it's up to the ukrainians to decide what they are prepared to accept but at the moment despite the fact that putin is relentlessly and mercilessly devastating their infrastructure pulverizing their cities they are determined to fight and the extraordinary thing is that this message that we got very very pervasively prior to the 24th of february last year that really there were the western ukrainians and then there were the sort of russian ukrainians that appears to be largely a a a putin inspired myth the russians speaking ukrainians appear to have been almost as a bed by the brutality of the russian invasion as everyone else and putin has succeeded in uniting the country in a way that maybe no one else has so look i think i think out of respect for the heroism of the ukrainians we have to leave them to determine what they think is a satisfactory outcome obviously we do not have to support and i would not expect this for a second any official uk ukrainian incursions into russia but i do think that nato and nato's partners such as australia should first do everything we humanly can to help the ukrainians into the best possible position militarily b say to the ukrainians that once this war is over of course we will admit you into nato and see if there is any use of nuclear weapons by the russians well we will then immediately admit you to nato that would be i think a reasonable position for ukraine's friends to adopt which is trying to avoid escalation while at the same time trying to avoid the triumph of aggression and dictatorship so all right we're we're coming to the end of our time on youtube i know you have a hard out that we negotiated a pri and so i won't ask you any more questions i would however like to offer you the opportunity if you think it's would be useful to address anything that you think might be well communicated to people on whatever broad international level we manag with this podcast is there is there anything else that you'd like to say to people before before we close up this this segment well jordan obviously i'm here because i have a great deal of respect for the work you've done over the last few years and i particularly admire the way you have reached a wide international audience particularly an audience of younger men and try to remind them of the enduring virtues you have tried to give them through your own insights and your own experience something to live for and some ways of actually grasping those those essential truths and look i just think that uh countries like australia and and look i i would extend this to the anglosphere in particular and i suppose to the western world more generally we have achieved so much and largely through the influence of the anglo-american ascendancy the whole world in 2020 was more prosperous it was more safe it was more more free than it ever before than ever before in human history and rather than despise and reject the values that created that we should cherish and admire them and yes to do our best to renew them and take them forward because i want the future to be at least as good as the recent past and yet things look much more ominous now than at any time since the early 1940s and i i don't think we're going to fix it by surrender whether it's economic surrender whether it's military surrender whether it's cultural and civilizational surrender surrender is not the way a a decent and self-confident approach is is going to be best for everyone well hopefully hopefully that that hopefully that's something that we can outline in more detail with this alliance for responsible citizenship you know and what what what was it the churchill said at the beginning of his of his of his histories of the second world war in defeat defiance in war resolution in peace goodwill and in victory magnanimity i mean something like that is what we need today yeah yeah well it would be lovely what we're hoping to do is to help inspire a vision for the future that draws on the wisdom of the past with respect for the past with the kind of respect for the past that you describe developing you know over the course of your life that people can ally themselves with voluntarily that will provide them with hope and that will offer a respit from unnecessary anxiety and and with tremendous emphasis on the voluntary element right we we don't want to produce a vision that would rely on compulsion force and fear to implement but that would be invitational instead and i don't think that that's a pipe dream i think that that's actually what everyone who has any sense and who thinks about it for any length of time would want and so i'll see you in london i believe at the end of october and so that should be extraordinarily interesting and we certainly appreciate your participation i'm looking forward to it jordan thank you all right well thank you sir thank you to everyone watching and listening on the youtube side um for your time and attention and to the dailywire plus crew for facilitating this
