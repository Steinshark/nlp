the launch of amd's n4 processors is imminent so what should you know before running out to buy one the first thing you'll probably notice if you buy a zen4 or ryzen 7000 series chip is that amd has finally switched to a more intel like lga socket this is actually team red's first ever mainstream consumer lga socket which amd is using to increase pin density am5 as they're calling it increases the pin count from 1331 to 1718 which will allow the cpu to receive up to 230 watts of power increase bandwidth for ddr5 and pcie 5.0 and make the cpu itself more durable but of course you'll have to take care not to bend the pins on the motherboard boy back up a second ddr5 and pcie 5 that is indeed what i said as zen 4 features support for both but you'll need to pay attention to what motherboard you're buying if you want pcie 5.0 it's potentially important for future graphics cards but the only chipset that features it as standard is the new x670 extreme however ddr5 will be supported by zen4 regardless of what chipset you have along with a new feature called expo but expo isn't a fancy soiree at the london crystal palace instead it's amd's answer to intel's xmp memory profiles and yes i realize that's like saying atm machine but we're trying to make things easy here okay anyway this might sound a little confusing if you're used to setting your memory speeds and timings with docp or eocp but the thing is these solutions are only offered by asus and gigabyte respectively expo by contrast was developed by amd itself so you should be able to get one click memory overclocking regardless of who made your motherboard but what about the stuff we've all been waiting for raw performance vroom vroom you know well we'll get right into that after we thank vulture for sponsoring this video vulture provides high performance cloud servers bare metal storage and managed kubernetes at a fraction of the cost of big tech in less than 60 seconds you can bring your own iso or deploy windows or linux from over 25 server locations worldwide for low latency infrastructure wherever needed also there's vulture talon cloud gpu allowing devs to deploy fractions of virtualized nvidia a100s to handle even the most advanced workloads try vulture today and receive an exclusive 30-day 150 code for new signups at the link below now here's the nitty-gritty amd's internal benchmarks taken with a grain of salt indicate 13 more instructions per clock cycle partly thanks to a larger cache size as well as better branch prediction but the bigger advancement is probably the 5 nanometer process that zenfore is built on amd partnered with tsmc to develop a chip that would get higher performance despite an overall smaller die size than zen 3. team red also included support for avx 512 extensions and if you have no clue what that is it's a set of instructions that intel actually axed from its alder lake cpus in favor of power efficiency amd clearly thought it was still worth keeping in so they baked in partial avx-512 support in order to help with deep learning and ai applications and speaking of power efficiency we're looking at 62 percent less power draw for the same performance as zen 3 which amd attributes to not only the new manufacturing process but also lessons they learned in the mobile arena of course it remains to be seen how all these improvements will translate to performance in the applications you use the most and amd has already admitted you shouldn't expect earth shattering performance from the integrated rdna ii graphics compared to their upcoming apu lineup but at least it looks like integrated graphics are coming standard in case you just need a display out it won't be long though until we get independent testing available for broad consumption as the ryzen 7000 series is due out on store shelves on september 27th and more variations including cheaper non-x versions should be coming our way sometime next year best of all there's no price increase compared to what zen 3 sold for and there's actually a discount at the top end of the product stack let's all just keep our fingers crossed that we can actually get chips at msrp instead of selling our spleens to some dude in a back alley i don't want to do that again and i don't want to keep doing this video because it's over thanks for watching like the video if you liked it dislike it if you dislike it check out our other videos comment below with video suggestions and don't you forget to subscribe and follow you cutie you
