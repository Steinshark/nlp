the toobi index for january 2024 january headline c is programming language of the year how did they come up with that one for the first time in history of the toobi index c has won the programming language of the year award congratulations c has been a top 10 player for more than two decades now that is catching up with the big four languages it won the welld deserved award by being the language with the biggest uptick in one year plus 1.43% runners up are scratch all of a sudden this article is like making 10 times more sense it cannot get worse than having scratch a second place and for tread [ __ ] it actually got worse it actually okay that actually got worse i have never stood corrected so fast in my entire lifetime as an and as in two words i got to meet the person who writes this horse all right anyways c is eating market share from java really and is getting more and more popular in domains such as web application backends and games thanks to unity okay that's fair that's fair c can be used free of charge it involves oh dude name a language that's been charged for since when like i mean borland compilers i i guess existed at one part at one point javascript it doesn't cost money to write you just lose part of your soul you know it's like come on come on come on mat lab okay i don't know this mat lab business i guess i don't ever use mat lab you can mat lab on these nuts okay let's see it involves in a steady pace making the language more expressive every new release c is here to stay and might even surpass java soon apart from c there was a lot of interesting changes in the toobe index last year fortrend and cotland became permanent top 20 players replacing oldtime favorites r and pearl who's ever said any of those words ever who's ever said you know my oldtime favorite r said nobody ever fortran is very fit to crunch numbers with good libraries and remains university favorite in lots of domains what cotlin is easy to learn slri competitor of java interesting question what languages will enter the toobi index top 20 in 2024 i guess i'm not that interested considering fortrans number two or three and and scratch is number two this article is too stupid to be an ai article i hope you understand that this article is not mid enough to be an ai article okay like you have to be a lot more mid to actually be an ai article let's see this is very hard to pick julia touched the toobi index briefly in 2023 but couldn't keep that position maturity of julia language and community is needed to get a second chance i've heard a lot of great things about julia i would put my bets on dart with flutter and typescript the ladder is already heavily used in industry but for some reason it is not breaking through the toobi index yet there's 20 positions and you're telling me that typescript ain't on those 20 positions what like i don't love i don't love typescript but damn i know it's used a lot and scratches on there i don't think netflix has a single library written in scratch the ladder is already heavily used in the industry but for some reason not breaking through yet let's see what 2024 as install paul jansen ceo of toobi software okay paul all right so how do they do that so how how is the index created does anyone let's see hold let's see where where is it okay the toobi programming community index is an indicator of popularity of programming languages the index is updated once a month the ratings are based on a number of skilled engineers worldwide courses and thirdparty vendors popular search engin such as google b yet did it just say popular search engine and then named ay that got renamed and purchased years ago wikipedia also would be called a search engine hard to call amazon a search engine i mean i guess you could say it's a search engine for buying products okay interesting it is important to note that toobi index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code has been written okay then well that sums up a lot right there by definitely counts for sure but that i mean that sums up a lot right there it's not about how often people are writing the the code okay that's not what makes it popular isn't that like the the truest measurement is how much it's being used also i would just like to say that they put cp as number one but it's number one in change like can we just i can't even organize it according to change yeah job of anyways okay january python then then c oh c is dropping c is hurting people c++ java c javascript php visual basic is eight squeal scratch coming in at number 10 scratch beating go scratch is higher than go it's official scratch is higher than go go sucks go is literally terrible fortran deli slob pascal i want to know one i want to know the son of a [ __ ] that's programming in here who made this mat lab assembly language what assembly on the way down how was assembly language whatever that means in ninth place who's rolling hand artial assembly senior scratch engineer needed asap quickly swift okay it's apparently it's going down swift seems like a pretty interesting language cotlin these nuts dang it i keep highlighting things and actually clicking it ruby it's up ruby's up dhh wrote one more application yes assoian raw doged some assembly all right let's go rust it's down oh [ __ ] cobalt is up cobalt is about to overtake rust on this shitty website oh no oh no oh my gosh oh my gosh what am i looking at what am i looking at what am i looking at d typescript on their proprietary measurement system is 14 ranks lower than d and fshp and fox pro and ada and classic visual basic not even visual basic classic okay it's like class wow it's hardcore mode prologue typescript lost to prologue i've never even heard of x++ what the hell is objective c doing on this list pearl pearl is more popular than typescript i mean don't get me wrong julia sounds interesting but to pretend that julia is more popular than typescript is the world's dumbest measurement visual basic prologue vb script pearl objective c dart julia and x++ all ranked higher than typescript i don't even i've literally never heard of x++ genuinely i don't even know what x++ is is x++ when i when i pay for twitter what the hell is x++ please stop citing the toobi index okay what is toobi toobi programming community index is an indicator of popularity of programming languages the index is updated once a month it is important to note that the toobi index is not about the best programming language or the language in which most lines of code have been written the index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make strategic decisions about what programming languages should be adopted when starting new software systems which means taking that exact statement i would strongly recommend you consider using cobal if you're currently using the likes of typescript okay so if you're using typescript i would just personally recommend cobal because cobal is actually more popular on this index whereas your typ script's kind of old a little deprecated probably not the right choice but if you're not a cobalt fan which understandably i get it you're not one okay you don't like you don't like grace hopper okay okay whatever i don't know why you're just being angry about it i would suggest scratch a high contender okay beating out go normally i would suggest go but since go's no longer soup dour it's actually scratch okay so scratch really is where all the winds are going to happen scratch is literally for children a programming language index by the way toobi must clear is clearly the ceo paul jensen or whatever the guy's name was is obviously not a program like it's it's obvious this guy has no effing clue he is running a consulting company and they should get him out immediately you should never use toobi okay if you are currently using that run run as fast as you okay i i don't like typescript i am no like i am no i'm not shy of going against modern trends but whatever you think of modern trends kobi does not represent modern trends at all i would say that their top five close right python probably a good bet you probably shouldn't start a project in c you probably shouldn't start a project in c++ you could get away with java or c honestly people there just a lot of talent out there still using java and c you know what i mean you will always find people that know how to use those two so python java c you're going to find the right things c c++ game games yeah yeah reasonable c hardware embedded i don't know it's kind of wild though at the same time okay it's kind of wild anyways let's see why a programming language index that helps us choose which language we should use sounds useful how does toobi calculate this index you might not believe this but they count the number of search engine results for each programming language not the number of people quering not the number of queries they are making not sentiment it relies entirely on the useless number that the search engine reports to give themselves a veneer of being data and they don't check just one search engine google.com they check several bing.com google.de d's nuts google do also dznuts and a few others but 25 useless sources are isn't any better than one useless source they actually check xqc they actually call up xqc on the phone and say yo i know you're incredible at overwatch pro material but xqc come in i'm going to give you 35 individual words and i want you to rank them according to over overwatch's potential characters and you tell me which one sounds the best c obviously came in really high python you know python sounds like a really good overwatch character python i should say it with thor's voice python python is a great character for overwatch all right so although it has 25 million google results i would not recommend programming in this language xkcd programming language it's a good point xkcd programming language though very popular may not be your first reach for a language the absurdities in the toobi so what kind of output do we see in this garbage input well let's look at broad trends maybe this will allow some strategic decisions okay java and c very high still 2016 and 17 the trend lines for the top two languages in the java green and c black collapsed java dropped by 42% c was even worse at 62% what was happening the was the demand collapsing or the supply no other language was gaining at their expense so maybe we're seeing a software industry recession should we prioritize rewriting our apps and our java apps turns out c and java both rose dramatically in 2018 regaining their 2016 levels i guess google was tinkering with their search algorithm i hope no one made any decisions based on this data i hope no one made say an index based on that because that would be crazy maybe instead of trends we could look at the ranking of specific languages on any passible metric like github pr stack overflow questions or developer survey jobs problem with stack overflow questions is that it naturally selects for a specific individual stack overflow is largely indexed by complete rookies and overbearing regex users elder reddit mons as i like to call them elder reddit mods are a real thing all right so now you're probably wondering why visual basic is so high it didn't used to be in march march 4th 2020 7% but why in the world was it entering let's see but when the world was entering lockdown vb exploded in popularity 29 days later it had grown by 6x reaching 4.72% i don't understand that at all it has remained uh ascendant since by the way no other source is able to back this up not google search trends stack over questions or anything else only toobi thinks this happened what the hell why are they allowing visual basic to be so high what is happening to put absurdity into context visual basic is more than twice as large as swift and objective c combined the entire ios ipad ios and watch os mac ecosystem is apparently half the size of the mighty visual basic ecosystem that actually might be true is it vb g a chad devs are you sure true and based true based and obviously correct chad tradwife let's go assembly language number eight okay first off again you keep using this word you keep using this word is either too high because no one programs an assembly or too low because isn't all programming languages ultimately assembly yes either way the ranking is wrong factual and correct nobody except for like tls specifically crypto crypto tls stuff hand rolls assembly but every programming language eventually becomes assembly therefore checkmate it should be number one sadly the market for logo number 48 program programming seems way down back in its heyday it was high as 21 on i've literally never heard of logo this is the programming language that involves moving turtles across the screen that can't be real when i was young child one of my best friends was a turtle not a real turtle although that would have been fun but a virtual one my turtle lived inside an apple 2 an early 8bit computer at my elementary school when i first met her my turtle she didn't do much she just sat there it didn't take long for me to realize that in order to get her to do something i would need to prompt her to do this there was a literal prompt on the screen beckoning me to type something and so i typed forward thinking that this should obviously move the turtle forward not enough inputs to forward undeterred i revised my input to forward 10 just picking an arbitrary number although i was only six years old i deduced that forward needed a quantity quantities were numbers and well 10 was a good start and hooray the turtle moved i was in love with my turtle from that moment on i learned that she could also move back and turn left and right and i didn't know what degrees were when i first met my turtle but by the time i finished our session together i did that afternoon in 1981 i had learned some of a programming language called logo the father of logo was a mathematician and philosopher named seymour peper interested in learning how to improve mathematics education to young children in the early 1960s he he had studied under jean pag a swiss psychologist who championed a philosophy of learning known as constructivism average logo enjoyer pj okay well that shit's [ __ ] up if that's number 21 somebody has to say yo dog this is a terrible terrible index also why was that man so into turtles okay i got so many questions right now we could go on and on but let's see we could ask why typescript languishes at 37 well behind deli object pascal classic number 14 and scratch scratch is now actually up to number 10 this year for anyone that's wondering but you get the idea none of this makes sense except by accident is it possible that even with completely wrong output they're still locking into correct predictions again no in the toobi report from march 2012 they pessimistically they're pessimistic about a popular language in 2022 they also ranked python low a top three language today by any metric curiously they can't let's see they can't find old reports with these bad predictions on their websites evaluating languages for projects fortunately there are better ways to evaluate a language look for projects look for a technical fit can developers be hired and trained to use it i would say a better like something that i always i'm very excited about is one reason why you should consider i i know this is going to be just such a dick punch but one reason why you should consider rust or go is that there's developer excitement right like if i pro if i just simply said hey i'm looking for somebody to come program rust with me i would get 100,000 applications like in an instant real talk i would get so many applications it would be unbearable right it would be literally impossible will they be happy using it bada bing bada boom you can you can build a roller coaster in excel so choose a language so anyways what will our development veloc be on this language what will be the operational burden of keeping it running in production do we need to rely on third party code does that code already exist and what is its quality only your team can answer these question it depends on your business problem your local jobs market your engineering budget if you've hired smart people they can figure this stuff out to a lesser extent your team needs to account for long-term trends the language must remain a good technical fit in the future as well if it's it's no good if you can find developers today but end up having to beg programmers to come out of retirement cobal people that is i can see down there you guys probably can't see it but it says something in shambles to find and train more cobalt programmers predicting the future is hard but you can take a look at developer surveys okay jet brains probably a good place to go check github trends probably a good thing github prs by languages probably a cool thing let's just check this out really quickly what do prs by language looks like we see python real high we see java javascript c++ go typescript php ruby c c shell nx scala rust rust lost to nyx damn damn russ lost to nicks man oh my goodness i'm not going to lie to you that hurts a little bit that hurts a little bit damn nicks nicks more popular than rust by a wide margin too by a wide margin margin shell twice as popular twice as popular notice that c isn't very high though kind of wild it's kind of wild that se is so much higher like gallons higher i'm a little bit confused by that the octoverse index yeah let's check that one out i'm curious about the octoverse index let's okay can can do do i really need to press another button to read the effing thing okay just show me some show me some languages okay i okay show me some languages okay these are people just give me some languages okay give me some languages okay these are people people people people people people people people people javascript remains the most popular language cloud native development grows a typescript rises past java in the third biggest language okay interesting there we go so now we're looking at some stuff javascript python typescript java c c c++ phpc shall go rust sucks to suck man sucks to suck javascript has once again taken the crown for number one most popular language and we will continue to see familiar languages such as python and java remain in the top five languages year-over-year typescript rises in popularity this year typescript overtook java for the first time as third most popular language across oss projects on github with 30% 37% growth of its user base yeah this one's kind of unfair a lot of people just renamed js to ts and slapped on a bunch of anni's and called it a day we're now typescript compatible you're just like okay that's pretty cool all right anyways all right evaluating languages as a developer unlike a project that needs a quick quick let's see to pick a language and stick to it you don't need to if you attach your identity to a single language drop that you're a developer not a language developer love it love it grow your toolbox over time love it your favorite programming language can solve every problem you'll encounter in the future haven't heard of javascript so you learn new ones periodically if your toolbox only contains a hammer everything starts to look like a nail haven't heard of javascript if you've worked with garbage collected languages try a languages that uses manual me manual memory management or vice versa okay i like it i like it and if you've mostly worked with imperative languages try a language that uses functional construct and vice versa analyze a language you know and try ones that offer something different functional languages are interesting i have un unfortunately just don't think functional languages will ever become popular honestly i think dhh would like this language i mean would like this article what am i saying dhh would like this article this is like dhh language it's true he talks about trying stuff right like that's he says it quite a bit and he's landed on the things he likes i'm just saying this this is like this is d h11 if you know anything about the guy i've read three of his articles on stream and that's what i know about the guy that's it and they all are like this try heroin you could try that one that could be a little bit interesting but whatever you do don't make decisions based on the number of google results agreed a comment on reddit pointed out that the previous articles criticizing toby it also explained why unknown languages like deli is so high in this index it is because deli community has put a lot of effort into manipulating the toobi index ratings rankings good for them no way let me see this this shit's so messed up no no this is so good this is so good oh my goodness this is so hilarious this is so hilar i mean they're literally telling you how to cheat oh my goodness this is beautiful and they've been doing look at this that's 2008 that's 2008 and deli whatever you call that is still it's number 13 it's growing the they like are still making it work damn incredible the name just trust toby he's gonna tell you the truth go learn fortran deli ada and cobalt and your jobs will be secure for the rest of your life this is not financial advice a jen
