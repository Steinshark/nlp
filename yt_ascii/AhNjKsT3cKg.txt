[music] thank you here are the top five biggest things to happen in tech this past week from ai helping a quadriplegic man move again to well smart glasses that can help you with your dating life but also too acing that technical interview let's get into it oh before we do hit that subscribe give this video a like and leave any video suggestions in the comment okay now let's get into it now this first story gets pretty wild quickly which is ai knows what you are typing there have been studies that were recently conducted to see how ai was able to detect or pick up what keystrokes are being typed when you're in a zoom call or if someone is in earshot from you in this paper it states that with zoom audio to go on an ai can decode keystroke sounds with a startling 93 accuracy and it's able to pick up exactly what you are typing now i'm sure the inevitable is going to occur with this potential risk and danger yes there's pros to it but also too let's face it there's a lot of cons especially when it comes to cyber security one example they share in this article is really how this could be used for example you're in an airport typing in your password and there is a hacker sitting close to you with a microphone captures that audio from your keystrokes the rest is history and this might sound so far-fetched like we are in this cyber movie and this isn't going to happen but it's already happening today this is where we are at and cyber security implications are going to be huge with this and they actually tested this out the researchers pressed 36 keys on the macbook pro a total of 25 times each recording the keystrokes on two different mediums a nearby iphone microphone and zoom audio and the accuracies of picking up these keystrokes were between 95 and 93 now this next story it hits close to home as a developer which is stack overflow has seen a massive decline in users since different apps such as chat gpt bard you get the point have been released and not only are they competing against these ai models but some of them were actually trained on stack overflow data and of course elon musk had to make his way into this news by calling it death by llm now stack overflow's ceo is responding to this in two main ways one being the phenomenal community resource he is saying that the reason why stack overflow in many ways became so popular you don't have to spend a large amount of hours into the night trying to figure things out you have this amazing community resource stack overflow is responding by saying that it wants to be paid for its training data i mean they're giving away all this data and losing out on it so it makes sense where they want to get paid he also shared out a tweet which i think is really interesting and gets you thinking this is what it said he also recently tweeted this out and it really gets your mind going when stack overflow is fully dead due to ai where will ai labs get their training data from and this is a great point it's one of those things where the snake is eating its own tail they are getting this data from stack overflow but they are killing stack overflow as they are doing that where are they going to get the data once this is done does that even matter to them oh the irony in this next story this one was it's too good it's too good as someone who works from home remote and is a huge remote fan i had to include this one zoom wants its employees to return back to office very ironic considering they make their money on individuals working remotely now here's what they had to say about it we believe that a structured hybrid approach meaning employees that live near office need to be on site at least two days a week to interact with their teams now although this is very ironic considering what their technology is all about they are one of the last big companies or where there's still a few hanging in there but most big companies nowadays are going back to this hybrid approach which by the way is terrifying as someone who likes to work from home this next story i shared in short form on social media but i had to include it in this week it's mind-blowing we talk a lot about ai on here and sometimes it gets more into the negatives of ai and what that is and i always try and keep it positive and this story here with ai is one of those really positive use cases of how it can change the world and people's lives mr right here ai helps quadriplegic man move and feel again so what surgeons were able to do is implant a chip into this individual's brain and let me let me read for you exactly what they did surgeons implanted microchips into thomas's the quadriplegic brain in the regions that control movement and touch sensation in the hand the chip interfaces with ai algorithms that relink his brain to his body and spinal cord through this they are able to interpret thomas's thoughts and translate them into actions now this is wild and such a great use case of how we can help people with this technology with ai and now you can see thomas is able to move his arm when he starts thinking about it and signaling from his brain this was impossible before he had this surgery it was very successful and it's getting a lot of media attention rightfully so now one of the lead researchers on this project here's what they had to say this is a game changer our goal is to one day give people with paralysis the ability to live fuller independent lives you can think of maybe you have a friend family member acquaintance who has been impacted with something like this being able to have more independent be function more independently through this technology i think it's really just at the cusp of what is possible now this next one is for anyone who's in the dating scene or needs a little help maybe with dating stanford students created some glasses smart glasses that can display the output of opening eyes gpt4 this is something that i kind of wish i had during my technical interviews especially when we get into really specific algorithms being able to see the solution on my glasses and they can't tell that i have the solution where do i order a pair the device is called riz gpt and this is how it works it listens to your conversations and it tells you exactly what to say next so you can see on screen when you are having a conversation text will be generated in real time for you so here let me share with you this tweet of an example of what is possible with these glasses now this is able to work this way because opening eyes speech recognition software whisper allows the glasses to feed speech directly to the chatbot which can generate answers in a matter of seconds really now there still is when i was watching videos a little bit of pause even one or two seconds in a conversation can feel like a lot but we are definitely on our way to making these an everyday product which has the potential to really impact a lot of areas from your dating life your job interview that's why i keep on coming back to the job interview would be the biggest thing how you do negotiations having all that information right in front of you in real time the possibilities are really endless what do you think though do you think something like this product these glasses should be allowed for the public to access or is it giving us too much information at our fingertips that will impact really if we put any effort into learning or using our own lives all right those are the top five biggest things to happen in tech this past week tech is moving so quickly so i try and keep these updates for you to stay informed in a fun and engaging way that you don't have to spend all your time reading in depth about all these articles that's what i like to do and sum it up for you leave in the comments if you enjoy the series if you want me to continue with it other video topics you have your comments your likes your your subscribe hits i know it sounds all cliche but it really helps me when creating content so i appreciate it all i appreciate you and on that note i need to get some more coffee bye everyone [music] thank you
