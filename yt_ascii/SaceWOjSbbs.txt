when it comes to battery life whoa sp 30 and p 30 pro have pretty much every factor in their favor and i've managed to get both devices making this the most important battery comparison we've ever made we're effectively fitting two whole battery comparisons into one video here we've got the standard mainline flagship phones from huawei apple and samsung but then also their pro plus size variants so right now i'm using a lock saw meter to make sure the brightness is completely calibrated between the different screens they might look a little different here but that's because the angle they have from the camera and off we go i've unplugged the cables and the first thing we're gonna do is continuous skype calling if you take a look at the battery capacities at the bottom you can probably tell huawei isn't messing around here the p30 pro out of all the plus size smartphones has the largest battery capacity at 4200 milliamp hours but what is interesting is that it almost looks like they've made it a mission to beat their competitors in every category of phone for the standard sized p30 you can see it's got quite a bit more battery than the iphone 10 s and the galaxy s 10 on paper alright so with 40 minutes in which is a little early to say anything conclusive but so far it's looking like team hallway on the far left is winning in fact the p30 the standard smaller p 30 is currently beating every other smartphone out here right now we're just on youtube then we're watching some of the other mister who's the boss coverage of this phone and we'll leave it on this for about 30 minutes or so i'll see what videos we end up on one thing worth noting is the measures we've had to take to try and make this as fair a test as possible all phones have wi-fi bluetooth nfc as well as location turned on and for all four android phones here we haven't touched the resolution setting we've just kept it on the default 1080p that most people will use out the box the other really important thing is that we're testing phones that haven't been used yet when you use a phone as your main device you're constantly draining the battery day and day out and these continuous charging cycles degrade its overall capacity and so none of the devices you're seeing here have been fully charged and discharged more than ten times and so even the s 10 plus you're seeing here is a different s 10 plus to the one i reviewed and just to make sure that we're getting the best battery life out of each phone we've now switched from news and social media to something slightly more intense by running f1 mobile a racing game and we are starting to see some trends when it comes to battery the two iphones are starting to slip behind a little bit and the standard smaller galaxy s 10 has lost a lot of battery compared to its larger counterpart if you compare that with the p30 and the p30 pro well the standard smaller p30 is actually slightly ahead and that may well change over the course of the test but nonetheless so far this is an exceptional result the galaxy s 10 plus at least when it comes to continuous screen on time is incredible we did a battery test earlier this year when it came out and it was the leader they beat out every current gen flagship smartphone so if the hallway beats that then that's really really something we've just passed the three-hour mark and with this in mind all six flagship phones are doing well for battery life none of these are gonna disappoint although on a relative level the iphone 10s and the galaxy s 10 have fallen quite away behind this starts to build the kind of picture we were expecting given that the standard s10 has a reasonably sized but not particularly large 3400 million power battery mind you that looks like a very generous figure next to the iphone 10s is 2658 milliamp hours but apple's ios and this is the latest ios is just very efficient at managing limited battery capacity i'd be interested to see how well these iphones would perform if they were bundled in with equivalently sized batteries alright we've got facebook open right now we're just watching endless pretty useless videos and we're gonna close it down and open up the camera we're gonna focus on 4k video recording something that all phones here can do but mind you the latest - huawei flagships can't do 4k video at 60 frames per second all four other phones can so for the sake of parity we're just gonna record 4k xxx on all this does big damage to the standard galaxy s 10 which is now clinging on to 30% and that's crazy because the galaxy s 10 plus is still on over 50 after over four hours of screen on time worth bearing in mind whilst don't get me wrong the huawei p30 phones are cutting edge in many ways they are built on the same chip as the mate 20 pro last year and it's a super efficient chip so it's not a bad thing but it just means that any battery efficiency gains that you see on this phone versus that one are most likely due to two things firstly both p30 phones ship with mui 9.1 a slightly more refined version of the software at the meet 20 pro released with the company said that one of the features of this new software is that the phones will better be able to anticipate your behaviors and if you think about it if your smartphone can successfully predict your behavior then in theory it should be able to allocate resources efficiently ahead of time and so that would explain some battery saving the other thing is resolution whilst the apples and the samsung's have a maximum resolution well above 1080p both koala flagships are limited to this figure which i was kind of surprised by i feel like a 20-19 flagship should be able to go up to a quad hd plus resolution nonetheless we are now well past the five-hour mark what had called a safezone any smartphone that lasts over five hours of screen on time is what i'd consider acceptable and so even though the - 10 s was the first to go and in fact the galaxy s 10 is just gone as well they're both ok the battery life won't amaze you but more importantly it won't be a concern not at least for the first year or so of using them also if you've been checking the figures this test is getting seriously close it's probably the closest test we've ever done between the p30 pro which by the way has overtaken its smaller sibling now and the s 10 plus dell'utri completely neck-and-neck the iphone 10's max has just called it a day which is good news for huawei it's nice to see that they've shared the battery love between their standard sized phone and their plus-size model the fact that they've got this more compact phone that can still outlast the suppose it max variance of other companies is really cool ok so we're nearing the end of this test i'm going to put this last section on fast-forward and we're going to get straight to the final results in sixth place the iphone 10s with the result of nearly 5 hours and 20 minutes which is kind of just above what i've consider acceptable the galaxy s 10 lasted about 15 minutes longer than that which is fine but at the same time it's a shame to see it so heavily hindered compared to the amazing s 10 plus for the iphone tenace max finished at a fraction under six hours which i'm pretty happy with it's good performance but i was really surprised by the p30 which managed to last a good 45 minutes longer than the 10s max and that's the kind of difference you would notice on a day to day basis in second place the galaxy s 10 plus with over its 7 hours of screen on time and i've said this before but this thing is an absolute tank when it comes to battery life but that means we've got a new battery king the huawei at p 30 pro which lasted over seven hours and 20 minutes wow i'm incredibly impressed not hugely surprised because on paper it does have everything going for it but nonetheless to see those on paper specifications translate into real-world battery performance is still really cool if you enjoyed this video it'll be massively appreciated if you could smash that subscribe button tons more really cool stuff coming soon and as always my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music] you
