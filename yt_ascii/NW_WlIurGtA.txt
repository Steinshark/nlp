so hello everybody i am here with father andrew dominic and father steven de young both of them are working with ancient faith radio and started a new podcast called the lord of spirits and the people around me the people that watch my videos everybody has been really excited about this podcast i listened to the first episode and it's very very fascinating it's a very it's an exploration of the world of angels of spirits of demons basically trying to help people understand that as christians as believers we don't believe that it's just us and god although we do believe that god the god we worship is transcendent is beyond time beyond space beyond everything it's uncreated but that between us and god let's say in the hierarchy of beings there's a whole bunch of stuff going on that's how the ancients understood it that's how the fathers understood it and so they are trying to dive back into that understanding and present it to us today in a manner that we can understand and that can also help us transform our lives in relation to all of this now i'm gonna have some questions some tough questions too i hope they're ready in terms of what this means and what the consequences of going into this might be because i've as you've seen in my videos i've been tempted by talking about this more and more and so yeah so i think we're gonna have a lot of fun [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world so i don't know who is going to speak first but i would like you to maybe tell us a little bit about your vision for this podcast you know what you're trying to accomplish and then we'll just dive in i think we'll we'll probably have to cut it short because there's so many things we could probably talk about and so we'll see yeah well i'll i'll go first i usually go first on the actual show because i'm the one who's looking at all the blinky lights so in the studio but yeah so you know father stephen and i have come bring very different things to the table and my desire to do this show was number one in some ways to to give a wider audience to some of the work that father stephen has been doing in terms of talking about the the bible especially and in the orthodox tradition in its full sense and especially in the sense that is maybe hidden from us as people who tend to function as materialists right and so the reason why i've been fascinated by that stuff is because you know serving for a number of years as a pastor and still doing pastoral work in another different kind of way now i think one of the biggest problems that we have in our age is that we tend to function as materialists we tend to function even if we're believing christians we tend to function in a way that suggests that the 3d world is all that there is and occasionally we maybe add in some god here and there and then you know if we're then we occasionally maybe add in some saints and angels if we feel like really desperate you know god please do this for me and oh by the way you saints and angels please help you know and the the truth is that's a very anemic way of understanding the spiritual life and so i'm also fascinated by narrative and i think narrative is really the way that we understand and organize reality the way that we actually able to approach it and so much of what we're talking about in this program is about reclaiming narratives that are in orthodox tradition they're in the scriptures they're in the church fathers they're in the liturgical services but have become opaque to us because of our modern culture and and it's you know secular humanistic materialism so that's kind of the nutshell of what it is that i what i'm interested in particularly for this for this particular program father stephen maybe tell us about your research and you know the way you've been presenting it to people i know in the blog for a while but now in this in this podcast tell us a bit about the angle and what you're trying to accomplish with what you're doing yeah i'm i'm the bible nerd of of our duo i actually went and got a phd in it and and i've spent a lot of my life studying ancient dead languages but i think a big part of what has motivated me is i don't think that as as orthodox christians living in the west for the most part we sort of fully appropriated our tradition it's all there it's all in the tradition it's in our liturgics it's it's in the fathers it's in the scriptures themselves but we've tended to in part i think because we're doing this work in english so we start out adopting traditional english language theological terms sort of our interpretive grid for theology and understanding god and understanding the scriptures has been dictated by sort of modern assumptions mostly modern protestant assumptions especially in terms of the bible and so you know we try to figure out what's the orthodox view of justification what's the orthodox view of predestination we take these western categories and just try to plug in the orthodox stance you you don't end up with the orthodox faith that way you end up with sort of a an orthodox-ish form of western western christianity and so i've been trying mainly to try to to pull out some of this stuff that's there in the scriptures there in our our tradition especially very early fathers there in the jewish traditions of the second temple period that form the background for the new testament that people just don't know about and sort of show that hey this is what's there that there's a whole other way of understanding all of these things that's more original that is the basis of the orthodox faith and that we're just unaware of that's already with one episode in the bag the most common comment we get either from a critical side or a non-critical side is why haven't i heard this before well one of the things that we've been that has been a disservice to us let's say in the west is our translations have been a a desire to de-mythologize the the scripture and so you know when i tell people that you know in the creation narrative it says that god created sea monsters and people they've never seen it but it's right there in front of you they just use words to kind of make you think that to to make to avoid the problems or to avoid all the strange characters the dragons the demons the the strange you know gods that are named or these these strange mythological creatures they don't they there has been this attempt to kind of shield this from us in order to protect christianity in the modern world but now in the the past few decades what we've had is we've had kind of secular atheist type biblical scholars come at us with arrows and knives and say all of this stuff is there and tried to bring it back and christians have no idea and so one of the things i'm excited about what you're doing is saying we're going to do this but we're going to do it in a way to show that it's completely coherent with our christian tradition it's not an opposition to it it doesn't it's not there to undermine what we would we believe yeah yeah we don't have to be embarrassed by the appearance of monsters and spirits and so forth in the bible you know they are there there's a there's this idea that we need to sort of make christianity respectable right we need to we need to make sure that it's something we can talk about in polite company at cocktail parties with educated people you know and so if we start talking about demons or we start talking about sea monsters or we start talking about giants they're going to laugh at us so we need to figure out some some way to paper over that you know some other way to to understand that so that we can all be you know modern intellectual respectable folk yeah yeah and so i would my big question this is like i'm gonna go straight to the toughest question i would say is one of the reasons that i have been very going very slowly at this or kind of bringing people slowly onto this point of view which is this notion of these principalities of these these beings is i'm afraid of the marvel comics spirituality like i'm afraid of the marvel comics version of mythology which is that everything is on the same level right so you have these beings but they're all basically like us right they're all basically on a kind of material sphere i would say and so it you know thor's on another planet and these gods are kind of floating in space or you know the recent version we've heard are things like they're in other dimensions this type of speaking which is trying to use scientific speak to explain these beings but always trying to explain them on the on the same level and so this is the thing that i'm a little worried about because what to me what it ends up creating is a kind of science fiction version of the the bible and so i don't know if that's something you've thought about yeah like one thing you notice for instance in the recent marvel films i think the last i think was the last avengers movie you know thor gets a beer belly right so like i mean this is this is this is the the reification of of thor you know that he's he's real he's so real he can get you know become a deadbeat and get drunk and have a beer belly right and and be out of shape whereas no one who ever worshipped thor and the christians who encountered thor worshipers would have ever seen him that way they would have regarded you know those who worshipped him would have regarded him as a god and those who encountered those worshipers were regarded as a demon which are both biblical terms for the same kinds of beings and he you know he was not just a human with kind of superpowers who lives on another planet but but but actually this this spiritual being who through sacrifices and through sin frankly is in communion with this group of people and affecting them and there they've made him part of their community and he's you know super dangerous right he's you know so that the powers that he wields are virtu by virtue of his with the kind of being that he is and and he's not he's not just like us like he doesn't get bummed out like us he doesn't you know fall in love like us he doesn't get a beer belly like us that's just not what thor is just as an example you know but but yeah it's i mean i've i've long loved comic books and father stevens is a comic comic book lover as well but you know that's not that's not the real thor yeah well there are analogies let's say i mean i like comic books too for sure and i think that there are analogies to help us understand sometimes you can use analogies of physical power to help you understand spiritual power there are there are ways to use those tropes and let's say the manner in which even in the stories of the gods that they're told they're told that way right the the gods are are tol are described in ways that have massive let's say physical power and that they they manifest this power there's a there's a mapping on of the of the two worlds let's say there's a mapping on of the higher world with the lower world and we use words from the lower world to talk about it but but angels don't right angels don't have physical bodies or they have something like subtle bodies or you could call them that i don't know am i wrong in my understanding father stephen what is your vision of this well i think to begin with your original question i think really getting into the reality of this does the exact opposite i think the whole spiritual world and god himself has been sort of domesticated by sort of modern theology especially protestant theology you know you you've got calvinism which basically has a god who's within time and sometime in the ancient past sat down and wrote out everything that was going to happen yeah you know and if he didn't do that then he's not sovereign and he's not in control right you know or and then you have you have people who respond to that and go the other way with open theism who say that god like doesn't know the future right so we've we've got these words that are so humanized god so i think when we come and say well no if you look at the scriptures you know the alien or the angels are these vast cosmic intelligences you know that that help god in his governing of the spiritual and the material world you know i think that's a much less sort of marvelous you know that's less justice league yeah no and i think the word intelligence is probably the i mean it's a traditional word to talk about these beings and it's probably a good way to speak about them in a manner that people can maybe understand what we're dealing with here because one of the things you said i think was it was in the first episode or maybe i read it on on your blog where you talk about the notion that that the spiritual world and for the ancients even though it's seen as these intelligences that are that are above us and that are kind of managing the world they nonetheless map on to the physical world right there's a there's a correlation and so you have places in the world that are like you know the gates of hell or the the mountain of the gods or you have all these physical spaces in the world that kind of that say concentrate these spiritual powers but it doesn't it doesn't mean that let's say that if you went up the mount olympus you would find god you'd find zeus sitting there kind of you know fiddling away at his at his lightning bolts you know but it's difficult because people are so materialistic that i i'm always afraid sometimes that like you understand what i'm talking about because sometimes i'm a little worried when i talk to people about this stuff we have the the ancients saw these things as sort of overlapping like to use a modern term it's like you have a transparency over a photo you know and so the atrousian lake for example was a lake in hades in sheol in the underworld and it was the place of for for plato it was the place of forgetting where the souls sort of lose their memories before they get reincarnated in in general greco-roman paganism it was just forgetting their former lives completely and sort of starting to dwindle away to nothingness christians adopt that and in a lot of the early christian apocryphal works like the life of adam and eve they have repentant people in hades at the coming of christ being baptized in that leg and being cleansed of their sins and then able to enter into into paradise but that lake you know we could talk about how that functions in the stories of these but that was also a lake in italy you could go there yeah that's it's an actual physical lake and they didn't think it represented this spiritual reality they thought those two things were the same they overlapped it's more like a man i always use the word manifesting in the sense that it's not an arbitrary representation but it's a condensation of something which is beyond what it's condensating like it it it actually it's actually manifesting this principle but the print the principle or the intelligent part of it is beyond what is being shown to you let's say you know just like a church really does it really the physical building of the church really does become the place where christ descends you know manifest themselves in the cup really really you know but but you cannot limit that just to the blood and bread that's in the in the cup because it there's something else going on there's a there's it's pointing us bringing us into something higher than what's there yeah and and also that that human participation makes a big difference in terms of what people actually experience right so like early on one of the the the memes that i think father stephen shared on our podcast facebook page had these two pictures on it and on the top you see this very plain very primitive looking sort of village with huts you know and and then on the bottom you see this idyllic countryside where you see mythological beings cavorting with human beings and they're labeled separately i'm i'm doing this from memory so i forgive getting wrong but the top one with the sort of primitive bare you know set of huts it says something like what a video camera would have seen and then at the bottom it says what ancient people has experienced yeah and so you know what is the difference between those two like if i go to those huts i'm probably going to just see huts because i don't i don't know how to participate in the same way that those people did right and so you know and and and i think that that's that's that's one of the key things right is this sense of ritual participation but also just having a having the the imagination and and by that i don't mean that they're coming up with ideas in their heads and then they they're seeing things but i'm seeing i'm saying having the ability to recognize something as being there and and having that ability then you actually do see more right so so you know like for instance you talked about that lake in italy just because you go to that place in italy and stick your toe in doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna forget everything you ever knew right there there's there's something else going on there at the same time right there's certain conditions that kind of have to be met in order to have that specific experience you know and and like i'm still kind of grappling to get a handle on a lot of this stuff father stephen's been working with it for a lot longer but what one of the things that i've found that's really fascinating to me is that so much of it is i have this internal feeling of like i've always wanted this to be real i always wanted this to be true and now actually now i have a coherent way of understanding how it is in fact true right so these sort of human intuitions that we have about the presence of spirits for instance there is a vocabulary there is a tradition to understand and access and approach in the right way these realities because like there are other ways to access them that are not the right way you know you can engage in the occult you can engage in like we were talking about offline psychedelic drug usage you can engage in this stuff and get in contact with the spiritual world but you're lost that's the the difficulty is that a lot of the there's a hierarchy of beings and there's also a hierarchy in the good sense in the sense that you know that which is connected to which is above but there's also a hierarchy in the sense that there's a bunch of stuff that's disconnected or that's wild and not that you know that is beings that are on their own and doing their own thing and people have no way of discerning how what or how what they're encountering when they they they go on these trips at least that's my perception you know people i remember one time a guy who i respect very much but he was telling me about psychedelics and he was you know he was trying to get me to do psychedelics a lot of people are trying to get me to do psychedelics and and so i was asking questions and i'm like okay well tell me about your thing you know explain it to me and he's saying and then he says well she you take psychedelic and if you ever see a monster he said you know just relax just relax and like ask it what it has to teach you and i'm like you know what let's let's move on to something else because if i see a monster i'm not going to ask it what it has to teach me because that would probably not be good for my soul you know it's it's funny and i want to yeah right don't talk to the monsters but you know it's funny like so within 24 hours of our first episode we must have received i don't know five or six messages from people that essentially kind of went like this my house is haunted what am i supposed to do about this you know and and i mean like we're gonna we're gonna talk about this at some point but yeah i mean father stephen you could probably comment on that like like i don't know it's so funny we're just kind of there's this explosion of interest that we've experienced and so there's an unending list of topics you know well yeah and and there's you know i frequently brought up when i'm talking about this and you've heard me do it like it's speaking engagements i bring up the fact that for example saint john chrysostom in one of his homilies instructs his people on what to do when they encounter the spirit of a dead loved one so apparently this happened frequently enough to people that he had to give them directions on what they should do right and and how they should handle it and what did he say i need to know what did he say he said assume it's a demon right until prove it otherwise assume it's a demon trying to trick you but i say that and people kind of chuckle and they're like wow that's weird but then when everyone else leaves the room i have people start coming up to me and say hey when my mom died when my dad died when my aunt died when my grandma died i kind of did they tell me they've had that experience and i think these experiences are well because this is reality because spiritual reality is reality people have these experiences they try to write them off or re-explain them or man i must have something weird or you know or or whatever or they just don't admit that they've had them because everybody again they won't be respectable everybody will look at them like they're crazy you know so so this reality intrudes on people's lives and so part of what i think is valuable about what we're trying to do hopefully for people is that we'll give them a content an orthodox context in which to talk about and and understand that you know and and what what do you do with your houses on well i've done an exorcism on a house and i ended up doing it because it wasn't an orthodox person it was a person from a nazarene church but he went to his pastor and said hey this weird stuff is happening this thing grabbed me and left like burnt finger marks on my body what do i do and this nazarene pastor was like i don't know you need to go find a priest you need to go fast don't you watch movies find a priest what do you do here i got this is it in my wheelhouse right this i don't have the toolbox for this right so i mean these things happen to people and and they're normal in the sense that they're part of the whole world we've just done everything we can to blind ourselves to the whole spiritual element of the world around us yeah well one of the things that's being opened up i would say right now is there are certain scientists and certain thinkers there's someone his name is don hoffman who's kind of attracting a lot of attention and he's he's positing that consciousness is basically a fundamental part of of the world like it's a fundamental particle of of the universe and that it scales down the human it scales down from our experience all the way down to the sub-atomic level and it scales up as well beyond persons and then this phenomena of consciousness scales up and and so you know and he's really kind of muddling around you can tell that he doesn't have any traditional metaphysic he hasn't studied philosophy he's really doing it as a scientist but he's he's trying to account for consciousness which is the last thing that scientists are unable to really account for they can't explain it they don't understand it despite the fact that it's through consciousness that they're saying everything they're saying that they're everything they're doing is basically through the the lens of consciousness but they can't account for that phenomena they think it's just a phenomena it's not a phenomena right it's a it's it's the place the place meeting of heaven and earth we could say but what happens is that it opens up the possibility even for materialists or kind of scientifically minded the possibility that the world actually organizes itself not just in material categories but in consciousnesses you know and if you join that with a kind of traditional metaphysics if you imagine let's say the platonic metaphysics of ideas that the notion that there's a hierarchy of concepts you could say or ideas whereas the real traditional way of understanding it is that no there's a hierarchy of beings the world manifests itself through beings and that even things in the world that say sectors of reality are have principalities that are beings that are managing those those things and it's hard for people to kind of grasp that but if you in our human endeavor that's how it works right we have a mayor we have a president we have a general we have these characters that are acting as principalities on on larger constituents you could say yeah i'm i'm totally fascinated by pan psychism which is what you're talking about yeah yeah in large part because it accords with you mentioned you know the platonic metaphysics but i mean back when i was studying philosophy i was i did a thesis on in aristotle's physics aristotle has everything having a will anything that has a nature has a will because will is a function of nature which is also part of our orthodox theology that separates us from the west in a lot of ways but that's sort of treated as some kind of weird crude of course by modern people reading aristotle they're like oh this is some weird crude he's you know humanizing natural elements and the world soul and all of this but but this was basic to the ancient view is that there are these consciousnesses associated with everything in the material world and as you say that the idea that they scale based on the complexity of the system that they represent but and then the question was like when you read philo responding to plato in a jewish context he's saying these consciousnesses aren't gods to be worshipped in their own right right they're gods we would put it with a small g but they're they're those beings created by and appointed by the god to to administer his creation and through whom he administers administers his creation and then the the idea of demonic rebellion is that some of these powers have rebelled and were being worshipped as gods by by the various nations treated as ends in themselves rather than as as part of this hierarchy that leads toward the god yeah that's it's one of the questions is probably this is a question that i've had for a very very long time so i'm going to ask father stephen because i want an answer to this so one of the things that i would say people are going to call me a heretic now but one of the things that i've appreciated let's say in in the islamic cosmology is the possibility of the jinns okay that is it seems to me this is and i might be wrong because maybe i do come from a protestant background but it seems to me that in the christian cosmology of which i'm aware of there's this idea that there are let's say angelic beings that are connected in the hierarchy to god and then there are demonic beings that are rebelling and therefore let's say fallen or or are scattered full of pride and and pulling people pulling the world apart let's say diabolos but we don't seem to have the possibility of beings that are neutral or that are ambiguous in between and we don't have that but then they reappear nonetheless as like fairies and gnomes and all these all these let's say kind of folk beings that are there for the christians even though they're not part of their official chrisman christian cosmology let's say so to me that's like something that i've always wondered about are there traces in the fathers or in in let's say in the traditional text or the extra biblical extra biblical stories where we talk there there is this idea of neutral or ambiguous beings yeah i think i think there are two answers to that first is that that's sort of where humans are because humans are humans are both immaterial and material right but by being a soul-body unity humans are the bridge between the unseen and the seen world and so we are sort of in in between in that regard or able to move in either direction would probably be would probably be a better description the other place where you see that kind of thing is is with the idea of the giants where you have this kind of and we could talk about how to see that but this quote-unquote hybridization idea of something fallen and something human right and and there are there are some outlier traditions but there are some outlier traditions that have people who would be categorized as giants but who are nonetheless righteous or repentant and i think father andrew's favorite one that i that i pointed out to him is that there is actually a tradition that noah had some kind of nephilim connection himself yeah and then they represented different ways like with his children or he himself is kind of a because he's an artisan even in the regular story he you can see that he has something of cain's descendants because he builds a boat and that all is in in kane's lineage yeah and there are a lot of stories of his miraculous birth and there are a whole series of stories where after his sort of miraculous weird birth his father lamech is kind of like hey is this mine you know like or did what did like an angelic being get involved here because he seems to be right he has to sort of be reassured and the dynamics of a lot of those stories actually get they get inverted but they get reused by saint matthew in his gospel in terms of saint joseph's questioning when the theotokos becomes with child now they get inverted because he's told the opposite answer lamik's sort of reassured like no it's he's your child then just like nope it's not whereas joseph it's like yeah no it's not you know humans but it's the the same kind of dynamics in this in the story get played out so there is that those would be the two places i think where you would see something like that even then i don't think there's ever really neutrality but there's the capability for certain beings to move in either direction they're not sort of locked in in place yeah because c.s lewis seems to want to try to cast that idea and so you know he takes the the different kind of little gods or the like the the woodland creatures and the woodland spirits and he recast them in his narnia series as being somehow something which i think are akin to the gin like are these these these these characters that you don't really know like they're kind of neutral they're you're not sure some of them are with asl and some of them aren't and some of them can flip anyway so i just thought i just was wondering about that because i see that someone like jesus seems to have tried to to create something akin to that in his in his series yeah and and you know i mean so you know you know you and i have talked about tolkien in the past a little bit and tolkien tries to deal with this on some level too right so on the one hand you know we were talking earlier about the idea of spiritual beings were engaged at kind of every level of creation kind of helping to make it go like one of the best fictional depictions of that is in the silmarillion by j.r tolkien when when you have the one god who creates this you know the angelic beings and they're engaged in all this and so forth and then and then some of them rebel right justice happened in the real the real world and at the same time then there's various kinds of creatures that exist in his world like like you know that that seem to not necessarily always be entirely aligned in one direction or another although if you really had to sort them out i think you could probably do it but like the one of the ways that he attempts to kind of solve this problem is you have men and elves but he essentially says that elves are essentially a kind of version of man you know that they're two different types of peoples of the same one species yeah right like a cat like a caste system of some kind sort of yeah sort of but but of course you know elves can be evil too even though like when you encounter them in the lord of the rings they're generally you know almost divinized right but but yeah so so it's interesting how how there's various people that are attempting to kind of work out how to deal with these problems of you know the the how do you represent spiritual forces in the world and also what do you do with the fact that mankind has always kind of seen up until relatively recently has kind of seen fairies and sprites and gnomes around every tree i think one of the problems that makes it difficult for us to understand that is that especially since the victorian era a lot of those creatures have been have been kind of domesticated so like tolkien hated for instance one of the things he hated about shakespeare now he's pre-victorian but one of the things he had about shakespeare is that shakespeare's fairies are kind of too small they're they're too weak right they're too cute and and that really becomes extreme in the victorian peter pan yeah yeah right and and now you get you know images of you get tinkerbell tinkerbell is the ultimate in cute fairies although it's interesting how tinkerbell is then presented in pure pan as being ultimately dangerous right tinker bell attempts to kill wendy you know so so even then you saw this idea that they're dangerous but but but they've been made much much smaller right whereas tolkien's elves and and fairies and so forth are a dangerous people to run into and generally not a good idea so one of one of the things that i don't bring up often but i think in this case it's it's probably a good idea to bring up the the author renegade who was like an early century traditionalist and he was he came out of the occult some of the stuff he wrote is very is off some of the stuff he wrote is quite good but his one of his theories that he has was that materialism was like a wall that the civilization had built around itself to protect itself or to isolate itself from the spiritual world let's say and he said it was actually in a certain way successful like there it's true there are less miracles there are less manifestations you know it's a from the enlightenment on there less and less connect connection with what you would call the spiritual world and so the materialism philosophical materialism and then had actually created this wall around the world but his theory was that at the end one because that can't hold at some point it's going to start to crack and he called it the great fissures in the wall but he said when the wall cracks it's going to crack at the bottom it's going to crack below and it's the stuff from beneath that are going to come up right and but people are still going to be more isolated from the higher beings and we've seen like he wrote that maybe in 1920 and we've seen it you know with all the new age insanity and all the craziness we've seen it kind of happened manifest itself and so this brings me then to the question of the you know kind of what you're trying to bring back which is you know the book of enoch and the you know the enochian traditions we could call them have been controversial like to a certain extent in christianity but nonetheless it seems like they do offer us a way to deal with this in the world as we see these beings kind of creep back into reality you know they it offers us a a let's say a a map or a guide to help us understand what exactly is going on i don't know if you've thought about that well i think building off what you said i think the the the rule of christ gave us the luxury of materialism for a while right because because the western world christendom right as such right the fact that there there weren't practicing pagans and and so sort of idolatry and the the religious aspects of sexual immorality had been kind of ruled out it kind of created this space where there weren't a lot of demonic manifestations and people getting possessed and these things which were commonplace in the ancient world and are still commonplace in in some parts of the world but within christendom they became relatively rare and that allowed everyone to become materialists right but the problem is that materialism then turned on christ himself for a while in the'th and 19th centuries they kind of put brackets around god and christ and said well we'll get rid of all the rest of this stuff but we'll keep those but once you deny those you lose that sort of protection and that's why you get sort of the return of of demonic powers of chaos sort of welling up from the bottom like you described and in terms of the anakic literature in particular it was actually less controversial in the ancient church than it is now i think frankly sola scriptura has poisoned the well in the west where we even most orthodox people have this very binary view of like something is canonical and therefore 100 percent true and literal or it's non-canonical and therefore it's full of lies and it's garbage and you shouldn't read it and it's bad yeah why do you think the narcic literature was lost because to a certain extent i think the only copies of those texts were kept in ethiopia and most of the whole world had lost those traditions they were they kind of had faded away in some way in the west in the west they had we we know they were still in circulation in the 8th and 9th centuries you have byzantine historians drawing on that when they write their chronicles and write the history of the world they're pulling directly from first enoch for all of their early history of the world interesting and george singalos in the cinquelos in the eighth century basically said this is the byzantine word on first zenith he said it was a apostolic apocryphon what he meant by that was in the original meaning of apocrypha something hidden so he was saying this is this is a text that has this information that's part of the apostolic tradition part of the apostolic preaching saint irenaeus and his on the apostolic preaching basically sights straight from first evening but scripture states quotes from enoch like it's but it's it's hidden in that it's not read publicly in the churches right because that's what canonical means means we read it in liturgy right it's not ready liturgy so it's hidden in that way but it is this apostolic tradition even saint augustine and i hate bashing saint gunston because he gets picked on way too much but saint augustine is really the first one to really reject oh really yeah and that's why it sort of fell into disfavor in the west because the west became all about saint augustine but even he when he talked about the book of enoch itself said that well yes enoch wrote something right he says saint jude quotes it as being from enoch he says but this text is so old that would mean right that means it's it's antediluvian it's for before the flood he says it's so old we have no way to verify that what we now have is the original book of enoch okay that's why you shouldn't trust it right right right that was his argument it wasn't to just say this is spurious yeah right or it was it was so even he who was the first one to really be against it had this sort of marginal acceptance and st jerome at the same time his contemporary went into a protracted argument about how well noah must have had a copy on the art like to explain how he's going all out my goodness like how could this survive well noah must have had a copy that he got from his great-grandfather and brought with you know this whole elaborate thing so it was much more accepted in the early church because they didn't have they really had three categories they had canonical that's read in liturgy they had books to be read in the home and then they had books not to be read right or heretical and the the the books to be read in the home so you still find people the fifth and sixth century quoting the shepherd of hermas authoritatively for example but they wouldn't have said it was canonical they wouldn't have read from it in liturgy but they're still quoting from the same thing with first enig all the way into the the the eighth and ninth century with examples we still have yeah well i'm happy to to hear that because i have been trying to let's say slowly reintroduce the ideas from from first enoch mostly because it seems like it offers us a map of what's happening around us right now because one of the stories of first enoch is of course the the increasing of technicity which is connected with magic we try we tend to want to separate those but they're they're really very similar in the sense that there's a an accelerated modification of nature which is brought about by connection with these these demonic beings and these demonic beings teach you know all the different crafts and the different also ornamentation which is important in in in i think it's as zazel who teaches both metallurgy and ornamentation which is like which is such a great great connection between the two weapon making and seduction making you know but so but so it seems like we're going through the same the same situation that was happening first enoch this acceleration of technicity the loss of virtue the loss of morality the falling into sexual immorality to an extreme degree all of this is kind of happening at the same time as we're talking about as we're talking about the notion of creating an ai for example that would be this artificial intelligence i always tell people if you want to know what a fallen angel is just imagine what ai is going to be like that's probably going to be the closest thing you're going to you're going to come into contact with nai so anyways maybe tell tell me a little bit about your perception of that that trope that i'm trying to bring up here yeah i think i think you're right and you know one of our problems in looking at material from the ancient world is we tend to assume materialism as being what's actually true and so when we see stuff from the ancient world we tend to think like like we're trying to give them a break we'll say oh well they saw lightning and thunder and they didn't understand it and so therefore they had to come up with thor or paroon or procunus or zeus you know and and and then that was their explanation and so they then they wrote stories you know there were probably initially metaphors and eventually people took them as being real and then they thought that zeus was a real being right as an example but but the problem is that number one doesn't take seriously what these people are saying about their own actual experiences right and you know that they're actually encountering divine beings and they're engaging with them that's what they say about themselves now we can simply say they're all lying if now but if we accept that idea then we're basically saying that almost every single text from the ancient world is a lie that people are lying about their their actual lives you know across the world consistently and interestingly they're lying in in very similar similar ways throughout the whole world the whole globe right you know like i'll give an example that blew my mind when father stephen first told me about it he said almost every ancient culture when they depict spiritual beings that they encounter depicts them as being about 15 feet tall everywhere africa asia indo-european cultures south america egyptians everyone's everyone is depicting their gods as being about 15 feet tall like what is that about i mean i could explain like you could explain i don't know maybe you could explain it right like so like you could for instance do the historical critical thing and say okay well maybe someone at some ancient indo-european point depicted a 15-foot tall god and so then therefore all of these indo-european cultures got the 15-foot tall god from that and it kind of spread out from there right you know essentially kind of explain it linguistically you know but the problem is you have cultures that are not connected to those cultures at all that are depicting the same things so you could either say like wow that's an interesting massive enormous coincidence all over the world everywhere or you could say well maybe they're all having a similar experience and so they're all therefore all depicting the same experience that they're all having you know and and so like that's that's one example of these things that are kind of right in front of us but that we just sort of just disbelieve them from the outset right but but i think you're right that that we are now experiencing this kind of increase in for lack of a better term spiritual activity right and it's funny like i one of the jokes that father stephen and i have sometimes made about the way that we're already interacting people with people about the lord of spirits podcast is to you know at some point we're gonna have to say look we're not ghostbusters you know we are we are number one if we are ready to believe you we are ready to believe you you know but but that's like that's not what we're talking about but it's interesting that what happens in the ghostbusters films right is the sense of this increase in spiritual activity you know they're talking about that so that's that's interesting it's in ghostbusters it's all materialist it's almost yeah it's all ectoplasm and like capturing the ghosts in these machines it really is like the worst of 19th century kind of materialist magnetism all that kind of i'm sorry to say crap that came over the 19th century to kind of to make the the spiritual world into mater into material categories yeah yeah people had seances and then they would gather this goo which was like electro yeah yeah that i think the dynamic your point which obviously is front and center in the book of the watchers in the book of enoch about the connection between the increase of kind of demonic activity and the increase in technology has to do with the way even if we just stick with the old testament the way in the old testament that the the spiritual powers of of chaos and evil attack right that their goal is the destruction of god's creation in general and humans in particular right and the way they do that consistently is by trying to give to humans ideas thoughts wisdom knowledge that they're not prepared for that they aren't in a spiritual state to receive yet because they know that will cause self-destruction that starts with the serpent with eve you know take the knowledge yeah right yeah that you're not prepared for yet it's not that the tree was evil it's that they weren't prepared yeah and all the way through and that's the same thing in the watchers story right where i'm gonna give them you know weapons technology they're not prepared to use it responsibly right and so they're gonna use it to kill each other i'm going to give them these means the women these means of seduction right because they're not prepared for it and they're going to they're going to fall into sexual immorality all these this destruction and chaos comes yeah and it's knowledge that fills your desire this knowledge to fulfill your desire for power for domination for seduction all of these things that it's basically how to act upon the world to get what you want is what they're giving the people yeah and and that's that experience again like father andrew was saying is universal that's why you read about prometheus that's why it's it's it's all of that understanding that there are these spiritual powers who gave to man knowledge he wasn't ready for that's been destructive and they were punished for it is is universal yeah around the world and you see it it's funny because you even today i don't know because i i've i've mentioned this before i've been sadly i mean strangely you've been connected with all these people doing doing psychedelics and so you know they talk about these mechanical elves that they meet whatever they call them cockrells or whatever machine elves machine elves are i don't know and i keep and i read a story a comic book story about santa claus which was written by a weird pagan guy grant with a grant morrison wrote a santa claus story and and he has santa claus meeting these machine ls right he takes some some mushrooms or whatever then he sees these elves and then he he makes toys better but then he also like ends up making his sleigh into like a super sleigh or whatever but what i was thinking is that wow they're actually encountering the demons from first enoch like they're they're they're actually encountering these beings that are giving them like mechanical formula or they're giving them showing them technological feats that they that they then kind of encounter and so it's just very strange because we already have this story from the stories from thousands and thousands of years ago but we seem to be going through similar process right now yeah and and ayahuasca isn't a new thing right like it's better to give you an idea of how long it's been around the greek word that's usually when you read sorcery in your english bible the greek word that's usually behind that is pharmaca yeah because they were using pharmaceutical right even the oracle adelphi was inhaling fumes coming out of a a crack in the ground to produce an altered state of consciousness in order to be possessed by the spirit of apollo you know and and give these oracles so yeah it's not a new thing that experience has just continued into the modern world and you know one of the things i think that makes so much of this stuff very urgent is that like we were just talking about drug use for instance right for a lot of people they might ask like why why is it immoral for me to do psychedelic drugs right and i mean if you listen to everything we just said then it becomes clear why it's a super bad idea why it's a rebellion against god because you're entering into communion with these other spirits it's dangerous it's like it's like going on down a dark road without anybody to guide you and you know you encounter beings and you think they're there to help you like what are you talking what are you doing this is really not safe yeah and it's and you know what's what's interesting like if you understand christian morality not just in terms of a list of things you're supposed to do and not supposed to do but but rather actually like this is the right way to interact with the with the spiritual world as it as it actually exists then all the other elements for instance of christian morality such as sexual morality and even things like like the right way to worship god like this all makes much more sense if we understand it as not just being instead of arbitrary tastes or preferences or or even just desires but this is actually you're interacting with reality and there are things that result from that interaction right so like that's why for instance over and over again in scripture you've got idolatry and sexual immorality are just paired together as always going together you know as as an example and and i think it's it's it's you know it's it's frustrating on the one hand to see the modern world just diving headlong into immorality not because it's like we're sitting here and saying look how moral we are how dare they you know like that's not but but the problem is a lot of people that's how they see what christianity is that's what they think christianity is a sort of moralism but but really it's like it's like that that immorality is immoral not because it violates a law somewhere in the sense of a a legal code but but rather that it is you know it's like telling your children not to stick their hand on a hot stove like that's reality like it's not just right and wrong don't tell me what's don't tell me what to do dad you know like no it's like no you are going to be burned if you engage in immorality you are entering into communion with demons you are you know that that's just an objective truth and you can watch people like i saw this as a pastor watch people who who get into the get into it a little bit and then get it to a little bit more and get it to a little bit more and then you know they would not even recognize where they had gone you know when they got it where they were at the beginning of that process and so this to me this is i'm i could just say that i'm very excited to see where this is going to go and i'm really i'm really happy to to that you're taking this trip and in a way i'm happy that you're doing it then i'm not doing it because first of all i don't have the knowledge to do it of course but also because i know this road is going to be fraught with all kinds of strangeness that is going to manifest itself to you in terms of in terms of demonic things attacking you but also people coming to you like like father father andrew already said coming for help trying to get them to to deal with these experiences that they've had that they don't understand in a modern world where you know all of this has been although we although it's everywhere in our fiction it's everywhere in our stories you know in the real world people try to avoid it or try not to talk about it or put it to the side but nonetheless it's the if you look at all the card readers and all the new age stuff and people are trying to understand this and so and so i'm happy to see that that i've got orthodox priests trying to guide people along the road so they don't get lost i think that you know and and i say this not in a kind of to draw attention to us kind of way but but i think the fact that we are priests it's not just a question of like authority right in the sense of like although it is we're talking about principalities right so so that's the kind of authority yeah right that's the authority that i mean is you know and it's interesting like for instance i've i had the experience one time just and this was this happened years ago where my wife was somewhere and i mean i wasn't even present but my wife was somewhere and this woman approached her in public and essentially kind of offered her i don't know if it was a seance or a fortune telling or something like that like you know and my wife told me that she looked the woman straight in the eye and said my husband is an orthodox priest that was the one thing she said and she said that the woman like drew back in sort of shock right right so it's it's like it's it's not that it's not that like i'm some holy person i'm not i'm not but but as as priests our task is to stand at the altar and to to facilitate people communing directly with god and being engaged with the angels and the saints and so you know there are many times you see in scripture where priests engage in this kind of spiritual warfare not again not because they have some special holiness all their own but because this is the way that god has chosen to to work right you know that offering incense that offering up the eucharist these things are spiritually powerful and and not just in an individual way that makes somebody have a spiritual experience but but like you know for instance that offering up incense fumigates the space from dark powers like that's literally what is happening when incense is being it's clearing them out you know and you see it happening in the bible right it happens you know father stephen what was that what's that passage where you see is it aaron and a couple of other ones like there's some kind of plague that has happened with the people of israel and so they offer up incense to to drive this out after after the rebellion of korra aaron takes his sensor and his sons take their sensors and sort of stand betw the languages that they stand between the living and the dead offering offering incense and as they stand there sort of the plague stops at that line like that that forms the the sort of barrier between between life and death and yeah that that's and this is another one of those things that ancient people just understood you see people offering incense and incense is offered as a sacrifice there are altars of incense right but it says is offered all over all over the world in every culture and it's so ingrained that the the greek word for purification right catharsia right is derived from the acadian word for incense kataru that's where it comes from and there's something i think the materialists who are watching this who are listening to this they really struggle to to understand this stuff and i always want to try to point them back to the notion of intelligence and the notion of consciousness that that we brought up at the beginning which is that if the world is constituted by consciousnesses or by intelligences that if these intelligent patterns are the way in which the world lays itself out then it's not strange to think that ritual behavior or that acting in a way that is meaningful will will be part of it will alleviate these problems that that doing certain things that have meaning and that have that have a coherent kind of symbolic ritual meaning will affect the world because that's how the world lays itself out all as meaning and as intelligence is of course if people can't even concede that or understand that then then it all looks like superstition and bunk and just whatever but we do it all the time we use meaning to to affect the world all the time you know and the most recent one is one of them the most real ones is this mask wearing thing so so much of the mask wearing thing is a ritual behavior i even saw someone posted recently a a post from the new england journal of medicine saying that the the main aspect of mask wearing is a talisman function where as people wear the mask they feel safe and they they are willing to act out in the world because they have this kind of protective garment that is shielding them from from their perceived danger you know and so that's and that's a that's a ritual that's a ritual behavior yeah i mean it's it's i think again just basic that that ritual well ritual does something right too often people look at ritual they obviously 99.999 percent of people in the world have never studied ritual theory but but we look at ritual we tend to look at it in this sort of diagnostic way where even if we're talking about the liturgy or the parts of the liturgy right well this represents this and this represents that and this stands for that but what ritual does something and so yes the person who participates in ritual is going to be shaped by that the community that participates in ritual is going to be shaped by that they're going to be brought together as a community that community is going to be formed in certain ways and the example i use with people who are just raw materialists is i talk to them about sports maybe this only works in the u.s i don't know maybe it works with with football other places like non-american football but but that right it does not matter what socks you wear in terms of whether your team will win or not it doesn't matter whether you watch the game like on a materialist level yeah it doesn't matter what you do it's not going to affect the outcome of the game but you cannot tell a sports fan that what they do and their rituals and those kind of things you know dressing up like a team member yeah you're right yeah just look like a team as far as they're concerned that's part of the game that's part of their team winning is is their support from their house miles and miles away you know so we understand it at some base level even if we won't let ourselves fully sort of appropriate it that the example i always use is shaking hands because you know you could say shaking hand represents showing your hands that you don't have a weapon that shaking hands represents you know a movement towards the other blah blah blah but it doesn't just represent it it you're actually doing the thing you're encountering someone and the gesture is creating the bond between you and that person it's not just they represent although you can you can find all the meaning and it's there you can you can show you can show how all of this is very very meaningful but it's also acting in the world and transforming the world in the way that that ritual does yeah yeah well this has been we've been going for way longer than i usually go i knew this was gonna happen but but i am really excited like i said and i and i first of all appreciate you coming on here and i want to tell all the people listening to tune in there's it'll it'll probably be a lot to think about a lot to discuss a lot to debate about i'm certain you you're going to create all kinds of controversy with this podcast which is going to be good controversy that'll bring up the bring up help us understand a lot of the the spiritual malaise that is in the modern world today so thank you for for your time and thank you for all your efforts but it's really hard because it's so huge i mean i mean you you can talk about that you'll be able to talk about this for seasons and seasons of this podcast years i think i think there's years with the podcasting here we we started out with monotheism is bunk so it could be yeah more from here i totally agree i made a video like was it two years ago called the problem with monotheism and especially for the modern atheists it's such a such a great thing to understand you know when someone you know you this argument you've seen it probably online where they say you know i'm you're an atheist too i just believe in one less god than you do right like you know what you've got the wrong guy because i believe in all the gods that's right yeah oh yeah yeah that's it and it's you know we only brushed on it in the first the first podcast but you go and take any old testament course at a university in the united states i'm sure this is doubly true in like canada and europe and you know and they're going to tell you that israel started out polytheistic like everyone else and then they evolved they do monolatry and then they evolved into you know unitarian monotheism sometime around the time of of christ and then they watch around the time of christ is when they they go that far really oh yeah yeah they have it all laid out and it's they've just adopted wholesale this 19th century german thing that yeah yeah yeah the hegelian thing because then what they want to do is they want to say okay so monotheism is the thesis or no polytheism is the thesis monotheism is the antithesis and the trinity is the synthesis oh right okay that's the thing right they want to do that whole hegelian move you know look at rabbinical judaism they have all the weird stuff like they have way more weird stuff than we do oh yeah that there are there are some key books that i recommend to people all the time by orthodox jewish scholars talking about second temple judaism and the fact that they were not unitarian monotheists that they were at least bynatarian sometimes more in fact benjamin summer who's a professor at jewish theological seminary in the us who wrote one of those books in a talk said that trinitarianism is tame compared to a lot of forms of judaism because he was talking about different forms of kabbalah that have like a hundred yeah like a hundred persons of the godhead yeah well if you even the the the famous sephiroth tree like they have ten manifest ten ten let's say manifestations of god and it's all god like the whole truth is god and so it's like wait so what's your problem with the trinity already yeah yeah and so he he just comes out and says you know this is this is but this is i like sending people to the jewish sources on it yes then they can't say i'm trying to pull something right i'm like no these these are orthodox jews they don't have a dog in the fight right like they're all right it was great to talk to both of you and and i'll i'll send you a link as soon as this is posted i might even try to post it today or maybe tomorrow morning thank you jonathan we appreciate it yes thank you for having us and so and maybe in a in a few months once you've you've given us a full demonology and angiology
