i thought i thought you could have fall for it i thought i actually could grab it hello friends and welcome to the razer zephyr mask oh i didn't even think you would think of me like oh i'm so excited so if you're not familiar with our friends over at razer they make some wacky stuff sometimes we made an entire video on some of the goofy stuff that razer makes but this has got to be top 10 weird things this is a bluetooth mask that has not only rgb because razor it also has changeable filters and it has actually that's pretty much it right oh well it's got a motor inside so you're not just breathing in and out you're being puf you're circulating air i have a way that we can test this that you may or may not approve of fart in my face let how a pink eye no oh activate it's a nice little hum got to say if this is actually how loud it is though that's kind of loud put the bottom strap around my nape what's my nape is this oh my go the back of your neck oh wow as i breathe i can hear the fans like i don't like that i can see your mouth no no no no no so when it comes to the zaper i have a few different functions so right now i'm on low fan speed i could kind of do this although honestly i feel like i want it on high just cuz i need more air flow now i can change my internal lighting right so you see my mouth right now so i'm going to go blue god that's even worse no no that's slightly better would you guys wear one of these nope nope with a 10ft pole not a not a chance i don't want people f hyper focusing on my mouth those two leds next to it look really cool mhm but when it lights your mouth no i personally don't think that being able to see my mouth is the most important thing for me but i understand that for a lot of people that actually is a major selling no i figured it out the the way that the that the plastic is curved on it yeah it magnifies the size of your mouth i don't no no no no you stop that is that why this looks like logic an annoying orange activate mystery tech ultimate ears are these headphones for your ears only follow these simple steps to find your perfect fit so typically when it comes to doing these fully custom inar monitors you have to actually go to a space they need to measure your ears and they essentially build a custom set of headphones that are exactly meant for you right are actually not too bad 250 that's it so just for context these custom inar monitors typically will cost you i mean i think starting at 500 bucks but they often times will go up to and above $11,000 i mean they're very expensive cuz think about it you're not just buying a nice pair of earphones you're buying something which has been completely custom molded to your ears all right so we're going to take our case we're going to open it up place our earbuds in try them on okay you mo mold both sides at the same time okay so we're basically i'm going to put them in my ears adjust them until they feel comfortable okay i mean that pretty much immediately feels pretty good to me so it's just playing a little bit of like a beat so i just need to like gently adjust them until i find it that sounds where it sounds the best oh they're about to start getting warm and molding to my ears oh boy oh it's getting warm wa okay they're very warm right now but it's happening they're essentially curing the tips yo this is very cool so i'm going to go ahead and put them back in the case now and install the the software update battery life apparently is 8 hours of earbud battery life 20 hours with the case okay 10 minutes of charge for 60es minutes of listening that all sounds pretty solid 8 hours is actually pretty good considering that most earbuds like airpods and galaxy buds are usually little clos to like 3 to five i think is probably the norm there are a couple of concerning things as far as using these as like daily earbuds the case is big right i'll try to fit it into my little pocket but like this is always the test can a pair of earbuds live in your little coin pocket right cuz if it can't i'm not going to say i'm not going to carry them all day but i only have so many pockets and this is my ear bud pocket ooh that's that's chunky i could carry these that's borderline too big but i think it might work i'll immediately say i think the left is a little bit of a better fit than the right i hear a little bit more bleed from the right but let me actually do the test and see it looks like your earbuds are fitting well that's i said everything's okay and it's like great everything's good the thing that i just kind of pause a little bit with these though is the sound quality they don't sound bad i would put them in the same category as something like a pair of airpods but that's not a ringing endorsement right if you think about the statuses that we've taken a look at on a previous episode of mystery tech excellent sound quality and they have that really long battery life admittedly in a chunky sort of case but they're certainly not this expensive if the fit is the most important thing you're looking for then yeah these are great but the problem is is that there are other headphones that are cheaper that deliver similar sound quality and a whole lot more features right with active noise cancellation with the transparency mode with the ability to easily swap between devices these really have one claim to fame and while it's good i don't know if it's $250 good when so many other great bluetooth headphones exist hey ken i have a proposition for you mhm i'm going to run the segment of mystery tech hello it's me austin greetings friends today i'm going to share some of my favorite tech with the room except that i'm going to keep it all but you guys just get to watch me open it the tyranny is over this right here is the analog pocket now analog has made a number of different retro inspired devices over the years in fact back in like 2016 or something we actually did a video on the analog what was it the nes whatever they called it the nt or something but the pocket is without a doubt the most ambitious console they've done yet the analog pocket oh my god i'm so this thing is i'm going to touch it for the first time it's plastic what i definitely thought this was metal now if you've played a game boy or any kind of sort of more old school console that uses a 1989 lcd you know the screens are terrible right no backlighting the thing with the analog pocket is that it has such a modern high resolution display that it can not only play the game but you actually can get all like the little sub pixel detail and accurate color and whatnot from what i've seen this thing is next level i'm going to update the os but analog were very kind to send over quite literally all of the accessories the game gear adapter so the nice thing is this out of the box will work with game boy game boy color and game boy advanced games you can just drop them right in but if you want to play some other titles including game gear games you can add the little adapters and it will work for that as well we also have the analog dock so if all this wasn't enough you can hook this up via usbc and then you are able to play your games in high quality on a tv which is nice although let's face it i want to play it on the actual this way the os is incredibly simple nanoloop is the digital work station for gba i'm going to make music i'm making music first i don't know how to make beats we're just going to move on let's start with an original game boy game oh my god that looks great let's go boys let's go oh no get away less blue flag blue flag the way that it emulates the game boy screen is incredible because you can see the individual pixels you also see like the lines the to go around the pixels oh that is sweet all right all right all right i get the idea let's actually play a game that's not terrible polaris snowcross is this a 60fps game on a game boy holy crap well that makes such a big difference to the responsiveness compared to like f1 race which is like 5 frames per second we can use game gear we can use a bunch of other things but what i'm curious about is how it handles a game boy advance game which has not only a different resolution but also it has a different aspect ratio yo wait wait wait i can tell if i look super closely it's not perfect scaling on the game boy dance but it's still very sharp it also sounds great [music] too and the nice thing is if you're done playing for a minute hit the button it goes to sleep you don't actually have to like restart your game or save or anything like that oh you should always save your games now at first i was a little bit turned off by the idea that it's plastic cuz i thought like in all the images it looked metal but the more i use it it's a nice nice sturdy plastic it's a little bit matte but also it's a game boy you kind of actually want it to be plastic i think and no more i kind of use it like the buttons don't have like some super highend feel like they're not like really tactile or clicky or anything like they're still a little mushy but they're mushy in the exact same way that a game boy was in fact i'd say they're actually slightly higher quality than the kind of buttons you got on a game boy this isn't the end of the segment i got more items we ain't done son this is not something that normally lands on mystery tech right but i receiv received something in the mail that i just have to share can you see this little poke ball on the letter for austin from john p h10 please put in a whery tech well this is mystery tech but how could i say no you put a pokeball on the front of it very excited thank you john for your kind contribution to this episode of mystery tech oh my goodness oh my goodness look at this all right so we've got ourselves a note here dear austin first of all i love your videos and your podcast shout out john heast test drivers

i'm opening the box all right one cyber quad has been assembled how fast is this supposed to go 10 mil an hour okay oh oh okay it has lights that's cool all right onward wait this going to be oh he's really going for it there he [music] goes oh oh oh oh oh oh oh [applause] okay how do 10 mph feel huh how's it going getting some cardio in oh [music] absolutely can you pop a wheelie do you want to he's going to i can't do a wheelie but i can definitely put it sideways oh oh [applause] oh [music] hello and welcome friends to austin catching boxes for the first time in his life oh oh this is my item thanks all right so this is something that i backed on indiegogo i think a year ago so the xbox series s is a great little console but you know what's missing portability which is where the x screen comes in do you remember the ps1 with the display that you attach to the top it's that same idea for the series s however while this is not an officially licensed microsoft product from what i've seen from the mini mini indiegogo backer updates i've gotten over email the last year they put a lot of serious time and effort into developing something which will actually make sense serious time serious development now i'll be honest i backed this long enough ago that i don't remember how much i spent on it you plug this into the series s it takes advantage of the hdmi and the usb however you are going to be losing your second usb as well as your ethernet i guess is fair enough but you do still have access to your storage expansion and your power and to be fair you still do have an additional usb port on the front so you can charge your controller and whatnot y that's just not lining up right m if you get a running start i'm sure you could oh i got it i got it i got it okay took a little bit of persuasion first thing the color match is very close but not perfect this i would say is a very tiny shade of white off it's a touch more sort of beige versus white how does it look when you close it i mean that actually that's really good that's not bad i like that what's the stand for so open the x creen flat lift front of xbox and attach feet oh so it's like this yeah so you can that's that's that's it gets an eye level i'm now much more convinced that this is totally cool and worth it oh that is awesome it's like a little kiosk you are blowing hot air directly into your face but n that's fine dude the series s it's it's warm air all right does this fit in here all together i would hope so does nicely actually and then i guess you can put your extra power cables and whatnot here oh that is that is a cool package wa all right let's turn on the xbox i mean i will say the viewing angles are not bad also it's a it's a matte display it's not gl glossy haven't played a game yet i'm looking i think this is this this this is feeling like a good product to me right now two jz can't go wrong around when it is safe to do so oh the sound an 11.6 in display completely will mask any of the deficiencies in the performance of the series s because 1080p on a display that's this small is going to look super super short the pixel density is way high on this you know i will say this layout does blow hot air towards you i actually didn't think it was that noticeable but when you have the series s directly facing towards you you do notice it huh okay hang on let's try it in the standard configuration the series s laptop i'm not used to playing games like this close so it actually feels a little bit weird but it's good the screen it's good that the screen will go back a little more yeah yeah i can definitely like lean it back and honestly the fact that it's antic layer especially here in the studio where we have so many studio lights actually does help quite a bit supposedly if i close this screen if i've set it up correctly it will turn off the xbox so there the only way to find out right and oh that's cool you definitely just gave me a paper cut this is the fao schwarz step to your own tune tun giant dance on piano is this just an excuse for me to dance for mystery tech cuz i'm all about that right now all right this is a lot of oh my god wow oh most importantly it comes with the alphabet that's not the alphabet do you not know music theory kenneth so this is an fao schwarz staple fao schwarz is some new york store right it's a new york toy store it's yeah it's the toy store that everyone thinks of when they think of toy stores it's the one from home alone too yeah you know piano notes my pokemon's low on hp what am i going to [music] do does it do chords i don't know try it okay this is going to sound really racist but i want to learn how to play chopsticks and i've never done that before why that racist no no no no oh how are you what he almost minute that's racist wait what happens if you hit this there you go oh no no no no do it do it do it oh my god [music] virtuoso wait wait here get out of the way let me try this let me try this basally you just need to know the rhythm which you're still messing up on [music] [applause] go oh why did i try to catch that ow you did that i just put my hand underneath it to catch it and it just squashed my hand what's next you're going to sniff it too just a disclaimer for this one we've been sitting on this box for a while we haven't shot mystery tech since before the end of last year when did halo infinite come out december so this has been sitting around since december oh it's a halo thing okay i'm like way shock oh really did you really ask that i just i gave you the hint just a side note with halo infid weapon is better than cortana who weapon oh i thought you played the game but apparently not there's a lock on this crate i feel it like with microsoft you always have to check those pieces of cardboard don't think i needed the lock to be fair that that i definitely opened it beforehand just what i needed to i needed to sniff it out and make sure that it wasn't poison you open the it's not poison box number two oh god i bro dude found an elite controller why is it that everything i plan on taking you drop yo even the sleeved cable oh my god yo this is absolutely sick okay i love the gold d-pad the gold d-pad is really good yeah that is ridiculous i mean look the elite controller the specially spe shut shut up we get it english is hard it's all right oh yeah yeah don't mhm don't peek mhm oh my god is that chief chief looks like looks about 150 lbs too light but where's the arbiter i didn't know 117 stood for inches wait pretty good i'll be 117 in yeah that's still pretty good you know i got to say the helmet like that kind of looks like master chief's head and i don't really like that it's kind of like you actually beat him in person and and this is just your we' defeated the spartans oh my god oh wow you guys actually got the mini fridge so as a joke when the xbox series x first got announced everyone made fun of it because it looked like a fridge so the mad lads at xbox they didn't take a joke laying down they made an actual legitimate working xbox it's a mini fridge and yet it is 1 to.5 to1 scale so it's even bigger than a series x behold my friends something wiggled inside i don't like that behold the xbox series xxl wow it's even got the fake ports on the back do you see this you got the mega usb this is not 1.5 to1 scale that's way bigger than us b that's huge yeah that's oh oh my god yo oh my i can't believe they included that in there did you really put our series x inside the fridge no that was a little extra so this my friends is the glass sound speaker you're not inc by the way it's i'm trying to get okay okay create a cozy atmosphere with room filling sound you know that's what they they say about me oh oh i think we could leave that in there because you were so off that we can't even get copyright all right that looks sus h i mean what the this is very heavy like much heavier than it looks it's super super dense oh i turned it on oh is it touch control oh it's touch controls so you can slide so that's all the way forward or you can slide it down it's supposed to be like a candle light type thing why is it all the way at the bottom it doesn't fill up that tube at all i mean it's a nice little cozy sort of [music] vibe oh this is an interesting speaker because it looks cool and i think that that's a big reason why you buy this right it looks very interesting the sound though is not amazing it doesn't wow me in the way that this kind of i should the bas kind of rumbles over everything i do think though that i'm going to do the rest of this video lit by candl light no you won't no oh was weird now what the i'm a weirdo crouching around a bluetooth speaker so you may be familiar with an episode of mystery tech recently where we got to take a look at an incredibly cool custom game boy made by the one and only jake simmons well jake is here welcome to mystery tech my friends you've been wanting to do that for a while haven't you yeah i've been wanting to do this for a while so jake is a game boy effici andado he does an incredible amount of modding to make some of the coolest custom game boys ever today we're going to build one together hit me what' you got so we've got this pretty destroyed oh my god dude did you drag this behind a truck where did you find this i have a game boy guy i i got a guy so i didn't know if you wanted your overclock orange that looks great i'm kind of just going to let you loose and see what you can do that's how you get the best content yeah okay man that is that's that's bad so i can see that you started on a usbc where the charger went it's actually really simple there's so many people in the community that just do everything they have complete schematics they have got it down to the point where it's literally just there's one tab right there oh i see where you sold it down and that's all you need for the positive line and then securing it down will get you the negative so it's a whole little board you just drop right in that's incredible you know blackberry phones they still make phones okay blackberry got it that's a blackberry screen no serious this is like the most 2000th video ever so i have what three cables to wires to solder how hard could it be don't don't say that flash back to that clip i think i can handle it all right so iron coming in there you go beautiful give it a little pull that fast yep it's that fast wow okay oh okay oh what what do we have here i definitely thought that was a z flip skin cuz if you look at it it kind of looks like the two camera bumps and everything you know that's what i was trying to go for right is that really yeah oh wait how did oh he didn't get oh my a that is crispy this screen looks great it is so bright and vivid and the scaling also looks pretty sharp oh that's great look i am bad all the time what go away bowser the only reason daisy likes you is cuz you kidnap her bro get some real games that's not how daisy what super mario land yeah yeah one game out of like the 80 don't defend him is that wle oh it is wle don't tell the new york times though oh i only got one wait so look i got to get look you got to get a little wiggle going on wait wait don't oh what's this oh what is that is this an a connector oh my god that's cool what you can do this i'm here to do it so you don't have to okay i'm i'm just saying like it's a word jake where can people find you they can find me at youtube.com/ jes simmons you can win this by subscribing to your channel right now dude this is a sweet dmg man wow this will be available once i'm done with it wait what where are you going there's no door where where are you everyone just take a quick breather prepare yourself go fast is that sanic the hedgehog oh boy where's my sanic mask yeah boy let's go it smells like a dentist's office in here you know when they put their gloves in your mouth what the is this this is the whole item that just a sonic necklace that looks like it's actually maybe real jewelry or something it is sonic bling it's actually ice yo i'm sanic what's up i'm just straight chilling you know with my with my with my boy knuckles and and jim carrey who's a close personal friend of myself this is the whitest sonic i've ever seen and he's blue really i'm honored thank you what as someone who never ever wears a chain this feels cool no no no i'll got you that was so aggressive or at least it's just an innovative smart led sling bag and nothing that's fragile or expensive the bag i'm not really sure what i expected there i was like legitimately confused for a second why is it always to smell it does it smell like wish or does it smell like amazon it smells a little like wish oh god little wishy a little wishy here oh that's never good okay well we've got a usb port thank you very much sir so we're going to plug this in activate oh i mean the bag is made for me after all oh great you have to log in i create an account to use your bag wa so inside the app you literally just open up one of the pixel art like things that people have made and it just instantly works ready boom this is cool this is pretty cool little persona action here oh okay this is a little aggressive a little it's a little aggressive i'm not a huge fan of that one okay i saw that one coming i saw that one coming but you know how it is when you want to be the very best the best that ever was i don't know where my thumb goes there was some force behind that i did it with nine fingers look at how thick vulpix thighs are vulpix don't skip leg day that just didn't sounds good that sounds like it broke y'all really like leaning in the pokemon thing don't you a pokemon interactive watch and some more nonsense y'all want to explain yourself right now it's a whip look being being a pokemon trainer is not easy this is a different kind of training friend it's a wireless jump rope can i just ask a very simple question mhm why who needs a wireless jump rope isn't that the point you're supposed to jump over it i don't i don't like this this is not good so i just do this you feel like you're jumping rope no i don't at all i think technology has come so far i think this is doing exactly what it's promising that's actually kind of cute actually not that bad dude this thing for 30 bucks actually pretty good i we got to try the camera right [laughter] i don't know if that's the most flattering photo of myself that i've ever seen that felt heavy and aggressively thrown y'all just need to get some energy out you got a lot pin up something going on over here ready what is this is a yellow keyboard oh is it cyber punk no you idiot what what are you wearing oh oh it's pokemon don't mind me i just be doing my thing over here so we should point out that if you couldn't judge from the fact that it says pokemon asia this is stuff that you cannot buy in the us at least officially through razer's official networks what keyboard is that does it say i don't know what it's based on it's a mecha membrane keyboard oh look at that pikachu's tail i mean that actually is pretty cool yeah oh that's not terrible for a meming keyboard in addition to the keyboard oh you have a the wrist rest yeah that's pretty cool i don't know why they don't sell this in the us this is rad cuz lic oh yes i will say as a big fan of black and yellow i'm just i'm just saying i'm i'm just saying i came prepared today i'm not going to lie though the mouse pad pretty generic i will say if you look at it it's a different shade of yellow right it's a little a little bit darker which i think actually doesn't help it that much i'll actually say the mouse probably pulls the aesthetic together the best you have the little like pikachu tail which is where the i'm sure the led is you've got your little red buttons and red accents none of these accessories feel like they're the super expensive high-end equivalents on the razor side instead you're getting this much more so i think for the aesthetic look isn't it cool i'm being lit by the glow of the mouse right now and the brightness of my display [music] all i saw was something okay neo flying out of the corner of my eye to the point where i definitely just gave myself rug burn my hand is actually very red i don't know if you can see that but this is what you did to me okay that's much harder to open than i thought okay i got it i told you it was much harder open than i thought how dare you a nyx color sensor what's the point of a color sensor this table is brown i've learned that this table is brown excellent hold on here let's see what color is my shirt dark yellow let's see what color is mewtwo did you know what colors are that's not going to work it's you can't ask the audience what color they are black the camera is black oh god okay got it what's up the aqua shift xbox series x controller is that are you about to tell me this is going to show up as aqua but what's cool about these guys is that the grips are all unique there's no two that are alike ooh yo that looks awesome oh i like that wow and yeah you can see with the grips you see how they're very like almost looks like it's been like hydro dipped or something wait no no no no my jeans oh myy tech that was actually really gentle and kind we have mountain oh okay so mountain is actually something we featured on the channel before they had that crazy modular keyboard that you could attach a number row you could add like the little dial all kinds of stuff i guess they have more things they say here in their press pack $139 for the keyboard itself okay keyboard and key caps together is 160 and i believe that the number pad that's to the left of it which is really cool because it hooks up magnetically and has connectors is an extra 40 bucks that's a value proposition right there especially if this keyboard does sound as nice as i assume it would ooh all right all right all right let me take a look at this oh wow oh i like that oh put it down put it down put it down put it down wait i'm curious wait i want to try it next you're i'm first i'm first oh okay these pre-builts never sound that great that is probably the best sounding space bar i've heard heard from a pre-built oh yeah this is on another level you also have a number of switches here which i'm got to say i'm more partial to the white and the green i think i am too yeah this is a little bit more of a deny style if i were to to pit something no no no dany colors are the ones that you want but i'll let you have your pick no it's okay honestly i feel there's a dany video in this i'm actually going to seal this up unless you you have a crack at it so hyped on this for a few minutes and there are a few big takeaways for me personally i'm a big fan of this layout now of course because it's a 60% keyboard you are missing some things right so you don't have a function row and the entire thing has been shrunk down a little bit so one of the specific things they've done is they've shrunk your right shift to incorporate the ability of having full arrow keys for me totally fine i'm a left shift boy and having the arrow keys is something that i just can't not have like i just need that for any keyboard i use as a fan of linear switches these feel great and honestly head and shoulders above pretty much any pre-built keyboard that i've tried because most keyboards do not have loop switches most do not have great stabilizers and basically very few have any kind of real sound dampening on the inside if mountains out here doing this and like razor isn't i'm just saying what's that laptop you using right there oh is that a razor blade 15 that we just did a this is on he did it said the thing wow he promoted this is and you can only see him slightly having an aneurysm right now this is my joker origin story is right this moment right now high sense a7 highres audio is this a phone so let's see what we got is that a god e in phone say psych look how big this device is this is an iphone 13 pro for context this was 750 imported from ebay a lot of money okay i know that eink tablets have existed an e in phone though is wild to me can someone please explain to me why you want an e in phone 12 days of battery life 12 days i don't know i made that up wait no i want to use the camera how good is the camera camera's pretty impressive wow it's got a built in black and white mode cuz it's all black and white so the problem with this do you know how many shades of gray you have you sprinted head on into that one no way are you using this as your main device this might be a cool like secondary burn i mean secondary device but i'm going to guess this is running at about 10 frames per second while it's fine for some people would still be better if you bought an eink tablet because then you could actually draw on it and you have a little bit more to do and plus you want the biggest screen possible just because you want to be able to see to read and everything like that well okay at least you didn't knock over my coffee oh my god that's that's not what i expected that's so creepy the first ever mobile phone is now a real mobile phone oh cute wait the eyes the eyes move oh my god wa usbc yeah we're living in the future we actually bought this pre-order at launch but it sold out immediately wait is it actually rotary it's actually r oh my god i'm dialing i dial that number hello oh my god matt i'm talking to you on the telephone it sounds like so [music] dial ken don't touch my phone sylvania optical mouse and voip usb phone what the actual am i looking at so the idea is this is a mouse but then you open it up and then you can do a voip call or voice over ip wait where did you get this it's a po box someone sent this for mr someone sent this yeah oh my god dear austin can matt and everyone else i've been watching your channel for about a month now and i wanted to send something for you to either have fun with or more than likely mock and make jokes at this is an item that i purchased a goodwill for $599 that i intended to play around with thanks for all your hard work in making entertaining video i look forward to your future content you're a fan eric eric thank you very much see i have to deal with mystery teck from these guys and they just try to make fun of me all the time this is legitimately awesome my favorite part about that letter is he says he's been watching us for a month he's got us figured out to a t for one month he's got it down right now you really look like the kid from polar express like the know-it-all kid what know-it-all kid i think you need your ticket that's so so we got a usba end on one side and then the mouse which i will say is very heavy for a mouse which makes sense because surprise surprise bluetooth i mean not bluetooth usb skype phone what the hell well that came out of the mouse so that's probably a good sign oh also let me hang on let me just plug in my headset to my mouse there we go oh oh oh oh oh mouse is mousing oh my god it sets up as a usb audio device so unfortunately i don't think the screen is going to work without the windows xp drivers this my friends is an audio test of the usb voip mouse this my friend is an audio test that speaker has to be blown the fact that this thing is probably 20 years old i just plugged it in and immediately works there's something behind that can we please have the next item can we please have the next item oh we have a very small item this is oh the sony link buds these are actually some headphones i've been wanting to try for a while so my everyday carry headphones are the sony 1000x mark 4s featured on a previous episode of mystery tech and i honestly love these headphones a lot while comfort is not their strong suit the sound is great the fact that they easily pair between lots of devices whether it's android ios windows mac whatever is terrific now the idea with the link buds is that these are along that same kind of line except for the fact that they're really heavily focusing on comfort as well as giving you that oral experience that you're really looking for oral dude the oral blal with these headphones you can hear your surroundings because they have a little hole in them for your ears so we looked at experia buds or something like that a couple of years ago on mystery tech they were kind of a similar idea but those didn't sound particularly good but i hear that these might be a little better you hear that they sound a little better ah oh that's tiny m this is a good start i always look for small headphone cases to fit in my pocket and i'm going to tell you with resounding absolutely no it's a little strange because there's no real like ear tips oh wow that feels like there's literally nothing in my ears there is zero passive isolation like i can hear absolutely exactly the same immediately say lack of base right which makes sense considering that you don't actually have like a sealed sort of chamber it's kind of wild that i'm listening to this volume at like actually maybe even a little louder than i normally would and i can have a completely normal conversation with everyone in the room right now even with transparency mode i still feel like that's really difficult for me to do okay so here's something else that's unique about these you're not supposed to actually touch the earbuds you're supposed to touch around your ears or something i'm not entirely sure how that works oh does it work does it work yo that's wild so i'm not actually touching the earbuds i'm touching like my my ear on off [music] awesome yo it [music] works double paused i like these headphones a lot my only question here is the long-term comfortability after using them for a few hours i think these might be my headphones so what you're saying is i'm buying a personal what i'm saying is you don't get to steal these these are mine now i'm sensing something it's coming quickly there's an item on the way for myster tech i can feel it it's going to come out of the table i've caught it levitating bluetooth speaker you got me a ufo speaker yes all right i'm doneo so we've got the actual speaker itself which looks very unidentifiable it does actually look like a ufo oh that's kind of cool so i don't think i that's not how you do okay all right maybe i should read the instructions so i need to hold it slightly above move it vertically and then release it okay so i'm going to carefully position this okay it's leveling it's almost like zero gravity oh no no no stay in the middle stay in the middle stay stay stay stay i guarantee you i will get it first try go ahead just got to find the point never mind i lied all right watch matt's actually going to do a first try i believe in matt how many overclock employees does it take to put we don't have enough okay i mean we're already overheated okay okay plan b plan b plan b plan b okay it's floating we did it edit team you can you can composite this right in after effects that was not a fun did you make that noise no that was not a fun sound it's overheating okay oh oh oh wait wait oh that was it here here here here ready ready ready yeah oh let's go oh it's [music] vibrating is this video sponsored by the aliens i love how that's what you went to the only thing that goes through austin's mind is what's the sponsor for this video and after meeting austin they immediately said there's no intelligent life on this [laughter] planet dibs get out of box yet you can't call dibs i hav't the fip k2 multi-functional touch keyboard what the fip is this so that's a chun this feels nice you know what this reminds me of are the the assus laptops that have like you know the screen like with a ergol lift and whatnot yeah but this has a real keyboard on it it does yeah i mean obviously that's a full mechanical keyboard although that feels like a $30 mechanical keyboard theoretically if i plug the single usbc cable into a device that has full usbc with power delivery and display port and everything it will power my display and my keyboard all over one cable oh oh immediately thick hip shows up i just kind of wish that the screen would tilt up more it doesn't yeah yeah and it's also not a touch screen oh it is a touchreen a touchreen yeah it's a yeah that i remember seeing yep those are blues for $400 i would expect a nicer keyboard the keyboard itself very much feels like a $50 generic kind of like blue special that you can get on amazon one last thing that i want to check yeah make sure they're actually blues well no not so much hot swappable if they're hot swappable oh interesting hot sw you can hot swap oh still expensive the fact that it's hot swappable though actually kind of interesting i'm not going to pitch another dky video but ken you should make a dinky video on this i will i'm going to make the weirdest keyboards i could find all right don't subscribe to dany subscribe to this is is ccam focused yes are you sure yes okay i just double check what the hover pen hover pen 2.0 interstellar edition oh my goodness wow ken knows me ken knows that this is the kind of sh that appeals to me so i'm assuming this little thing in the end is a chunk of meteorite what does it smell like doesn't smell like space how do you know what space smells like and i've got a little stand for it so do i okay this this this is a complicated three-dimensional shape all right so oh my go okay no no you people have too much money there you go oh yo okay that's cool that's pretty cool i wore a hovering meteorite pen how much would i cost $169.95 you know you know what the funny thing is is that it's actually cheaper than that okay it's $100 for the base model is this the point where you tell me that this is not the base model yes the meteorite version cost $400 yo did you see that did you see that did everyone see that can we get a slow motion replay of that one this is the shadowcast console laptop link is this like reverse hdmi a capture card to get your game console to show up on your laptop display yes wow that is very small so it's literally hdmi on one side usbc on the other who needs xcloud when you have xwi okay you got me on that one i'll say when you have it in favor performance the quality looks like 480p favoring resolution looks a lot nicer got it all right let's see oh well that immediately feels [music] bad i mean there's definitely several frames of latency obviously we're watching this at 24 frames on the preview but no i'm getting like 20 fps right now yeah i'm switch to favorite performance all right let's see how that that goes still latency you using obs really mhm you think obs going to be better so i'm going to do is i'm going to add the gy as a video capture source just try that out latency seems a little bit better performance seems to be about the same where i do feel like i'm dropping frames this is actually not even as performant as a lot of cloud gaming all of those feel better than this it's a cool idea but i think the premise is a little bit flawed for some games if you don't care about that sort of really quick response time this is probably fine but the fundamental limits of the technology mean that even in the best case scenario you're only going to have so much performance it's certainly not going to be as good as pluging an hdmi cable into a display so that's a that's an l that's an l what we got for mystery tech today a play date oo okay so if you're not familiar the playd date is a tiny little i would almost say game boy like console but it doesn't play like emulated games or anything like that it actually plays its own specific titles now this is made by panic who have traditionally been more of a game developer but this is the first time i believe they've actually gotten into hardware it's my favorite band panic at the disco yes i chime in happ it you people ever closing the god godamn door oh oo okay all right what lovely packaging have fun i think i will first thoughts this hardware feels incredible so it's plastic right but it's kind of like that sort of higher quality almost like grippy kind of plastic and you've got the little like spinny dial thing which is not the way to charge it but is actually the way that you can actually like interact in some games if that was the only way to charge it i hang on i got to play mom i got to charge it for one more minute compared to an or dmg it is i mean obviously a lot smaller but it's a much sort of wider aspect ratio it's not 69 smells very slightly of plastic if i really get you get in there and just jesus christ okay well okay you know it's not a p oh here we go oh that's sweet that's so cool i love the haptic sounds the thing that jumps out to me most about the screen is the fact that it's not back lit so we're in a studio environment right now so we have a lot of lights which makes it really easy i think this could get annoying if you were not in a well-lit environment so i have two games built in right now although will download more every 7even days all right crank to turn okay so gnarly bro woo oh on on off all right all right i'm starting to get the idea though so it's really just the crank and i just move left and right yeah buddy yeah boy let's go let's go r bro let's go let's go the play date is super weird right it's one of these things that is incredibly quirky you might play it for a few hours never touch it again it's totally possible but this is fun these games are totally unique and while you're probably not going to waste 10 hours and play through a campaign on something like you know it's not that kind of game but the fact that you're getting games constantly updated to this it also is apparently easy for you to actually develop so i'm assuming that people are going to be third parties are going to be making playd stuff while i love something like the analog pocket that's just a better way to play games that i've played for decades this is something which is all new not only with the actual input method but the kinds of games and the actual hardware it's like nothing like you've ever played before it's a shame that austin's never going to touch it again cuz there's no pokemon on it now you know what i'm going to do what i'm going to take it all the way over to this is and make an entire video check it out subscribe to this is what's better than a good life a great [music] life a serenee life ken looks really excited right now that's never a good sign cuz you know he's going to take this immediately into i have no room ken face look at ken's face look how excited he is right now about this i have no room for the thing i'm about to steal what is this so i've got a nice foam mat i'm matte yeah that that matts over there i'm like am i building a tent is it a warming tent incubation pod do i grow this this is a deluxe personal therapy detox heated home sauna how much was this there better not be four digits in what you're about to say there's five digits including the cents $342 53 okay so just go ahead and sit down sit sit right in i feel i have a lot of clothes on for sa i'm going to get really swey i mean we don't want you to take your clothes off so we're going to go ahead and zip you in here okay you feeling good i feel like i'm in a quarantine unit all right turn on the oven oh my god why is it red why is it red i don't like the fact that it's wiggling it's wiggling what do you mean what matt is over here wiggling it right now matt matt matt's literally right over here dude it is now up to 82degrees i don't believe that i think it's a lot warmer than 82degrees in here celsius that's then i'm dead you can just flat out see the sa compared to everything else like the ambient room temperature is like 27degrees c and what's the how hot is this thing right now 86degrees c by the way on panels these panels are like not something i want to touch like even having my hands in front of it it feels like my hands are in front of the oven right now like this is proper toasty i got to say this is one of the few mystery tech items that has legitimately surprised me in a really really positive way it looks dumb it's such a weird idea but for a pretty reasonable price this is a real saa like i am proper i don't know if you can tell but i'm like proper sweating which makes sense i am super happy with this right now like this is great so if you're super happy with it we could keep you in there right no so guys want to go have a good one austin don't leave oh camera you can come too jo come on yeah yeah bye austin bye bye i'm all alone they've left me is that second gear or third [music] gear is that a nintendo switch a mysterious piece of technology from 2017 and oh i know this one cuz i found this one this is the orion gaming display we've done the ultimate switch before in fact we've done two of them but orion did it for us because this is a switch do and giant display built into one so we actually were looking for products for a completely separate video i saw this on amazon and insta bought it for mystery tech cuz this thing is wacky it's not mystery tech if you know what it is it's true you're cheating oh wow i breaking the rules of my own series this is not your our series okay so immediately this is much larger than i thought oh oh oh that's a seven out of 10 for stink that's that's that's not good smells like feet do you have your son with you yeah sorry he's right here that was mystery the velcro the velcro oh no no i would be a little concerned cuz you're putting this thing screen down which means that you could probably pretty easily scratch a screen this is what nintendo should have made to begin with does anyone know how big this display is cuz that that feels huge got to be at least 42 in power okay orion okay so we at least we've got the screen up and does it turn on the switch is my question how how do we actually activate the switch oh is there a pass through button on the top there's not you cannot touch the button on the switch me wait really can you remind me what video it was you were looking for when you found this this was scam busters amazon edition huh so the product that you found while looking for scams is not working 100% as intended oh canot connect to tv make sure you're using the ac adapter supply with the console oh o so switch is not happy with this theoretically if i plug this in now it will work or i've been scammed out of this thing's like what 200 200 bucks this was $200 maybe it was actually 29 9899 $2.98 you can go and buy one of those panels for like $17 this is top three worst items on mystery tech and i picked it which makes it so much worse i mean it makes sense you don't know how to pick that items every time you pick items it's either a pokemon card or something that doesn't work the mysterious technology it works i don't know what i did but it works unfortunately i have to stay tethered but whatever it's fine let's trick it let's trick it let's trick it no no no no no it works it works okay man this screen is not it like this screen is worse than the regular switch screen in every possible way except for the fact that it's bigger is there even volume control on it i'm trying to hit up and down it's just brightness not volume this is actually just bad in the thumbnail this looks great but for the actual like functionality it's too big the screen is low resolution and low quality and then there's so much like jank involved and actually getting it to work i mean there's some nice things the fact that the joy-cons actually not only mount but actually charge using this whole unit is cool but you're doing a whole lot of work to get a slightly larger display and i could have spent this $300 by 78 of a switch oled and that would have looked a million times better even though it's slightly smaller screen i just go get my pre myer tech workout okay weird flex got some gloves what what are these no no no no no i wanted to see if you could build a pc with these oh you know what the thing is you actually can kind of control it oh wa oh jesus christ oh i really don't like that i didn't hate it oh oh look sometimes you just need to be cressed by a cold mechanical object don't you feel like just giving someone a back scratch that's cool those noises don't sound great for fingures this is just spidery i don't like how spidery this looks wait what is this for though what i don't get this part i mean i think those were just extra cuz those weren't in the [music] listing oh no no my finger here so okay oh so ready oh i already like this i apologize to everyone for the nightmares oh that's sick creepy but sick freddy goes to the rave dude can i join da punk yet you're if da punk was in squid games now i can't see anything cuz i'm blind without my glasses so ohello wow it's like it's like if the sun got mad it's just unsettling that you have eyes oh what's this oh that one oh that's oddly terrifying i kind of like this that's kind of cute well it i don't like that looking different it's a minion i don't know minion noises think he's got a lazier eye than i do when the mystery tech budget is $115,000 oh so it does actually good for halloween i like oh that's creepy oh that that's creepy that's terrifying oh what's [music] wrong wow what oh oh oh i really regret this i wasn't ready when have you ever been ready you can't hit me with an msi lucky golden figure if i'm not ready for it i love 3si it does look like 3si i will say is there any context to this it's a 35th anniversary edition that's been sitting around for a year our limited edition msi golden lucky figure is more packaging matt you okay they just announced the ps6 on ebay right now yeah there's one opened yeah for $9,000 oh we're not that's a whole mystery tech bu someone get tape tape if you like to purchase this item that we definitely got from msi it's available the link in the description or on our ebay store okay tech meets aesthetic yo what are you seeing this right now oh my god if only they put this much effort into their peripherals ken can you stop getting us cancelled by 3si this is really rad so you got the little msi crest here tech meets aesthetic on the back you have your 35th anniversary thanks msi lucky is great and we're really excited to have him on the back her of our set until we need to sell him to pay rent one day i'm just going to put all this packaging in here for when the price is right message me if you're interested luck's for sale i'm feeling a wave would you one day let me finish a joke when a mystery tech item hits the table what you just want all right we've got ourselves the mx master 3s there's a 3s that's what i said okay and also the mx mechanical mini generally speaking especially when it came to like old school tech youtube these were the absolute coolest mice around now to be fair i have not used a logitech mx mouse in i think i probably stopped using like 2013 2014 so what is new on the 3s so they're upgrading from a 4,000 to an 8,000 dps sensor but the biggest thing is going to be that quiet click they claim that it is 90% quieter than the old mouse wait you're clicking it wait you're you're actually clicking it i can't hear it that's basically not a click i mean it feels fine for the record but it is basically just dead silent for context what a regular mouse sounds like and the master i actually like this quite a lot this is super ergonomic right it feels exactly like or very similar to the older logitech mice that i've used you've got the little click on on the bottom you have your sort of back and forward buttons onap too where everything is like shortcut based so logitech has always sold a couple of mechanical keyboards before but this is their first mechanical keyboard in their mx line so this is higher end basically premium office mechanical keyboard how much is the mx master 3s so the master 3s you're looking at $100 which i believe is the same price okay how about the mini the mini and there mind you there is a 10 key version of that keyboard as well the mini is $149.99 oh get out i'm throwing that in the garbage that's a lot okay actually wait hold on on let's not be too mean to it just yet i like the look of that that's actually i like the kind of the two-tone finish they're not the only ones that make low profile mechanical of course look i'm just no no i'm actually just saying the color way right like these are nice let's just experience a little bit of oral bliss together oral oral oral oral bliss it's like you hear a lot of just like sort of hollow oness on the inside it's it's not even that i also hear the scratchiness of it right so wait let the back light turn off for a second okay so it's off there's a sensor in it yeah that actually is kind of cool the sensor does work pretty well i don't know about spending this much money on a keyboard i just don't know if you're getting the price for it it's a good mac mechanical keyboard i'd say that being said though the mouse actually does feel really nice now should you go throw your old master in the garbage probably cuz this does feel very very similar there are a lot of options out there for mice but there aren't a lot of new and unique options yeah the fact that these are damped so that they're silent i'm a big fan of that yeah why couldn't they do this with their stupid keyboard hello my friends and welcome to the most unexpected crossover of 2022 yeah friends i taste like a fresh mcdonald's sprite i don't ever want to hear about what you taste like ever again k what would you say is one of your favorite things in life anime what's another thing that you love in life my car keep going what do you do 6 hours a day watch anime yeah yeah what what what else do you do 6 hours a day play gran turismo what do you do while you're at work that you're not supposed to be doing watch anime yeah listen to music i agree what it's like it's like bony you know i'm not going to lie though i'm going to take this to the next anime conv they're justable of course they do you think coca-cola would make a bad product ha hilarious oh this is actually really comfortable though can i just point out that kimito listens to his music at 100% volume at all times no no no no no no you have to listen and you have to guess i will tell you the price i am the captain now base actually not terrible there's not much detail in it everything seems kind of crushed there's no like the base is not punchy there's no depth there it's a little muddy i mean there's literally fur in between my ears and the cffs themselves these are probably $15 headphones with i'll put a $10 markup on it i'll say 25 they're $25 get out not bad right you can get better $25 headphones but these have the novel now i'm sitting so close to you take a tic tac a coke tic tac oh wait that sounds counter too oh i will take one of those i will take all of those they look like pills you got to take one coke a day keeps the doctor away wo slaps right i like these delightful like all products from the coca-cola company how about we talk about the actual best brand it's not coca-cola sprite earbuds these earbuds have sprite bottles on them those look funny in your ears do these headphones look good yeah good cuz they sound like sh one two or three three cool here you go a mini wireless did you really just buy every tech thing that was at the c i walked to the coke store slightly inebriated and made some questionable decisions on this would be a great segment for mystery tech and then bought like eight pairs of headphones i coke on it oh this looks kind of nice though that that metal top though the satin red finish ice [music] cold i don't like this i have more headphones because i came prepared and bought everything that seemed vaguely techy at the coke store those are what they use as a base for fake beats no not true it's the real thing i will say the plastic oh jesus christ sounds like matt's knees wowow wow is that mariah care's heartbreaker nope it's still thomas the tank engine the biggie version yeah those don't sound good wait wait are you looking at the last item oh no did i leave that in there you're wen't supposed to see that you drunk bought $200 worth of stuff at the coke store you what but you know what they gave me for only an additional $8 a mystery bag why is this empty wait did you open this no i got scammed by cocacola i was supposed to get sponsored by coca-cola how could this have happened a dreamcast that was about 8 db higher than i thought it was going to be i have not actually ever opened a dreamcast i was a gamecube kid or really as a ps1 kid woo oh wow this actually is pretty much a complete in box isn't it everything right in this complete kit was about like 350 400 but we bought more stuff sonic adventure for the dreamcast so here's the big problem with the dreamcast it unlike the ps2 and the gamecube which used its own proprietary thing basically just use cds you could just copy paste cds rip them all day long what it came to piracy prevention it didn't really exist that is an old school keyboard and it does have the controller port good luck trying to use this with your fancy windows xp computer i feel like they just took a regular keyboard smacked a dreamcast sticker on it and then just soldered on a different cable i mean was the cheapest way to make this right yeah all right ready and oh listen to that baby perr oh oh oh that was fast dreamcast all right play please i did uh-oh that's not good i'm not feeling great about our sonic adventure right now this feels like an adventure sure he gave us this for free can i swear if you hit it [applause] one he just this is like every uber that i've been in in san francisco yeah this is so much fun this game absolutely holds up what what are you doing okay you literally just hit robo raptor in the is it in his big toe robo raptor's back okay i see your comments everyone's like bring back robo raptor my little unboxing buddy is right here so this item is in a generic box is this the world's largest mouse i found a website that just makes big things of things this is a great idea i love it robo raptor it's a little bit too big for your tiny hands but he's going to try to use it yo he's not happy with it i forgot how on point he is everyone thinks the robo raptor's remote controlled he's just this good i'm going to lose my job one day and robo raptor is going to take my place yeah we would love that yeah okay i'm going to stop joking for one second this is actually not terrible it actually looks like it fits your hands okay okay okay you're good you're good you're good buddy do i have a computer that can you oh my wait no no what's a big mouse without a big keyboard oh that is ah actually wait is this that big of a keyboard i've lost all sense of scale i mean the font is large is that that big i would say it's maybe like 10% larger can you may vomit if you touch that capital m membrane oh that is the worst membrane too roboraptor is about to jump off the table ah ah ah right don't step in lasers i forgot i haven't not played portal in a very long time i've got to do a lot of this hand motion look how much i have to twist my hand but that's how esports guys like actually use their arms to move around a lot ken at what point do you think i'm an esports guy the may 22nd episode of mystery tech thanks man that poor table this table is coming with me to the new set you know what memory has been made on this table ken my son was made on we're moving oh my god jared please zoom out i've got a an avant guard intro for this episode of mystery tech ah stop hitting me with things i'm not ready for it ken the hydroly runs on waterers no batter is required did you just get this from like the as seen on tv section of target no batteries no charging runs on water lasts for hundreds of hours that's not how water works does this how water works i mean hydro electricity it's like a dam why does it need to be this big so essentially it uses water to soak up the fuel cell but it only works for a little while i'm teabagging oh my just get everywhere why don't you stop no just someone help me not my table oh god it's dripping everywhere this table say too much all right it said shake it vigorously to get off excess water that's a different light ah a oh it's so salty what i spray all over myself those are the electrolytes there's so much salt in my mouth right now okay we've now activated it let's see if my hydrolyte works oh wow waa but who's to say that that it already didn't have power though hey you this is the police it's actually not that bright of an led though like for a flashlight you can see on camera i mean obviously the camera's a little darker than like my eyes but like this is not that bright this is definitely an emergency tool yeah it's good for 25 years you put it in your prepper bunker or your tado shelter all i can think of right now is how like sticky i now am based on the water that just your your your salty brine water is definitely ruining that that's great now yeah why is your phone sticking so far out of your butt this i'm just sitting here minding my own business austin get down from there it's a bad influence for your child and this is a good influence the cody by pillar what is this so this is a product from shark tank wait i already have a robot friend his name is robo this is not your robot friend this is your robot babysitter this guy here he's got you covered oh that is adorable though looks like a chow from sonic adventure i need to download the cody parent app also micro usb which as we've established is illegal and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law please connect me to your wi-fi oh i didn't not want to hear [music] that is this the wi-fi song oh oh let's go it's theing cult classic the wheels on the it just keeps going hold on guys i feel a hot item coming in i just got to like warm up the table austin all that working out you must be thirsty i am for some hydrate spark steel is a water bottle mhm a smart water bottle did you really have to question if that was a water bottle remember when we tried the the fork that told you when to eat yeah it didn't work yeah it did it it actually really did it really worked who needs to be told to drink soorry when's the last time you had a glass of water today yeah i haven't had to drink besides caffeine today so you are the target person for this water bottle so you pop it open on the bottom that doesn't seem like a good idea so you've got yourself a little connector a magnetic connector for the usb port oh proprietary it is most definitely proprietary it's little magnetic puck that you're going to no yeah he wait you have to take it out to actually charge it you do that's so dumb dumb this should just be able to be wirelessly charged on any chat charger oh my god that is 100 you should do is oh my god that's right to fair plugging it in immediately sink okay recalibrate your bottle if it is reading lower in accurately so i need to empty and refill so can you please empty the bottle oh oh it's starting to leak it's starting to leak around the lips all right empty thank you very much okay put the lid on it is calibrating 10 oz and 10 seconds or whatever it's doing so right now it says that we have to drink 56 o of water matt can you come back and drink one more botle of water for me drink something and then we'll see if it works can get close with that it's hard to drink the from the straw like it actually like limits way you could drink it doesn't it's not connecting to the bottle anymore also how do you turn on the rgb through the y oh you know what no no we didn't finish charging it that's why it was actually dead out of box so he's saying i drank all that water for nothing for your good health m do not throw that do not throw that gently place it gent oh no gentle gentle see was that so hard so this is the sony inzone m9 now i know a little bit about this because this is part of sony's brand new gaming line of products not to be confused with playstation they've canceled playstation that's over instead inzone is the future they've got got a couple monitors and then i know there's some headsets as well oh speaking of okay so we've got the inzone the h9 and i caught that one the h3 wow it's a ps5 that no wow from this angle in particular it that just looks like we stretched a ps5 so one of the things i like about this is that it is a 27inch monitor now nothing againsts you if you like larger like big format gaming displays but for me 27 inches is the perfect size it's definitely not a normal looking stand so if you're up against the wall look how much farther out it has to be to not hit the wall touch the wall that's fine well it's you're now in theall put in the corner put in the corner if you look at it on the back now that you have what actually would say is a pretty nice like stand although it is a little front heavy so it's a little wobbly when you're actually trying to adjust it but on the back side there are a ton of ports so this has built-in cave v m which means that you have three usb as's as well as you have an upstream and usbc so you could theoretically have say your ps5 and your pc or maybe your desktop and your laptop all connected to this monitor and easily switch all of your actual usb accessories and your video at the same time this does really feel like they're trying to make a do everything monitor all right so actually before we fire up the monitor why don't we actually take a look at some of these headsets the thing with the h3 is that this is a fully wired headset which at $100 is a little a little bit of a tough sell $100 is a fair bit for a wired gaming headset but i actually will freely admit that i actually typically like to use wired instead of wireless headsets so we've got nice easy swiveling cups i'll say immediately nothing's creaky or particularly crazy got a decent amount of adjustment oh wow that feels air traffic control over here no i was say immediately their lightweight they feel very comfortable like i can instantly tell you i could wear these for a long period of time and it would not be a problem problem while these don't have any kind of like noise cancellation the passive i can also tell is relatively good i got to compare it at 100 bucks to the xbox ones which are also fully wireless but also have both bluetooth and the radio in it so you can be connected to literally both your devices at the same time and that's something that the h9 does but that's $300 yeah all right next up we have the h9 so this is the high-end endzone gaming headset now this i will say is expensive 300 bucks for a fully wireless headset look these better beuing awesome or otherwise no i'm i'm being serious so you've got a little switch between pc and ps5 but as far as i know this is the way to connect it although like some of the other higher-end headsets lately you can also pair them via bluetooth to your phone so theoretically you could have like discord on your phone and you could route it into the headphones as well as getting your game audio from pc or ps5 actually need for ps5 play a lot ps you don't obviously need that for pc really but for ps5 it is nice and now we have the headset itself surprisingly light even though it's full like active noise cancelling and everything maybe a touch heavier than this one but honestly feels very similar in fact i would say not even similar it feels basically the same supposedly between the headsets you're not getting a big difference in audio quality it's more so the features so we've got the headsets we've got the monitor let's actually plug all this in and see so as soon as i've plugg the ps5 in it shows up with the hdr settings so the following settings have been optimized for your tv oh j sprite you can't even see the text on camera oh my god that's very bright still no i'm all the way down what oh with the monitor connected to the ps5 it's able to communicate what kind of hdr settings so as you can see it immediately popped up and said everything correctly theoretically that's noise cancellation wait talk to me test hi can you hear me okay so that's okay so i've got ambient sound on sounds pretty good all right can you hear me now standard and yeah active okay hello i can still hear you but active is cutting out a lot now one of the things that the headset does is if i bring this down you'll see it unmutes myself and i now have talkback so i'm actually listening to myself in the headphones right now although there is a dial i can dial that out volume controls and everything with the headset are all communicated as you expect these are designed to work well with playstation but you know if you especially have the endzone software for pc it should work there too ken can you commentate my race going into turn one he hits the rx7 just immediately crashes oh god oh my god oh jesus i didn't know you could bend like that are you okay i'll say the monitor is horrific but i will say though the headset does sound good obviously playing gran turismo might not be the like best way to evaluate the sound quality especially gran turismo sport yes yes cuz gt7 does sound a lot better but that being said looks good sounds good i mean if you want to know more you can follow den's wonderful video all about these products and i'm sure ken will be much more illuminating on his grand turismo experience i'll be playing gt7 hardware introducing hardware designed by gavin for microsoft up oh a bunch of stickers save as there's no clippy sticker though not saying it's a miss i'm just saying the original vtuber did you say clippy is the original vtuber don't like that all right all right all right o okay the back never not creating also i'm just going to say you see this right this is a small this is about twice as big as my small w that that's like that's like small when i'm in it here i'm just going to be right back oh he's going to squat the noises that usually accompany this are oh god jesus christ why did you have to do it with that much bigger oh he's popping what what are you it how why does it take you like 5 minutes to put on a shirt it i'm how dare you yo i didn't know some assembly was require oh the noggin boss oh okay i actually know what this is shark tank right this is a shark tank product is it just a big hat it is a jumbo hat oh it's got the this is logo on it oh so if i try to put the hat on normally it looks like my son wearing one of my hats all right now let me put it on oh that's funny it looks weirdly normal it's it's it's literally just a scaled up baseball hat that looks weirdly k backwards no it it does how much do you think we spent on this with the context that it took 6 months to show up and that it is custom embroidered $69.99 it's close to $200 let's go i was right it was like $180 you know what i need to keep creating otherwise this is is going to run this entire company out of business hello my friends and welcome to this next exciting item on mysterious technological inven chins integrated led monitor for ps5 what are the specs on this it's probably on the back of the boxer what are the spe on6 in it's hdr free sync wait oh is this actually not well i mean everything that g story has made is usually kind of but like it's fine i got this prime shipping on amazon how much was it like 300 something bucks i think it was like 365 i i balled out on this one that looks so ugly though it does it looks terrible i haven't even opened it yet can we can we please let me do the mystery teching and you do the mystery talking when you find an item you can do the mystery talking okay so we've looked at several of these style of products in the past things like the xbox series s has a really neat little screen that we did a video on not too long ago this is big wow the ps5 is big yeah okay so it definitely on the backs side fits on like a normal ps5 side plate i'd have to obviously see what it looks like on the ps5 but i mean this looks ps5 is so for context this is the size of a standard disc ps5 now the g story once i attach it should theoretically pop on something like this that is not the same color you see the match i'm not sure how well that comes across on camera that's not the same color no they should almost give you another shell at that point to make it even how much is this again so this was 380 how much is the ps five digital edition again was that $400 400 bucks okay just double checking just double checking there we go and all right there we go the height of style my friends the ps5 pro now available at your local youtube clickbait emporium so all you need to do is plug in the hdmi here and then hop it over to the 4k 60 on this side and then you need to plug in the power adapter which is annoying so this is always going to need its own external power one thing that this is doing way better already than the xbox one is you can just leave this on you don't have to take this off good point whereas the xbox one you had to open it up because it was covering the fan true yeah there's no cooling impact at all here which is like infinitely better than the xbox one all right my friends it's time to fire up this magnificent beast so i'm going to open it up no signal enter power saving i think something's supposed to happen right about now oh there we go that's why do you see how bright that is that's a lot of nits friends so many nits that my eyes are blinded by my desperate please to subscribe to the channel and wringling the dingling button so that we can keep this entertaining engaging and insightful content flowing to your youtube subscription boxes thank you we are at like a terrible angle over here and that that looks perfect is that the loudest i can go good question no that's the max volume i mean these are two tiny little speakers so it's not going to give you that that much but it sounds good it sounds fine the screen looks good for something portable i couldn't ask for much more like i think the screen quality is the redeeming factor in this for sure no don't do it he ran me out of road i was you saw how good i was i gave him plenty of space i think you ran yourself off the road there honestly this contraption is huge heavy you almost need like a dedicated backpack to move something of this around but if you were looking for a screen for your ps5 this is is a solid screen i don't think i would actually buy it cuz i don't want to take my ps5 around with me cuz laptops exist my head is getting so big now i've caught so many items yes oh my god the word sus didn't exist yet but this is a little sus has anyone in this room ever used a shake weight ironically yeah i like how it doesn't say absol on tv it just says tv oh my god it's this big why does it need to be this big for max maximum shake weightage it comes with inspectional dvd how do i activate is there anything i need to do i think i just hit the turn the button on right you just go no you turn it on wait you really just do this yeah that it's not electronic dude don't sniff it it smells kind of weird this is really it this is how you shake weight no you give it a really good okay all right all right do it lateral lateral lateral shaking it i'm shaking it really shaking it do i need to show you how to use a shake weight matt shake weight master help me rapidly sculpt my body okay that's actually pretty good get a little no no no no no no definitely not i am not sure i'm going to watch the dvd make sure that's allowed hello kenzie hello what do you got there is that my god that was an incredible throw that was an incredible throw inside we have hey we have aa it's a google pixel 6a # team pixel # sorry for the shake weight no one should ever apologize for the shake weight so i've take a look at the pixel 6 as well as the pixel 6 xl before and my problem with both those phones was something that's a little more unique to me because well let's just say i'm a flippy boy i like small tiny phones and the 6a is the smallest of the current pixels automatically makes it number one in my book oo that is a good color that's color oh that's really no oh wait no oh that's pleasant is it scratching sniff no it just smells smells like pine i'm a huge fan of this color though i think it looks terrific and i like the way that google does the little like camera bar if you're going to have a camera bump at least give me one that's not going to rock all over the table like it's well balanced now it does have an indisplay fingerprint sensor but the problem is i've been using the s22 lately and that's honestly better than this now i'm curious how the price to performance is going to line up because this is powered by a google tensor chip and it does have two cameras an ultra wide and the standard wide angle the problem and it's not a huge problem but it's the older camera that's from the pixel 5 4 3 and two i think which is less than ideal google's play has always been more software yeah so i think you're still going to get most of the benefits just optically it's not going to be as good that's the thing as we kind of talked about with these phones is they were so good how do you get that much better so here let's just get matt and ken ready and okay of kenzie looking cool now if you want to know more about the pixel 6a more than austin's quick first hands-on shake rate reaction y yeah go ahead hello friends i'd like to bestow upon you the pixel 6a would you please make a illuminating high quality and impressive video on this is and dany to explain to everyone the pros and cons of the pixel 6a can you just make high quality but yeah we'll make a video okay thank you oh how long have you been holding on to these these came out a while ago what are they the 1,000 x mark 5ivs oh probably a month these sat here for a month i wanted to try these i almost bought a pair okay so the 1000x mark 5 specifically the wh 1000x mark 5 n to be confused with my earbuds of choice the wf wf 1000x mark 4s these are i would say by a lot of tokens the gold standard for overear active noise cancelling headphones did i say dany short on these or something wow you watch my channel sony also sent me some i unboxed mine on time are you stealing my sony friends nice packaging cardboard although it looks premium it's very eco i could probably eat this if i tried it hard enough why would you want to so i oh wow that is mhm mhm oh oh and it like stays squished you squish it and it slowly fills back up called memory foam it's memories of my childhood what let's go with some vinyl days i very rarely eq headphones right out of the box that is it's a little troubl it's a little troubl i had i had to eq mine as well would you say it's giving you some trouble so yeah i mean sound quality is good a quick eq definitely helps a lot i'll say i'm not the target demo on these because while the active noise cancellation i can immediately tell is terrific it's one of those things where for me i don't typically use overear headphones when traveling i know that this is like s of the best active noise cancellation blah blah blah this is too big i would much rather take my headphones my ear earbuds and leave them in my pocket i always prefer a good pair of wireless earbuds and these are the link buds s okay i'm excited for these so while i think most people are probably going to prefer a fully wireless set of like 1000x mark 5s to me much more interested in something like this so these are significantly cheaper because these are like 350 bucks they're 400 400 united states freedom units yes that's like 1,00 canadian rupees they still sing the marvs so the mark 5's just slot above that so the link bud s come in at $200 so it's almost kind of like these are a little bit more expensive than airpods pro and these are a little bit less expensive but both have active noise cancellation i think these just lack wireless charging right whereas these have it so the problem with these is that they're big and chunky right these are the 1000x mark 4s these are my favorite headphones but when you put them in not only are they a little bulbous but also i don't find them to be super comfortable which has always been my issue now that being said they're so good that i'm okay with them being a little uncomfortable but these i can tell just in my hand are lighter and certainly a lot smaller wow that's that's it there they let it feels like i have nothing in my ear right now that is actually i'm immediately impressed just by the comfortability and the lightweight of this me play with the eq on these a little bit as well oo and it does pause when you take them out okay first impressions are good i would say they don't quite sound as good as the bigger brothers but yeah it's not maybe as quite as a rich and full of a sound i'd say it's still 85 90% is good which especially considering the price difference i don't think is a big downside these might just be excellent when they go on sale and typically all kind of bluetooth headphones go on sale at some point but i'm legitimately impressed are you going to move though are you going to switch is that the question i will spend some time with the link buds they're really nice like very nice so it's been a few weeks since i've recorded this segment and the link buds ads have absolutely replaced my old headphones to the point where i don't think i've touched the 1000x mark 4s since i shot that so thumbs up what's the next item what's the next item is a great question it's the thing i just caught the vu so this is a cool streamer microphone that solves all the problems you didn't know you had i see it's got rgb your streaming setup if it doesn't have rgb are you even really a gamer okay so inside we've got the manual and actually a lot of accessories wow that's a dense that's can you see how fast it drops cuz that's how physics work right can i ask how much is this so that one there is'0 bucks okay not bad for a supposedly high-end microphone hearing a lot of handling noise pickups on the side like the yeti right side side side top top no it's top top top good the way it's supposed to be yeah i'm going to get uncomfortably close to the microphone cuz that's how everything sounds good i'm going to be using just the regular voice recorder app for the test it's not going to give me the best quality in the world but it should be fine all right i'm going to start recording now hello and welcome to austin's mystery corner where today we have a very special guest tech i've got the volume all the way cranked up on the microphone right now so you can really hear every little bit of the detail in my voice including that little bit of a tongue pop you have to do you have to do the the the the thank you for watching this episode of mystery tech subscribe and wringling that tingling button so you're always kept up to date on the latest and greatest of technological inventions wow can you do something with this you picked the wrong day to be the unboxing man that's lou i'm the unboxing boy yeah that's accurate yeah is this a drone not just any drone oh is it the snap drone yes it is oh this is some stupid stupid  all right i'm about it okay so snap the company formally known as snapch chat have created the pixie i'm going to be real i don't remember my snapchat login i don't use it anymore i'm not 20 years old like a baby jared janna do you guys use snapchat i use it every day oh janna we no longer have things to talk about i still feel like snapchat keeps making hardware because they keep trying to pitch themselves is not a social network and it's not working i'm not going to lie though this a bit of a vibe i want to beat you up so bad right now while while you're wearing that here actually joan i wanted you take over why don't you set this up set it up i was just going to let you use my snapchat you are a certified drone pilot you have a license and certificate this is the perfect product for you you can name it joanna's pixie it's how about not joanna's pixie the camera's like right there i don't know if that's like that is loud that's the loudest thing oh okay now i'm going to walk this way trolling this at all has any of this video come through to your phone no technology is terrible so what is this this is just regular selfie mode this is hover because this is the least dangerous mode we could put it in look at this drone safety there we go okay okay okay okay so it comes down so i think it's kind of like supposed to follow you yeah or it's following joanna in this case the image quality is that yeah probably it's okay for snapchat i i guess no okay we need a guess not we should do an orbit let's do it orit oh oh no that's oh it has to go pretty that's pretty far away okay hey oh wait wait no no stop h no no oh barely oh let's go well that was quite the orbit well now we've all learned how to use snapchat a little bit i've immediately deleted it from my memory okay it erased itself are you feeling the wave the wave that's not the wave you can't ride my wave you're not riding my wave matt you stay off my wave now this my friends is an entire care package from a friends over at iono now i will admit the last time we took a look at an io i wasn't a enormous fan mostly because it was expensive but they listened to what i said and crafted a product exclusively for me using my feedback and not listening to anyone else this is my invention and i'm going to take none of the credit for it no this is the i neo a although there's a lot of stuff in here this is a nice little care package thanks iono a letter dear austin thank you for giving us the idea to create the iono air with such a brilliant idea can we confirm that was notorized the top line of it says dear media friends before no no austin it's said austin it doesn't even have your name on it dude this is what i'm really excited for this is the ya neo air wow that really does look like a switch light and this is the a mid-spec model so this is the ryzen 550 6560u with 16 gigs of ram and 52 gigs of storage this is actually relatively competitive with the steam deck though 16 gigs of ram just like the steam deck you're going to lose a little bit of graphics on something like this but keep in mind it is going to be significantly smaller this starts at $550 which to be fair is still more expensive than the steam deck but keep in mind this is a full windows 11 system with a 1080p oled oh look how tiny it is look how tiny it is oh it's oh i was i was going to say that's the instruction manual no sure how tiny it is look how look how little it is oh that's pretty small it's so little wow i like the finish if you see it goes from like this kind of like teal color over to pink and a really nice smooth gradient o look at that oled oh dude this feels nice this feels nice m purely on size i'm going to give a huge w to the io just because for me this i might as well carry around an xps 17 alien wear big chungus edition i like the steam deck but man this thing is huge the io it's small i look look i'm going do it i'm going to do it watch watch no i hope you like stick drift cuz you're going to get it now hey oh except you won't because these use sensors and it's an oled screen one of my biggest complaints with a steam deck is the fact that it's got a pretty mid screen i mean it's 1,200 by 800 which is a fine resolution but the screen itself it's just not great quality especially when you look at it compared to something like a switch oled and this is going to have as far as i know fairly i mean it's 1080p oled so it should be pretty damn solid here's the thing like you say that but the steam deck having the lower resolution actually just makes everything better no but you can run this at 720p i would run it at 720p but for some very low like you know graphics games i'll run it at 1080p and even if i'm running at 720p i've got the ole quality as opposed to the crappy lcd playing a lot of games on the on the seam deck i would have never called that screen crap yeah like i i've never complained about it at ever i actually think this is too small you're too small like where my thumbs want to place are not feel like i'm cramping my hands in yeah i don't like where the stick is it needs to be up here i'll say though this is very ergonomic and the materials feel nice this doesn't feel overtly plasticky like every other iono or gpd product that i've ever tried i don't think it's benefiting like a ton by being this small i think you can get some decent like thermal gains and like you know ergonomics just by being 15% bigger ken here's the thing right as much as it pains me to say this let you borrow it briefly to make a dky video it's perfect for my oneway flight to japan you're never going to see that thing again you know better than this i can see the next item it's called transparent like me cuz you can't see me this this is where everyone laughs cuz it's funny what's the opposite of a laugh track a boo track look i see the name of this thing you literally haven't even thrown it it's literally in front of me it says transparent speaker can i have the item yet you know who also has a lot in common with the speaker who john cena cuz you can't see him time is now what are you guys talking about he doesn't know the john cena is invisible you can't see me don't you don't oh right he's saying oh he still has no idea shane so this is the transparent speaker does anyone know anything about this thing it's a very high-end speaker hold on no no no this is a very high-end speaker that cost over $11,000 that we've unboxed on mystery tech in the past without any further ado as the kids say the transparent speaker oh wow i can't even see it wait it comes with yo this means it's fancy oh no this is a lot of assembly instructions can i not just turn it on that looks like an ikea manual to be fair this company is swedish so oh yeah they they love their paper behold my friends the transparent speaker oh well it's the wrong way but i got to be honest with you after all that that was really disappointing yeah this looks super cool so you've got a couple of speakers as well as i assume a sub looks like mickey mouse got it is that a hidden mickey it's a hidden mickey so you've got this little box which has all of your actual electronics in it so if i flip it around to the back what you'll see is it's very very neatly managed hold on so does chomecast does bluetooth does apple tv so airplane the cool thing is that you can actually wall mount this so i believe wow imagine this on the wall how sick would that be oh that's the switch oh that's kind of nice wait we need more base oh wa okay there's a lot of leeway there [music] oh so this sounds good how much j does the speaker cost this costs $1,100 so it does not sound $1,100 good this is something that you're buying for the aesthetic and for the very good audio quality i think you could probably spend 4 or 500 bucks and get a speaker that is going to sound similar and especially if you have this like a stereo pair of a couple of these i think it's going to look phenomenal right and that's really i think what you buy this for that was an aggressive throw this is buddy a what a multifunctional cable stick yeah you know how i love to be super extra prepared in my backpack to have everything yeah this is cool how much is this 15 bucks all right this is looking very promising very promising nice jewel dude vaping isn't cool kids don't do drugs all right on one side i have a bunch of micro sd card slots nano sims matt how often do you need carry extra sim cards that sounds a little sus i have our google f sim i have the an at&t sim sounds like you've been watching too much better call so you gave me these sims never mind i have nothing to do with this so i plug it into my s22 a little red light has appeared and it shows as charging device the cable's good for 65 watts as well which is enough to charge something like a laptop it actually is really easy to put the cable back in too that was one of the things i figured this would be a huge opinion for good product austin like today we're going look at spicy things this my friends is as spicy as it gets now as the official president of the samsung galaxy z flip owners fan club i have had my fair share of z flip f shenanigans and issues but today it's all fixed this is my first time actually touching the z flip 4 touched it the bora purple this year looking pretty nice it does look nice you're telling me that those are two different phones look i am looking at these you're telling me that that is two different models of phone there are subtle differences the camera bumps are significantly more pronounced on the four compared to the three the bezel is a little bit smaller and the actual crease is ever so slightly shrunken down honestly if you do not have the flip three and the flip four side by side you are going to notice almost none of these differences but as the president ceo and treasurer of the zflip fan club i will be remiss in my duties to not inform you of every flip and fold difference that could possibly exist every z flip from the original one all the way up to the three has shared the same kind of mediocre camera from i think the galaxy s10e whereas the flip 4 finally gets an upgrade to a more modern camera it's not quite up to what you would get on the where' the full go oh ken already unboxed k ken literally already unboxed the fold over here been trying to be quiet and all right well it's it's unboxed now let us pixel peep neon sign the dynamic range is definitely better it's doing less of that hdr thing so you can see the larger sensor look how it's like a a little bit softer in the background all right so let's flip over to portrait now i will say samsung portrait mode lowkey best in the game even on the z flip 3 their algorithm even with like hair and stuff i've been incredibly impressed even with the three i immediately like this more it think the color temperature is a little bit better look at the wall looks a little too blue on the back where it's a little bit more neutral the four did a better job at the cutout but i at least in this photo it on the three it got it more right skin tone wise think the four is naturally a little bit of a softer image which to my eye looks better and more natural it's not that sort of slightly over sharp kind of thing now this video actually is probably not live yet but i'm going give you a little sneak peek i recently was able to take a look at at my zflip 3 in an x-ray machine the hinge it seems small right but when you actually have it open the hinge is like that wide like it is a massive massive chunk of this foam i know hinges always kind of work in but it does feel very firm in fact so much so that like i can tell you've got a lot more angles where it will hold whereas i know on the z flip 3 once you start to open up at a certain level like you do it here it's just going to close right but the z flip 4 i mean it'll it'll stay in almost every orientation you want which is neat if i'm trying to watch video and bed i can get it just right angle what videos are we watching in bed nothing but this is videos matt good answer hush me personal voice mask this is a gift from all of us to you does this turn me into bane i was born in the darkers why did you give bane a mickey mouse voice that's the only voice you have is this a mask where you can have potentially private conversation via bluetooth but without people around you seeing it if you remember we actually did a product like this very similar it was so you could sing karaoke without everyone it was the mic that had the foam oh boy too many straps there's never too many straps that's what i i need you to just take it down a notch please take it down a notch this looks so weird this looks like cyclop one one ear on the front this is a headset that only van go could love cuz he's got one oh look so the headphones are just magnetic to the back this while hideous stupid and ridiculous i'm actually like not not the worst person to try this i spent a fair bit of my days on phone calls and i'm always having to like walk around but if i had this on i wouldn't have to worry about anyone's feelings so there's mask and there's headset what what how how don't you get it oh wow that it works i don't think i got it right this does not seem like the optimal way to hush me man i thought you were the strap master are you a little out of practice my my straps are a little bit more professional we got these bad boys i don't like this this is highly suck you trying to say i look like goofy i got got to say my breathing is not great in this it almost kind of like covers my nose a little bit it's t me time so i'm going to talk a little bit right now with the h me on and you can be the judge of what this sounds like you have headphones on and that seems sus matt looks great today and the ken has a fresh cut and honestly it's looking pretty fry is it just me or does it make him look like he has like a big old thick mustache it does how much can you guys hear a lot of it but i won't hear you from the next room now i was speaking relatively loudly let's actually hear what that sounds like this is the last time you'll ever hear my this is way clearer than what we heard oh wait can you present the next item of mystery tech kind of heavy all right a nondescript brown box exactly what i like to see out of the oh jesus the xback tr screen 2 so we did this once before yeah yeah it it was not good and it was adhesive it was one extra screen not two this is pretty much specifically for macbook how much is the xb remember remember we had that conversation about up in the budget for mystery text problem is this is dumb we paid $300 for the other one there 500 bucks i'm immediately upset this thing is going to suck these things always suck all right packaging will give them is cool we'll say it's chunky boy but all right all right it's got multiple screens i that's fine so as someone who does use a macbook as my primary system right i dock on on my work i dock it sometimes when i'm at home i can see a scenario in which i'm editing on two screens and i've got a third screen to watch i'm curious these are quite small screens so this for reference is a 14'-in macbook pro oh okay well there's a kickstand is there a kickstand okay oh yeah you're right all right all right so i will say from the front you can see it literally just sort of attaches right so you just kind of extend it line it up with the top edge and then it attaches and it attaches to the top so you don't have to worry about the bottom so theoretically that would be fairly close to universal so immediately way better design than the earlier version of this from the other company that we tried okay so both are out and i can the hinges have some play but they're not too bad so plugging one into the macbook oh xack is firing up macbook sees it and there we go okay so it immediately works so hang on let me plug the other one in and i've got three screens on my macbook now one thing you would definitely need to keep in mind is if you're running three screens on your computer these screens are pulling power from your laptop right so i can see a scenario in which this is going to significantly hurt your battery so you probably want to be using this plugged in but realistically if you're a weirdo who's pulling out three screens in a coffee shop you probably have a power adapter with you anyway i'll say this works pretty well and supposedly so each of these displays has two usbc and an hdmi per so theoretically if i plug in a power adapter into the screen it will charge the laptop which they say is in case you don't have enough extra usb c's the problem is so few laptops actually support two usb c's with video like honestly it is a lot more limited than you might think which is one of the reasons why i really hesitate my big question here is not so much do this work cuz we can see it works my bigger question is how easily portable is this boom boom close it boom and then take it on the o i don't like that it doesn't close it's actually hitting the laptop cuz it's got a little thing so you're never going to want to leave this on this is like 85% fair especially if you got like a macbook or something you can just plug your ipad in and get a second screen it's much much easier you could have like your ipad on the side either wirelessly or connected that's the same price and you get two screens for this one but an ip actually work actually has an os on it you know this is going to be a good segment of mystery tech when robo raptor's out here next item please caught the mighty mug that mighty mug has been in the sink for about 4 years who in this room is familiar with the mighty mug there's a huge we all watch l's video on this it is literally one of my favorite unbox therapy videos of all time the moment that i first saw this was absolutely incredible and the fact that that lou video when he just like are you kidding me what what was one of the great youtube tech moments in history wait kenzie are you familiar with this no i'm i'm new to the unbox would you like to come and experience this unx dude okay the unbox dude okay take a look at this mug it's not i feel like i'm like presenting a magic trick right now regular mug you see that little like kind of rubber bit on the bottom right whack it well you you pushed you didn't whack so imagine this you're like sitting there drinking your coffee okay that was a bad example you broke the mighty mug it works wait no you got to hit it once and let it reset a little bit cuz if you hit it a second time it goes flying you're going to reenact lose video that i haven't seen yeah we're we're going to coach you we're going to teach you how to do this okay okay you're just going to do a lot of what what no like but more like what yeah yeah oh w w w you you what oh oh is that is that how is that how he does you're basically l to really properly do this this should be full of like some sort of like mystery liquid well why does it have to be a mystery liquid thank you for letting me experience the marty mug it's a relic of the past did you just drop this on the table is this still psa 10 now it's a psa 8 i have never ever opened these before but these are tops formula 1 cards now i'd say about half the people in this room right now are pretty big formula 1 fans h the other half is matte and he's not cool how am i weighted 50% of this room right now what are you trying to imply there this is not a cheap box how much did this box cost i believe that was $350 something like that yes all right the seal has been broken friends now you're going to be going to the bathroom all night all right i have the odds a foil refractor card is 1 11,000 oh my god another one's one in 20 5,000 these odds are ridiculous they're slightly better than me getting a girlfriend married or not married all right let's go for our 1 120,000 we're going to get rich today boys i can feel it we've got ourselves richard verore matio nanini what wait what that just sounds like someone's forgetting how to say my name we're going to get something today so this is a one of one so you just p a one of one one of one oh can me one one retirement season let's go careful careful careful i'm looking don't breathe too hard on it so you think that card paid for the whole box probably yeah i mean it's one to one right good thing i get a $10,000 bonus today i called dibs on this one i what one there's no item okay you can tell that ken caris is actually walking it over are these san rio hello kitty razer collabs i'm about it let's go all right so we've got the razer kraken bt hello kitty and friends edition and then we've got the razer goliath mouse mat and death adder essential that has a mouthful i literally know none of these except for hello kitty cinnamon roll oh wait what's the what's the little the grumpy dude on the side matt this is the death adder essential which i know is their lower end mouse in fact i think this is actually what the pikachu mouse that we looked at was based on it's fine i think i'm a little bit more excited for the headset well i'm looking forward to this screenshot being on the internet for the rest of the time behold my friend the hello kitty headset oh let's go oh hello austin why are you talking to yourself hey girls this is austin it sounds a little sus but i like it wait wait what stop the show stop the show it's micro usb isn't it micro usb micro usb they spit directly on our faces right let's go so you know you know what the issue that i have with this is they use the base of the c kraken kitty cuz the ears look the same but it's like like a molded version of it and so i think they also compromis the inner lining a little bit so it's like hard the voice is the wor it's literally like bluetooth it's connected it's not even hello kitty being like bluetooth y i i'm going to watch episode seven of hello kitty and friends super cute adventure i'm fing oh no one can hear what i'm hearing right now that's kind of awkward isn't it i'll call them cinnamon rolls cinnamon rolls these don't sound good i think the design of these headphones has actively made them worse headphones the mouse pad i'll take the i don't even want the mouse i just kind of want the mouse pad hey no i feel naked in front of the look look at aam look at all the nonsense you can see what is this thank god you decided to wear pants today of all days yeah it's a good call i'm glad this is the walking pad have you ever played ddr before oh no not it's not like that oh good i really don't understand what you got here i don't understand how you don't is it literally just a p like a a stationary treadmill there you go to be clear it is a foldable stationary treadmill you like foldables i do but not it looks like it looks like it's a moto razor it looks like a razor from the it's aing phone wow look it has less crease than the regular it actually is the motorola holy you also have some lube where do you put that i assume on the parts with friction that's that's not fun oh okay how do i change the speed oh it's okay this is 1 mph 1.25 here do 2 mil an hour a brisk pace i mean it's treadmill oh the remote's cool it'll tell you how many steps time or calories burn i feel like i'm doing like motion capture for like walking animations in a video game how fast do you think we can go six no this is it really yep that's it it is a walking pad it didn't say the running pad it's meant it's meant to be used at like a standing desk i mean i feel like i could be gaming right now i think it'd be a really fun time how much is the walking pad $450 w that's almost as much as an actual treadmill at least with an actual treadmill you get something to hold your laundry on wait wait wait wait wait i got it i got it wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on oh it no i can notice when you get off ken do you want to try to be synchronized with me look just titanic it it's fine we're marching we're marching down the road again the pointer instrument a precise universal tool designed to last this is just a mouse right no it's a pointer instrument just the mouse you can get at anywhere for $4.99 or in the subway very nice packaging oh my oh good lord that's fancy do you feel that is not it's plastic or it's a cardboard or whatever but look at this ho that's heavy this is the mouse let's go this is the mouse no that's the pointer instrument look at the detail on this mouse so it's actually like stitched leather and then if you flip it over it's all brass and i'll tell you it is incredibly heavy w oh this is cool i mean probably outrageously expensive and not worth it but this is cool so this is not one of the mice that gives you you know bunch of extra buttons whatnot not even having like a forward and back button to me a little bit of a miss but again this is not really meant to be like a productivity mouse this is meant to be a mouse that will make you look cool on [music] instagram it's actually not that ergonomic we'll meatly say that the sensor feels pretty responsive supposedly it works on glass oh so here's something else so they actually recommend you hold it differently they don't want you to hold it like this they want you to hold it like here so so like like this yes here's my issue with that you're kind of arcing your hand in a weird way where you're kind of just asking for some like arthritis and carpal tunnel does come off you serious so yeah you know you you want to be able to get at it for some reason i guess you could also clean the leather too without having to wet your mouse did you just say wet your mouth how much is the lunar artifacts pointer instrument i'm going to say i'm not going to condone this price but i'm going to say $149 wow you started with a one rookie mistake this was $242 even ah ah no no this is not a $240 mouse i mean they clearly spent $100 of that on instagram ads to get you to buy it it's not a terrible first effort and i appreciate the idea it's a new company and they're trying to do something different right this is a different mouse it's not bad it is not terrible i cannot tell you to spend $242 on this paper a razor mouse and a razor keyboard what is the death stalker v2 pro death stalker that sounds like a netflix special so this is their first low profile optical switch it's a lowprofile version of that before i open this add that low profile we sure we want to go low profile is that is that the move historically speaking we haven't liked those now the fact that it is wireless and battery powered is an interesting little wrinkle here but then if you're going to add the latency of wireless feels a little strange oh that's pretty thin though it's got a nice little scroll wheel she very tactile kind of scroll wheel going to take my microphone off right now i'm going to put it directly on the table so you can hear what this sounds like for my first impression mhm okay hold on it's not bad it's one of the better in fact it might be the best low profile switch i've ever tried as expected of a pre-built it's not amazing in terms of dampening the actual like cut in these key caps super clean like the rgb comes through incredibly well yeah which in a lot of these keyboards they don't normally do can i ask what the most important question is here how much does this cost it can't be more than the huntsman the huntsman i think tops out at 200 $249 for this for this specific get the hell out of here no absolutely not no that's a lot of money no that's a lot of money the key v2 is this a copy paste little macro pad i feel like i've seen this on tik tok it literally is like two buttons it's copy and paste right okay i don't think the laptop slides across the table but thanks okay so we've got a very nice very nice little usbc cable wait that's probably where the value is i'll say it like that's that is$ 1999 right there you know i should like program this to like tweet something offensive every time i'm upset i just tweet something offensive why is that your go-to well that's what everyone else does isn't it so i guess i actually have to download some software and program this thing or something here's the thing if you hit c i'm pretty sure it's just going to be the c button what's the point of saving time that's not any faster than just me doing it on the keyboard the fact that you're trying to bring logic into this device at all is baffling point is you don't need to keep keyboard to program if you steal all of your code with this it's a meme it's not supposed to be yeah i got oh my god it's not the real product i thought this is a real product no v v v v v enter v v v enter this is the dumbest item this is i thought this is a real thing dude it's not my fault if you throw a box and it's already been opened get ready to write your own story cool what is all this maybe you should have read it before you threw it away so we've got carst stone paper pocket journal in a6 we've got a stone paper notebook and woodless pencils what is this wait recycled stones isn't that just stone would you say that this idea is cool or that it rocks i wish i had more stone puns to tell you no what you're holding is paper made from stone it saves trees water and energy while being waterproof more sustainable and infinitely smoother to write scribble d doodle and draw i'm going to i'm just to experienc this paper for the first time okay so we're just going to flip over to one of these pages does it feel like normal paper no it feels like rubber almost feel that everyone take a feel of the the stone paper stop telling me to feel things this feels like a raincoat you know what this does feel like is like test paper i don't love it but like okay rocks don't tend to smell it smells like a book it's a solid graphite pencil so does that mean that i can write with any side of the pencil or do it needs to be sharpened i think you should sharpen it cuz i think it has the coating on this on the edge so it doesn't mark your hands ooh oh that actually that kind of writes nice does it smear when you rub your hand over it no no that's the thing the coating on theide that i'm i'm on the paper oh no a little bit oh just a tiny bit wait a minute i just realized a massive flaw of these pencils yeah no eraser no you're not supposed to rip them out no they don't it doesn't rip it like stretches it's like it's like a dbrand okay but oh good lord it rips it actually rips though but after a while look at that's actually really nice it's so clean the ri yeah i am hardly the person you should listen to when it comes to writing implement advice it's weird it's interesting i'm not totally buying that using stone is going to be way better than paper but it's definitely a unique kind of thing it's a beautiful drawing good job matt is that this is nft i call him rick i think we should be all set book feels weird this is a momentous occasion my friends because this is take one of the first episode of mystery take shot at the new studio this the first one very first wow what do you mean it's the first how do you not know it's the first one have you been for here for any other mystery text this all blurs together what a lovely new set i'm so excited that we're here all us that's less than ideal okay okay buddy thank you very much you just woke up all of the termites again again no they're sleeping just like i'm sleeping on the subscribe button and ringl linging the dingling button i should fix that right now time since launch is this a space thing this is not a space thing it's not a space thing no make time your own a single use long scale launch clock to mark a moment in time it will count up to 1 million days i will be dead by then hopefully hopefully a million days it's 2739 years damn i don't want to live to the fourth millennium caution after launch there is no option to reset i'm i'm excited by this this is classic prime mystery tech we should have opened this up when we first opened the building that would be great so it's a goofy ridiculous silly item that you should really only buy as a novelty but also that looks like a bomb it's not going to look any better once it's open it smells like cork not the future the future everyone should watch more spongebob don't understand what your accent is at least you've seen the episode oh what is that that looks that's a bomb i would not walk into a public that is actually a bomb dude this looks like what doc puts into the the delorean there's a chip of some kind and then you've got the lcds how do you program it cuz you doesn't tell me is how to there's like no obvious interface or anything well why would you you pull you don't need to you just pull the pin and then it it's a counter not a not relative to your time do you not understand the oh i thought it was a count down not count up what are you counting down to how much is this oh yeah that's a good well i was hoping you pulled a pin before i mentioned that before you want to return it yeah yeah yeah it is $280 oh that's not bad that is $300 more than anyone should have paid for this i mean you can't put a price on time you can it's $280 is everyone ready to pull a pen start off our new era of mystery technology three two one oh it it flashed a light at the back that scared me we are now like 5 seconds in to the new era of mystery tech welcome friends subscribe and ringling the dingling button because when this baby hits 88 mph i'm going to see some serious we are 20 days 23 hours and 30 minutes into the new mystery tech era in case you're trying to keep track at home i was pretty close on that one why is it metallicy rattling i don't think that's good korder as a korder owner you have helped us take one step closer to achieving our mission of getting the whole world to type at the speed of thought oh all right great this i'm going to hate this also what a that doesn't look like it goes on your head very afraid that this is what my keyboard is going to look like so i've seen this on tik tok and this might actually piss you off more than any item that we have had on mystery tech ever oh oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no that's not a keyboard that is oh good lord so it's a bunch of joysticks you go up down left right oh can you see how scuffed up it is like straight out of the box quality wise it seems a little now to be fair i think you can take this apart so it's got one of those like retractable cables well i don't know what that's for so if you want to have them separate you i think you can take it out of this like you unscrew these screws here you take off the metal support get pretty quick with this might be surprisingly intuitive for not austin cuz he can't touch time wait why is matt sprinting the last time i saw him sprint like that it was because he got to go home what is oh no yes yes yes so this was an early episode of mystery tech actually this like maybe year or two ago this is a game controller it's fully 3d printed and essentially you put your hand in here and then you can kind of push up down left right like i hated this with a passion this is almost worse can i have a laptop so i can just just get upset already cuz i know we all know where this is going let's just speed this up here i'm going to attempt to type going to be bad first of all let me just start pushing some things and see what happens so do you want to look on the guide online before you just go in this one no well i'm just typing i just typed the word trun u t oh i'm typing weird words here so there's combinations of gestures to get different letters try you trying to tell me that i need to learn something for this episode of mystery tech yeah he didn't even go to college he didn't even go to high school no he did he was guess who the boss i'm just typing oo no no oh no o i've heard that song before okay here okay i will say without a proper guide on what i'm doing here this is very difficult one of my little nubbin is an actual mouse cursor it's crazy cuz this is like the ultimate lazy man input device but also it requires so much effort this is like learning a really obscure language english apparently ow this item is fa really cheaply made you know it's just regular very cheap plastic which does not feel great oh this is going to get embarrassing their build cost $17 the actual cost of this $179 this is $300 that's like a steam deck for phd students sorry i'm just going to this do you have a piece of tape can we just no return policies what come with me friends as we swim through the ocean of mysterious technological inventions to our next item i was really hoping you were saying you're flying because our next item involves the air the inreal air i've seen people talk about these as far as i know they're like a hdmi display that goes on your face it's all in japanese i did not know inreal was a japanese company so we had to import this i don't know what i'm getting myself into here we've got our inreal glasses which do come in a nice little caring case so i'll give them that we got a polishing cloth we got a manual get to know your inreal air so we've got some like little nose bridge things so okay this is what happens don't let me read the instructions you did read the instructions we've got ourselves the glasses here and oh boy these are interesting so from the front they look pretty normal but on the inside you can see what looks to be like a combiner so we've got ourselves a usb c toc cable so if i put these on straight well i can't see anything okay how do i look do i look stylish and like i'm in the future you look like you just had cataract surgery do you have to have an app and then you also have to plug it in vi usbc yes the usbc plugs in to like the end here it will work with lots and lots of devices do i see a pixel nope don't work with no pixel my entire activation and set of process is running inside of edge right now so that is cool oh i heard a windows chim that's bright ow was not ready for that okay let me try that again so essentially to kind of describe what i'm seeing i would say the display is like 50% of my field of view okay let's pull up a youtube video so i'm going to watch this is apple killed the lightning port apparently so what i'm seeing here is essentially a complete mirror of of the laptop display but in the glasses which means that it's very bright the color the clarity the sharpness i mean it actually looks honestly better than the actual laptop like a 70in like nice looking tv in front of me and the audio is also pretty decent it sounds like matt's talking into my head you know i bet this would be fun for is actually gaming cuz you've got a really huge personal display in a way that even though it's technically ar it feels much more aken to something like a really nice looking like say rift display or quest display or something but the difference is there's none of that kind of like head tracking right so as i move around the screen is staying exactly as if it's like tied to my face and also the fact that it's not full vr right like even though the screen is quite bright i can kind of see through it a little bit especially if i turn the brightness down i can easily see all the way through to the camera but as i turn it up it pretty much sort of drowns out most of everything but anything that's slightly darker it mostly gets rid of how much in this so that's the thing we bought this before it was officially available in the us oh no so on amazon right now it is $380 when we had to import it it was 460 okay that's a lot of money even 380 bucks i think is a lot of money for this but okay okay let's get a fish sh i'm going to plug this in to a samsung phone that is supported okay i'm now verified my nebula account oh it's updating the glasses again so i'm i'm updating oh well it's now in dex mode also the glasses have turned themselves off for 380 bucks there's real potential here in using this as a head-mounted display that can give you some massive like 100 in display right in front of you that's 1080p clear cris you've got audio built in problem is is that while all this ar stuff seems super promising i can't get it to work so did can just fall asleep i'm like so bored with this thing i just feeling in a wi mood night watch the dock that turned your apple watch into a clock what the what what it already does that for all apple watch series my bs radar is going off hard is this going to be one of those stupid like magnifying glasses it says like magnify the face i hate this already is it even a dock amplify the sound what what sound does the apple watch make it is the night watch for all apple watch series you can magnify the face and you can charge it up parenthesis charger not included you can go 150 m hour in your ferrari ferrari not included okay cool thanks for letting me know night watch what the that my god they they killed da punk oh no they're already dead sorry don't go there ken okay if i hear you make one more one more time i'm going to put them next to grandma one more time i'm going to send you around the world oh please do i want to go back to japan oh no you mean malaysia no you're going to be forced to listen to robot rock the entire time open the apple watch app turn on nightstand mode and then insert your charger in when you slide the apple watch into night watch nightstand mode will automatically turn on so the problem with this is that well besides the fact that it's just a dumb magnifier your appw watch not going to stay on there's no no tech here it's just apple watch mode i hate this it just looks dirty because like every little bit of dust or anything is now magnified i mean okay i'm looking at it directly it does make it bigger you said it made it made it bigger yeah i'm going to need to borrow that after we're done with it how much was this and if it's more than $1 199.99 you could just buy a regular alarm clock and be very happy with it this was $85 is that even real glass oh wait i know this one there's a story behind this item before i even open it and come closer so for this item i was reached out to by a certain person who shall not be named who offered to pay me to say nice things about it i know is this the screwdriver i did not take lioness's bribe money to be sponsored by ltt store.com so you were stupid enough to do it for free oh okay right okay let's take a look at the ltd screwdriver we've got ourselves the standard and the creator edition apparently people are all screwed up in the head about this it's very orange on the inside got a piece of paper and we've got the screwdriver all right a that sounds nice so you've got yourself your bit storage on the inside they're no bit okay the bits are somewhere so we've got the black handle with the orange tip and the silver shaft this thing is not cheap this is like what $70 that's more than i paid for my electric screwdriver so you've got a pretty good selection you've got some phillips you've got some torx you've got a little magnum one which actually i like that i will admit i don't know how to review a screwdriver cuz it's a screwdriver oh you know i can do though first of all cool second of all had to line let's take a look at the creator edition we have ooh there is a white base as well as the stealth model i'll say it feels nice and it also does have all the bits already loaded up in here which is very much appreciated but this has got to be pretty nice to be worth the money so i just did the math it looks like they're already close to selling over 100,000 of these 100,000 100,000 that's a lot of screwdrivers this feels solid and sturdy but also is someone who builds a lot of game pcs i'll admit i don't really care about my screwdriver too much you're looking for a high-end screwdriver i mean obviously this is well-made and if you were in the market you can visit ltt star.com it's kind of a lot of money man it's kind of a lot of money so this comes courtesy of a future friend of the channel hey guys it's alan from card arena again i put in some more random gifts hope you enjoy he also put his twitter which is @ card arena usa there's actually a lot of stuff in here so we've got ourselves an infer v-b box we also have something that's definitely let's go okay okay you got you got me we got some nice sleeves oh let's go i saw it yay white cross oh shoot let's go oh dude this is expensive what the hol live cards i didn't know if even existed and importantly a lost origin elite trainer box so this is a lot of stuff i almost kind of feel bad this is this this is not cheap so thank you very much alan austin ken and the rest of the crew are now going to start opening some stuff while we eat some delicious snacks that's a sus looking box don't damage the table it's already damaged with termites so this looks to be a valve steam deck a way to take all the good and bad of steam and put it in something that is not pocketable doesn't smell like steamed de because it's actually debrand and so is this the kill switch this is project kill switch yes okay so i have seen this on twitter but have not paay any attention it's actually a nice kind of like sort of grippy rubber kind of finish you've got like kind of little grips on the side you have easy access to your ports and whatnot warning this is a magnetically detachable kickstand do not use as a handle so oh and it's keyed too so it doesn't rotate that's sm okay okay okay oh that feels terrific well i think the idea is that instead of of you know having their bulky casee or or like the standard steam deck case you could just throw this in a bag with the front cover oh is its own case yes it doesn't make it any bigger i guess i'll say that especially when you take off the kickstand you've got a hard actual shelf for the screen this is actually pretty neat so you've got your little caps for your thumb sticks which look nice although not like this is the most original idea i am probably one of the least big fans of the steam deck cuz i know while everyone universally loves this thing basically i prefer the iono entirely because the iono is actually a reasonable size this thing is larger than ken's ego i'm ready to expand my horizons with a very tiny little item what is this ew why does that look so ew these are elf ear earbuds let's go i forgot it's the humiliation part of mystery tech okay i don't like this at all so it's got like a little like loop for your ear you're supposed to put the headphone in and i guess loop this in the front of the back it smells not good like it smells like ears no smells like silicone actually how do i loop it backwards no no no no no no undo it like an umbrella like it's it's it's like when the wind hits it and like it's like inside out are we feeling it now you ready to go to comic-con can you feel it now mr krabs after thou feeling it now mr krabs we got to get you a little like link outfit he looks like he's about to give me the first quest in my pg village elder getting down this actually don't sound bad how much is my new cosplay future these are only $4 wow so there's an item on mystery tech that serves its intended function is kind of neat and affordably priced i i'm speechless what am i supposed to say it's it's it's does what it says and it's cheap i'd like to ask you to subscribe and ring ling the dang ling bell cuz otherwise my emo arc will be long and dark pretty happy with that catch day one editions okay so immediately i'm concerned the reason why i'm concerned is that day one editions launch editions limited editions are usually what you slap on the box when you're trying to ship something which is not complete oh what does it say amazon.com support a what is a day one addition of an amazon product a compatible echo device is required to pair your printer smart sticky note printer day one edition so you print out a sticky note isn't that what a sharpie for i have nothing yeah i i got nothing either what what what what have we ever been speechless so we got ourselves a roll of thermal paper which i will say does not look like a sticky note at all this is already more work than just going to target buying a sticky note and writing it yourself i'm trying to keep an open mind here it could be cool but also i'm so confused as to why mr basis would have ever green lit such a product also i can tell that austin has never worked in retail all right it's printing out how to get started alexa discover my printer starting discovery this will take a few moments this is really disturbing your printer hasn't connected to your wi-fi network stop wasting i didn't do it ken i did not do anything the printer printed out i hate the fact every time we reset it it has to print out another so stup it's connected we've used half the damn roll we're getting another message almost finished once the the level of stickiness of this by the way is also like the rece you get from mcdonald's after you spill some sprite onto it like it sticks but like not really alexa print me today's crossw do you want me to print today's crossw you can also pick a different date yes your request was sent to the printer thank you oh my god that's a okay oh my god that's enough 13 smartphone border it's bezel bezel a yeah mystery tag the star of everything everywhere all at once i don't know how to pronounce it but it's y who is the star of everything everywhere all at once use alexa to cheat abraham who is the father of us all that's alexa how much is the amazon smart sticky note printer recently on amazon the price for amazon smart sticky note printer ranged from $22 up to150 i'm going to go ahead and tell you that's wrong okay it is $110 not as bad as i thought what are you talking about that's horrible i can't get behind this alexa print me a sticky note i'm stupid note was sent to the amazon printer oh it's even timestamped is this an iphone this oh wait hold on hold on oh it's actually in there isn't it what do you think this is a game i mean usually you guys pull shenanigans yeah we've never pulled a shenanigan a day in our lives okay then i'm going open it up surprise it's a zen phone 9 i knew it why is a zen o why is a zen phone 9 in an iphone box because i might have thr thrown away the box before mystery tech but you opened an item of mystery tech yes cuz i'm making a dinky video on this okay so now i get this nonsense out of here this my friends is the asus zen phone 9 what we've got here is a smaller android device that packs what seems to be an impressive camera and some features that you probably haven't seen in a while this is some ancient technology called the head phone jack a little bit of a strange alien concept theoretically you could plug in head foams to your phone even though it is a small size of a device the thickness is a little bit chunky i mean you put it beside a z flip which is obviously a very very thick phone it's not that much thinner but it makes sense right if you're going to make a smaller sort of form factor of phone you got to flex somewhere it has two cameras it has an ultra wide and it has a gimbal main camera 50 megapixels which the gimbal only works in 1080 gimbal should be hardware not resolution based gimbal is more of a state of mind so i am now recording on the zen phone and while i'm going to try to be nice and smooth i mean it is doing a lot of stabilization do you think for 700 bucks this beats the value of an iphone 13 which is the same price it depends for camera i'd still get the iphone 13 but i do think that on the android side this is really competitive for 700 if you're looking for a small device the zenphone 9 certainly seems like it is well worth a look and it's also worth a look to go check out ken's video all about the zenone 9 apparently an xeria or something wait you're going to scratch the back of your z flip dude okay wear less tighter pants austin and cargo shorts we've got an apple bag is this an actual apple product yes is it really i took a trip up to san jose to visit some friends and went to apple park and picked you something up is this a gift from tim cook personally no he hates you are these children's clothes did you buy me children's clothes from the that is what you wear isn't it so there are two onesies here for no particular reason not like i would ever have a personal use for a onesie cuz that's wait are you saying you don't have a son anymore so if you'd like to indoctrinate i i mean get your child looking stylish early you can give them the green apple oh you know i like the fact that the buttons are color matched that's a very that's a very like sort of on brand kind of thing also i'm a big fan of the three snap on the bottom i don't like the extra snaps now i know that there's a snap for the head but that's not as as important i think you can just shove their head in there the heads ar important now this one's a little bit smaller but i immediately like this cuz this is the rainbow logo a is for apple oh that's adorable that's pretty good these sns are for the big head yeah go ahead lightning or usbc do you have the pro model or the poor model promotion 120 burps per minute i i would have waited for next year's model that's you know what though the older models are better you could always get a refurbish can we can we move on to the next item of mr you're the one who controls this true words have never been both true and false at the same time what's empire it says it on the box atlas custom wait wireless gaming m wait is this just a modelo ripoff it's got replaceable hot swappable switches that's okay i guess i will just admit that i am not a mouse afficianado i feel like i would probably just tweak the mouse once and never touch it again so we've got ourselves the very very lightweight regular shell and we have the mouse itself sounds like a mouse you can swap out the main grip to go from honeycomb aka trypophobia warning to a more regular standard version and you also can do that for the top as well i've never played around with switches for my mouse before it's definely not as common as keyboards are right now but i think there are companies out to change that that's actually a very interesting way to do put them yeah they're on their own little caddy that you can just pull out with your hand so you actually don't have to go super crazy like you would even on a hot top keyboard okay all right so i'm going to do a full test so these are the switches that come with it these are the quos these are the blues so okay pretty decent now we're going to move on to the red switches which are k's all right i'm going to do one red one blue all right now let's do my left versus right click so left click right click it's subtle but i can hear it that sounds exactly the same to me the true super fans know that the blue has 036 dbs more of pressure that give it an actuation point of third dee past center one sounded deeper than the other just vaguely that's what i said oh and we've got ourselves some rgb we got a little underglow as well as the actual logo itself looking at all of this i don't think there's anything here besides the hot swappable switches that would really make me want to go for this over something like a model o which really begs the question how expensive is this the price of the switches per pair is five bucks the price of the shell is $6 a piece as a wireless mouse 90 bucks is a lot of money man no dude what are you talking about that's not bad for all right all right all right all right all right if swappable mouse switches are the way you want to live your life then let me not stand in your way but let the light of freedom and justice lead the way to your promised land i'm just going to use a mod okay uncle sam so if you made it this far into the video thank you very much this really is meant as an easter egg for you for sitting through 2 hours and change of a giant compilation of mystery tech from 2022 i've spent the last few months putting this video together and it's been fun it's been really nice to look back because you know i look at the old studio stuff and that feels like it was forever ago but i mean that was just last year you know i mean we started shooting here in this studio in i think it was september or october of 2022 and you know it's it's funny i've got the the countdown till launch timer which we still keep on the back of the set and it has been 455 days in 23 hours since i pulled the pin on this and started the new mystery tech era so if you're watching this video in 2023 thank you very much for being a big supporter and you know sitting through this if you're watching this in 2024 and beyond well hello my friends and hopefully this jarring change from the mystery tch shenanigans hasn't woken you up from your slumber but i just want to take this opportunity and just give you a sincere thank you and i'm i'm looking back at again 2022 for these these videos that we've been able to make and you know 2022 was a very especially now that we're we got some time between it it's it was a very transitionary year you know 2022 was the year that we were simultaneously building out the new office from scratch which was a huge huge commitment to just not money but just time and effort and just kind of building the space out while still also maintaining the existing spaces that we had in our old studios not only for the this is studio but also for the main channel studio and as you've seen this video we had to do a clean transition from all the old stuff to the new stuff and get that all set up and then you know there was a lot of turmoil if i'm being honest with there's a lot of stuff that was that had to be dealt with in 2022 you know good and bad i i don't want to make it all seem bad but there was a lot of stuff you had to go through in 2022 and you know i mean now only in the personal side but on the business side you know the a lot of things changed had a second child in 2022 no actually it didn't that was technically 2023 but i found out that was going to happen 2022 regardless it was just one of those things where looking back has been a really fun time for me to put this video together so don't expect these things all the time this is much more of a special sort of end of year thing it's just one of those things where going into 2024 you know i'm shooting this the last couple couple days of december in 2023 i want to be more appreciative and more grateful for the time and the opportunity that i have to share with you and i'm sure you've seen lots of videos like oh it's the end of the year blah blah blah and like look this is no different right this is just a little easter egg for those of you who've sat through this very very long video but for those of you that have made it this far thank you incredibly deeply from the bottom of my heart for supporting what i do you know 2024 is the year that i will hit 15 years of full-time content creation on this channel and i'm not gna lie man i feel old i just just that is an insane number you know i mean i was 16 when i started like you know it's it's crazy at how far things have come and for youtube the way it is today it has to be at least in my opinion it has to be very polished it has to be on a schedule like it's a very i say corporate thing but i mean it's a job and it has to be taken very seriously which is fine there's nothing wrong with that but it doesn't really lend itself well in my opinion to conversations like this the more casual stuff for the the true hardcore supporters of the channel who have made this all possible so i just want to take this opportunity to just have a little chat with you because i just you know as i look at 15 years which is a an absurd number it just has me thinking a little bit about the future it's not some dramatic thing like go i'm quitting channel nothing like that no but i'm just trying to accept the idea that all of this has a an expiration date all this has an end date i mean nothing is forever in life and certainly not something that's this fun and this cool and you know my intention is to do it for another 15 years if i'm honest with you right but that decision is not always up to you you know some sometimes decisions get made for you and so i just want to take 2024 and sort of this this beginning of the second half of my career to be a little bit more appreciative and thankful of the things i get to do the thing the people i get to spend time with the amazing audience who gets to support it all and make it all possible because it's like i don't know it just i i think back i've been thinking back a lot lately i i think back to a lot of the things that i've been able to do over the last 15 years and i didn't appreciated enough you know and i don't know how many of you have been in this kind of sort of position but you know sometimes you get to do amazing cool stuff but it feels like it's just normal or it's supposed to be normal at the time you know like i just you know especially i think about you know the 2012 2016 kind of era for me and that was the time where i went from being sort of doing everything myself living in a little apartment in missouri and you know freaking surfacing for taco bell every couple days to traveling meeting all kinds of amazing people getting to do amazing things building the studio just just just building a company you know that was was a huge huge transition moving to you know california and all this kind of stuff and at the time it just felt like of course this is what i'm doing of course this is what i'm supposed to do you it was just it was just a no-brainer and i just blitzed through it but i look back and i kind of wish that i had savored some of those moments a little more because they're gone you know i'm never going to be able to do or experience or see a lot of those things for the first time again and so i i just want to be a little bit more circumspect i want to be a little bit more aware i want to be a little bit more plugged in to moments into things and i know i feel like i'm getting super deep here but you know what it's the end of the year you made it through a three-hour video hopefully you can hang out for another couple minutes with your buddy austin but yeah that's just one of the things that looking back at all these videos has really kind of made me nostalgic for but also i want to take that and put that toward the future right none of this is for real none of this is for ever none of this is guaranteed or promised or anything like that right like every day should be appreciated every day that i get to do this amazing job and you know i want to appreciate these moments so that you know 30 years from now i can look back and go you know what i did everything i could i appreciate it all and i apologize for making this sound like my retirement video cuz it is definitely not beard and all but it's just one of those things where i'm just trying to be more appreciative that's all so thank you very very much for watching for supporting the channel we got a ton of stuff coming up in 2024 and beyond so you know stay tuned all that kind of fun stuff this is not a desperate pre plea to smash that subscribe button this is just a very sincere thank you for watching this video for watching the channel and hopefully you eny enjoy many many more years of mystery tech h jinks shenanigans and other tom foolery and i'll be right there with you along the way so merry christmas happy holidays happy new year there we go sorry i'm getting a little bit emotional right now i will see you in 2024 my friends
