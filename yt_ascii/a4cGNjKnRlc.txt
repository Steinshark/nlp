- hey guys, this is austin and welcome back to broke vs. pro gaming. you guys really seemed to
enjoy the last episode, so this time we're taking
it to the gaming pc realm. - [ken] i got you. - what?
- [ken] here, hold the camera. - what?
- let's go, let's go. - what are you doing, ken? - let's go. - okay, so we are here at micro center to build the pro vs. broke gaming pcs. what is the budget this time? - so this is a better time
than ever to point out that this video is brought
to you by micro center. specifically my part of the video where i get to buy all the stuff with an unlimited budget thanks to our sponsor of today's video-- - [austin] are you serious--
- micro center! - [austin] right now? you're a sellout now. i'm fine, but you're the sellout. - look i'm not a sellout, i'm just here to let you know that this is one of micro
center's 25 locations - [austin] oh my god. - we're here in tustin, california, and if you want a link to any of the items that i bought today,
- of course. - they'll be in the description or feel free to visit
your local micro center. - you know, it's exactly like ken to get a secret sponsor and not tell me and of course that sponsor
benefits him and not me. i mean, i shouldn't be surprised. i feel like he has a lot of sponsors in mystery tech i'm just not aware of. what are you--
- this video is brought to you by micro center. go to micro center for
all of your pc needs. okay so all good pc builds, especially ones that
have unlimited budget, start with the pc case, of course. because this is the
thing that everyone sees and it's the thing that
signifies that you are pro. - [austin] because you
care about aesthetics, - i do.
- [austin] not performance. oh wait, this is a standing
desk with a pc in it. - [austin] we're not trying
to fit this in the office. no. no. no. no! - oh my god, what is this? - [austin] what is that? - oh my god, like it has the
water cooling in the front. - [austin] are you really just gonna buy a pre-built right now? - i mean, it's not
against the rules, right? i'm gonna go see if there's someone that can help us here...
- [austin] really, how many water-cooled computers
can micro center have? - wait... (laughs) - [austin] oh no. - (laughs) oh. - [austin] dude, are
you serious right now? - i've always wanted a
crazy rgb water-cooled pc. and that, that's pretty crazy rgb. - [austin] that's a maingear? - that is a maingear pc, actually. cool. - [austin] oh no. oh, there's a remote for it? - so it has core i9-9900k, 16 gigs of ram, one terabyte ssd, and 2080 ti, with-- - [austin] 2080 ti? - yeah, 11 gigs of vram. (laughs) and this pc is
running the best operating system for gaming, windows 10, which is available in the link in the description
below at microcenter.com. - this thing looks awesome. i have to do literally no work. i'm also paying for labor. but that's okay, i don't
have to pay for it myself. because the gracious sponsor
of today's video, micro center, is doing it for me. i will be taking this one, because it doesn't look like it is here. - [austin] are you just gonna take the display model right now? - i will take the display model. - [austin] you're--
- it's cheaper. it's cheaper. i know you like that. i know you like that. - [micro center rep] i
can actually tell you how expensive it'll be. - ooh. - [austin] are you getting a discount literally as we speak right now? - thank you micro center. - [micro center rep] he also looks cooler. did you see his shirt? - [austin] did you just
say he looks cooler? - (laughs) i love micro
center even more now. their employees know what's up. - [micro center rep] by the
way austin, the apple section is over there. (all laughing) - we couldn't make that
up, even if we wanted to. - so while ken might decide to go and buy some pre-built,
water-cooled computer, i am going to do it the old-fashioned way and build it myself. i mean, i'm working with less than 10% of what ken has, right? i mean, he has more money
in his water-cooling than i have for my entire setup. so one of my thoughts is, "i can go with, like, integrated
graphics, go super cheap, "or, i could cut all the corners and try to squeeze the cheapest
graphics card i can." hey, dude. - just wanna say hi. - aw, thanks man, i
appreciate it. (laughs) yeah, we're just shooting
a video right now. as you can probably see.
- yeah. - (laughs) awesome. hey, have a good one. - all righty, austin.
- oh. because you said budget,
i went ahead and grabbed-- - why would you do-- (laughs) what are you doing to me, man? - it's an open box. - it's an open box for what-- it's $700. - you're right, you're right. so let's scale it down a little bit. - (groans) this guy, this guy right here. one of the legit advantages of going to a store like micro center is that it's not as straightforward as, "oh, i'm just gonna order
this brand new part," right? i'm trying to take advantage of open box. i'm trying to take
advantage of bundle deals. i'm trying to take advantage
of the dusty thing they've got in the back that they
totally forgot about. like, whatever i can do
to save a few dollars and make my system remotely game-able... (stutters) game-ified, game-alicious... game... ...atastrophe. i need to game on a very small budget. - [ken] this is a very
explosive value, might one say. right, austin? - look, usually it's a good idea to get a very nice power supply that will work for
years and years to come, and give you excellent reliability. and sometimes, i'm trying to beat ken and i need a 400-watt power supply. look, sometimes in life, you do as i say, not as i do. that's it my friend. thank you so much, i would
shake your hand but-- - that's all right, i'll
give you an elbow bump. - i'm gonna do it very carefully. okay. we're gonna do this. thank you for the help.
- of course. - i am going to go and be
victorious in my gaming exploits. (clears throat) all right, so it is time to
build my micro center pc. now i see that you're already set up here. - [ken] i am. - like, how much work that took you. - [ken] it was very laborious. - oh, yeah. it was so hard
to plug in the power cable, press the rgb button. - [ken] dude, this thing
is not light at all. - oh, boo-hoo. you had to
pick up your $3,000 pc. - [ken] no, matt had to, but that's fine. - (laughs) you didn't even do it yourself. - so a bunch of y'all complained last time that i didn't have a mousepad. and the sponsor of today's
video, micro center, just so happened to pay for everything, and they also let me get a hyperx fury s... - [austin] did that come out of my budget? - probably. - [austin] it's on my receipt. - yeah. we're done. - [austin] (scoffs) that's...
yep. pro gamer right here, ladies and gentlemen. - [ken] what are you doing? - building my gpu mining case. there's a lot of components in here. - [ken] wow. that looks like a lot of work. - [austin] so, my graphics card should go something like here, - [ken] yes. - however, my motherboard... down here. because i believe as a mining card, this is meant to be used with risers. something that i did
not think ahead about. - [ken] hmm... team poverty
not looking great today. so, i'm just gonna take this, i'm just gonna put it-- no, i... - mine. no. - [ken] okay, well-- - [austin] i need a power supply, ken. if you're not gonna put it
next to the fire extinguisher, then i'm gonna take the
fire extinguisher to you. - look, it's fine. don't worry about it. - look, i'm just trying
to be a good friend. it's happened once
before, i'm out for him. like, i know it's kind of a competition, but i've gotta keep it friendly, and i care about his business. and i need to make sure
that fires don't happen on my watch. (laughs) look, i wasn't hired back
then, so, i mean. (laughs) - [austin] ken, with all
the fun you've been making of my pc, you missed the best part: my power cable. there we go, see? power cable. that's my
power button right there, - or as i like to call it, a detonator. - no, my power cable--
all right, you know what? so i think my broke setup is about done. as you can see, we have
our processor, our memory, motherboard, graphics
card, ssd, power supply, as well as our case. all set up, nicely
cable managed, and ready for some gaming action. hey, it works! i don't know what-- - [ken] (groans) here, all
right, take this, take this, take this, take this. - my graphics card is
spinning, my cpu is spinning. - [ken] oh, jesus. (laughs) - it's all right. look. once that this
works, i will actually try to clean some cables. my power supply is power supplying, and have i posted? nope, i want dvi, i want dvi, give me dvi. (groans) okay. i'm gonna
need to do some testing. but hey, this is a good sign. there's signs of life,
my fans are spinning, my usb peripherals are usb-ing, i'm sure i can figure this out. by tomorrow when we do
the actual test-off. (playful music) - [ken] we've been here for,
like, an hour and a half. - no, we're doing it tomorrow, it's fine. - [ken] okay. - so, after some minor
alterations to my computer, it is fully functional, with
some wonderful ltt store-- oh wait sorry, no (clears
throat) wrong channel. some generic brand cable ties to make sure that it is all perfectly
functional, perfectly wonderful, look. it's--
- it's very less bomb-like. - look, it's fine! don't mind the thin gauge wiring, don't mind the fact that
i don't have enough space to install games, so i
might be using external-- what are you doing? that's--
you just turned off my-- - it's on my side of the table, so... - i just had all the games
set up, i was all ready. you're a (beep). (laughs) - (laughs) i mean, there's a power button. how could i not press it? (slaps button) (slaps button) - last episode, we took a
look at the peripherals. so, monitor, mouse, keyboard, headset, and i pretty much showed the
world that you don't need to be ken bolido and spend
a giant pile of money on all your accessories. so i think it only seems fair that because we are doing the
gaming pc edition this time, we're gonna use all of
those same peripherals. except that ken forgot
to bring his headset and i have already used my
monitor for something else, so i'm seeing a downgrade
and he's seeing an upgrade. again, story of my life. ken cheats, i get the
worst end of it, it's fine. we have a full group of easy bots, i'm not cheating, my group's
not better or anything. now, let's play, shall we? so in my great need of a graphics card, i picked up whatever i could. and it is doing great for games. what it is not doing
well for is recording. which is why, even though i'm getting a very smooth, incredibly
buttery frame rate, the recording's, like, 10 fps. that's fine. he's got a graphics card with, like, shadow play and all this kind of stuff. i'm doing the old-fashioned
way, using obs. so, you know, cpu encoding is great, aka, my footage looks better in real life. don't mind this terrible recording. - [ken] all right, here we go. here we go. - you have no chance,
my friend, no chance. - [ken] no chance, eh? (gunshots in video game) bye, austin. (laughs) (austin groans) - [austin] (beep) run faster, run faster. - [ken] yeah.
- [austin] no. - [ken] look at all those kills. (laughs) (austin groans) - hey guys, this is austin. hey guys, i'm running away from ken. (austin mumbles) (laughs)
- [austin] what? - (laughs) couldn't run away fast enough. - this is bad, i don't
like this at all. oh, no. - all right, let's go play the objective. yeah. - [austin] there we go, got one, got one. - [ken] oh god. (laughs) i'm
almost dead. i'm almost dead. (austin laughs) not if he can find me, though, but. - [austin] look at that
excellent objective defense. what a great amount of teamwork
from me and my ai buddies. where are you? - [ken] oh, god, i'm not telling you. - [austin] oh, i see you,
i see you, i see you. (both exclaim) - (laughs) what was that? - [ken] oh man, so much
is happening right now. - this is such a mess
with all these easy ais, like everyone, literally everyone, sucks. - [ken] all right. road hog,
road hog, road hog next. road hog next. yeah. - damn it. come on. come on, go. (ken groaning repeatedly) - lucio, lucio! the (beep) was that? bastion. the (beep) bastion. you mother-- (groans) - (laughs) you raging over there, ken? - [ken] (groans) no. no. nooo! i was so close! - victory for team austin
and the cheap setup. (laughs) (groans) - played the game though.
- [austin] whatever. (mocking) played the game, my name's ken, i can play the game. - my bot team was awful. i carried everyone. - care to 1v1 in cs:go? - oh, yeah, yeah, totally. - i am running at a super
smooth 78 frames per second right now, at 1080p. - [ken] okay. oh god. oh. - (laughs) already. already.
- [ken] this is bad. this is bad, i don't like this. - [austin] ha ha ha, i'm
just gonna stay here. - [ken] there we go. (both exclaim) oh, rip. - [austin] oh, god.
- [ken] rip, three. - [austin] i don't like this.
- [ken] it was a three-piece! - [ken] oh my god,
this terrible display. this terrible display- - [ken] oh god. no. no. no.
- [austin] (yelling) yes, yes! - no, no, no, no, no! - yes!
- i was not ready! i was not ready! - i mean, it took me 30 shots to get you, but it's fine, it counts. - [ken] oh, man. - [austin] someone's about to spawn in, i'm literally gonna shoot
him in the back of the face. oh (laughs) okay.
- [ken] oh, jesus christ. - [austin] not the case. are you gonna get swept right now? am i gonna beat you in
both games right now? is that what, that kinda seems what... oh. - [ken] one.
- [austin] okay. - [ken] oh, that was a two piece. cool, i did not even realize. no, that is austin! that is austin! - [austin] no!
- [ken] that is austin! - no! - [ken] it's now a problem of, i'm trying to compete for kills with my... - [austin] with your teammates? - [ken] yeah. oh my-- - [austin] it's okay,
they're bots, they're fine. - [ken] there we go. - [austin] oh hi, it me. - oh my god, my bots are just too good. the robots are taking over
the world, sure, whatever, but what the (beep),
don't steal my kills, man. why? - i'm almost in last place right now. this is not good. i've died a lot of times in a row. - [ken] one. two. all right, yep.
(austin laughs) back in first place, what is up? (austin sighs) - so what have we learned today? - nobody won. - thank you very much for watching this episode of pro vs. broke gaming, and let me know in the comm-- no... (groans) you're gonna break your headphones. my computer will chew
them up and spit them out. thank you very much for watching this episode
of pro vs. broke gaming. and of course, let us know
who won in the comments below? is it ken and his
ridiculous overkill system? or is it me? with the every man, practical system that anyone could build. (wire rattling against computer) (both laugh) - just having a little
fun, sorry. (laughs) - we'll see you guys next time.
