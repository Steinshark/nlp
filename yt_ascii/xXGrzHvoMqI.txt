those of you who were teenagers or tweeners in the early 2000s probably remember myspace the big dog in town before facebook came along to seal its thunder even once accounted for over four percent of all u.s website visits that's a lot and it was a place for friends and a crazy vortex of sparkly unicorn gifs and bad emo songs and while myspace had problems with spam and poor design that ultimately led to its downfall plenty of folks do still miss it and now my myspace clone called space hay that popped up in late 2020 already has a user base well into the six figures but why has it become popular all of a sudden is it just a nostalgia rush for those of us who miss a simpler time or is it really offering something the big social networks don't well aside from the combo of millennials wanting a blast from the past and zoomer is curious about the way things used to be space hate is actually notable for what it doesn't have according to a developer a teenager from germany there are no algorithms that try to feed you content that's addictive spammy or annoying so forget about a feature that's like tick tocks for you there isn't even a like function or a news feed pushing posts at you so space hey clearly isn't built for chasing your dopamine fix in fact there aren't no algorithms at all and no ad tracking meaning it's a lot like the older web where you had a relatively blank slate strobing banner ads notwithstanding you'd populate it with whatever you wanted to say or to show to people and that was kind of it space a profile pages themselves are almost an exact replica of myspace you get a small profile photo an about me section a prominent area that displays people you friended and any comments they may have left for you as well as a section to list interests blogging forums and instant messaging are all supported as well as custom html and css so you can make your profile page just as gaudy and terrible as it was when myspace ruled the world that's a bad idea by the way custom html is like really exploitable but that's about the end of the feature list space hey feels like a foil for the major social media services like twitter instagram and facebook which are extremely pervasive in our lives not just because we use them so much because when we do use them there are always so many things jockeying for our attention between promoted ads algorithmically optimized outrage and people trying to dunk on each other in replies many users report feeling overwhelmed and burnt out and the algorithms can't work without collecting lots of data on our lives and preferences so it isn't surprising that these services notably facebook have been embroiled in huge amounts of controversy over how this data is handled and even when it isn't the companies themselves misusing the data there's a strong argument to be made that the post as often as you can nature of these services promotes over sharing and this feeling of having your life being made a little too public combine it with controversies over disinformation and low self-esteem promoted by these algorithms and it shouldn't be surprising that enough people just they want some kind of alternative they can at least use on the side of course we're not going to say space hay is going to be the next big social media giant but it's not trying to be it's likely to remain a niche service for the curious the exhausted and the minimalist but isn't that just what we might all need these days now if you'll excuse me i'm often to go listen to some mcr thanks to secret lab for sponsoring today's video secret lab chairs are engineered to keep you incredibly comfortable for long hours at work and play the new titan evo 2022 chair keeps you feeling comfortable for longer hours with their 4-way lumbar support ultra comfortable line of different seat material and more all of their chairs come with up to 5 years of extended warranty and a 49-day return policy head to the link in the description below to check out secret lab today thanks for watching guys like dislike check out some of our other videos comment with video suggestions and don't forget to subscribe and follow
