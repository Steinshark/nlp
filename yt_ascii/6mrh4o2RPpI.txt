three two one holy in front of us we have seven phones seven of the wildest rarest limited edition phones you've ever seen so let's go from hard to find to one of a kind you'll see what i mean alright number seven is the galaxy s21 olympic games athlete edition because yes samsung created just 17 000 of these units exclusively to give one to each olympic and paralympic athletes who competed in the tokyo olympic games a few months ago the 17 000 is not a lot of units for a company who might sell 10 20 million of their normal variants and so of course a whole bunch of these athletes stop them on ebay and i was one of the suckers who paid three thousand dollars for one i just want to make good videos okay the packaging isn't anything elaborate very eco-conscious but there are a few extras for example every athlete who got one of these phones also got a pair of purple galaxy buds pro as far as i can see though they are literally just the normal buds that anyone can buy but then also a limited edition case for those buds with this skateboarder chilling inside samsung's latest foldable and then the phone itself that is gorgeous i think this is an exquisite color combo i love this contrast of the deep blue on the back with soft gold all the way around the rims which i'm imagining is symbolic of a gold trophy only trophy i've won in a while and if we compare it to the original galaxy s21 they've changed a lot of stuff here it's got this pretty wacky new startup animation it's got new olympic wallpapers a new color scheme which feels like quite a departure and more importantly a completely different style this is the first time i think i've ever seen samsung using circular icons and i actually think it's an improvement but i'm even more excited about this one so i've grown up watching a fair few martial arts movies my dad loves them and within this genre there is one guy who is normally referred to as the single greatest icon bruce lee and so i almost can't believe i'm saying this but in front of me right now is the bruce lee phone and while samsung's athlete edition was pretty rare at 17 000 units this one has just 4 000 globally full stop i'm not exactly sure how this links to bruce lee exactly but this is meant to be a gaming phone with a whole load of very excessive gaming features what an unboxing experience though it's like a pop-up book underneath the phone we've got a yellow bumper case i'm not sure i've ever seen one of those come with a phone oh this is so cool they've actually gone as far as to change the color of the charger and cable and this isn't any ordinary charger and cables it's a 67 watt fast charger and an l-shaped usbc cable they've probably done this so you can carry on playing even while charging they've even changed the color of the inside of the usbc plug completely unnecessary attention to detail but it does make it feel exclusive okay that is one of the most class designs i think i've ever seen it's far from elegant but it's got these little textured grips on the sides where your fingers rest the camera system looks genuinely different and the colors are punchy as hell get it a joke if you're going to make a sharp aggressive gaming phone that's how you do it it's try it oh there's leds inside the camera and also because it's a phone made for gaming if i release these catches here you get physical shoulder buttons that pop up from the sides watch how i break it before i've even turned it on there's a bruce lee start of animation hmm the only let down here is that once you get into the phone it's literally just a normal ui no special bruce lee theming or icons seriously number five is a bit of a different limited edition actually in that it doesn't really have a theme so you might have heard of the me 11. it's xiaomi's main 2021 flagship they're equivalent to samsung's s21 well alongside that phone they also launched the me 11 special edition which serves no other purpose than to just be a fancier version of the me 11. i like the box it swaps out the flat black or white that you'd normally get for this reflective rainbow finish you get an insert oh okay just a normal clear case you get the phone and then just a normal charger and cable this is very very interesting in contrast to how vanilla the unboxing experience is the phone itself is psychedelic i feel like i'm getting dizzy just looking at it it's like every single color everywhere at the same time but also like it's properly ridged listen to this i feel like i could file my nails on that and then at the bottom you get this mini paragraph which i think looks kind of nap but then also a signature from legion the ceo of xiaomi now i feel like here in the west most people don't know who he is but in the east he's got crazy fandom he's considered like the steve jobs of china the software isn't anything out of this world phone number one is number four though i'm expecting this to be god tier so right here we have not one but two different super limited versions of the oppo find x3 pro which is oppo's 2021 flagship and if you've seen any of oppo's past limited editions you'll know that this company does not mess around so let's start with the mars exploration edition long story short in 2020 china launched their first ever robotic spacecraft straight to mars to pick up rock samples audio recordings just to figure out as much stuff as possible about this planet and this year in 2021 that craft successfully landed so this is a celebration of that what did they do to this box kind of looks like it has explored mars on the way here it's really heavy though that's a good sign and straight up love this orange and gray color combo you get a hardback 2021 mars board to i don't know look at the phone we'll get to that in a second and oh strong black theme also running through this which i guess makes sense because space is black and black is also kind of what companies have started using for their pro phones and this phone is extremely pro it's the highest possible spec of the pro version of their 2021 flagship so we're talking 16 gigs of ram 512 gigs of storage the full works and then finally a case that feels quite gritty i guess like the surface of mars okay the phone itself it's made of frosted gray glass smoothed out almost to the point of being soft to the touch this might just be the single most comfortable thing i've ever held there's literally not a single sharp edge here but yeah i mean as a color we've seen gray before that said there's a few cool things about this so for starters it's got engraved into it utopia punisher which is the site that china landed in on mars isn't it kind of crazy that we now have names for places on other planets you get an exclusive mars wallpaper that shows the planet at various different times throughout the day and a color filter in the camera that can apparently make earth look like mars and secondly the photographer edition this only just recently came out it's a collaboration between oppo and kodak it's almost impossible to find and i think it's going to put the last one to shame i love this so this entire phone and unboxing experience is themed after the kodak 35 which is one of the company's most iconic cameras actually used a lot during world war ii we've got a plush leather-like material on the outside and a metal lift this is top five smartphone boxes i've ever opened and felt on the inside of the lid too they really have gone hard okay so then there's a hardback insert with some manuals inside the phone we get a chunky insert wow that's that's stunning white leather on top black leather on the bottom a pair of earphones plus a lanyard that attaches onto the case so that you don't drop your phone while taking photos and then right at the bottom is a fast charger and a usbc cable this is so slick it's combo it's silver fogged glass on the top to give the impression of metal and then the bottom half is leather it's not particularly plush leather but i'm well on board with the concept of both having leather and two-toned phone backs like this the software looks pretty familiar if you've used an oppo phone before but being the photographer edition this has 14 different filters to use for different types of cityscapes oh yeah and also this is a top spec find x3 pro so 16 gigs of ram 512 gigs of storage but with this you also get a terabyte of cloud storage to be able to keep your photos my only reservation is that of all camera companies to partner with why oppo chose kodak it's not like they're exactly known for their high-end imaging exposure probably an unfortunate camera button hey do you want to hear about a really poorly named phone like way worse than even sony's naming well this right here is the smartphone for snapdragon insiders that's literally the model name it's like if i change my channel to youtuber for phone enthusiasts you might have heard of qualcomm they make the snapdragon chips that power almost every android flagship well what tends to happen is at the start of each generation qualcomm will come and say hey this is our next generation chip it's going to allow phones with this chip to do this this and this but then in reality almost no phone maker fully takes advantage of the chip so one day qualcomm is just like screw it we're making our own this thing is super limited it's fifteen hundred dollars it's not even trying to sell in big numbers but its cameras have been rated as well above the galaxy s21 ultras and it's audio quality apparently in a league of its own this is actually why it comes with these earphones included see one of the key things that their latest chip supports is the ability to wirelessly play songs in what they call studio master quality and these are some of the few earphones that can properly take advantage of that anyways you also get a red and black bumper case i can think of one youtuber who'd appreciate this a thick chunky case for those earphones and then whoops the charging brick plus cables [music] okay this design is not for me even with the led backlit logo the whole thing feels distinctly prototype and lost in some halfway house between going for actually sharp square edges and the more elegant circular design elements everything from the screen bezels to the home screen wallpaper to the sheer size of this unit are all a bit clunky let's try this camera though i am curious that's a pretty spicy photo not gonna lie but what about this audio quality well i have title loaded up which is basically the audiophile version of spotify first time i'm trying this let's go right it's tough for me to say how much this is going to be the earphones and how much of it is the chip on the phone but this combination is so rich that it almost wants to make me forgive the naming okay number two this one's taken me a long time to get hold of lots of ebay alerts and eventually two thousand seven hundred dollars of cash too so late last year oneplus decided to partner up with the video game cyberpunk 2077. and to be fair to them this could have been an awesome deal cyberpunk was pegged to be literally the game of the decade but when it eventually came out and it was so unbelievably glitchy that playstation refused to sell it i imagine oneplus probably decided not to talk about this too much the sad part of it is though this might be their coolest limited edition ever so much so that if you get the full set it comes in three separate puppets oh glitches how appropriate so we'll start with the phone i have seen a few photos of it online and i remember when i first looked at it i was just like that this is more than just a paint job this is a redesign we've got an outer sleeve that's new i'm assuming this is the map of the game world which the night city the core accessories they don't look too different we still get a white power brick phone on top instead of red charging cable but this is where it starts getting special you get a cyberpunk badge that's kind of horrifying to be honest a pretty stealthy black and yellow case and then inside this insert are actually more cyberpunk goodies legends are born in night city i'm pretty sure you were born in china but sure the sheet of stickers and the poster here's the main event though okay this is so well done like it is actually based on this phone the oneplus 8t but the limited edition is so heavily customized that you wouldn't know looking at it how they've extended the camera across the entire width of a phone how the back goes from glossy to matte to glossy how thomas got this concrete finish in the middle and yellow and gold highlights throughout let's boot it up oh that's different and slightly alarming a few cool things to note when you're in the phone the live wallpaper is wicked i've never seen a phone theme this heavily customized you've got black and yellow everywhere sci-fi sound effects baked in and i really respect when companies go to lengths like this they've even made custom cyberpunk themed fingerprint scanner animations i wonder if the camera is different oh yeah yeah look we've got a cyberpunk filter here too called night city oh listen to that i think that's one of the most well executed filters i've ever used damn not like i've just come out the oven and if you think about it this cyberpunk collab makes so much sense like every single year companies come on stage to tell us that their new phone is the future and when you're collabing with a game that's literally set in the year 2077 it allows you to run with that idea cube doesn't want their tech to be more futuristic plus this desirability is also fueled by how hard the damn thing is to get hold of oneplus never announced exactly how many units but i do know that in some countries like malaysia there were as few as 10 phones available okay so then we have the second part of this to watch this is a cyberpunk version of the oneplus watch which to be honest has a product on its own i don't rate too highly its operating system is pretty limited but for the same reason that i love this future theme on the phone it might well also add something here too so far so good big fan of the yellow accents dotted all the way around it pairs really well with the phone one hour maybe it's just a shame that the software is a genuine mess i've spent at least a full hour trying to set this thing up using three different phones and i've had three separate error messages on them ironically and unfortunately quite fitting without the game turned out but hey if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be smooth bit of a letdown overall i almost feel like this cyberpunk theme was slightly wasted on the mid-range oneplus 8t and the mediocre oneplus watch but really is actually the part that i'm most excited about it's apparently a hand belonging to one of the main characters from the game which also doubles as a charger alrighty if it's nice i might actually keep this as a permanent fixture in the room oh [music] honestly i am not that impressed it's very plasticky the fingers can't move as i've just found out and it's completely hollow [music] so that leaves us with number one the most limited exclusive thing from this video by an absolute landslide and you can bet your bottom dollar that of course this is from caviar who like to take expensive things and add even more expensive things to them and as it turns out this company is also celebrating the exact same thing the oppo is celebrating the fact that china reached mars just in a slightly more elaborate way so we have a pair of mars shoes in here which i've had to restrain myself like crazy from looking at and then we have the mars smartphone in this box here and they're calling this god of fire all right there's not much to unwrap here it's a shoebox but i'm kind of like nervous excited like these are two thousand dollar shoes that is many many times more value than any shoe i've ever even looked at let's do it got a little letter on top so the first one says international certificate of ownership gold engraving russia they're gold on these shoes but then what is this one this certificate confirms that the fragment used to create this design is part of a martian meteorite found in 2011 in morocco excuse me definitely the fanciest shoes that have ever entered this building it's just a bit of blue crinkle wrap left oh my god oh my god what's this i mean i guess if you're spending two grand on a pair of shoes you you want them to stand out they do that you might even be able to see these from mars even the souls are like hand painted it looks like a martian crater these feel good so they're basically a heavily customized pair of nike air force ones which i mean they're nice shoes but they're not more than like 150 the reason these are priced at 2 000 is a the paint job b the spaceships which are the things that are made of gold and see this little fragment of meteorite oh also they're limited to 29 pieces do they go well with my four dollar t-shirt okay finally god of fire what does a phone titled god of fire even look like time to find out oh i like this i don't remember the last time i've seen deep red packaging like this it feels premium but i guess you'd expect that for 28 000 okay so caviar normally have an inner box inside of this outer box yes oh that's even nicer anyways moment of truth three two one [music] holy it's so cool i love dragons oh i love the color scheme so we have a gold letter a whole bunch of letters that's a lot of smoke so this is a certificate for all the gold on it international warranty there's a guide on how to use it three boxes inside first one is a plain white cable the middle one plain white charging brake and then the final one oh plain white earphones i don't think an m pro would be impressed and then you've got a sim ejector tool which is made of gold and then this is a tool you actually need to work the back of the phone what do we have here so it starts with red composite stone to mimic the features of the red planet the black parts are titanium with apparently a pvd coating for extra strength frock test it also apparently just like the shoes has a fragment from mars in it again i say apparently just because i'm not a geologist i've got no way of confirming that that is what they say the dragon is' karat gold and get this all of the frames are double plated in 24 karat gold and then you've got this enormous thing i swear this phone is just a portable jewelry cabinet this is a mechanical watch with a built-in tourbillon or in other words a mechanism that allows it to ignore the effects of gravity it is ludicrusty extra especially for a device that literally tells you the internet synced time on the front or ready but then again i'm probably not the target customer here if you think about actually this is basically an extreme china phone it's based on a chinese device the huawei mate 40 pro which was also selected because of its lunar ring circular camera module the phone as well as the entire packaging is red and gold which are two colors that when combined together in chinese culture symbolize good fortune it's got what looks an awful lot like a chinese dragon and on top of all that if you look carefully you'll see that the watch face as well as the camera module they paired together to make the number eight which is considered to be the luckiest number by the chinese and to top the whole thing off there are only eight of these being made and this is number one so alongside scripting this video one thing that i've also been doing in my downtime is listening to the audiobook of june through audible who sponsored this video and i'm not gonna lie to you up until about two weeks ago i thought audible was just someone reading out to book to you but it isn't it's like experiencing a 20-hour movie there's a cast list there's different people reading the lines of different characters so you get a proper feel for who's who and there's like an entire soundtrack that ramps up in the big moments and then peters down in the slow ones the key word was maker maker maker there is a ridiculous amount of content here on every genre of audiobook and i'm like proper impressed that before you even commit to one of them you can see a three-tiered rating system based on other users feedback so if you want to check it out head to audible.com mr who's the boss or you can actually text mr who's the boss to 500 500 to get one free audiobook a 30 day free trial and access to the plus catalog to check out my previous ridiculously priced unboxing that's here or to see why i'm worried about the future of humanity that video is here my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss catch you in the next one [music]
