i know what you're thinking it's only been nine months since our last 500 budget build but in that short time we've seen amd and intel launch new product families and we've seen inflation take away about three percent of our buying power which had a 500 budget works out to about 15 which is the difference between 8 and 16 gigs of ram or between a 512 gig and a one terabyte ssd so you got a lot of questions to answer today like how far will 500 go if we want the latest cpu tech will we be able to afford a good gpu an okay gpu a gpu can i afford a segue to our oh i faked you out we're gonna get right into it today starting with the core i3 13100f four hyper-threaded performance cores and a boost clock of 4.5 gigahertz the core i3 13100f doesn't offer a lot of bells and whistles it doesn't even have onboard video but it does support intel's latest platform features like pcie gen 5 and ddr5 even if we won't be using them and it's only a hundred dollars making it well the only option by comparison the cheapest 7000 series ryzen cpu is the 7600 for a whopping 120 dollars more to be clear it is much faster six cores rather than four at up to 5.1 gigahertz but at this price amd just isn't viable for our system and what's really wild is even if we go back to their older am4 platform we find that amd has simply abandoned the budget-minded customers that kept them alive during the bad years even with a ryzen 5600 we would need to make extra compromises to hit our 500 budget like trying to find a free case or buying a used gpu but today is a no compromise day i especially am not going to compromise on this segway to our sponsor enlisted take part in iconic world war ii campaigns in this immersive free to play first person shooter use detailed era accurate firepower to dominate the competition get enlisted at the link below unlike 20 years ago when i first got into this hobby there's not much left in the way of bad motherboard brands so really what it comes down to is finding something that has the features and connectivity that you require we settled on the b660m hdv from asrock it's got a total of six usb 35 gigabit ports including one type c dual m.2 ssd slots ample pcie usb 2 and sata expansion and while it only has two ddr4 memory slots unlike the h610 chipset motherboards that come in a little bit cheaper than this those slots support overclocking which means we're not leaving any performance on the table i well not that that's necessarily concern given our ram choice we ended up with a single eight gig stick of patriot viper elite 2 and i know i know is going to be a bit of a controversial pick so please allow me to explain this lands firmly in the bang for the buck speed range for this platform and while we could have gone with 16 gigs of ram or at least a dual channel 8 gig kit which would have netted us some additional performance it's a slippery slope right guys i mean if we start with a budget but then we keep saying ten dollars more suddenly we find ourselves with a six hundred dollar build rather than a 500 build and a hundred dollars of debt to our mean older sister it's far better to just drop a second stick in down the road upgrade to dual channel later when it can be found dirt cheap second hand or when cash flows a little bit looser which while i tend to shy away from the f word ended up being one of the big themes of this build let's talk about storage for nearly the same price as this intel 670p 512 gig ssd i could have had an ssd and hard drive combo that would have netted me significantly more capacity and in an era when some games will take up a hundred gigs on their own there's no question that that's desirable but storage is one area where i just don't like to screw around and the 670p is not only a known good performer punching well above its pcie gen 3 weight class it's also got an excellent reputation for reliability i mean do you want to be gaming or do you want to be waiting around for a warranty replacement that might never come and besides once this is full and you want to boost your storage space down the line those dirt cheap drives on newegg are still going to be there and you can always throw them in knowing that you've got a rock solid foundation though i'm not sure i can say the same about our case the diy pc f2's main selling point is available in purple or orange it doesn't have entirely terrible cable management thanks to this kind of popped out back panel here you can see when we pop off the panel it's totally flat here no room for anything but that's where your space is as far as i can tell it's to save the like six percent materials cost of making everything else a little bit bigger to accommodate that extra width so you just stamp it out of the side panel it's it's ingenious actually truthfully though none of that is why we chose this we chose it only because it is literally the cheapest matx case that we could find on pc part picker and i would never buy this case not because i'm some kind of out of touch elitist but because i am willing to get down and dirty if scavenging from a dumpster means saving 38 dollars almost 10 percent of my total budget here i'll do it and you should too the atx standard hasn't been meaningfully changed in almost 30 years which means unless you're buying a top of the line gpu which you're not your modern system will probably fit in this or this or this or this or this and on the subject of using what you've got let's talk about cooling even as you start to upgrade the machine the cpu heatsink is one of the last things that i would recommend you spend money on intel stock cooler it ain't much but it'll take you all the way up to a 13 700 non-k so you might as well use it now we just need to plug in our cpu fan header and while we're at it let's do our case fans as well we've got the rear one and the fun one header here yes if you must have something bigger or especially quieter there are plenty of options in the 15 to 40 dollar price range we're going to have some of those linked down below or you could just take my advice and spend that on an adorable wag hoodie for your four-legged friend just 24.99 at lttstore.com now we just got to do a little bit of cable management here's our front usb 2 as well as our hd audio oh so convenient these come in little bricks easy peasy they only go in one way i can't say the same for our front panel connectors but what i can say is everything is very helpfully labeled reset right power switch last thing we've got is our front usb 3. just be careful with this one these pins are very fragile make sure you got it aligned before you click it in time for power this is going to be yet another controversial choice we've gone with the enermax cyber brawn 500 watt it's non-modular but it does at least have black cables so it'll look nice it's 80 plus bronze it's got dual six plus two pcie connectors so it's good for pretty much any performance tearing down gpu but the issue is that you can get a functioning power supply for as little as like 20 bucks the issue for us is that our options below this price point are either from unknown brands or from thermaltake whose entry level lineup doesn't have a great reputation and the thing is given the risk of collateral damage when a power supply blows from my point of view you just can't afford not to spend a bit more here didn't really script anything for cable management here so i guess we're just gonna wing it oh yeah eight pin the eight pin has no cable management cut out so it's just gonna go here this is going to come right here cool not bad not bad yeah yeah i just do everybody just relax for a second okay all right go there all right and now it's pretty all right again i had to segue into this written but we're completely off script now so i'm just going to open by saying it's amazing what 200 bucks can buy again these days anything the asrock challenger d radeon rx 6600 has eight gigs of vram a core clock of 1626 megahertz and a dual fan cooler that's not bad considering that our only real criteria was how much money do we have left okay i'll take that one at two hundred dollars you're pretty much looking at the gtx 1660 or the rx 6600 between those two the 6600 is much newer and way more powerful see you later nvidia not bad though right no i mean it's not great but but not bad powers in and everything's looking pretty good on this side not as great on this side we'll deal with that in a sec first i want to address some of the other options for gpus if you're not married to buying brand new at 200 there are some very interesting options in the second hand market including 2080s 1080 ti's 5700 xts and 6600 xt's it's a lot more performance but you do miss out on your warranty oh boy oh i don't know if i want you to roll on this yeah wow that's something really good case wow it's like it's like that video of the bloated whale carcass where the guy like cuts it open it's like okay let's fire it up oh how close the panels bad gbs it's not gonna work everything up after a small mail-in rebate i think it was like 10 bucks right we are just under our budget at 498 dollars we're gonna have a link in the description to our pc part picker list before you click on that though let's see if it's worth buying this is freaking awesome sitting at nine percent eight six percent cpu usage with screen capture going we're using the gpu for encoding that does still use a little bit of cpu let's fire up a game we're gonna go hard going straight to halo infinite i think we can go to high preset we started the game to take effect now i'm not going to restart the game fine whatever 1080p medium preset still we're looking at 80 fps for our one percent lows so if you're losing at that point that's on you that's good they didn't even pick up my sniper these guys suck definitely struggling a little bit sometimes the real world experience is not quite on par with what the fps numbers would suggest it's almost like there's a little bit more input lag can't put my finger on it no i'm busy winning i'm the top on my team what do you mean that's what winning looks like you want me to capture this like fine i'll capture the flag i don't even care wait 10 seconds 10 seconds of what we're almost out of time draw or oh we won we won what we won all right do eternal hey but notice how quiet it is not bad generic orange led fans and even that poor intel stock heatsink when it's barely doing any work very quiet i think ultra nightmare is probably a little aggressive for this let's try high something something's attacking me look i don't have any audio and this is running amazing okay i probably could be running ultra nightmare right now okay we're turning it up it's way way too good ultra nightmares a little much that's not quite right oh crap yeah no this is laggy let's try a nightmare or let's try ultra how about ultra okay too easy now we're getting 150 frames per second there has got to be a middle ground here you know what i thought it was a cpu issue even playing a single player game four cores these days very borderline i'm hitting 80 plus sometimes 90 cpu usage do maternal right in multiplayer games there's a little bit more for the cpu to keep track of and that can be more of a challenge to be clear it was very playable but it's not going to be necessarily optimal but i only have a pistol now wait what was that oh that was was that warm-up my knife what's happening right now oh man oh did i yeah yeah it is free from okay no no so i was supposed to do that so that was epic then yeah whatever dang it oh come on come on they're too good i can't hit myself i'm coming at him for every side he's dominating me yeah thank you for that david anyway we're getting anywhere from 150 to 300 frames per second i'd say that's fairly playable not that it helps me not suck no i'm killing this guy how david help me out here these guys good or am i terrible oh who would have thought that intel would be not just a good budget gaming option but the budget gaming option if we wanted to go amd with this we'd have to go all the way back to am4 maybe a ryzen 5600 on an a520m board or something like that the point is that's taking me into probably going to regret this territory on the cheapness of the motherboard and it would still cost me a bit more and if i wanted to spend a bit more this is still a great starting point i could cheap out on my case and spend a little bit more i could get a core i5 13 400 on the same platform or if i didn't want to spend anything at all i could go for the segway to our sponsor enlisted transport yourself onto the battlefield
