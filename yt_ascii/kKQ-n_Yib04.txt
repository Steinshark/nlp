ladies and gentlemen it is with great pleasure that i welcome you to the champions chess tour finale of 2023 one of the last epic chess events that we have of this calendar year featuring an allstar lineup and it is currently being held in toronto canada where i will soon be going i'm only delayed at home as i'm recovering from illness and i'm going to be making this recap for all of you $500,000 worth of prizes magnus carlson hikara nakamura the two big names but we have fabiana car we have wesley so we have maxim vra ali resua okay we have no be abaturov and we have the youngster from bellarus and that is dennis lazovic it is eight players they play around robin then there is a playoff system and today we had games one and two we had rounds one and two and you're going to want to watch this whole recap because the last game i'm going to show you has probably the move of the day these games were exciting ferocious i hope i didn't forget any players we're going to cover the games of everybody i'm going to feature incredible moments from all sorts of different games all over the board and you know ju just in case you don't believe me i won't put an ad on this video in like the last seven minutes there's going to be no so ju because i i need you to see the move of the day all right magnus carlson opened up against the eighth seed dennis lvic the stat the statistics said that dennis lvic has an 0% chance of winning this event that is insulting let's see magnus opens with d4 and dennis lazovic plays a solid queens gambit decline setup he doesn't play dc he doesn't play the semi tash he literally literally just plays the uber solid queens game of decline dennis lazovic is a very solid player in fact he i believe boasts the highest average accuracy over a certain period of time in these rapid games the the format is 15 minute with 3 seconds bonus time they play two games against each other and if it's tied 1-1 they play armageddon in the armageddon you bid for a certain amount of time black starts with less time but a draw is actually a win for black that is the way they break the tie in these events oh crack my neck here we go magnus plays an exchange queen's gambit declined and dennis lazovic immediately goes after his bishop this is the opening game of the event so you're kind of getting a sense of who's in what form who's feeling confident magnus volunteers his bishop for capture and then he plays g3 bishop d3 and then he plays this move h4 very interesting and provocative approach by magnus looking for potential h5 ideas while accepting that he could have light squired weaknesses in the future but he does have a very very strong dark sor setup for now knight a6 and now lavic is trying to go here he probably thought magnus is going to play a3 in this position and then he's going to wrap around the knight at some point but instead of that in instead of that after knight to a6 magnus takes the knight removing his other bishop completely from which is that's a massive decision and now he's trying to play this type of position versus the young man from bellarus doubled a pawns potential weakness of a c pawn and magnus will play knights versus bishops horses versus pointed hats castles by magnus he understands that the light scores are weak but there's no way for dennis to really exploit them so now rook e1 knight e5 look at this look at magnus's knights dancing around the board taking advantage of some of those weaken squares that was a massive decision he made earlier but his knights are looking good dennis lazovic threatens a mate against magnus looks unstoppable but you're forgetting maybe you're not forgetting you're waiting for me to tell you knight takes bishop and now when everything is said and done one guy just has a little bit too much of a weakness queen c2 rook c1 and we go for an end game queens and rooks but when you're playing the goat and in particular his skill is technical play and end games it's going to be really difficult and you can try to trade as many pawns as you want but magnus sends us to an end game where he's picking up pawns and i got to tell you though dennis is is is not going anywhere he's got a couple of weaknesses but somehow he's turned this into a bit of a mess magnus has to take and go after that pawn but look at dennis's a pawn rook d2 rook a8 and i don't actually think that dennis is all that worse anymore according to computer magnus has this incredible cluster but somehow dennis is doing a good job but he's magnus and despite all of his best efforts look at look at dennis rushing a little bit apparently dennis should have went here and just stayed exactly like that and believe it or not magnus came can't do anything you might be confused you might go what do you mean what he's he won the pawn yeah he won the pawn but his king is cut off from the entire board and dennis actually had a chance to save the end game but because dennis rushed with his pawns and tried to trade a little bit too quickly what ended up happening was he played rook b1 and rook f1 and magnus created a barrier and then managed to run his king over and obtained a winning position by getting to an unbreakable setup and just advancing his gepon and dennis had to resign it was a really valiant effort dennis opened the day by nearly saving an end game against magnus down two pawns he ended up losing it was a good win for magnus an expected win if you will and dennis has nothing to be ashamed of i mean that was a very very very good start now i got some epic games for you hikaro versus wesley in round number one you will remember if you were watching the event last year in toronto that wesley was the one that knocked hikaru out completely in the semi-final hikaru opens with one of my favorites the trompowsky unfortunately all top grand masters they play the critical lines which is d5 c5 hikaru sends us to a position with damaged structure wesley's going to win that pawn back soon there it is he has won it back hikaro here throws in kind of a dislodging check wesley blocks very flashy move if you take the knight there is rook c8 and stuff on c1 so hikaro doesn't blunder that and instead we have a very solid position wesley has one of the highest accuracies also higher one one of the hardest people to beat in the world he's so solid and look at this trying to trade hikaru's pieces off and before you know it it is wesley so who has activated the pieces and is calling the shots knocking on the door of hikaru's position hikaro now scrambling wesley trades the queens pressure still being applied and wesley is just swarming i mean his knight his rook his bishop all poking at hik caro's position hikaro trying to trade some pieces off but wesley's not going anywhere wes wesley sniping with the bishop hikaro under a minute now wesley starts taking a little bit too much time he's got 40 seconds on the clock no whoa knight takes f2 a tactic has been landed on hikaru bishop takes bishop back to b6 f5 oh my goodness a pawn explosion wesley coming down that side of the board 7 seconds versus 12 all of this was a crazy scramble and it ended with something completely insane as hikaru ends up in a position it's coming don't king e4 king f3 scrambling crazy position knight f5 and wesley has to give away a rook he sacrifices his rook but he does it because he's just going to start marching his pawn and hikaru manages to scramble his way out of this situation and make a draw wesley's king gets trapped on the outskirts of the board and under the threat of mate we start shuffling and repeating moves but hikaru doesn't make a draw and instead blunders the game he blunders the game he had a draw on the board it was exactly like last year in toronto but he went for it it's hikaru's birthday actually december 9th and he he just went for it he thought he was creating a checkmate net but this move covers this but also gets the king and escape route and that's it wesley's just winning the pawn's just going to go pawn's just going to go the pawn makes it to h2 hiar just resigns he just resigns because rook h8 bishop h6 unbelievable unbelievable and and and and he goes down against wesley he lost the next game as well he it was hard i mean you got to try to win with black and i maybe he didn't lose maybe it was a draw but wesley beat caro for a second year in a row in toronto crazy stuff next one i have for you this was an unbelievable match between kowana and maxim vra this is still the first round it's an imbalanced grunfeld right we have f3 a bit of a sideline we have takes takes and we're going to get a bunch of theory here that's about to plop out on the board all of this has has been played many times before bishop to h6 takes takes knight takes d4 a pawn has been captured f4 and now knight f3 white is going on a big attack both sides are not really thinking they're just playing their moves instantly white now wins the pawn back and now we have officially the first new moment of the game' moves into it bishop d3 maybe not maybe it wasn't bishop i think it was bishop d3 because here maxim spent two minutes so they play a very edge line opposite side castling mvl makes an inaccuracy on the first move out of the opening the computer wants pawn to h4 already but i think oh my neck is so stiff but instead of h4 fabiano does this and he does that to open up his light scored bishop then we have a trade and now look at this tactical shot pawn to d6 that pawn's going to be a problem queen g7 and now it's going to be a problem because i don't even have to attack you how are you going to defend yourself against the pawn on d6 bishop d5 the computer already thinks black is a bit out of danger but it's still a very difficult position to play as a human rookie seven check mbl is defending himself along the seventh rank but i got to tell you it is not a very pleasant position takes takes bishop back to e8 rook e1 rook e6 disconnecting now maxim makes a run for it rook b6 rook e7 but now here comes the check and the pawns are falling g5 from maxim king to d2 rook d7 and it looks like fabiano is going to get it done because at the end of the day he gets the bishop back too many pawns too many pawns in the rook end game rook f2 he just needs to get a little bit of breathing room rook h6 and he's just he's just up two pawns he's just up now he's up three pawns and in this position maxim resigned maxim actually won the next game against against fabiano but then he lost the armageddon so fabi wins his first match up so does wesley so does magnus and there's one more in the first round that was nuts fua versus nck all right this one an exchange queens game of decline just like the game against magnus versus lvic but the bishop was on a different square none of that is important what's important is he plays the principled approach which is f3 against the queen's gambit declined exchange variation bishop f2 and pawn 2 e4 that's the plan that he's going to try to implement and all his pieces are coming back as ner beck is pressuring but at some point once ali razza gets rolling he is red hot he's like a locomotive h3 he going to make a couple of preparatory moves but if ali resa can successfully play e4 he's going to win the game what i mean by successfully is if he's able to implement the game plan rook c3 uhoh there it is big moment in the game everything in white's position is fully geared toward that's that move listen black's got good piece he got this he got the rook over here bang bang he's got the bishop sniper but when the board is is about to open up ali resa is arriving and he is knocking on the door of the blacks kings position no is so desperate he's trying to trade that bishop off so it doesn't participate in the attack that that was not the best move the best move was was not to allow a lot of this but but but what about what about the knight who is the knight intimidating and the knight gets attacked so it's got to move and here comes ali rza and it's just a matter of time until all these pieces start landing haymakers and you don't have to wait knight takes g7 when you're stting an attack and chest you always need to look at things only the king protects knight f5 check there goes the rook zipping in and coincidentally also blocking that diagonal and queen takes h6 is m so he's got to sack his queen and it's not good enough queen h6 is a sniper f6 would lead to queen g6 you pick this up you win in a couple of moves no back abaturov succumbs to the brilliant attacking chess of ali resa fua who came to play i said before the event in my predictions video that i did for chami ali rza is the biggest wild card you don't know which ali rza is showing up and in the first round he showed up and he showed out now my friends round two was crazy noer beck has to go from losing to ali resa fuja to now playing magnus carlson it's a round robin and the way this round robin works is the bottom two are eliminated if you finish last or seventh in the round robin you go home or stay home until your flight if you're top two you make it to the semi-finals third fourth fifth and sixth play a double round robin among themselves the survival stage to be third and fourth seed all right two to the semis two go home four compete for the last two spots so magnus carlson opens with e4 this is their armageddon game you will notice ner beck has n9 and a half minutes what does that mean it means they drew their two regular games and they went to armageddon and they bid they they they they wager a certain amount of time to play with black because remember when you play with black and armageddon a draw is a win so you get two results but less time so magnus now needs to win on demand that's not easy to do when the guy's got 10 minutes but he's got to play in a way that's going to keep pieces on the board keep things tense magnus playing a spanish d5 noer beck is trying to force something why less time not enough time to maneuver take take right look at magness no queen trade maneuvering close position we traded upon pawn that's all you're going to get i'll go back to my home square here comes my knight you can't take my queen b3 why b3 slow play ner is the one that has to think but he can't think he's got to make moves instantly bishop he is he's he's playing fast but there's magnus now m magnus asking questions now he's not up as much time as he was in the beginning of the game but do spends 30 seconds magnus takes back in two now magnus firmly plants that knight on d5 trades this knight ac activates his rook plays a4 this is the big moment in the game noj has the closest time situation he's had all game but here's magnus ready for that queen side pressure no spends one entire remaining minute on rook d8 magnus plays bishop b4 one and a half minutes spent it's now less than a two-minute advantage bishop c5 but magus still throwing things that way and n very big decision here the best move for black apparently according to the computers to take and then to take the knight allow this rook c7 cd5 survive but instead of that nock does this and he spends another minute remember no is at this point spending 20% of his remaining time on each move it's very tense it's very hard to do that and when the dust settles magnus is infiltrating on the queen side and posing massive problems queen e1 defending his pawn no has to make something happen he's only got two and a half minutes to do it two and a half minutes and no bonus time queen a7 and he's w a pawn and he's still calling the shots he's going to win that pawn too and when it's all said and done there's a beautiful tactic sacrificing the rook the idea is king of7 rook b7 check discovered attack on the queen queen a4 counter sack but now rook takes g7 rook a4 rook d1 but when it thust settles remember that las ofic end game this one's even worse in the lavic end game at least lavic had a pass a pawn no it's all on the same side takes magnus 45 moves but he gets it done two for two from magnus he won both matchups today first one nice win against lvic this one nice armageddon grind against nerc now hikaru bouncing back from the defeat to wesley so is playing maxim vra all right so we open up the game it's a chowski just like he played against wesley so where are we going to take a different turn okay knight c6 wesley put a knight on d7 if you might remember maybe you don't this game went completely off the rails this game was nuts completely off the rails so maxim is the world's best poker player because this man played the opening so fast look how fast maxim is playing the opening all of this gets blitzed out and maxim puts his king on e7 does he also have this prepared the knight goes to a6 hikaru develops doesn't trade queens maxim goes queens 5 and he cares castles and has a clearly better position apparently it's so good that despite him being down a pawn right 56 black king is so bad and white has so many light score opportunities and potential to attack on the queen side he's in good shape bishop g7 but maxine played so fast it's like okay he car plays rook b1 rook b8 now white is better and he car plays knight g3 to put the knight on f5 bishop f8 move right oh my goodness but notice he car's time advantage is gone cuz he knows he's better but he's probably calculating knight g3 right now he's maybe looking at c4 potentially to weaken the e4 square so very tough position he does put his knight on f5 and king e8 tar makes a couple of preparatory pawn moves but that cost him time apparently the advantage has already gone i mean i don't know you know we look at stockfish we go oh white is better but this game goes completely insane maxim starts taking over he's like you gave me a pawn now hikaro is down we've i've never seen hikaro open a tournament this shaky maybe a little bit of birthday jitters i don't know what it was but he's shuffling a lot maxim starts taking over max and we we get into a scramble both guys about 3 minutes on the clock maxim still up a pawn so he's playing for a win one minute on the clock now each now we go less than one minute hikaru is getting busted up queen e2 queen c4 queen he's down two pawns he could take on b5 but then he's going to lose a rook oh my goodness maxim defend in himself 20 seconds now less than 20 for for mexim queen e8 white is apparently not worse but all of a sudden we're in a queen and bishop versus queen of knight and white white is not worse white white's losing white is going to be losing this game hikaro giving checks apparently here queen g3 now is saving the day queen g3 but it's chaos less than 10 seconds queen d2 knight g7 the king is going to get run out that's it hiar is losing queen h oh my goodness centralizing everything maxim's going to push his beep on hiar is about to start the tournament with three games in a row losing oh and maxim hangs his bishop maxim hangs his bishop with a fork queen f5 check and hearo wins a pawn oh my god he's is he winning is it a draw the pawn might be too far he's got too many pawns and as fate would have it it's too many pawns there like even though karu is up a full piece black is threatening something like queen d2 for example you play h4 queen d2 is is game over for black black actually wins so the players make a draw and an insane game and a shaky start to the event for hikaro uncharacteristic crazy stuff they drew the second game and they go to the armageddon crazy story they bet the same amount of time the first time they wagered time in the armageddon they made the same same minute same second so they had to bet again and this time hikaro out bid maxine by 20 seconds 9:38 on the clock this was a double petro this is called io's variation white wins a night but black spends the entire opening striking at the center excuse me and the position is actually okay for black knight b4 very sharp line very complicated white loses the right to castle and as you can see i mean hikaru is just rattling off moves this game gets crazy hikaru ends up castling his king both guys are attacking each other i mean b4 is just lunacy insane position whes king is in the center remember hikaru is not not playing to win or i mean he can make a draw he doesn't care but he's playing to make maxim think look at queen a7 this is insane hekaru is two pawns down in the armageddon game but he's not worse he's not worse cuz there's monster counterattacking chances maxim has to go here spends two minutes loses the pawn on g2 okay rook h7 threatens mate aaro goes for a queen trade he didn't have to do he could have played rook g7 goes here we a6 and now that that that pawn's not scaring anybody that pawn that pawn's nothing king's already in the square bishop c5 but hearo down a lot on of time can he fight back you wager this much time in the armageddon because you believe that with this little time on the clock you can still outplay your opponents take take take take hikaro is going to stop the pawn maxim is now better but suddenly here comes hikaro pawn all the way down to g2 now maxim pieces have to defend against it king f4 it's going to be a draw rook e 7 hiar stabilizing king f5 five rook f7 check despite being down two pawns hikaru is not losing rook h7 maxim advances with e6 rook e8 and it's time to draw the game with rook h1 rook h1 is sealing the deal if rook h1 and let's say rook g2 you can give a check you can also play take take rook f1 you're going to win this pawn you're going to win this pawn iaru goes for a tactic but it doesn't work iaru takes on e6 and goes for this and his logic was that after king g4 rook e6 king h5 there is rook e5 and he makes a draw that was his point bishop e6 and after rook e6 rook h5 that would happen but after this there's a7 a7 and then there's knight c7 and you threaten promotion and you escape with a winning endgame iaru missed that and just straight up loses a piece he just straight up loses a piece and maxim just defends himself i don't know why maxim didn't take on g2 here i guess he thought he was just losing the pawn but this just goes on for a little bit and hikaru loses both of his matches on the first day which is crazy that is not a result i had i i thought was possible maybe against wesley but that's wild that is a wild first day maxim wins after a very tough match against fabiano and that was not the end of the story my friends we have arrived at the final matchup of the day wesley defeated dennis lvic in a second so wesley 2-0 magnus 2- 0 and here you go fabiano versus ali resa i told you from now till the end of the video you're not getting an ad i promise you i don't know if it's going to take seven minutes whatever it's going to take this was a crazy match fabiano corana started with an italian ali resa fuja normal principled brought his bishop back and then when the trade happened he went knight h5 and in symmetrical positions of castling in italians you always got to be careful cuz someone's going to kill somebody else it's like the mafia all right it's crazy times out here knight e7 knight g6 g3 was played in this position to fully lock down the f4 squ so that black cannot put a knight on f4 fabiano is doing everything in his power to prevent an attack from getting generated and that is really nice of him because in this position alira plays knight to f4 anyway and that is how you know some s h i you know what is about to go down he takes the knight this man is a psycho he calls the bluff on ali resa who promptly threatens to execute his king knight g1 this man sacrifices the rook the idea is to force the king there and now you still threaten mate but wait it's not mate but wait it is mate because of this so how do you defend yourself well obviously queen g4 that doesn't work actually if you play queen g4 i take the knight you take my queen i take and then i check you and i get out and apparently at the end of this whole sequence black is chilling because he wants so many pawns so he doesn't want him to be chilling queen h3 poy says let's just block the bishop let's just make sure the bishop doesn't get back into the game oli resa plays h5 and this man oli resa is just straight up he was down a rook for a second but it doesn't rook e6 rook g6 and the attack just plays itself with less than one minute on the clock he then proceeds to pry openen the bishop's diagonal watch this he prize open the bishop's diagonal he activates his dark square bishop that the end of the game and fabiano hangs queen between f two and the game is over game over ali resa i i am not he absolutely destroyed fabiano caruana with the black pieces destroyed destroyed that's not a disrespect to fabi ali resa fua has shown up to toronto to kick some ass okay this was nuts that is a massive loss for fabiano who now right and and since you know there's three games look i'm sorry i i there was no other way to hype up this thing we got some old indian is what this i'm not insulting anybody this is literally called like the old indian defense d6 knight f6 bishop f5 to stop e4 right so knight h4 and look at ali resa taking all the bait taking all the bait take this dominant position look at this control of the center playing so provocatively now he plays e5 the idea of e5 is simple he just wants to trade he wants to take take trade the queens he can't he can't lose g oh my god look at this fabiano's like waving him on he's like al resa come come get some knight e4 aliv resa castles but then somehow he has all this space and he's got such a great position you can't take the pawn on d4 knight f6 check wins can't take knight f6 discover attack but then in an attempt to trade a lot of pieces somehow ali resa took his eye off the ball he played a couple of moves but you know fabby stayed in the game right and aliv resa spent a lot of time he was trying he was like do i attack cuz aliv res is trying to not lose he's trying to not lose how do you play a ch game when you're trying to not lose queen e2 rook c1 rook d1 right just chill bishop f2 okay and you know then then finally al r is like i don't know what to do i mean like i i'm going to trade everything i'm going to trade everything i that's it can't lose now oh yeah you can oh yeah f4 fabiano's playing for a win queen f5 takes takes queen e5 we now have an insane end game on our hands where fuja is trying to win with 14 seconds ver three minutes queen e1 from fabiano coldblooded what attacking the rook queen e4 check ali resa takes the bait 10 seconds on the clock the pawn is up to d7 there's no way fabiano is going to win this right queen g1 that's it it's over there's no way fabby just starts throwing pieces queen e3 b4 i's playing with no rook and now he's not even up on time anymore and then all of a sudden queen e1 disconnects the white the white pieces and rook takes d7 you can't take the pawn now and all of a sudden fabiano caruana is playing for a win he plays rook c7 and when the dust settles in this long sequence of moves he checks ali reza until ala's head is spinning and then he just wins all his pawns he just goes two pawns up in an end game queen b2 he's going to take it at some point he's is's going to win the pawn and fua still can hold with that pawn but then he hangs the pawn he pushes the pawn to a5 and then he just he just hangs a fork he just hangs a fork he could have played something else he could have just apparently it's a draw here because of hangs a oh my god and he loses he goes on to lose the game by a force queen trade because take take take king h5 is a winning king and pawn end game you got to know your king and pawn end games boys and girls so we go to armageddon we go to armageddon fabi wins the bid he is 957 on the clock all right knight f3 e6 it's a london what's the best opening to play to stall and be solid is the london system the good oldfashioned london system we got a big trade bishop b5 what the rook h5 this looks like a board mistake what is ali resa doing he's going to put his king on g1 what's going on no he's going to castle the other way both guys hate hate their kings one guy's king is going on f fa one guys can't going that way rook's going the other way g6 the rook is in the center of the board a6 bishop f6 kicking out the rook he sacrifices it aliv to sacrific the rook for what reason well i i guess it's because fabiano's just pin to the back rank but he doesn't have to play like this now fabiano's consolidating but now the knight goes back to e3 and the pawn's going to fall if the pawn falls maybe g4 knight h4 knight knight knight here knight g4 knight f4 knight f5 oh my goodness this game is insane knight takes d5 apparently a bad move apparently it was better to go here first apparently if black just like doesn't do the right thing there are various i'm not saying you do this now but that is the idea like queen g4 maybe and then get a knight to f5 instead he takes and in this position fabiano carana uncorked the most nasty move of the first day of the champions chest t final he has a rook staring there wouldn't knight d3 be nice well if pawn can't take but the the rook can take unless you sacrifice the rook rook 2 e1 disconnecting the rook from the defense of the d3 square and also threatening to take and take oh my god ali resa goes queen d2 and now that's it without the firepower of more pieces fabiano it's his game to win and he does it in style in this position knight takes g6 if take knight f4 is discover check deflecting the white queen queen d5 and now a a gangster finish hanging the queen into a pin and we go to an end game and it's over rookie six just a matter of time remember fabiano doesn't even have to win he doesn't even have to win but he can obviously win but i think the players made a draw they made a draw of course it's winning but that secures it and after our first two rounds of action the first day champions chest tour final these are your standings wesley so magnus carlson fabiano caran with two match wins ali raa maxim fourth and fifth and then nock karo and dennis lazovic now that is a crazy bottom three and i think if it was the playoff time hikaro and dennis would be eliminated now there are still five more games hikaru's got a roar back cuz he hasn't even played magnus yet he hasn't even played alira yet he hasn't even played fabiano yet today hikaru played wesley and mvl he hasn't played he hasn't played a lot of the top guys so we're going to see a ferocious hikaro because he can't stay on the bottom too he's got to make it at least third to six to enter the survival stage i hope you enjoyed this recap i hope to be in toronto very very soon more information about the tournament can be found you know all all online and everything it's very fun 500 grand at stake that's all i have for you today get out of here
