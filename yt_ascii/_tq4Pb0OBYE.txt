welcome to 13 of the most painful smartphone fails ever starting off pretty bad but ending up in some absolute nightmares number 13 is the new motorola razr a phone that everyone wanted to love i give it 9 out of 10 for the idea a phone that manages to be both a throwback and a glimpse of the future at the same time it's just that it's been delivered with four out of ten execution there is an initial high when you flip open this folding screen for the first time it's beautiful it's enough to make a grown man cry but that's about where the fun ends because to achieve this almost every single feature that actually has a use is compromised the battery sucks the camera sucks and even the display has had an alarming amount of reported issues that said i don't think it's completely fair to bash new ideas just because the implementation isn't great and that's the reason the rays the reason the razor the reason the phone is not further down on the list it's the fact that it kind of succeeded in its intention of just being cool and once again people are paying attention to motorola so overall i'm only giving this eight two out of ten fail rating number 12 is on the subject of foldable phones the very first one you might have heard of a company called royale they were founded with the sole purpose of creating flexible displays it became very clear though that displays is probably what they should stick to see when they were founded in 2012 no other company was even close to building a foldable smartphone of their own so royal probably thought easy we got this if we can be the first company to build a foldable smartphone well but what i think happened is they became complacent before we knew what was happening it was 2019 and samsung was about to launch an actually good foldable phone at which point it looks like we all panicked and just released whatever their latest prototype was as the royal flexpay they knew that if they weren't first and they really didn't have anything it's a similar form factor to the huawei mate xs i took a look at a few weeks ago except it's a thickness of a book when folded up and the software is so bug-ridden it was bringing up visions of times that i thought we'd move past the flexpay was just a really bad start to foldable smartphones it was bad enough that it made people take a step back and question why on earth companies were trying to fold their phones in half in the first place so this one's getting a three out of ten failed from me also a shout out to surf shack vpn for being the sponsor of this video number 11 is airpower not a smartphone but a smartphone related bit of tech well they ended up being a bit of a no-show back in 2017 alongside the iphone 10 apple showed the world wireless charging done right a pad that you can place your device's anywhere on and they'll just start charging and this was massive because whilst apple is never really the first to enter new product categories generally when they do they tend to set a new industry standards not this time the next two years were a constant swirl of rumors and teasers air power was mentioned explicitly in ios updates as a supported feature and quite literally on the physical packaging of the second generation air ports but come 2019 apple canceled it or ip air power see with normal wireless charging the back of your phone has one coil and the charger has another coil and placing these two coils together creates an electromagnetic field that delivers power to your phone but the only way that apple's idea was possible the idea of having an entire pad that could deliver charge not just one specific spot on it that you had to align your phone up with is by packing many wireless charging coils into a tight space and in the end the company couldn't find a way of doing this without either the electromagnetic fields interfering with each other or just generating too much heat so not the kind of fail that's gonna a company like apple but at the same time it will mean that future announcements are just treated with a little bit of extra depth three out of ten for this one now in the last couple of years we've seen quite a lot of smart phone companies that we previously loved just kind of fade away disappear into almost non-existence and for each one of them there's usually been one or two mistake devices phones that have been so bad that they've kind of set them on the path to ultimately failing before example htc in 2020 is dead as a dodo they've fallen from an 11% market share in 2011 to less than 0.1% now and there are a whole number of factors but one firm that really sealed their fate was the htc u ultra see if there was a time when i was actually excited about htc phones you might remember the htc one he had a beautiful metal unibody with a gorgeous display and the company collabed with beats to make its boom sound speakers it even had a software skin that people didn't hate which was more than you could say for a lot of phones at the time this phone could have been a turning point for the company had they continued the innovation but they followed up with a couple of mediocre phones and then one just bad one and with the insane pace of the smartphone market you just can't afford to do this the big selling point of the u ultra was a secondary ticker display that nobody asked for the battery sucked and instead of building on their great beats audio technology they removed it alongside the headphone jack which at this time was still a pretty sensitive topic so considering where htc once was and where they are now you ultras getting a four out of ten fail number nine is lg and their g5 see there was a point when lg was soaring in the smartphone market their g3 was one of the first phones in the world with a quad hd display and it was a genuinely competent alternative to buying a samsung or an iphone unfortunately life's not always good the g4 that came after shipped with what could only be described as a cursed software tens of thousands of geforce would just randomly start shutting down they'd restart and i didn't get stuck in continuous boot loops people were mad at lg but thankfully the g5 was coming the company's one shot at redemption at reminding their fans why they loved lg in the first place so they announced a firm that you can stick a grip on to the lg g5 s big selling point was the fact that you can attach modules things like a camera grip that adds some extra battery but considering the lg is not exactly gonna sell tens of millions of g fives an ecosystem of modules built just for this one phone is destined to fail nobody's gonna want to make these modules because instead of just building a universal gadget that could appeal to billions of smartphone users across the world you'd be building a gadget that at its absolute maximum could appeal to let's say the three million people who actually bought a g5 specifically so just like with htc it only took a few not-so-great phones for lg to kind of lose its place in people's hearts so again the g5 gets a 4 out of 10 from me number 8 is blackberry oh gosh no blackberry of all these smart phone companies that have gone from riches to rags blackberries fall is definitely the most dramatic it's hard to believe but we're talking a company that used to have a 50% market share in the u.s. 50% and they've gone from that to a quite literal zero blackberry is gone and their z10 smartphone pretty much embodies the entire reason they failed blackberry never understood why people wanted a smart phone to be clear they were insanely successful before the smartphone era and it feels like this made them complacent when people got their first taste of ios and android and they started wanting a proper app ecosystem blackberry completely misjudged it they thought oh maybe it's touch screens that people want so they made a touch screen version of their existing phone which by the way was one of the worst smartphones in existence when this didn't work blackberry could have and probably should have just dropped everything and tried to build the best possible android phone but they missed the mark again they thought ah we know what it is what people really want is a proper smartphone operating system we'll get him this time so they built the blackberry z10 running on their new in-house blackberry 10 os and to its credit it finally felt like a smart phone but again they failed to realize the importance of apps blackberry thought though because security used to be one of their big selling points they should focus on that again which meant that they couldn't make this os as open source and as developer friendly as they need it to again a fatal mistake so to reiterate i don't think the z10 is the worst phone blackberry's ever made they've had some real shockers in their time but just like with htc and lg the bigger failings are often not the one-off mistakes you make it's quite easy to recover from a mistake the real problems come when you start heading down the entirely wrong path and the z10 was exactly that with blackberry five out of ten this was messy number seven is samsung's bixby virtual assistant it's become a bit of a joke in the tech community see the thing is for most android users who wanted a virtual assistant google assistant did pretty much everything they needed to anyway and so when samsung launched bixby because it didn't really have one killer feature that was in and he going to make people jump over on mass their only option was to force people to use it samsung's phones would start coming preloaded with bixby as their default virtual assistant and they had a dedicated button to summon it like some sort of genie that could just about tell the weather it didn't help that big sphere launch was both slower than google assistant and is struggled massively with accents it's almost a shame because bixby's gotten loads better since launch we're at a stage where there's two camps of people those that have never heard a bixby and so don't really care and those who know all about it but having seen it through its rocky start basically think it's a meme at this point knowing samsung though they won't stop pushing bixby as much as i want them to so i'm giving this one a five out of ten number six is the amazon fire phone and it was a monumental miscalculation see the way amazon's business model works is they sell ultra cheap hardware like the kindle like the echo but the reason they still make money from them is because these devices become a portal for people to then borrow other stuff from amazon for example by getting a kindle into as many people's hands as possible amazon can sell more ebooks from the amazon bookstore anyways the fire fern operated with a similar concept but it was sir matt worse for starters it was little more than a glorified portal to the amazon app store but the company also tried to push a feature called firefly which allowed you to take photos of things in the real world and oh so generously gave you a link to buy them from you guessed it amazon.com they even had the audacity to remove the google play store all but ensuring that every digital purchase made on this phone goes directly to amazon and the icing on this cake was that unlike their other hardware products which somewhat make up for this by being cheap the fire phone wasn't priced right alongside apples by phone ittan helped that the fire phones coolest trick was a set of four cameras that enabled something called dynamic perspective which was a bit pointless at the best of times and vomit-inducing at the worst so the fire phone was comically bad it was both the beginning and the end of the company's mobile efforts and amazon took a 170 million dollar l just trying to make it the only reason isn't further down the list is because amazon as a company had enough and going for them in other areas that they could just sort of pretend didn't happen still though they're quite deserving of a prestigious six out of ten fail number five is essential the company that hit the ground for flying in the smartphone market but in four short years they went from crushing it to crushing in it z essential was started by andy rubin referred to as the founder of android and he made a whole lot of claims about what essential was going to do it worked before he's making a single product essential had hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and the company was valued at over 1 billion dollars again without making a single product with that in mind then you probably saw where this was going yeah they screwed it up but not just once the first step was a smartphone and it wasn't terrible visually i'd say it was one of the most futuristic phones on the market it's just that there was a huge gap between the kinds of claims that were made and what the firm actually delivered after that didn't work out essential did a weird one they bought the company behind a dead email client there were rumors that the company was working on a i powered smartphone so they were gonna use the technology from this email client to give the phone the ability to auto reply to emails and that all adds up we just never actually saw this phone anyways at this stage andy rubin was then exposed for being involved in a scandal which i won't go into in this video but in what seemed like a bit of a last-ditch attempt to get people back on his side he released images of project jem a completely new kind of smartphone that i'll admit looks fascinating however it looked like rubens reputation was beyond repair at this point so a couple of months later essential announced they were shutting down essential essentially failed sorry have been waiting all video to say that one but yeah i'm giving this a 7 out of 10 fail now you might have seen something recently about apples slowing down older iphones this is bad but at the same time there are two sides to this coin on one hand you can see why they might have done it the amount of charge that a battery can hold it naturally falls over time so apple's reasoning was if we slow down older iphones then we can help people's battery to still last a full day on top of that some older iphones were shutting down unexpectedly because of excess strain on the batteries so throttling the performance actually fixed this issue and to be honest i believe their reasoning this is the kind of thing that apple would do this is a company that is famous for doing everything they can to make the user experience simple they're the kind of company that will take options away that will themselves decide what is best for their users as opposed to letting them decide for themselves and this is an example of that on the other hand regardless of whether the intention was innocent or not apple should have just been more open about it by hiding what they were doing it always made it seem malicious as if apple was slowing down older iphones to keep people upgrading to the latest either way it's come back to bite them apple has got to pay up to five hundred million dollars back to customers not to mention just the damage in the trust of the animal brand so 7 out of 10 again for this one okay top three and in third place is red hydrogen where do i even start well i guess first of all no disrespect to the company red they make cameras that well actually i've had pretty poor experiences with them but some people swear by them a shout out to marquez although fun fact the video him and i filmed together were shot on his red camera and we actually filmed it twice because this eighty thousand dollar machine it crashed partway through anyways i digress the point is that red makes high-end cinema great cameras so when they announce that they're making a smartphone the hype was crazy you've got the fact that this was being made by a company that really understood cameras that they promised attachable modules and that the top-end version was sixteen hundred dollars of course if the red hydrogen one was going to set a new industry standard except it sucked upon being delayed not once but twice the cameras that the phone eventually shipped with the had literally nothing in common with what bread was actually famous for making it's not just that they weren't better than the cameras on other top-end flagships is that they were actually very much worse and the modules we were promised well they just never arrived and so after failing so incredibly hard on the first red hydrogen the company decided that second time is the charm and i'll spare you the details but it wasn't a seven out of ten for the red hydrogen series of ferns or lakoff right now number two is a little bit controversial but i think it's justified google pixel for google not red not essential google and so when a company of this scale makes moves there's a bigger expectation and just more to lose if things go wrong and wrong things did go the pixel for was not just a fail it was three fails rolled into one the first of all the leaks the pixel for was leaked so dramatically so far ahead of its launch the google decided to just sort of go with it and confirm the leaks now i can see how the strategy might work revealing the way your phone looks but then telling people to wait to see what it can do and then dropping a link to a live stream happening in a couple of days time that makes sense but the way google did it they reveal the pixel for literally four months before it actually launched that's enough time that by the time people were actually holding the phone for the first time it already felt like old news and that brings us on to the second thing one of the big hype factors is that the pixel for was when google would debut their new solely radar technology and in the lead up to solely they showed us all kinds of hyper futuristic applications like your phone being able to detect minut and movements performed even from a distance but the reality was much less cool it barely extended beyond just swiping over your screen to scroll through songs the third fail was the hardware itself there were just so many unfortunate decisions made here from the phone just shipping with 64 gigs of storage to google canceling their previous scheme where pixel owners could get unlimited storage of photos and videos the fact that the battery wasn't great or the fact that they skipped the ultra wide camera in favor of the much less popular zoom camera so yeah the pixel for not a runaway success is three fairly substantial fails thrown together to make a pretty bad launch now just before number one couple of things a if you're enjoying this video a sub to the channel would be incredible and b i have actually made another video on ten more of the biggest fails so if your favorite fail isn't on here it might be on there okay number one is its bordering on comical i don't remember the last time i saw a phone that misjudged the smartphone market this badly welcome to the energizer p18 k on paper it was the dream people our phones people love big batteries so why not just fuse them together to create a small phone that can last literally 50 days on a single charge it turns out there is a there are things that have never been done before because no one's thought of the idea or because there are the very cutting edge of technology yeah well this isn't one of those cases the p'k in its pursuit to be different has really just become difficult we're talking the smartphone the ways it retimed the amount of a normal mobile one that's so thick you'll probably need to carry around a bag just to keep it with you so okay fine it's not the kind of phone i buy but it's an interesting experiment can we just leave it at that then it got worse see energizer then set up an indiegogo campaign to raise a million dollars for the mass production of the phone and just to give you some perspective on how badly this went samsung sold about 16 million galaxy s tens in their first quarter nokia sold about five million phones in the same time period and even sony sold about 900 thousand energizer sold sixteen osya i'm gonna give this one an 8 out of 10 fail rating but as something that isn't a fail is deserve shark vpn it is the truth the most affordable vpn service out there you pay one dollar ninety-nine a month and like it's you unlimited simultaneous connections you probably already know that vpns can keep your browsing secure especially on public connections and they also help you to get around internet censorship in certain regions but surf shark does a lot more plans
