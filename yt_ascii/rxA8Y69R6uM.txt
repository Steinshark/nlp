hello everyone and welcome can you drive 1000 miles in an electric car in one day so i think a lot of people their main complaint with electric cars is like hey you can't actually take it on a road trip and you know i've been on several road trips in my tesla and i honestly think it's fine on road trips but i think what people mean when they say you can't take it on road trip is that it takes significantly longer right because you have to stop and charge the car and so that means you can't travel as far in the same amount of time so i was curious you know could i actually make it a thousand miles which to me seems like a ridiculous length to drive in one day but can you make it a thousand miles in one day in an electric car because if you can well then it's probably good enough for a lot of people and i actually asked all of you guys hey what do you think you know how far are you willing to drive in a day and surprising number of you responded thank you all so much for responding 165 000 of you answered this question of mine and of that 165 000 which is a very nice amount of data thank you for the very large sample size but of that you know 90 some percent we're saying you know 91 percent were within that zero to 1 000 mile range on about 60 under 500 miles which i was a bit surprised to see because i you know if i'm driving somewhere i just kind of just drive endlessly until i get there but it looked like a large percentage of people you know don't even want to drive over 500 miles in a day now i do recognize that miles in time are not the same thing right so like one of the comments that i liked was someone said like hey you know i usually like to drive about eight hours which is about 500 miles so i'm not you know trying to deceive people by asking a distance rather than a time but a thousand miles just seems like a lot right and if you know 60 percent of people say they don't want to drive 500 more than 500 miles in a day and i can drive a thousand in an ev in a day well since that's double that that's probably good enough for that group of people right and that's just kind of what i'm trying to figure out like what percentage of people do evs make sense for i think the only big challenge really for eb's is if you don't have a place to charge at home they don't make any sense to buy aside from that i think even for these road trip scenarios they make a ton of sense and that's kind of what i sought out to prove with this so the question is could i actually make it a thousand miles in one day well unfortunately the answer is no i only made it 973 miles so yes you can travel a thousand miles in a day why did i stop at 9.73 well i got to my hotel the hotel that i was planning to get to i was driving to los angeles i was going to meet this guy named jay there in los angeles and i got to my hotel and i was like 973 good enough most channels you know most youtube channels they've probably been like yeah i gotta drive another 30 miles to actually prove a point this is in most channels so write this engineering explain where good enough is well it's good enough now i do want to say that i think regardless of whether you're driving a combustion vehicle or an electric vehicle driving a thousand miles in a day kind of sucks i mean it's not really going to be that enjoyable of a day one of the things that i kind of liked about doing it in this tesla is that it forces those stops and it forces you to get out of the car and walk around for a little bit and stretch your legs and in doing so you know i never felt like tired or uncomfortable from the trip so the thousand miles went by and it was like hey that wasn't so bad like i wasn't like in pain which is what i do when i drive my crosstrek like i don't take any time for breaks i just drive right and and so it's like all about getting there and then when i get there i'm like man that wasn't very pleasant at all because i spent all that time literally just sitting in a chair and not taking any breaks so those force breaks actually kind of help you arrive in a little bit better of a mood though of course slightly longer time to get there so how long did it take well again there were a lot of comments talking about hey you can drive about 500 miles in eight hours and that was about my pace there people are talking you know combustion cars here but that was about my pace with an electric car so total driving time was 16 and a half hours and you know drove about thousand miles and so i was driving an average of about 60 miles per hour including time spent charging so you know 60 miles an hour eight hours of driving that's 480 miles so about 500 miles in eight hours so of that 16 and a half hours of driving 14 hours and six minutes were spent actually driving and then two hours and 24 minutes were spent charging so for about every six minutes that i was driving i had to spend one minute charging in other words you drive for about two hours and then you charge for about 20-25 minutes then you drive for another two hours you charge for about 20-25 minutes and you repeat now in total i made six stops to charge and the average stop was 24 minutes in length so six total stops over those thousand miles 24 minutes each time and honestly it goes by really quick like you stop you go to the bathroom you stay well hydrated because you know you're going to stop again in two more hours you grab a snack whatever you want to do you walk around a little bit you mess around on your phone for a second and before you know it 24 minutes have gone by your car is charged and ready to go and so for me and this wasn't purely intentionally but for me what happened this trip is i basically kept the battery between 80 and 20 percent so i was using that 60 window from 20 to 80 percent for most on average that's where i was keeping the battery i'd arrive with about 20 and i'd charge up to about 80 and then i'd take off drive for another two hours and then and then repeat that process now my average driving speed i mean i was driving you know 75 80 miles an hour while on the highway my average driving speed while actually driving for those 14 hours and six minutes was about 70 miles an hour but including the charging my average speed was about 60 miles an hour so how much energy did this require well about 286 kilowatt hours in other words about four full battery packs and i was able to actually check out some 250 kilowatt chargers where it charges at a rate of like over a thousand miles per hour of range added per hour of like time spent charging you can actually look at the screen and actually watch the charging percentage go up like it's wild how fast those chargers are especially looking at the time it took my car to go from like seven percent to 67 very impressive looking at the average charge times there and overall this 286 kilowatt hours of battery charging cost me 88.72 so if you were to compare that to a gasoline car say 30 miles per gallon gas at three dollars a gallon you know that's about a hundred dollars to travel a thousand miles so very comparable to you know a decently efficient gasoline car the thing is charging on the road is more expensive than at home so at home it's about half the price so you could cut that you know cost to yourself in half if you are charging at home also i think it's a little silly to compare this to you know a reasonably efficient gasoline car from a performance standpoint like this car has 500 horsepower right so if you compare it to a 500 horsepower sport sedan that's getting 20 miles per gallon and requiring premium gas at four dollars a gallon well then in that case you know it's two hundred dollars to drive a thousand miles rather than a hundred dollars so then the tesla looks significantly more you know better from a price standpoint now my average efficiency for the trip was 293 watt hours per mile which to me seemed a little high all things considered but then looking at the epa rating that's nearly identical to the the fuel economy.gov's rating 29 kilowatt hours per 100 miles driven and i'm at you know 29.3 so almost exactly what it's highway rating is for that trip now some of the things that were kind of interesting about this road trip first of all the navigation estimation was a bit strange so almost every time i was about to stop to charge i'd be about a mile away from the supercharger and it would tell me that i had about 30 minutes left of driving in order to get to that supercharger and it did it nearly every single time and i couldn't understand why because there wasn't traffic or any weird scenario it was just like something with the software was saying hey it's going to take you 30 minutes to travel a mile and of course it only took like a minute to travel that mile and then i'd get there and be like oh you're here which was a little weird now overall the navigation when i started in the morning which i started very early i plugged in you know the final destination this hotel that i stayed at and it told me i would arrive there at 8 27 p.m and i actually arrived there at 8 35 p.m so i thought that was very impressive how close i mean it was within 10 minutes the estimate that the computer predicted so that was very good for the trip overall though for every little charging stop for some reason it would add like 20 to 30 minutes to it which didn't make any sense to me one of the things that seems like it has changed and maybe this was just because i was driving through california where there's so many more superchargers but it would have me charge up to 20 before i'd start going to the next charger and in the past it would tell me to leave when i'd get like five or ten percent to get to the next charger remaining in my battery this time it would give me a little bit more of a safety buffer so maybe tesla's changing that because more people are getting into it into tesla's and they want to make that buffer a little bit safer and less people getting stranded but i like that it gives you about a 20 buffer you know to that next charger i'm generally fairly comfortable if it says 15 or more and you're you're going to be fine and you're you'll arrive but it gives you about a 20 buffer and this time it wasn't having me charge up into the 90s i was just charging to about 80 and that was what it was actually recommending so it seems like they've started to adapt a little bit smarter of a charging strategy with the navigation system because it takes so long to charge up to 100 it makes sense to stop around 80 and then just hit the next charger now i want to talk a little bit about some of the things that i really like and some of the things that i don't like about this car because i never actually planned on keeping it this long i kind of just wanted to have a little project experiment see what it's like living with a tesla and then sell it and move on to a different electric car because i like trying out different cars out there but i really like and one of the biggest things is just tesla's charging infrastructure is just way ahead of everyone else right now and because of that it's just a very easy charging experience and it's simple to use and it just works and and that is kind of the beautiful thing and they have a lot of charging stops a lot of superchargers out there so it makes it really reasonable to travel to most locations not absolutely everywhere but most locations in the united states are pretty well covered but on top of that there's a lot of little things that they do with this car that just make me really want to keep it one of the things i really like is the security of the front trunk so you know the thing is and you've probably seen other youtubers that have had their cars you know the windows smashed in and people steal their gear and that's actually happened to me thankfully i didn't have any gear in the car but they smashed you know the windows to my crosstrek and tried to steal whatever was in it there wasn't much in it and also i don't know why you have to smash two windows to get inside of a car you only need to smash one so if you're gonna steal from people just smash one window don't smash both their windows anyways just like kind tip if you're a thief and so the thing is with the tesla the front trunk you can lock it and then if you walk away from the car and then the car locks there's actually no way to get in if the car is locked and the battery is charged that front trunk is going to remain closed so you can smash a window you can get inside here and you're not going to be able to open the front trunk there's no manual way to do it and so ultimately like if someone wants to steal from you they can do it right it's all about just making it as difficult and as tedious of a process as you can in this case there's going to be a camera recording you you'd have to like you know either you know use a crowbar and like wedge your way into the front or actually cut into it with like a grinder to steal whatever's in there and hopefully there's actually something in there you don't waste all that time being recorded but you know so from a security standpoint i really like the front trunk very secure setup on this i also really like that you have these eight cameras that with the sentry modes when your car is parked it will record you know if someone bumps into your car or something like that and you also have the dash cam that's always recording so you just hit a button on the screen and you know it records the last 10 minutes of your driving and you can save that if you get an accident or someone does something to your car whatever it may be so i really like those from a security standpoint i also just really like their navigation system i mean it's a giant screen with a big map on it it's using google maps google maps is great so really nice navigation system you don't have a lot of screen lag like i don't know why we're using ancient computers in all but a very few amount of cars out in the world modern cars you know 2021 model year and the computer used for the infotainment system is from like 1940 it's like why do we have such ancient material and such laggy screens in modern cars let's let's do away with that nonsense and so having once you get used to that and then you go try out another car you're like oh this is terrible you know and like thankfully apple carplay helps a lot where you know with modern cars you can just use your phone but it's still a bummer that in so many modern cars we have terrible infotainment systems and tesla does a good job you've got spotify you've got nice maps i don't like the update that they did where they made the display of the car way bigger it's like i don't need to see what car i'm driving i know what car i'm driving so i wish there was like a full screen map mode or something like that or you could minimize this silly animation of the car itself but overall the screen is fantastic the response is fantastic and the voice control works really well with it which doesn't seem like a lot to ask for but a lot of cars are not good at doing that so there's a good number of things that i really like about this car but don't get me wrong like it has plenty of drawbacks as well one of the things that drives me crazy are the automatic wipers first of all the automatic wipers the setting is all done through the screen right so the wiper settings all through the screen that's a bit annoying i wish there was a stock so you can do it quickly not think about it but the wiper settings are through the screen and then the automatic wipers just aren't that good they're not that great when it's light rain if it's like a nice heavy rain they generally will figure it out but if it's kind of inconsistent they struggle and also please fix this tesla if it is raining at all like even a slight little rain and you put the car in reverse the wipers just go nuts they just go nuts and you're like i'm backing up i don't even need to see that way and the wipers are going absolutely crazy it does it every single time i back into my garage when it's raining the front wipers just go insane and it's like yo chill out front wipers so the wiper the automatic wipers are a little finicky rear visibility isn't all that awesome i wish there was kind of a blind spot monitoring system that wasn't like look at this little you know animation here of the car that might be next to you or might not be next to you it'd be cool if like when you use your turn signal it could show you the camera so you could see who's beside you that would be neat if they incorporated that or some better form of a blind spot monitoring system because honestly it is a pretty big blind spot even to your right like seeing if you're merging there if it's like a low down car it's fairly hard to see another thing that's kind of annoyed me and it didn't at first but it started to more over time is just that the range doesn't match what tesla says right and like tesla said when this car came out the range is 310 and in reality it's more like 250 and if you sit there and you do the math and you take the highway mpg rating and you calculate it out it gives you a range of like 250. so the thing is it's like who cares about a city range right like driving 300 miles within a city takes like literally all day so like who cares but driving on a highway you can eat up you know 250 miles pretty quickly 300 miles pretty quickly and so that's actually important highway range is important so i wish we were more clear about highway range rather than just giving this random range that's like okay here's your combined range this is how far far you'll get per battery and it's like well not really because you're not going to use 100 of the battery and also if you're driving on the highway it's going to be less than that because you're not getting any regen or not much regen i should say so overall yes there are downsides and my carbon fiber spoiler is always coming off so i think you know eventually i'm just going to take that thing off and leave it off because it's just not meant to be but as as there are downsides to this car i think overall it's it's very impressive you know can is an electric car feasible for most people's road trip driving concerns and the fact that i by myself can drive a thousand miles in a day without you know autopilot or anything like that yes i can make it a thousand miles in a day and yes it's the entire day 16 and a half hours which only leaves you seven and a half hours to sleep but but it can be done right a thousand miles can be done in electric car in a day and i think that's pretty impressive i think considering how new electric cars are the fact that the gap to combustion engines as far as road trip performance is concerned is so small that to me is very impressive where you know we're really just getting started with electric cars so i find it very neat thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel
