what's the closest you can get within the rules and the rules are you're allowed to add numbers together you're allowed to subtract numbers you're allowed to multiply numbers and you're allowed to divide numbers you're allowed to have powers but i'm actually not using those because when you're writing a program to do it they explode you get these ridiculously big values and it's just easier to not bother but they are allowed i'm just not going to use them and you're allowed to put brackets in to choose the order so i'm going to put some brackets there to symbolize that and you're allowed to just bunch the numbers together so if you look here concatenation there you go well done there you guys think that earlier today they were you going to have a concatenation theme today in fact you could take these two videos that involved concatenation and just play them one after the other and so you didn't bat an eye when three four five six you like what hang on you didn't think well what's the mathematical operation you've done there to put them in order you're just perfectly happy that of course three four five six can be there and so concatenations a strange one there's no agreed symbol for concatenation some people use two lines some people use a plus in a circle some people use like little dashes or dots are all sorts of things i'm going to use i tend to use the two lines right in to be complete i probably should have put in this picture if we go back to the past to fix previous errors if i sing more star i would have put three concatenate for concatenate five concatenate six and down here actually done for concatenate three right you know to be more fun so that is concatenation is clearly allowed if we just for some reason we never bother spelling it up so what i'm going to do is here's my almost but not good enough attempt so gonna be a park of square this is really cool right so you start with 12 so one concatenate two to 12 then x 3 x 4 divide that by five multiply it by six multiply it by seven add on eight put that whole thing in brackets and then multiply that by nine okay so what does this equal let's check that and we're close 10 9 58 mark with exactly if it equal 10 9 58 we are on so here we go so one can catenate to that's 12 x 3 x 4 / 5 x 6 x 7 equals okay so the whole thing there plus 8 equals 1217 point 6 times 9 equals ten thousand nine hundred 58.4 that's that's not bad ten thousand nine hundred if you say classic parker square where you're in so much trouble brady laughs come on that's not bad right that's as close as i can get within the rules as initially i understood them man what we'll do you think i'm not going back a square on the screen runner okay like a hashtag thanks for the quick a day is unnecessary right okay anyway so as long as you try to sell the t-shirt again but do you know how many people shop to my shows wearing parker square t shirts unbelievable honor right anyway so what's interesting about the concatenation thing is it's never explicitly stated to be able to look at the start of the paper he talks a lot about he loves plus product potentiation two powers and brackets loves those he will concede you can add in- and division which you like the sec they're not as good as plus and multiplication or products but they're okay and they're allowed it he never explicitly says concatenation all he does is in here he goes you can add a and b multiplied a and b powers of a and b oh and of course amv forming a number so all the ones in here a lot of them do use concatenation right from the beginning it's never assumed you can't do that but it's never used as a step during the calculation it's only used in a setup of the numbers that you then apply the other operations to and i like that's a bit arbitrary it should be a fully-fledged function if you go include it you've got to include it and so i found one x two concatenated with three plus in brackets four times 5 times 6 and then that so 4 times 5 just you know we're going with this that's going to be 20 x 6 is 120 but then 120 is concatenated with seven so now you do the calculation first and then you concatenate with another digit then you add on an eight and that whole thing you multiply by nine shall we check it let's just do this simplify it to their equals k 1 x 23 that's just 23 i think we're all quite happy with that plus in brackets that's going to be 4 times 5 is 20 times 6 is 120 concatenate with seven and then we're going to add on 8 and then we're going to multiply that 59 so now we've got 23 plus 12 if i want to do this all at once actually you know i'll do that step there is a concatenation plus 8 and then that there's x 9 okay so let's let's so we checked into the calculator now that feels like it's obvious enough that we can we can drive this home 1207 plus 8 equals unsurprisingly 1215 x 9 equals that plus the 23 at the top equals ten thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight there it is so we have filled the gap because the gap was only there because people weren't taking concatenations seriously and i i've taken it seriously i filled the gap and i'm going to send it in i'm gonna i'm gonna be like i think i thought the gap it is it is now available let me give you that really that's the only reason i found this by the way is because i wasn't afraid to try something where the odds are i was going to fail miserably and i said i think that is the morale of the parker square right you give it a go even though it's probably not going to work and you embrace it you own it when it doesn't work every now and then it does work out for you times that base have we worked out the length or something well you use a log right so is log base whatever the base is of your next digit
