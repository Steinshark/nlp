i quit my job and it didn't just happen yesterday i quit it a while ago back in june actually i wasn't trying to keep this a secret from you but i something that i needed to figure out and i quit it initially without having another job lined up i'm gonna explain to you exactly my thought process what's coming up next what i've been up to and so much more i need a smoothie though i need to get coffee or some kind of fuel to do this video i feel like let's go let's go let's get into it [music] got my matcha latte okay well what's next great question thanks for asking but before we get into what is next let's talk a little bit about my career thus far and no i'm not going to get into the whole bringing you back to my childhood and where it all started but let's talk a little bit about my tech journey thus far as many of you know i started in fashion modeling and then it was in my last year of university discovered coding really fell in love with it and from there ended up going to a coding bootcamp my vision long term was always to be a software developer to grow into some kind of senior level cto and expand and of course what you think at one point in your life definitely always changes and another thing i really wanted to address is quitting a job or leaving a company without being employed and i really wanted to address this because no it wasn't just like jumping off a cliff [music] the time it just seemed like the right thing to do for so many reasons and i'm so glad i did it because it really led me to knowing exactly where i needed to go next so i went to a coding bootcamp had a great experience worked at a startup as a qa for a little bit moved into a developer role i was doing mainly back end working with node and express loved it had a great experience there it was really cool because it was a very small company too so i got to work really closely with everyone from there though it went to a larger company i'm sure many of you who follow me on linkedin know more about that as well which was a great experience i grew really quickly there i started as a software developer very quickly became a senior developer and then was helping lead a team of developers so it was a great experience to grow my career very quickly and learn from really amazing people have great mentorship great support but something was missing hello hello let's make sure it's working hello hello hello yeah and it was around this time i started seeing a lot of roles for developer advocates pop up and it's so interesting because i make videos all the time around different roles in tech different jobs and tech yet i wasn't really familiar with developer advocate roles and what they really entailed we got music so i spent some time researching i actually dm'd and reached out to some people who are developer advocates shout out to bukla she is an amazing youtuber here on youtube obviously youtuber on youtube who took time to answer all my questions as she is a developer advocate and just really get a sense as to what this role entails and it's it's kind of difficult to get a sense on what it entails because every company defines it a bit different some there is more focus on coding some there is more focus on public speaking and traveling there's a ton of different variations of this role i would say but overall the role really excited me and getting to wear multiple hats meaning getting to use my technical expertise my skills and coding my public speaking skills my community building skills just all of the aspects of it really excited me and i'm like wow this is exactly what i do with tiff and tech combined with my five years of software development experience the next thing i need to do was decide what kind of company i wanted to work for and that is something i spent a lot of time thinking about and one thing that really helped me narrow down as to what i wanted in my next company or what i wanted in my career was i wrote down my values and what i really want in a company and one of the things i really wanted in my next role was for it to be more of a product-based company so for those of you who don't know i was on the consulting side at ibm which was great it made me be able to work on a lot of different projects get comfortable with one second here sorry we had to take a pause on the video we had a bit of a crisis happen with the dogs they were like anyways it's all good now but anyways as i was saying i was on the consulting side at ibm which was great and it made me develop a lot of skills as far as being comfortable with being uncomfortable i had to adapt very quickly consulting is a very demanding industry i really enjoyed it but i really wanted to be more on a product-based company where we all had the same goals the same vision we were building something with all that in mind and you get that in consulting but maybe not to the same degree if that makes sense and that was a huge thing for me and that's something i would really suggest to you if you are looking for a new job or considering what kind of company you want to work for is to make a list of values because often what happens is when we get into the job hunting process and you start speaking to these companies you almost make exceptions for things that you wouldn't have made exceptions for initially because you're so excited that a great company is interested in you that you just kind of like turn a blind eye to things and i think it's really important to not do that especially long term in your career and i'm really excited to take you on this journey with me it's something i think is so important and that i always say to you is to continue to grow and evolve and for me it was something that i love creating content community building blogging writing public speaking all of that so much on top of coding that it just made sense for my career to go in this direction and i really see myself building a very strong career in this direction and i'm really excited to to take you along with me so if you have any questions leave down below in the comments and i'll do my best to answer them i of course will share more with you as i grow and yeah i'm going to take the next few weeks to just completely take some down time spend time with family friends the dogs of course actually where is mugs oh look he's right behind me can you see hi i'm so excited i accepted a developer advocacy role and i start in september it's at a product-based company a smaller company than when i was at and i'm just really excited that i was able to and i had the opportunity to take the summer off to really just know exactly what i wanted my next steps to be what it would look like and it really helped ensure that i wasn't just taking something to take something but taking something because i really wanted it i really believe in the company the role and really i'm excited about it and yeah anyways i will share more with you as i start but i just wanted to give you a little life update into where my journey is thus far and i think it was really important to recognize that it's a continuous we're continuing to grow it doesn't just happen it's not just a linear path and i think it's important to be open to new opportunities as they come your way and just feel them out and see what's going on and maybe i'm just rambling now but i'm really excited and yeah life update thanks for following me along and i guess some of you might be asking so what does this mean for tiff and deck and it means nothing for tiff and tech in the sense that at this point it's just like a working wheel as far as you know having people who support me on tiffin tech and help with editing and all that amazing stuff
