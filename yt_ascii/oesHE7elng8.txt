ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the candidates tournament of 2024 this is round number seven out of 14 and tomorrow is a res day we are officially at halftime by the way tomorrow i'm also putting out an interview with none other than the indian chess legend five-time world champion vishwanathan anand that will be on this channel but that's tomorrow today is round number seven of 14 and oh my god today's round was unbelievable from start to finish hikara nakamura pulled up today and detonated an absolutely explosive opening idea against yan pishi the tournament leader and at the very end of this recap is one of the most incredible victories i've seen in recent memory and everything in between some a little boring you know how it goes but most of it extremely exciting hikaro nakamura versus yanyi pishi it's halftime nepo leads the candidates with four points out of six hikaro has three hikaru shows up and plays pawn to e4 because when you play e4 against yanomi he is going to play the petro defense he is probably the world's leading expert nowadays he plays this literally all the time now the last time they played in the candidates 2022 it was takes it was d6 it was knight f3 d4 d5 and in this position yan went knight c6 picaru then castled played c4 had a pretty good advantage against jan but yan managed to escape he managed to defend pos some problems karo couldn't win that game jan went on to win that candidates this time around yan plays bishop to d6 the symmetrical developing scheme we have castles castles and a position that has arisen 5,000 times at the highest level of the game at this point the most common move for white is to play knight to c3 and the idea of knight to c3 is trying to get a trade dc bishop c4 and this position may look familiar to some of you because it literally happened a couple of rounds ago in the game between prag nanda and yan bishi with knight to h4 this literally happened but rather than going for knight c3 which yan probably checked hikaro plays rook to e1 the second most common move in the position yan pishi defends the knight with his bishop hikaro plays queen b3 queen d7 protects everything and once again this position has been reached many times before white still can play knight c3 white can play bishop b3 hikaru chooses a move that has not been played very often and that move is pawn to c5 attacking the bishop the reason it's not a very popular move is it's extremely committal and it takes the pressure off the center yan plays bishop c7 the pawn is not capturable because black has bishop takes pawn check and the queen would take the queen so that's not playable but you know what is playable in this position karo plays a move that's been played five times a pretty natural move but not the most popular here's something incredible about the move pawn to g3 it has been played about five six times all in the last few years all in high level games hikaru copied hans neeman whether he knew it or not hans neeman has played this move twice in his tournament games look at that now in this position black can play a lot of things but yan plays a5 and he spent a bit of time he spent four minutes clearly remembering his notes and he played pawn to a5 trying to get after this queen but you will notice the move g3 stopped all of this so did yan blunder the pawn on b7 no not quite hearo plays knight to d2 trying to get rid of this knight now this knight's defensive move bishop e6 you cannot take the knight because after that there will be a dis but wait a minute folks i'm very confused yanomi is just losing material here and if he plays knight to a6 defending his rook hikaru trades and is up two pawns i don't get it what am i missing nobody's missing anything because in this position yanomi sacrifices the knight knight takes f2 ravaging the king's position both guys still probably in their preparation hikaru counter sacrifices material remember you cannot take this because bishop takes g3 so karu counter sacrifices the bishop what is going on black takes on h7 and now the queen takes the rook yan gives a check on h3 hikaro brings the king up to g2 yan plays bishop g4 hikaru brings back the queen wait a minute 1 2 3 4 five 1 2 3 4 5 six and white has a rook for a bishop white's doing pretty well white's doing pretty well and jan spence 5 minutes on rook to e8 hikaru brings back the queen they trade where is where are all the black's pieces well it took yan 37 minutes to get to this position and it took hikaru zero time all the time you see on hikaru's time all the clock like the time you see on hikaro clock that was from like moving around like that was from thinking for like a 10 seconds maybe going to the bathroom and finally in this position yan needs to move the king back to g8 this is the final move of prep instead he plays bishop f5 and after queen f1 he spends another 17 minutes 17 minutes moving the knight to d7 bringing another knight to the attack hikaru emerges from the opening up 54 minutes on the clock that's nuts and now in this position what white has to do is consolidate his advantage he has to get these two pieces involved black is going to bring all these pieces and he's going to have a queen 12 points of minor pieces and maybe a pawn and maybe a couple of other pawns attacking white's king it's an extremely dangerous position but this is an absolutely perfect turnout from the opening if you are trying to beat the guy that is winning the tournament karo plays knight f3 clearly from the time spend he's out of his own preparation the engine also really likes a4 now bringing the rook and not just bringing the rook there's other concepts that don't work right now but in the future something like this and that pawn's a runaway freight train i mean good luck stopping it you're going to have to sacrifice something for it the engine still evaluates the position barely equal if black sacrifices literally all of his pieces and tries to win white's queen tries to get to white's king bishop h3 i mean it's like an insane position so karu plays knight f3 yan plays knight f6 and now karu starts getting you know rid of the knight because again if you take you get rid of a few pieces you're going to just be winning bishop h3 i'm going to come and give a check i'm going to play knight f3 setting up knight g5 as well which is why in this position yan plays king g8 jan is now down an hour an hour on the clock he plays king to g8 to s step anything on g5 to side step anything on the g5 square and now hikaro has to put this kn knight on f3 and go for a4 like if black plays something like like like bishop g4 in this position white plays a4 queen i don't know f5 rook a3 and everything is defended this was karo's moment he needed after king to g8 it's very easy to sit here and tell you he needed to play knight f3 and a4 the the the complications in this position make your head spin and hikaru spent some time and offered a queen trade but this critical move despite offering multiple night trades causes some very serious problems if karu takes on h3 and comes back black will come here if white continues to hang around black will play knight c5 and after queen e6 knight e6 the engine gives a microscopic edge to white but black's going to take that pawn he's going to get that pawn for sure but the engine actually doesn't think that white is worse in fact after a4 it still thinks white has better chances hearu saw that and instead of that plays a4 and suddenly look how much time 40 minutes hekaru spent on the move a4 and he claims he missed this bishop takes g3 the all-in effort of all of these pieces now another piece sacrifice and queen g6 and the white king must retreat and the queen is lost but by a miracle white survives because he has a bunch of pieces here comes the rook and there's i mean you can get in like to c2 but knight f3 and somehow everything is protected because white just has enough material so bishop e2 yan gets in with his queen and they have nothing better than to repeat moves the white king cannot escape checks by the way if the white king could escape checks white would be completely winning why would have three pieces and a runaway pawn so the players shuffle their pieces back and forth and ad dw agreed an hour up for hikaru a massive chance backto back candidates backto back in the pet against yan backto back yanomi with the defensive effort some of you were not watching the candidates back in 2022 i urge you to go see that game this one was unreal i mean what hikaru did an absolutely insane effort but in this position he had to to bring his knight and play for a4 and he he mistimed the a4 he played a4 a little too late and it was a beautiful defensive effort from yan and offensive effort defensive whatever you want to call it it was spectacular but hikaru missed the chance the small of a chance that he had and yan pishi maintains a first place position with four and a half points pending the gcash game which was unbelievable and i will show you that as well now one game that was also knock your socks off level of excitement leting on the women's side versus vali rameshbabu this one began with an italian then i have a couple of you know we got every round we got a couple of boring draws and then we go back to like you know explosive chess bishop c5 this is one of the most aggressive ways to play the italian bishop it's one of those that's like hey get out of the row what are you doing that's that's a new yorker or italian knight bd2 castles and we don't have to wait for excitement very long in this game as black plays knight e7 the center explodes the bishop comes back and black captures on d4 knight takes g4 knight g6 and in every single italian it's a slow positional maneuvering game until it's not and the center blew up and very quickly le got moving on the queen side with this move c4 targeting this targeting this c5 knight d6 all of these ideas now vali controls that square but it is lei who is coming in on this diagonal bishop goes back to c8 now a nice idea here from leting jet takes on d5 and a very nice tactic knight goes to b5 because black lost control of that square gets rid of the bishop to alleviate some of the pressure in the center she could have actually in this position played the absolutely filthy the absolutely disgusting queen takes d5 you are not looking at that wrong rook d5 runs into knight f6 rook e8 and i just go here and black can't move black doesn't have a queen move black doesn't have any move black can't move any piece this this if if leting j did this it would have been the game of the year instead of that she plays knight a7 cuz giving up your queen like that is a little bit brutal queen c3 the attack still goes forward and it breaks through with knight to f6 a sacrifice of a full horse i almost said a whole force bishop h6 the black position is falling apart and unfortunately leing j had a vali i should say had a bit of a slow start a bit of a decent start actually but she has lost a couple of games in leing four out of six she had a she had a rough start but she she's picked it up and listen she won the last one so she has a whole halftime to go now fabiano carana i talked about showing you some boring draws next i don't know what was going on in this game fabiano carana showed up with e4 prague and fabby have the same score prague plays french nowadays at top level if you don't play c5 or e5 you are an outcast you are a weirdo you are the person that sits in the back of the classroom and makes funny noises and distracts the smart kids the french defense in the candidates tournament is bonkers and we we've seen prague i mean prague in his game against vidit played this opening which you couldn't pay a top grandmaster money to play like if you i'll give you $20,000 play this said no no no what are you insane all right prague plays the french defense it's just it's a completely fine opening but at the candidates it's not the meta and fabby goes for an advanced french we have this we have a line of the advanced french where black is really like struggling for space as you can see and now in this position several approaches for white are possible he plays bishop to b2 and now utilizing this tactic prague is able to land the knight on a5 right because the knight can't be taken puts the knight on c4 and then he wastes a move playing this move b6 so that the knight takes the bishop and that bishop in the french is the problem bishop black no longer has a light score bishop so he's going to use this color complex to control the light squares and this knight is just a beast it is such a powerful piece that sensing the game is about to slip away not slip away but black is going to get a really comfortable position fabiano just to take take the bishop just i don't want the bishop pair take the bishop because if he hadn't and by the way the computer likes not taking it likes giving black all of this it's actually quite happy the engine to play like a4 and stuff but fab is a human and so is prague and now they just have opposite colored bishops and both sides kind of have their strength some of you might be looking at this that doesn't quite work and you talk about a boring draw i mean not much happened in this game from this point they kind of shuffled but it was kind of impossible for either side to break through prague is not going to play a move like f6 it weakens everything in fact it just loses the game so knight c6 and it was tense for a moment and there was maybe a chance even black was better but very quickly they shuffled then they traded all the pieces and rook c8 came with a draw offer and draw was agreed so i mean you talk about an effortless draw by prag danda like fabiano has got got just got nothing today i mean absolutely nothing this was a great game by prague for his tournament it's very good that you can just draw fabby like clearly his openings with black are on on the money but four out of seven for both of them at halftime yan at four and a half right and the game of gash he has four right now it's outstanding he is going to be playing against ali reza in this round now anna musuk hy conu these two are are beasts they have been at the top of women's chest for a very long time by the way this opening was seen twice in today's round this is called the coo but with the inclusion of a is just like a coo deferred this is the coo and this is like the the delayed deferred coo black just tries to defend the center in an offbeat way but this one if i just click through it i'm not going to lie to you a lot of pieces got traded very early white had a small positional advantage as you can see from the pawn structure and actually around here the computer really liked white's position and now white had to choose the right way forward unfortunately she didn't and there was a big clash in the center and that just led to a very big simplification so white still kind of has a little bit of an advantage because of the e pawn and the weakness of black's pawns but queen b3 and the players ultimately traded everything nobody's going to win this position and this one was a draw after 40 moves and one more you know game we have to include this is the this is the battle of the leaders this is gachina versus tan jongi half a point separates them they are the leaders on the women's side a6 and offbeat queens gambit declined i actually have a course on this i love the queens gambit decline here gachina plays bishop g5 which is a way to absolutely kill the game with white here you can like lose this pawn get the center give up the like but bishop g5 kills everything and that's why she spent a few minutes on it she plays in the most boring way possible you know doesn't allow her opponent to get a game at all and she does have this battle against black's hanging pawns so white does get you know a little bit of pressure a decent you know position but black is very active at this point knight e1 would have been the way for white to push for an advantage and try to beat the leader instead she went knight to g5 and very quickly just like in the other game as it happens at this level pieces get traded and when i say pieces i mean literally all of them it was tense for half for a little bit but yeah all the pieces fall off the board and we go to a rook end game and this one is a draw as well so on the women's side the only person that won is ling j now has four points tan dr still up top though with five followed by gashin with with four and a half and one more game this was lagno versus salimova and this one also by the way the same exact defense but without a6 was a slightly different type of game and this one black definitely was under pressure and it was complicated it was like rooks knight and bishop but i got to tell you for all intents and purposes black was playing catchup from most of this game if you count the pawns she is down upon she was also down upon to tangi nurul just of hates pawns she she's always down a pawn but she always has pressure and white had an advantage here potentially if she had played knight to e3 and then knight to c4 but sensing that her king was quite weak she played rook d4 instead but she allowed simply too much counterplay with rook e 2 and all the pawns started falling this is just a drawn rook end game and the players agreed to a draw however here in the in the open section with the men we have two players who are having absolute spirals of tournaments njar basv is the lowest seed he has one and a half out of six okay he has lost three games and he's made three draws and he's in the middle of a losing streak and he sits down against vided gti and he plays e4 which is already a massive shock because abasov plays d4 this entire tournament and i don't think abasov is i mean at this level you play anything his opening repertoire is not angled toward e4 already a massive surprise which is why vidid plays e5 after nearly four minutes he obviously meditated before the game but vidid played e5 like vidit showed up to this tournament with the berlin you might remember he had a game against nepo e4 e5 knight f3 knight c6 bishop b5 is vid going to play the berlin the boring dra berlin against the is that what he's going to do doesn't he want to beat abos you got to beat the guy who's in last place and the lower lowest rated there's a lot of pressure on you what are you going to do abasov by the way after vidit spent 5 minutes again a lot of hesitation in the opening declined the berlin so abasov is not interested in the endgame vidid breathes a sigh of relief bishop takes pawn takes now vid it spends another chunk of time to play knight d 7 and knight c3 in this position c3 rook e1 h3 all of these moves knight c3 is almost never played so abas have just showed up today and said i'm going to play chess i don't care about openings now vidit who was not expecting this opening at all has to remember his prep and the pressure is on him to win and if he tries to take too many risks he might lose queen e7 15 minutes he spent 15 minutes moving a queen one square queen to e7 the idea is a flexible move there's a lot of flexibility involved with this move maybe black will go this way maybe black will go this way and now abasa plays bishop e3 just offers a trade and now officially we have left alln theory we're just gone we're just white has a damaged sl slight structure but they open f file black has the splits pawns as he does in the berlin b6 from vidit a3 from abasov ready to meet black's expansion over here bishop b7 b4 okay taking a little bit of space vidit also lashes out that berlin structure is very flexible knight e2 and knight g3 he expected he would go here so he has arrived with his knights g6 from vidit disallowing knight f5 now queen d2 c5 from vidit and vided at some point is just going to have to take over this game he has a big army of pawns on dark squares he has a very nice position rook f7 and now vidit says you know what he's playing too hesitant h5 i this is where i got to go for it this is where the better player is going to take over a win here for vidit would be massive remember prague and fabbi drew they both have four nepo four and a half vidit would join right there he obviously doesn't know the result but i'm saying four points would be massive here he's going for it queen e6 very very slow methodical game king g7 but he's down 30 minutes this man is always down like 30 freaking minutes it's terrifying king h2 but abasa hasn't done anything in this game knight h4 okay that threatens knight f5 check shockingly vidit doesn't blunder the fork queen e1 back rook g7 slowly methodically vidit is is just waiting for a chance he's just waiting he's shuffling now he locks that side of the board he locks it the computer didn't like that very much and a boss of immediately punishes him and the position's getting a little spicy queen c2 okay vid's giving up that pawn knight f8 that's a free pawn by the way wait a minute no it's not rook d3 okay but what about takes and takes yeah h rook f3 i don't know if that's the right plan it might have been better to try to rotate and plop the knight on d5 vidit splitting his pawns creating weaknesses but he's playing very very deliberately very assertively there it is he catches abasov going backwards with a punch clocks him and now he's much better but he has' wait a minute he has' minutes but he has to make eight moves it's move 32 so fantastic form for vid excellent rook back pawn takes on e4 the white position is disintegrating d takes e4 best move for vidit sniping the night and now g5 like the terminator five more moves to go 16 minutes five moves it's a good amount of time considering the play is very natural aos of on the ropes aos of is on the ropes vidit another deliberate move i don't like that he spent six minutes on that move but i think he just didn't want to jump in he was a little bit worried about the knight coming back so he plays knight f6 and now a boss of backing up again where are the pieces even going he has to support his center ved is now much better if he plays queen d6 because white runs out of moves you cannot take this because queen d2 white doesn't have a move like if white plays knight b1 he just loses e4 so he could play like knight a2 and then queen d3 takes takes and the the white position falls apart i mean everything is hanging you can't take on f6 because if you take on f6 i take on d2 everything hangs vidid has to play queen d6 and find this idea of queen d3 this night moves and he doesn't he doesn't find it and now all of a sudden on the time control with three minutes to go abasov gives back the advantage abasov needed to play knight c3 knight d5 he doesn't he hesitates and does it like this and now vid plays he vidit is back to winning and he has 30 more minutes to do it pawn takes h4 and now vidit must find the move rook h7 rook h7 brings the rook to the h file black cannot go here because rook h3 is just game over you just lose everything rook to h7 is the winning idea but he plays g4 vid it needed to make sure he had to make sure the rook bulldozes the h file this is a nice idea but suddenly you're too slow if now you play rook h7 i take here you take on h4 and i'm i'm faster i'm getting to your king before you even have a chance to get to mine and all of a sudden despite not even being in that much of a time trouble anymore he plays this move too quickly he doesn't work out all the details and suddenly abasov clears the board and he's not even losing anymore absolutely shocking turn of events vid is a pawn up but not a single pawn can move none of the pawns can move abos of is threatening an infiltration of his own there are no checks and vidit is going to be really hurting this tournament because the amount of chances that are piling up the half of points that vid gave to fabby to abasov he would literally be winning the candidates he lost a couple of games fair and square but he has missed a few chances that are brutal he has been a he has played some really really really inspiring chess and he has not taken his chances you know who has taken his chances gash you know who has one and a half out of six ali resa fuja ali rza has has gone down 10 ranking spots in the world he's down to like number 16 or something i mean it is unbelievable what is happening to ali resa fuja and he shows up this game after losing yesterday and he plays a london like that is that that is where we're at we just play a london that is what we do and that's not a you know what else can you do he has to play another eight games including this one like it's it's bewildering it it it is crazy and ges just plays a very principal very you know very very normal stuff but ali resa you know the the thing is what do you do now if you're ali resa do you play for a win every game and potentially run into problems like do you just buckle down and play solidly i don't know that's not ali resa style you know how i know it's not a style cuz bro played h4 gukesh remember prague's bishop you remember the prague game the the the french bishop on d7 ges has the same bishop he's trying to get rid of it al resa plays h4 like he's still trying to play exciting and exhilarating chess night b 7 bro played rook h3 i just spat cuz this is so absurd like and on the next move he played h5 this is literally how i played chess 3 in the morning because i can't sleep maybe after a couple of beers like this is coffee house chess this is this this is this what we love about ali resa this type of chess and gkes is a very good defender very stubborn doesn't let ali resa play h six takes on f1 and just knows he knows if he waits just like in the prag game remember the prag game of course you don't in that game gukesh was up three pawns and under massive massive massive pressure down 70 minutes on the clock but he knows if he just waits if he deals with the forward momentum he's going to flip him like it's judo okay and ali reza plays knight e5 all right and ali reza is down 30 7 minutes not cuz he was out prepared cuz he's just not in the best of form he's just spending a lot of time he's that's just sort of how he's doing things now knight d7 and yes rook g3 is very scary but just king h8 ali reza has 30 minutes to make 23 moves a boss of drew if ali resa loses he's in last place after halftime that's unheard of he plays a5 lukash plays queen c7 he's just waiting for ali resa to do something bad knight f3 queen takes a5 now this move queen a5 the reason kashh spent 17 minutes is because it's an offer of a draw what am i talking about well it's a draw offer because bishop takes h6 and queen d2 and that looks like mate but black defense but then there's check can't play f5 because of aant king h8 it's a draw so gukesh takes on a5 and basically offers a draw says you know what i'm happy with a draw with black four and a half i'll be in first i don't know about neo's game or maybe i do because it's over i'll be in first al res says no what what is ali resa doing he just lost the pawn what why would he do that why would he play c4 now gas just plays rook g8 now there is no sacrifice you can't even go here anymore because if you try to go for all of this i just take on g3 you you don't have any oh my god and now immediately immediately after not going for the the draw ali resa plays rook a1 and he's losing i mean you can't script this stuff this tournament is spinning completely out of control he sacrificed the pawn he can't defend b2 he can't defend c4 now he has to play b3 he has 12 minutes for' moves how is he going to make' moves from this position if that man has a coach that that coach needs to scream at him knight c5 from gukesh he's just going to clean things up ali raza continues to fight back though it's in his blood he plays knight d oh my god he has 7 minutes for 17 moves there is no bonus time how is that even physically possible gkes puts it's the best move and gukesh is just playing a fantastic game i mean 94 it's the best move rookie 3 six minutes he spent one minute on that move it's all over gkes is about to lead the candidates at the halfway point he continues to play the best moves ali resa plays rook c1 lot of tactics here the cleanest thing that you can do is play rook g to d and he played it again i mean gkes is just unbelievable he's having an unbelievable tournament this the knight is sniping and ali reza is out of sorts he rolls the dice one last time and plays b4 four minutes 14 moves time is ticking gukesh in this position can back up but he takes two pawn advantage for gukesh ali resa play c takes d5 wait a minute wait a minute c takes d5 the knight is hanging well that's easy you just take back like this no because then rook b3 rook b7 wait a minute c takes d5 the only move in this position is the move gcash finds sacrificing the knight and after king f2 rook d5 ali resa plays rook e4 with 246 for 11 moves rook d8 black's position is dominant white can't move anything bishop c5 and ali reza finds the only move queen b3 with less than 2 minutes to play the nine remaining moves the queens get traded i'm not sure gkes can play this for a win anymore yes he has three pawns he has he has six pawns versus three three pawns up so it looks like right around here maybe black should have just gone back to b6 and done this that probably was the best way he probably should not have taken on b4 but it settles and okay i mean it's gukesh is still pushing and ali reza has two minutes but wait a minute so does gukesh ali reza goes to c7 gukesh pushes the knight but now the knight infiltrates what do you even do here rook a8 is a really smart move just getting getting rid of everything on the seventh rank to try to push knight d7 very clever kukes here panics plays king h7 oh my god he has 20 seconds for his remaining four moves the best move in this position was to just play b5 or something just just get the pawns together king h7 is a panic move because now r resa plays rook f3 who guards the pawn i got news for you probably nobody because of knight to b6 being a fork gash plays a3 is 8 seconds but rook f7 he goes here knight f8 and before he has a chance to even lose the game on time a2 knight g6 check anywhere you move the king rook g7 has made oliver zarua just beat gkes what what just happened he was down upon pawn he was down upon pa he was down 13 minutes he had 7 minutes to make 17 moves i mean you could have been looking at a career defining moment for ali resa being one and a half out of seven at the halfway point but he kept fighting he kept looking for complications he did not give up and all of a sudden he forced gukesh into scramble mode and even though black might not be losing this is such a clutch move oh my god the emotions right now are you have to feel for gukesh i mean this is a gutting def beat he would have been in first place if he won this game with five but not only did he not draw he loses and you just got to give credit to ali reza you really really do i really hope this is the start of some big results for him in this event yan pichi continues to lead the candidates he has now led the candidates for 35 straight rounds 35 rounds of candidates yan pichi has been in first kesan fabby and prague all with four iaru vidit three and a half and oh my god if ali res wins a couple more games there's seven more rounds to go rest day tomorrow i've been really really enjoying reading your comments and the hype in the com in the comments and all the views and things like that i'll see you all tomorrow get out of here
