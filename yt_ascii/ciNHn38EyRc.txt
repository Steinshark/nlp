there are big companies being hit by sql 
injections all the time still in 2016 and if you   mess it up then all your usernames and passwords 
are out there in pohnpei spin or what have you   and it's it's it's bad pr not to mention illegal 
you know data protection acts and so on and it's   yes bad news for everyone involved and inevitably 
bad news for the hacker as well who probably goes   to jail okay so i should just preface this by 
saying that you know if you do this you will go   to jail so really don't you know i'm doing it on 
my own website which is allowed because i've given   myself permission i sometimes go back and watch 
older computer file videos because you know maybe   i came to computer for a bit later because i know 
maybe i was busy doing something i don't but the   reason is so i go back and i look at these videos 
and the home scott did a reinserting video on sql   injections which is exactly right okay so i'm 
not going to remit the wheel by talking about   exactly how they work but what i thought is i 
do some and perhaps demonstrate to anyone who's   got an interest in web development just how bad 
it is if you mess this up this little potential   i can social product anyone who actually does 
web development or any kind of design will see   immediately this is this is bad okay we've got 
a lovely little blue gradient here and a just   a box okay so i can search for hammer and when 
i do that i get a couple of hammers up so i get   a claw hammer in a sledge hammer right and i can 
search for other things nails is it i don't know   a common what i'm selling in this hardware shop 
yeah okay so different kinds of nails all right   these are all the nails i know it exists right 
different different arbitrary links of nail i   assume they it's elbows anyway all right this is 
not a shot that you would actually want to put   your credit card details in this shop also apart 
from being bad as a shop is also bad as a web   program because it's php and i haven't escaped 
strings like i should have done when i type in   hammer and click submit a post request goes off 
php receives this and constructs an sql query but   says you know give me any roads that have hammer 
in and then asks the database for all those rows   and then spit some out on the screen problem 
arises is if we put in a special sql command   character in this text box then the string but 
php forms is going to be malformed in some way   it's not going to make any sense as a query any 
more or it's going to make sense as two queries or   so on and bad news for everyone involved the first 
thing we do is we work out whether this text box   is vulnerable at all okay so if you put a single 
quote in right and we press submit and it says   server error we apologize for the inconvenience 
okay what's very nice of them but this is that   bad news right we're in a proper server would 
say there is no product with name single quote   because there isn't or it will return any products 
like by o'reilly you know hammers you know that   have an actual single quoting it should have used 
that single quote as a character not as a control   structure so what can we do to attack this well 
the first thing we need to do is think a little   bit about what the query might be behind the scene 
so we can we can adjust it so i've got my my text   editor here and i'm going through i'm gonna type 
in a query so i'm thinking that the query is going   to be something on the lines of select something 
right some question mark from some table i don't   know what the name of it is it could be product 
or prod or you know ids i don't read it could be   anything from some table where some column is like 
hammer if i search for amme which is the middle   characters of hammer i also see that it finds 
the hammer which means that is putting wildcards   in either side so that's what my query is select 
something from some table where something is like   hammer i have control over this bit this hammer 
word i can't change the rest of a query because   that's back-end php code that's already been 
coded so where are you typing this now this is   just a text editor i'm just doing this so my own 
head i can visualize the query right you wouldn't   necessarily have to do this if you were super 
good at this right but it helps and also it's   obviously illustrative to people who are watching 
also this does sql markup syntax highlighting so i   can show you how the query changes as i change 
it so this is my generic query right how do i   edit it well what happens if i if i just put in 
a single quote so i'm going to copy this line if   i put in a single quote instead of hamor that's 
what happens now you can see those few percents   of different colors and the reason is because 
what's happened is this first percent is inside   a proper string and now the second percent sitting 
on its own outside of any sql string and that's   going to cause a server error so that's just that 
texture just to shown you by the color coding that   yeah this is showing me pretty much what would be 
going on in php when i type single quote into that   into that box which is that basically breaks sql 
because it sends a malformed query okay that's not   a valid query the server will respond the database 
will respondent with an error and php will say   server sorry for the inconvenience so the question 
then becomes what do i change this single quote   into to really get information out of this and 
the first thing that's important to do is find out   what database management system is running this 
on the server so imagine that sql is a language   that's shared by a bunch of different database 
management systems so sql server mysql postgres   and so on so forth they will all have very 
similar syntax slightly different but very similar   certainly select will be the same and the point 
is that if i know which one it is i can then start   targeting that one directly and for example find 
that where there lists of table names are finding   the listed table names obviously quite helpful for 
me to get rid of some of these question marks and   fill in some blanks first of all i can get rid of 
the rest of this malformed query by putting in a   end of command and the comment okay and you'll see 
in this intact if it's gone gray which tells me   but now this is the query that i'm typing in so 
if my input to this shop is single quote then a   semicolon and a comment then what should happen 
is it should change to this query here which is   select something from the table where wildcard 
which means everything so i should get all of the   products in the database which i do ok so this 
is all the product it's not very good shop the   two dozen i don't know okay no one wants these 
products north buy my things right so so that's   a start now what do we put in as well to try and 
break this so the first thing we can do is we can   put in something that will only work if mysql is 
the database management system now i could also do   an equivalent for mokpo stress or equivalent for 
sql server i happen to know secretly but this is   my sql but you could automate this pretty quickly 
so what i'm going to say is select something from   something from where something like this thing 
okay and i'm going to put in hammer because i   only want to return the two items okay well that 
would make sense in a minute we're hammer and one   equals sleep too so what i'm saying there is find 
any products that are called hammer and also where   the function sleep to sleep for two seconds wait 
for two seconds returns a one so that should still   turn to hammers but it should take four seconds to 
do so because there's two hammers alright that's   my hypothesis let's see if it works so i'm going 
to copy exactly from hammer all the way to the   end of my quote there and i'm going to paste that 
in and we're going to see and it's thinking it's   thinking and it's taken four seconds it's not 
found any products which probably means sleep   return of zero not one so there's my bad right 
it doesn't really matter the point is it weighted   exactly four seconds and then returned us either 
some products or not some products so that was   basically you just trying to command just to see 
if it did what you asked it yeah so it inside this   query i've buried the request for the server to 
sleep for two seconds there's two hammers which   basically means to every row but it finds it's 
also going to wait two seconds which is two okay   four seconds now mysql has a sleep function in it 
cattle eight asleep brackets the number of seconds   you want to sleep for its wait for delay in sql 
server so i would adjust this slightly and i try   again so if it didn't sleep i think i probably 
not sql mysql maybe i'll try the equivalent for   postgres or try be equivalent there are what we 
call blind sql injections where even if we're   not getting any output we can base it on just a 
time it takes to respond work out what's going on   you could do another thing where you said select 
from a certain table name and also sleep and if it   comes back slowly you know at the table with that 
name okay so you can even if there's no output use   this blind technique to work out what's going on 
okay it's going to take you a little while to do   right in my case i happen to get it the first time 
yay okay so good news right so now what can we do   so let's start with my hammer thing again so i'm 
going to take this i'm going to copy it okay next   up we're going to use the fact that we know it's 
mysql to try and find some more information on   what tables exists and so on this isn't a blind 
sql injection because if i search a hammer it   produces me a table so it's actually outputting 
to the screen now this is very common a shop you   search for product it's got to take that table 
information and turn it into an html format for   you to look at okay so even if it doesn't look 
like an actual table like on my bad website it   is in a sense that if taken table data have turned 
into some form so it will event also downloaded a   picture of the product you know some reviews i'll 
get rid of this bit this sleep and i say what can   i do that sticks information i'd like to extract 
from database on the end of this product so what i   really want to do is turn this table into a table 
that dumps out you know passwords or something   like that if such things exist in this database 
now in sql we use the union keyword to do this   okay so union basically takes two tables with the 
same amount of columns and sticks and one on top   of the other so if i can find a way of sticking 
some personal private database information on   the bottom of the camera list then it's going to 
output it to the screen so select something from   some table now all we know about this miss select 
is what it's selecting three columns okay because   it's three columns output at least that's what 
i'm hypothesizing so select three columns from   some table where some column name is like hammer 
okay so what i'm going to do instead is i'm going   to say like hammer union sub query select one two 
three from jewel now for those of you don't know   my spiel particularly jewel is essentially 
a placeholder table name to select from if   you don't really have a table to select for okay 
it's use for testing purposes mostly okay so i'm   literally selecting the numbers 1 2 & 3 in three 
columns from some hypothetical jewel table right   now if this works what it will do is stick one 
two three on a row or the bottom of my hammers   if it works okay so let's see so take my hammer 
i copy all the way to the end there we go and i   go into my website and i search and there's my one 
two three okay that's bad news for the event with   this website which coincidentally is me okay so 
the fact that i can output queries to the screen   is really bad it's not just bad it's catastrophic 
okay because we're only a few steps away from   full-on users and passwords so let's do it so 
yeah not to be too cavalier about the security   right so let's not select one two and free from 
jewel because maybe that's not very informative   okay let's select from mysql information schema so 
there's a table in the information schema called   funnily enough information t its key medoc tables 
and that will tell us all the table information   names of tables what columns they have and so 
on it's the table of tables takes the table   tables right let's union select table name table 
schema which is the database name and then a three   because we need to make sure the number of columns 
match up between our union table and the original   hammer table does it just put it underneath it 
literally just pay put it underneath yet if you   want to merge columns it sort of it row by row 
that's a join and if you're just sticking on   top of us that's an appending that's a union just 
just two different terms for sq up so select table   name table scheme work three from information 
schema dot tables notice it's got purple which   is a good sign because it means that this syntax 
highlighting recognizes i vouch typed in an sql   come on so let's copy this the slow way with my 
fingers there we go and paste that in there there   we go so the information schema is essentially a 
metadata table but holds information on all the   columns and tables and number of rows and things 
for all the tables you would query if you want to   know what columns exist and what tables exist i've 
got a claw hammer and i've got a sledgehammer i've   got a funny blog table called evil and a funny 
blog table called posts which we may talk about   in a different video right i haven't bothered 
to put them in different databases that's with   honet right then we have a bunch of kind of almost 
semi random tables this is mysql stuff we scroll   down and then right at the bottom we've got the 
shop tables and we've got a table called stock   and a table called users so we won't select 
anything from stock because i doesn't seems   very interesting particular as we can search 
for anyway but we use this table on your hand   might seem quite useful to us okay we don't know 
what's in there but we've got to assume some kind   of user data now if we go back to my sql query we 
know what the table is what we don't know is what   the columns are in the table and if we want to put 
some output from that users table on the bottom of   our table we're going to need to know what the 
column names are cuz otherwise we can't select   them we can't just say select everything because 
they'll probably be more than three columns and   that won't union properly so we're going to 
say select something like hammer union select   column name two three from information schema i'm 
off screen now let's keep scrolling info schema   dot-coms where table name so the information 
schema doc columns table unsurprisingly has   column information also has what table that 
column belongs to my table name equals users   okay well i thought about that there we go okay 
that looks good to me so let's copy that let's   see if it works there we go okay so what we've got 
is we've got our hammers again alright we're going   to keep seeing them and then we've got a couple of 
standard mysql things like current connections how   many people are logged in and then we've got some 
actual column names user id user login user hash   user type now anyone that knows anything about 
hashing passwords and so on nut can guess that the   id is probably just for not a number representing 
that user probably just stuck in the table by   default the login is going to be their login name 
and hash is going to be a hashed version of their   password okay now most database cracks don't get 
unencrypted passwords people are slowly at least   wiring up a little bit to hashing although they 
don't tend to hash them particularly securely so   this is this is certainly a candidate for crack 
path of cracking for example so let's get those   things out so we need three columns from the users 
table and we want all of it right so we want let's   say user login user hash and user type so let's 
get rid of this select here we go and we've owner   so we're still unioning that's i don't know if 
that's an actual verb we're still performing a   union select you name is it you name or is it you 
login you login okay so you you login you hash   you type from users and that's all three columns 
append it to the previous one any so we'll copy   that and see if it works and it does so we've 
got a bunch of users they're hashed passwords   and we also see but because of a type this guy's 
an admin okay so i would focus on his password   personally right so that's pretty scary okay it 
didn't take me very many queries to get through   this now before everyone goes off and cracks these 
passwords right what you're welcome to do if you   want but bear in mind this is a website that only 
runs on my computer and these are probably just   the word password or something like that because 
i wasn't being particularly careful when i created   this database these aren't real people whose 
password you're cracking here so don't waste   your time i advise it's scary how easy that how 
easy that was to do now tom talks a lot about how   you stop this kind of stuff from happening okay 
parameterize queries sanitizing an input so but   i can't put single quotes in without them being 
escaped okay those sort of things are important   but you have to also think about things like 
second order sql injections which is where i put   something into an sql server and then it gets used 
internally as a query so for example i make my   username a sql injection right and it gets escaped 
properly but it gets stored in the database and   then when i go to change my password the injection 
gets run okay so that's a second-order injection   so there's loads of complicated stuff you can 
do that could get around some of these things   so if you're a web developer you have to pay 
a lot of attention to this because you don't   want your users hashed passwords and email 
address combinations stuck on the net because   it's embarrassing and illegal and really bad news 
for your customers i mean case in point talk talk   got hacked a few months ago and that was hacked by 
essentially a script a python script that performs   what i just did but in bulk really really quickly 
it takes i've run it it takes about on my website   free commands to obtain what i just obtained and 
dump them to a file which is pretty terrifying   you know so i would suggest people start 
scientists analyzing their inputs pretty quick is that if i obtain a cookie of you 
which is supposed to be secure then   i can send that to let's say amazon or 
to a shop and say i'm sean please you   know what's in the shopping basket what's 
his address what's his credit card details
