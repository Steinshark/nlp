there was something in reagan that was unknowable i come to find out and even those that were close to him would say that that i don't don't even know if reagan was aware of it but there was something the great communicator there was a very private place in there that you could not breach i'm sure that nancy knew what that was but he was a very very private person underneath at all yeah well i wonder you know be because of the remarkable role he played there's something singular about that right that that what would you say integrity and vision that enabled him to see the true nature of the communist threat early to fight that locally and to learn how to do it and then to take that battle onto the international stage right to make that the the focal point of his presidency yeah even when it was really not the issue right even most people were over here about that he was and that's what makes a great president is when they can they can point out because they have all the info and they could say it's here that we need to go yeah yeah and convince convince people that you know of what it is to go in the right direction remind them of the principles and not just the the the issue of the day right that's something to get to get folks right exactly well that's something like a prophetic spirit right that ability to see the current situation clearly and to see into the future and to put your finger exactly in the right spot and it is it isn't the case generally speaking that american presidencies are founded on say a foreign policy vision right that's foreign policy is important obviously but it's usually not central and it's much easier for a president to default to some fast payoff local issue and to do that continually rather than to fight the battle he fought which he really fought for decades right literally for decades it a life say no to the soviets but his take was so brilliant and it was disguised and because his idea and it wasn't originally his idea it was you know it was from a lot of reading research and just time spent he thought the answer was to bankrupt the soviets right their economy is minuscule even today through to what ours is they had done so much military spending and they were really you know things were so bad over there for the for the soviet people you lines just get food and this and that at that came he comes up with star wars which didn't really exist he got the idea from the movie you know about lasers you know that are going to shoot down missiles in space you know it didn't exist and russians knew it didn't exist at least 90% they knew it didn't exist but it was that 10% that reagan made him think about it he didn't he didn't back off of it at all yeah and so but it that and that's what that's a weird blend of f yeah that really tore them up you know and so they were on this military spending and and finally they just you know it just toppled that's really what brought the soviet union down yeah well that's that's a remarkable climax to a life spent that you know that originated in local fighting with the communists in unions in hollywood yeah yeah so how did you prepare to like how much work did you do biographical work and so forth i don't know exactly how you would prepare for well a lot of it i i yeah a lot of it i' live through i' live through the times that had a lot to do and i i was a history buff to begin with so like you know i i remember the stuff but i i watched youtube was really great because you have all of those you have everything uhuh you can go back and and and see and you know what do you get to i work outside in a lot so i work on the physical how how's a person walk talk and and then from that it goes inside and i realize why that is for instance like reagan had like a crooked smile yeah right it's like yeah oh yeah kind of h like that and there was and after do you do that a while you realize well why is that and it's because that's why you look like him in the movie because so co there's got to be there's some muscles that are deadened in his face yeah from what i don't know but that's you know that leads you to the the inside of of of a person of where they kind problem and the way he walked the way he uh the way a person grooms himself the way they you know the the image they put out and then there's the but really when you get down to that's the outside and you have all the news stories and stuff but i talked to a lot of people who knew him personally yeah and yeah and i think that's really where it formed i didn't want to do an impersonation that's the thing that scared me anything of you know doing an impersonation what's the difference because the the it's the fir that impersonation is an act you know it's like something you'd see on saturday night live the getting down to who the person is the real person is quite another thing a a personal side it really humanizes them yeah makes them singular and i i like to want to get a part of a real person of which i play many i'd like to tell tell it their story from their point of view yeah yeah you know not well not from the outside about what we thought of them and not for me to really i try not to comment too much i try to tell it from their point of view what is it like the question is what if i me were this person yeah in this situation right well and that's also what you're transmitting to the audience right that opportunity so what part of the reason that we go to see movies is because by watching the people on screen and by noting their characterization we can adopt their aim and as soon as we adopt like our emotions orient themselves around aim and so if you can embody a character yeah exactly if you can or if you can characterize a person's aims then you can invite the audience to adopt their perspective right and that means they can live being reagan for example in the course of the movie why we go to the movies absolutely and so way of okay so h so how long did you play reagan and what was the effect of that on you like i'm i'm curious when you embodi these characters so deeply it has to it because you're really occupying a different perspective it has to change you i would presume you know i find myself like never really asking that question i it's something to me it's about learning about it's about learning about myself yeah i don't know how exactly how to sometimes articulate that but and i leave i leave i have learned to just leave the character at the end of the day at the end of the take in fact just like go do something else right because i've already it's kind of like osmosis have already done all all the work and now just let the let the subconscious work right right so you can leave it see that's one of the things that you learn as a therapist is to because you're listening to people and you're trying to adopt their perspective but if you take that home with you then you you can't man it over time they have happened to me you know i learned that when i played jerry lee lo cuz oh yeah well to tell me about that because i i didn't believe that yeah at the s to tell you the truth and that was great balls of fire yeah that was great balls of fire and so you know i wound at at the end about six months after it came out or maybe a year yeah i was in rehab [music]
