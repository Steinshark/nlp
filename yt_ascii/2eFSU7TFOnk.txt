- we are going to spend 24 hours on top of one of the tallest
mountains in america. we will be over 6,000 feet in the air. but before the 24-hour
challenge can begin, we must first climb the mountain. and it gets pretty scary at some parts. buddy, are you afraid of heights? - yes. actually, i am. - are you afraid of heights?
- nope. - but you're afraid of pickles? - yeah.
- all right, let's begin. - we're on the grandfather trail, which is the blue diamond. - that is what we're climbing. - we gotta walk up the rocks? - yeah.
- jeez. - you know they built these
with their bare hands. - the pioneers used to ride
these babies for miles. - i don't think this is the right way. - oh, wow.
- that's pretty deep. all right, let's turn back around. - it's far down. - it's far? - i did it.
- i have a bad equilibrium, so climbing things is hard for me. - i'm just bad at everything,
so climbing's hard for me. - hey, buddy. how you doin'? - we've been walking for three hours. i can't feel my legs. - it's been an hour, you baby. stop throwing your gum at people! go pick it up.
- it's a defense mechanism. - chandler's like a fruit lizard, but instead of shooting
acid, he just shoots gum. we've been climbing for a while, and i didn't know mountains
had these many rocks. - i'm a mountain man, i'm enjoying myself. we're gonna make it through the top. we're really out here doing it? - oh, no!
- are we out here doing this? - yeah! i'm a packed mule.
- is that how you use a stick? - hi. - hey. - ow! - almost there, lads. - are we?
- no. i just wanted to make you feel better. - how you doing there, jim? - great, never felt better. - that's what you get for lying? - i got attacked! - we gotta do it like "the last of us". one person climbs and then help him up. - yeah, that's what i was referring to. - whoa! i'mma slip. - sunshine. - okay, no hands. what is this? - hell. this is hell. - how you doing back there? we're almost at the top. - i hope that i have
good liability insurance 'cause i'm gonna fall. - timber.
- oh, i don't think that's the right way. i don't wanna die, no.
- no. okay. are you scared?
- yes, i'm terrified. stop. - look behind you. - no! move out the way.
- yeah, they're good. - i've got so much money
to give away before i die. please let me live. - the video hasn't even started. we haven't even started the
camping part, this is scary. i wanna go home. - oh, my gosh. jake,
you can see everything. the higher we get, the better it looks. and that probably sounded obvious. all right. it's been a long day. - what happened? i heard two ladders. this is the eighth ladder. - yeah, i'm done with ladders. - i'm done with ladders where
if you fall off, you die. i'm okay with this one. - imagine the guy building
it, he was probably like, "should we make this a little safer?" and the other guy was like, "nah." - does this trail ever stop? - no, it just keeps going,
and then we get to space. - oh, where's chandler?
- chandler! - chandler left to pee, and i completely forgot
about him, no joke. chandler! hurry up!
- scream twice if you're okay. uh-oh. what is this? what am i supposed to do? - rock climb. - whose idea was this?
- yours. - that mountain right there
is what we're gonna be camping on 'cause we want that steep slope. we literally have to descend this mountain and go up that mountain. this literally is like a four-hour hike. - shopmrbeast.com! okay! that was magical. here, chandler. - you got it, you got it, you got it. jimmy, i know this
isn't a challenge video, but this is a challenge video. - it's a challenge video for my life. the oxygen is incredibly thin and we've been walking
for over three hours. i think we're gonna a set up camp here. we're literally on the
peak of the mountain. what? is that what you're carrying? - yeah. - i carry 30 pounds and
you carry cheez doodles. - i don't care, i'm starving. - chandler, what survival
skills do you bring to the table?
- food to the table, obviously.
- how about you, chris? i mean, we all know you're a boy scout. - you best believe. - what about you, jimmy?
- i'm good at... - so yeah, that's jimmy. - i'm hungry. someone order a pizza. - i'm already calling.
- perfect, all right. top of the mountain.
- domino's? yeah, can we get some pizza? large cheese?
- yeah. - you sure, cheese?
- yeah. - cheese. yeah, okay. - pizza delivery blog. delivery 942, got an
urgent call in for a pizza. - chandler, you wanna just share a tent? let's cuddle for the fan fiction. let's set up a tent and
let's sleep together. - i don't know how to set up a tent. - are you rejecting me? - yeah.
- i don't know what to do! - there's a rock there.
- all right, cut. - mike here, i think i'm halfway up or so. no sign of my delivery.
there's angry people up above. - can you guys wait on the pizza? we haven't given up on it, have we? jimmy, you look like
you've given up on pizza. - i've given up on everything. - do i see some snuggles? - hey, i wanna cuddle. does this satisfy your guys' fan fictions? - i got a beautiful shot of jimmy's face - told you, told you.
- and chandler's butt very close together. - chandler, you literally
emptied a water bottle. - on the way up here.
- did you waste an entire bottle of water? - we're gonna die of dehydration. - that sounds about right. - i could try and find
some water we could bull. - we're on the top of the mountain. - i mean, puddles. - we're a mile above sea level. - we don't need to sea. - that's where the
water comes from, chris. i thought you were a boy scout. - so we made a little bit of an oopsie. we drank a lot of water on the way up, and now we're kind of short on it. - oopsie doopsie. - there's a spring one mile that way. so we're gonna send a special
ops team, aka these guys, to go get some water. - while they're doing that, me, chandler, and a few other people are just
gonna focus on being idiots and getting content. - idiots on three.
- one, two, three. - idiots! [music] climb that mountain to deliver
a pizza for minimum wage [music] - mm! who does this? who orders pizza on a camping trip? they have smores. haven't you had smores? you don't need pizza on a camping trip. you sing campfire songs. i'm gonna do this the rest of my life? i wanna make ice sculptures in vienna, not fight off raccoons for
a pizza with no toppings. - so we're looking for water
'cause we gotta boil it so we have fresh water. water always goes down the
mountain, so we'll go down. hey, dead animal. good sign, that means
there's water nearby. - oh, okay.
- they're going to get water. so we have to set up for
them when they get back. we have to set up the grill. so when we have water,
we can grill things. there it is. what do we do? chandler, we don't need
chris for everything. we can do this. where do we put the grill on? chris! - all right, well, i'm gonna start off by putting this down
- m'kay. - so we don't burn the grass.
- m'kay, you put cardboard down to put fire on top of it. got it. - i think if chris was here,
he would say that's not smart. - okay, okay, got a
solution. so we got this. so we put the grill on that.
- chandler, chandler. - yeah? huh?
- no, no, no. - all right, chandler, grab these little propel things. - propel?
- chandler, to the rock! the grill is on the rock. what do we do next? there's a grill. - i brought the propel. - okay, what do we do with the propel? how do we turn on the
grill? hold my stick. what did you do? - what do you do? chris! chris! - i will find water and
support my baby nuggets, jimmy and chandler, if
it's the last thing i do. we found it!
- is it drinkable? - there's only one way to find out. we deserve a little break, don't we? - how was it, chris? - i don't wanna get dysentery,
but tastes pretty clean. - tastes clean?
- tastes like a drinking fountain, actually. - are we all gonna poop
our brains out tonight? - probably.
- so let's drink a bunch, fill some stuff up, and head back to camp. we found water. editors, add
some confetti or something. i wish it wasn't this anti-climatic. just a black pipe hanging out of the rock. this is not man-made. this
is a rare black forest pipe. well guys, we're the survival experts. i bet they're back there doing dumb stuff and we're saving their butts. - so we set up the grill.
now what would chris do? - complain about how
no one's helping them. - why me?! stop it!
- why is no one helping me?! why do i have to do it? no, i'm not making eggs for you, chandler. i built the tent, i set up
the grill, i did everything. - it's been four hours,
no sign of my delivery, but the view's great. you know, domino's, we make sure every
customer gets their pizza in 30 minutes or less. this isn't 30 minutes, but
i think they'll understand. i don't know who ordered this pizza, but i do know that i'm gonna find them and i'm gonna give 'em this pizza, if it's the last thing i ever do. - literally, just in case
you didn't believe me, we're 6,000 feet in the air. there's literally clouds on our campsite, we're that high up,
like the air's so thin, sometimes you have to take
an extremely deep breath or you'll just feel lightheaded. all right, do it. - the match went out. - gotta be quicker than that. - chandler, you're doing a great job! - ah! not even trying, i'm
actually trying to do this. - there you go, yay! - see? we don't need chris. - so the content has
become get back to camp before it gets dark 'cause
we have no flashlights on a mountain.
- this is how we die. all right, so they're going really slow. we don't have much time
before it gets dark. i don't wanna fall off a mountain. i think we might need to decide
if we wanna just book it, except for garrett has the water backpack. - so we kill garrett and go on. - so what do we do now
that we have a fire? what would chris do with the fire? - cook food. - how do we do that? - get food. - okay. - cook it. - just gonna get some food. - all right, so how does
chris get food normally? - you find his backpack. - we go ransack chris' backpack? - yes.
- okay, to his backpack! what? whoa, are you good? wait, did you find food?
- i got food. - wait, spaghettios?
- yeah. dude, i had a wrestle a bear for that. - okay, chandler goes, "i am not starving to death
tonight," and just ran in there. and then 30 minutes later,
he just runs out with, i don't know, where did you get this? - i just said i wrestled a bear for it. - all right, now we have spaghettios. so light the fire again. all right, so now that we have a fire, we put the spaghettios right here.
- wait, we gotta open it. hold up.
- oh, we have to open it? - yeah, i gotcha.
- okay. - dude, it has an openable lid. you just, we don't need chris. - when did they make things? - i don't know. we don't need chris. - facts. - this wasn't in orientation at all. this was supposed to be a
respectable nine-to-five job. what does this turn into? a quest 'cause somebody needs their pizza and i'm gonna give it to 'em. - all right, so it looks pretty warm. use the sock to take it off. - why don't you do something? - what do you mean?
- i cooked the food, i found the food.
- i put the grill there. - i set the grill up. - oh dude, you're turning into chris. you're turning into me. ha, i have the safety rail on. safety strap. - what did you say, chris? - fine, fine. i'm just
gonna eat all the food. - no, stop! - stop eating the food. - don't kill me! where's jimmy? - oh, i took care of him.
- what does that mean? - means i got the food back. all right, you guys ready to eat? - yeah.
- all right. jimmy doesn't wanna do
anything, i've done everything. why doesn't he do anything? - i don't wanna do anything
because i'm kind of, put your tomahawk away. - six hours now. i think
the sun's starting to set. climbing up, pizza's in great shape. pizza's never been better. oh, oh. it's all good, don't worry.
it's okay, it's a good pizza. do this delivery, and then
i'm done, i'm done with this. i'm never doing a delivery ever again. - hey, did you guys get
water? are we dying? we made food.
- we might die. it's a long hike back.
- okay, but we made food. - it's getting dark, we might die.
- me and chandler did something! - i'm proud of you, but-
- jimmy, we're proud of you. - that's what i wanted to hear! - all right, he said he
is proud. that's all. - fog's rolling in. that
is the fog of death. - we gotta get back. - don't do that. what
are you doing, oh my god! all right, if you can survive that, then we're living through this. - we have a flaming hot
can and a sock on my hand. dr. seuss said, "what could go wrong?" who wants a serving?
chandler, your serving. - throw some balls in there. - there you go.
- those are good balls. - my serving.
- m'kay. - oh, there we go.
- wait! i cooked it. - okay, chris. thanks. - just chilling 6,000 feet
in the air on a mountain, eating our spaghettios,
it's actually really good. we don't need you, chris! - okay, it's getting dark. we've made it over the ominous rock, which is what we were all worried about. we hear them talking very
faintly in the background. we're getting close, and it's
literally about to get dark. so we couldn't have timed that better. - wait, what was that? - does anybody want a pizza out here? - wait, what?
- is that the pizza we ordered?
- wait, what? - got a domino's pizza.
- wait, really? are you kidding me?
- yeah. nope. been here all day, man.
- yeah? how long was your hike? - like six hours.
- really? - yeah.
- jesus. - pizza's good, dude.
- is it? - did you eat a few slices?
- i mean, it's a long hike. - whatever. thank you, man, appreciate it. - yeah.
- all right, have a good one. - did you pay him? he just didn't care. - he doesn't, he just wants to go home. - all right, me and chandler were too lazy to make individual
tents, so we're sharing. - hey.
- it could get as low as 45 degrees outside, which is freezing. the air is thin, we're really high up, and a bear could attack. sounds like the perfect environment for a good night's sleep. - i'm gonna go to bed after
that long hike, getting water. i'm tired. hopefully, no bears eat me. good morning, boys and girls. let's go see what jimmy wants to do today. - morning, guys. get up. the ? we're under attack by ducks. it is cold. thank goodness i have my
pewdiepie hoodie, shopmrbeast.com. - plug our merch, not pewdiepie, dang it. - chris, what's for breakfast? - we have no food.
- we literally ate it all and we have a four-hour hike. - we have a couple of granola bars, a little bit of beef
jerky, and a snickers bar. - all right, we survived the night. no bears.
- no bears. - we're gonna just descend this mountain because we have very limited water, we're all out of food, and i'm hungry. - i quit! i quit, i quit, i quit. - to be honest, guys,
hiking was a ton of fun. and if this video
encouraged you to go hiking, i just wanna let you know that
you should stay on trails, follow regulations, never
damage or deface vegetation, rocks, or any natural resources. and i also encourage you to stay clear of all wildlife and never feed them as it affects the
animals' natural actions. if you go hiking, everything you do will
have an impact on the land. and i encourage you to make
sure those impacts are positive rather than negative. it's a lot of fun and i
encourage you to go try it. [music] mrbeast, oh [music] [music] mrbeast, oh [music]
