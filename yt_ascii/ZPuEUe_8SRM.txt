- we hit 10 million subscribers and to celebrate, i brought down my third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and 10th million subscriber and had them compete against
each other for $100,000 and 10 million underscore,
underscore, underscore. filling in for my 10th
million subscriber is chris. i thought it would make more sense to let chris compete in this tournament because he's been here since day one. so chris is our technical
10th million subscriber. the rules are simple, 10 games. you get points placed on how you rank. - yes.
- come in first, you get 30 grand, last place gets nine. you already know the rules. you gonna win? - i'm probably gonna be last place. - at least you're realistic. - yeah. - are you gonna win?
- yeah. - are you gonna come in first? - i'm absolutely coming in first place. - are you gonna come in first? - of course. - you gonna win? - yeah, oh yeah. - that's what the other
three guys said, so. the first of the 10 games they
competed in was "skribbl". it was a little hectic and hard to follow, but roger won was seven points. chris got second and got
six points, et cetera. and remember, the person
with the most points after all 10 games gets $30,000 and 10 million underscore,
underscore, underscore. roger. - yeah.
- got that dough, man. - let's go, yep. - dude, you're on track today. - i had to, you know, i had to. - the second game they played was "gmod". - no! - no!
- no! - big shouts!
- are you kidding? - the full game was extremely long, so i'm not gonna show it all, but it came down to a tie
between chris and tyler. so the only logical thing
to do was to have them duke it out in "rock paper scissors" to see who would get the most points. - boom! first place! - and tyler got second. so chris, tyler, roger. - all right.
- top three. the third game was the
"chicken capture" game, and it was pretty boring. here's who won? great job, everyone, great job! you're currently in the lead. 3 of the 10 games are down. - hey. - do not win. they're gonna think this is rigged. - i was the first subscriber. i earned my rank here. i'm going to try my utmost hardest. - this is true, you did earn your rank. now, here's where the real fun begins. the fourth game they
competed in was "brawlhalla". - all right, let's do this, boys. - three, two, one, brawl! - son of a . - sick, are you? - chink me, you piece of . - all right. - this is the key right now. - that's funny. - dude. - all that fighting and there you are. - yeah, god, i expect one. let's go back into it. - who is this other guy? - leave me alone, leave me alone! - okay, cheap shit. - yeah!
- someone please. - you got a kill. you got a kill, man, let's go. - wow, that hurts, what the hell!

that's actually ridiculous. - oh no, no! - oh no. - oh, why he keeps coming back over here? - no! - oh no. - you still in? - yeah, absolutely, i'm
taking this other guy. - you're not taking , bradheat. - that's him? - one of them. - what was that? - all right, all right, all right, let's see what we can do. oh, we're done. - yeah! - dang it, how did he have full health? - am i or am i just smart rat? what was that? - you just get the dough. - oh, oh. - what was that? - no! - get out of here. - dang it. - gg, man. - i did not mean to do that, but i didn't mean to take the
dough from bradheat over here. get wrecked! - next is everyone's
favorite game, "minecraft". rules are simple, last man standing wins. five, four.
- are we playing now? - three.
- okay, this is it. this is it right here.
- two. one, go. - am i beating him with my meat or not? what is this? - whoever's sitting in this corner. - you're going down. no!
- no. - i mean it, no! - i can't, i couldn't leave. - oh, you. dang it! - let's go! - who won? nice. - get outta here. - did you win? - yeah.

- oh. - no! - what are these targets? what? - yo, chris just hit
this target and bounced. are you kidding me? - boom, baby. - no. - all right, watch it, roger. oh, roger's gonna get through, oh. - oh!
- you're blowing it, roger. blowing it! - dude, i've been blowing this so hard. oh, oh, okay. oh, what? how is he already there? - i'm screwed, there's
no way i'm getting this. - i just threw, i just threw it, no! - game number seven is literally the best game ever created, "magequit". - what the ! they're going after me. - oh, oh god, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't touch me, don't
touch me, don't touch me. oh god, why me? - dude, there's so much going on. - oh, you guys suck. why is everyone going? no, are you kidding me? everyone, oh my god. god, i can't. i wasn't even in view. - no!
- boom. - get chris. - god, i can hit him.
- what? - oh, oh.
- got me, it's chris. - chris, oh you beat. - it's all good, okay.
- no! - what, what?
- oh, you walked into a trap. - what, what? oh, wait. that's a win, right? i mean, i survived the longest there. - what the . how do i, what? how do i get up? - oh no, no, no, no! - let's come down here and just chill. - chris. - no, no, no, no, no. that's not what i wanted to do. - no, oh my god. why is everybody targeting me?
- what? - let's go. i'm setting down the log. you can't get through the log. spells of weirdness.

won't hear much from me. - i just need to stay outta chris's way. ah, god, was that chris? oh, he's everywhere! - i've already conceded to the fact that i'm not gonna get first in this game. it's basically just like a countdown until chris gets 30 kills. - ah, my game's hanging. - all right, i'm gonna stay
away from that and that. that's for sure. oh my god, that is definitely chris. oh god, how does he find me every time? - yo, i cannot get this accuracy, dude. how do you people play on xbox? - i mean, now just hold on a second. - oh, i get, oh my god, dude. of course! oh my god, come on! - like the accuracy is so . god, who plays on xbox? - all right, we're not
