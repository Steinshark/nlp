ladies and gentlemen it's currently june 28 2023 and the world champion of chess is named dingley wren the number one ranked player in the world continues to be magnus carlson he's the best player and over the last nearly 15 years or so and in particular one of the best assets of his game is his end game technique and in today's video i will be showing you a game that he played today in the global chess league which is a team format event being held currently in dubai and it was a game against vishwanathan anand the best chess player in the world residing in india this was a ridiculous game of chess now if you're new to this channel this is not my usual setup this is very embarrassing if you're a returning viewer you know that this is my fabled wall here in the mountains of europe and lucy will be joining me for some content very very soon we're going to be reviving an old series but for today i have this come completely just stupid game by magnus and by stupid i'm not saying it's stupid like of a poor quality like what you would play i mean like this man should be banned for getting away with things like this because it's it's honestly just ridiculous what he does to people like yeah it's not fair so magnus opens the game excuse me magnus is playing with the black pieces vichy opens the game with e4 and magnus plays the french defense with the intention of going d5 he's been doing this recently because he's bored so he's playing a lot of openings that traditionally are not very decent and give pretty good chances to the opponent the french is actually one of these openings it's extremely provocative it's not a bad opening but at the top level it's just not something you see very often and vishyanand plays the most critical response knight to c3 vishu may not be playing as much top level competitive chess but this man knows more about chess than all of you watching combined if y'all live like three extra lifetimes and still combine that knowledge like vichy has forgotten that much about chess i mean you don't become a 50 plus year old chess legend of the game still competing at the highest level five-time world champion and as he's known in india giga chad that's not actually his nickname his nickname is tiger of madras but he knows a lot so he plays the critical line which is knight c3 and actually magnus responds with the winower which is the other critical line normally black plays knight of six here puts pressure on this and and that's called the classical but magnus plays bishop to b4 and actually magnus plays a variation which which i have played which that's not usually a good thing e5 here is the critical move locking the center and white is going to play queen to g4 and by the way if you see light flickering at any point throughout this video i mean it really makes a good scene like i'm in a prison somewhere and somebody is you know forcing me to record videos but no it's just you know you go to a remote location for vacation and the electricity is not great it's a miracle i can upload these videos the wi-fi is not bad c5 is the critical move now a3 tries to target the bishop white is like if you're gonna put the bishop there you got to take my knight black could go back but he does take and then he develops knight c6 now knight c6 is actually kind of an inaccuracy according to top level theory magnus knows that he's not playing things that are bad by accident the critical lines here by black goat queen c797 and then the queen tries to pressure on the c file this move does not pressure on the c file that is definitely not the right move and now queen to g4 has played it is completely fine according to the computer i have played this myself in a tournament and i got obliterated so so now could now g6 white plays queen g4 to induce a weakness in the in the camp over here either black is going going to have to play king to f8 or black is gonna have to play g6 he plays g6 that's called a hook a hook is a pawn near an enemy king that you could target with a pawn storm very useful because now you can play h4 h5 actually black is very close to already being completely lost like something just relatively trivial like this as you can see from the eval already beginning in white's favor and if black is careless white is going to play bishop g5 bishop f6 rook h7 and it's going to be game over h6 he plays h6 because against h5 he wants to play g5 but that's exactly what vishu wants visually plays h5 so he targets the pawn now we have g5 and the position looks absolutely horrible looks like it's barely hanging on by you know a thread f4 just trying to blow it open in fact it is hanging on by a thread for example if black takes on f4 white doesn't take white doesn't take white actually just plays queen g7 and black resigns because black cannot defend the rook in your case you definitely shouldn't resign i feel like 40 of you would still win this position with black so black needs to strike right now because if black doesn't strike right now white is going to go here and then here and then here or here and here like it's very very bad and you can't take and i have an overwhelming attack on this so the only weakness in white's position is the pawn on c3 which was weakened by this entire opening is in that incredible how openings all tied together and have game plans based on previous moves that's the way top level just is supposed to work don't just make one move threats don't play chess like that so queen a5 and now white has to respond he plays bishop to d2 white could have also played rook h3 and he could have played knight e2 but this pawn is actually pinned to the king so that would have lost the defender that is why this move was played and now magnus plays f5 because sometimes the only way to fight fire is with fire i don't actually know if that's like accurate that's a saying i don't maybe we have firefighters watching listen this channel has a lot of followers i'm sure maybe many of you actually are firefighters so do let me know if you can fight fire with fire the idea of f5 is that white would take on passong and then black would immediately capture back and then play something like pawn to g4 and would lock the position down and not really be any worse and then would play 97 knight f5 and just get a very reasonable position so magnus is is doing himself kind of a a nice favor here and now again if he takes on f4 there is queen to g7 so he plays the move g4 and now we can sort of take our first breath hopefully not hopefully you've been breathing throughout the video but we can take our first breath and the point is that now the position is locked it's a very locked very close position no pawn breaks are possible anywhere none of these pawns can break the only break that's happening right now is over here and vichy actually does something about that immediately because his idea is well we're gonna we're gonna now rotate over here we're gonna fight over on this side of the board because this side is dead right so vichy does something smart here because if she could play something like knight to e2 but he doesn't want to get locked down he actually doesn't want something like this that would be a nightmare for white it would be a nightmare because white has pieces that like to run free it's like buying a big dog and keeping him in a studio apartment in new york city personally if you buy that's what i think i think if you have a huge dog and you have no space in your apartment you're just a bad person just saying it right now all right just standing right now you got to get the dog some space if you do live in a small apartment you're gonna walk it multiple times like what are you doing like a husky in new york it should be in the mountains somewhere running in snow so anyway d takes c5 my rents aside vichy takes on c5 to open the position and now rotate over that way if you're wondering why magnus hasn't done anything exciting yet in seven minutes and you want to click away from the video i don't know you're beyond salvation you're a product of the social media machine in the modern era 97 you'll notice that magnus does not even commit a tempo to taking this back i think he didn't want to his queen being used like a pinata but his edginess had to wear off very quickly because he took the pawn on the very next move it's like a kid vegetables then you offer the kid dessert and suddenly he can eat the vegetables knight t2 so everybody's developed everything is good and now magnus plays the move knight to a5 right he wants to come over here he wants to develop the bishop over here he wants to fight on the sea file rook c8 and all that good stuff and this she now plays queen f2 vichy has finally like needed to think for the first time in the game they were playing a 15 minute rapid game that's on the screen right i didn't forget to put that in the travel setup yup they got 15 minutes all right great and you know this is like i could keep the queens on i can attack over here i can do this but vichy thought my plans are a lot smoother and i i can the position has more clarity if the black queen is not harassing all of my pieces on the side of the board so let's trade queens that's a big decision vichy is not intimidated by magnus whatsoever if she's like you know you go to your local gym to play basketball there's a 50 year old man and you're like what's he gonna do and then he posts up he could shoot the three he plays defense and he calls you the b word like while he's doing it he's like bro you are trash and then he drains the ball in your face and makes your mama jokes like vichy is in his 50s and he's still like clapping at this level so he's not afraid he's not like a lot of guys would not trade queens against magnus because they're not worried about like because they're worried that he's so good at end games that he's just gonna outmaneuver them from this position even if the position is equal because the chess is about creating chances right bishop to d7 very natural move now this shoe plays a4 multi-purpose move the first and very hilarious purpose of the move a4 is to actually prevent the bishop from maybe sitting there because it's actually a very annoying square for white to have a piece sit because it just applies permanent pressure the other idea of pawn 284 is to potentially play bishop to b5 and if black overreacts with something like a6 the dark squares are actually very weakened look what happens to the eval at top level chess look what happens to the eval if you if you play a pawn move it goes from 0 to 0.4 that's a substantial increase so magnus plays king f7 because he doesn't want to commit his king excuse me doesn't want to commit his pawns and magnus in general is very limited with his pawn play he doesn't like to over commit his pawns which is saying a lot because you look over here that was out of necessity and also that repels the white forces vichy now plays rook to b1 very natural move and that magnus plays b6 he doesn't play a6 he plays b6 because it's better to strengthen the dark squares over here because he doesn't have a dark squared bishop so these pieces are going to try to fight on the light squares but the pawns would be very nicely positioned to fight in the dark squirrels because he doesn't have a dark squared bishop bishop c1 very natural we're trying to go over here reroute there it is batman is also rerouting that man is doing a norwegian horse dance it's when a norwegian warrior walks into a field and does a dance and then gets kicked in the head by a horse and the point is that you go here and then you go here and then you go here and then i don't know hopefully something good happens in reality magnus knew right away what vishi wanted when he played bishop to c1 which is kind of ridiculous he knew that vichy's idea was not actually to take the diagonal he knew that vichy's idea was to play bishop a3 and then bishop b4 and that would kick the night out and you kind of want the night out if you're playing with white because that would be a very nice weakness creation then you would bring your king over and make progress and probably go on to win the game magnus was just in time with his norwegian horse dance and now his knights are glued perfectly together right now he puts rook hb8 this looks stupid like if y'all played like this i would yell at you because you don't see the future magnus is ready he's in prime position his rooks are on the ugliest square as possible the ugliest square is possible but he is ready for the next phase of the game which is potentially opening up that side of the board that's exactly what he does he now puts his knight on c4 and he's ready to potentially move the pawns forward in all end games you are also actively considering what happens with the exchanges what trades bishop for a pawn and and and what future pawn advancements might occur now this exchange sends the game into an opposite colored bishop end game and there is absolutely only one person who can win this position and it's vishyananda with the white pieces magnus plays rook c8 now that that transformation has occurred he can rotate back to c excuse me c8 then she plays a5 trying to knock on the door all end games feature potential exchanges this exchange would benefit white massively because the knight absolutely murders the bishop the bishop has a bunch of colleagues that are all on light squares all taking its opportunities away almost every piece in the white position is on a dark square it will be in the future the knight applies to meaningful pressure also can very quickly it's just bad it's bad all right very very bad b5 so magnus locks it down and a couple of moves later he plays a6 this is just desperate defending by magnus i mean this bishop absolute god this bishop bozo this knight potential to be a god right this night bozo the only thing that white has is that black has potentially is the knight arriving on the e4 square other than that i don't see anything so how is magnus gonna do this i mean you clicked on a video about magnus like it's probably gonna be something let's see rook d8 first order of business we need to relieve the pressure if you don't relieve the pressure i actually don't even really care about the material i can very easily sack my rook to get in in many positions and then i'm gonna win the night after i take back so we have rook takes d4 we have bishop c6 rook d2 and now magnus plays g3 check completely gives up a pawn which gives up the pun what is he doing bro like why is this man playing for a win in a position he's still trying to play for a win it's ridiculous he's just playing g3 now the point is if you play king g3 black plays rook g8 check there's no need to do that if you play knight takes g3 plaque is still going to play rook g8 and rook g4 and somehow it's like kind of a pain in the ass to play this position with white so white plays king g1 magnus still still plays rook g8 and then he just goes back to d8 you can't take the bishop because the rook is pinned so if she plays bishop d6 if knight takes bishop knight takes bishop by white so he has to move his bishop so there she goes back it's probably going to be a draw it's just a fortress ain't nothing that can be done magnus plays rook d5 he's got a minute and a half on the clock ain't nobody got business winning this game with the black pieces ain't nobody except maybe magnus carlson king to f1 but how's he gonna do it we're waiting for the moment king he won it's like your favorite football team down one right extra time knight c6 but all right if you take to oh i see it if you take and then take and then take and then take maybe you're gonna get that pawn oh that could be weird because then the g pawn's a problem it's still a draw but that she plays knight e2 magnus posing some problems now he trades but he lost his pawn he lost his g pawn well that's it i mean that's bishop to f3 bishop d1 that's it i mean there's nothing there's nothing you can do magna starts bringing his king starts bringing his king and now vichy takes the knight the one piece that had a chance of jumping around successfully in the position is gone the light squared bishop is not going to do anything in this position king e7 king c1 king d7 king b2 king c6 king a2 he brought his king over there because in this position black at some point is going to put his king on c5 black's king cannot cross the center line he can there's nothing you can do the only thing you could potentially do in this position his move your b pawn but even then it's a draw why is it a draw because after it takes here so what look at this you won the second pawn you can't get into the position it's a fortress it's a defensive fortress white will just hang out on a2b2 the rest of the game and black cannot cross this line he can cross this line with his king but that's it king b5 king a2 a5 king b2 a4 king a2 that's it it's just a draw you just can't make any progress because so vichy is not afraid he's just he's just sitting and waiting he's like all right this is you know this oaf is gonna come to realize that you know okay before so what i take magnus goes king d4 20 seconds on the clock this man is gunning for a win with his king but there's no way this works there's no way this works for two reasons you cannot just sacrifice pawns in the night in bishop endgame you're just gonna have less pawns you can't complete a lego set with missing pieces like it just you can you'd call the company or maybe just ignore it but like in certain situations and the other thing is like white is defending everything if you play king to e3 at the wrong moment i'm gonna sack my knight i'm gonna promote my pawn i'm also gonna sack over here your bishop just can't stop both pawns it just doesn't work the whole thing definitely doesn't work right so he plays king d3 then she plays b5 pawn takes b5 what is magnus doing what has he gotten himself into the pawn is a square away from queening is completely lost right 20 seconds on the clock foreign he had it all planned out the whole time all of this calculated decision playing on the knife's edge of the game the circus act of walking the tightrope he knew all of this was going to happen or he winged the whole thing and i'm just hyping up hyping him up in this video but i i don't think so i think he would be humble if he said something like that he knew vishu was gonna get this and he was going to get this and this game is going to come down to a race a race of some 20 moves all the way back here this race began sacking the pawn to activate the king to get down to d2 so that after pawn to a7 you can play b4 and this you have the red carpet for the pawn so bishop d5 now vichy has to go back to f1 but he goes in forward to the position gives up his night and goes with the pawn you can't take it because i queen the other pawn so magnus plays b4 e7 you are going to lose this race b take c3 a2 c2 but i queen first and if you take the queen the queen here and if you make a queen it's a draw it's a draw because it's stalemate the cruelty of the sea pawn in this position i would play queen to e3 sacrificing my queen and after king to c2 if you take it stalemate because neither of my pawns can move queen d3 you are now obligated forced to take the queen and either piece that captures it is still a draw how utterly ridiculous is that what a calculated defensive sequence by vichy anand to sack his knight to get all of this and then magnus doesn't go for it he seals the queen off from the king the computer here finds c3 this is how computers kind of kill the mystique of the best players in the world the move c3 threatens bishop d5 check and if you play something like queen d7 you can't really take king e1 is winning because the queen can't stop the pawns and neither can the king which is you know queen e7 check and then the king would run and and then you would shield yourself and then you would be winning but bishop b4 is still equal like this is still defendable but this is impossible queen dhek bishop d3 that's it the game is over queen d4 there was queen a5 check but it didn't stop anything because c3 so bishop to d3 queen d4 wait but c1 queen is still a draw queen e3 and queen takes d3 so in this position magnus promoted to a knight he played against the queen with a bishop and a knight and he promoted to a knight with a check with the shield of the bishop in the pawn and the critical squares being covered by his most important pieces so it was impossible for the queen to ever get close the king moved because he was in check and the pawn stepped one step closer the knight will move and the pawn will promote and there is just not enough room your own pawn gets in the way and if you play queen f2 i just play knight e2 i am completely shielded queen to b6 played by vichy the knight slides out of the way that she takes push this she resigns actually in the game broadcast something very funny happened here that's not what happened in the game but i think they were analyzing this year resigned in this position magnus one in the broadcast it said queen here which is fine but then it said that magnus went back to c1 which is a move that maybe you would play but not matches c1 queen of course wins the game it wins the game because you're just up two pawns and then this knight will always take and stop that one this man promoted to a knight to fight off a queen and promote another pawn and he did all of this from a position where like i mean it's literally not possible to win with black i mean even all the way back here like if magnus hadn't played g3 if he had been lazy for a move and played rook d8 what would have happened is this this g3 that would have been a draw that's it i mean this is just completely a draw magnus for no reason at all in a position he's got absolutely no business calling the shots gives away upon completely to activate his rook then he proceeds to get into a tangled web of pieces here trade the rooks trade the pawns and just all he's got to do is threaten he's just gotta threaten nasty things and even here faced with the prospect of a fortress he sacrifices a pawn for king activity and they get into a race where it's one tempo to queen one tempo to break through a completely ridiculous avoidance of a stalemate trap with the threat of the promotion of the queen here and he promotes to a knight and that wins him the game ah and then he went on twitter and then he said he he didn't actually plan that and he just was trying to promote to a queen but he couldn't find a queen anywhere around so he promoted to a knight that's basically what he said which is you know it's peak magnus content online you know you just click this and it becomes a queen you might not even have out you might have auto queen on which is a really good reason by the way why you shouldn't yeah this man is a magician i don't really know what else to say the show stuff he does is just stupid like i don't know how he does this that's all i have for you today lucy compton coming up vacation's good i'm gonna come back tanned and hopefully well rested get out of here
