crisis or recent protests their latest video goes over cell towers and their effect on human health check out their channel in the description below the simple concept of redundancy and design has brought us the safest form of transportation in human history modern aviation from engines to flight control systems and hydraulics operating with two to four parallel systems has become a key tenant of aviation safety however the structure of an aircraft itself by nature cannot accommodate the use of redundancy easily it must rely heavily on the properties of the materials used to construct it this is an inconel fastener on the boeing 767 only 16 of these two thousand dollar bolts attach the vertical stabilizer to the rest of the fuselage incandel alloys are oxidation and corrosion resistant materials well suited for service in extreme environments when heated it forms a thick and stable passivating oxide layer protecting the surface from further attack it also retains its strength across a high temperature range inconel is part of a class of high performance metals known as super alloys super alloys have the ability to operate at temperatures far closer to their melting point than traditional alloys they also possess excellent mechanical strength and resistance to thermal creep or a permanent deformation under constant load at high temperatures additionally they offer good surface stability and excellent resistance to oxidation super alloys achieve their high performance strength through an alloying process known as solid solution strengthening where the solute atom is large enough that it can replace solvent atoms in their lattice positions while leaving the overall crystal structure relatively unchanged the casting process is especially important in the production of heat resistant super alloys such as those used in aircraft engine components nickel-based super alloys for example are cast using directional solidification which produces a polymer grain structure with few transverse grain boundaries or single crystal castings which eliminate all grain boundaries altogether this technique enhances its resistance to thermal creep iron nickel super alloys tend to be used in jet engines for their high temperature properties and low thermal expansion they are typically found in blades discs and engine casings cobalt super alloys are also used in jet engine components though specifically in components that require excellent corrosion resistance against hot combustion gases they are resistant to the lead oxides sulfur oxides and other corrosive compounds in jet exhaust gases while super alloys achieve high degrees of strength especially at high temperatures like most metal alloys they deform first elastically then plastically until they fail some materials resist this deformation and break very sharply without plastic deformation in what is called a brittle fracture the measure of a material's resistance to deformation particularly in a localized manner is its hardness there are three main types of hardness measurements each with their own individual measurement skills scratch hardness is the measure of how resistant a sample is to fracture or permanent plastic deformation due to friction from a sharp object this is commonly measured using the mohs scale particularly in mineralogy indentation hardness measures the resistance of a sample to material deformation due to a constant compression load from a sharp object this measure is usually represented by the scales rockwell shore and brunel and the third measure rebound hardness or dynamic hardness measures the height of the rebound of a diamond tipped hammer dropped from a fixed height onto material this test is usually represented by the lieb rebound hardness test and the bennett hardness scale diamonds have always been the standard for hardness being the hardest known natural material to man however in 2003 a non-crystalline form of diamond known as aggregated diamond nanorods or adnr had been found to be much harder than bulk diamond called nanodiamond or hyperdiamond it was initially produced by the compression of graphite within a diamond anvil cell at 40 gigapascals this process was then refined by using fullerenes an allotrope of carbon compressed at 2 to 20 gigapascals while being heated at 2200 degrees celsius these experiments produced a series of interconnected diamond nanorods with diameters of between 5 and 50 nanometers and lengths of around 1 micrometer each x-ray diffraction analysis had indicated that aggregated diamond rods are 0.3 percent denser than standard diamonds giving rise to their superior hardness testing performed on a traditional diamond with an aggregated diamond nanorod tip produced a hardness value of 170 gigapascals the same test on an aggregated diamond nanorod sample resulted in a 310 gigapascal value though due to the lack of the existence of a harder testing tip these results may be exaggerated still it's speculated that aggregated diamond nanorod's hardness on the mole scale could exceed 10 the rating of a diamond curiously naturally occurring hyperdiamonds have been found at the site of the papago crater in siberia it's theorized that the direct conversion from graphite to aggregated diamond nanorods had occurred during the impact event that took place around 35 million years ago the way we utilize the properties of materials tend to occur in plain sight they form the products machines and structures that we see daily but less obvious and arguably less appreciated is how we bond these materials together adhesives by definition are any non-metallic substance applied to one or both surfaces of two separate materials that bind them together and resist their separation sometimes referred to as glues or cement they are one of the earliest engineering materials used by man evidence has been discovered of the use of birch bark tar as an adhesive on stone dating back as far as 200 000 years ago adhesives generally come in two forms non-reactive adhesives which either dry by solvent evaporation pressure contact or solidification from a molten state and reactive adhesives that chemically react to harden through multiple reactants anaerobic curing heating or through a reaction with ultraviolet light the mechanism by which adhesives bond materials together can be mechanical chemical or dispersive mechanical adhesion fills the pores of the surfaces and hold them together by physically interlocking them chemical adhesion occurs when the surface atoms of the two surfaces form ionic covalent or hydrogen bonds and dispersive adhesion takes place when the two materials are held together by van der waal forces the strength of an adhesive bond is usually measured by the simple single lap shear test the lap shear strength is reported as the failure stress in the adhesive which is determined by dividing the failing load by the bond area for comparison a single six millimeter spot weld found on the chassis of most cars typically has a lap share strength of 20 megapascals cyanoact adhesives often marketed as crazy glue or super glue can have lap share strengths as high as' megapascals when bonded to steel and toughened epoxy construction adhesives can even achieve strengths up to 25 megapascals in 2017 the dilo industrial adhesives company broke the guinness record for the world's strongest adhesive by holding a 17 500 kilogram truck up in the air over an hour with just 3 grams of adhesive spread over 40 square centimeters the product used monopox ve403728 is a thermally cured one component epoxy designed for the automotive and microelectronics industry that can achieve share strengths well beyond 40 megapascals however nature still holds the title for the strongest adhesive bond ever observed in 2012 it was discovered that the water bacterium colobactor crescentus synthesizes a polysaccharide-based adhesin when stimulated by contact with a surface this substance is estimated to have a shear strength of around 60 megapascals approaching the strength of a solid copper joint and now we predictably turn our attention to the opposite end of the spectrum the slipperiest of materials how easily two materials slide against each other is determined by their coefficient of friction a dimensionless value that describes the ratio of the force of friction between the two objects and the force pressing them together this value can be further divided into static friction where the mating surfaces are at rest relative to each other and kinetic friction where the frictional force on each surface is exerted in the direction opposite to the relative motion these frictional forces are the net effect of material deformation characteristics and surface roughness both of which are derived from the chemical bonding between atoms in each of the materials and how their surfaces interact most dry materials against themselves have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6 however lubricants can lower these values significantly by separating the surfaces in the case of liquid lubricants their viscosity now becomes a key component of the coefficient of friction some materials such as ice self-lubricate in this case forming a thin film of water reducing the coefficient of friction to values well below 0.1 human synovial fluid which lubricates the cartilage in our joints can even lower the coefficient of friction in our joints to lower than .01 for over 60 years polytetrafluoroethylene or teflon has dominated as the slipperiest dry material available achieving a coefficient of friction as low as 0.05 teflon is so slippery that it resists van der waals forces making it the only known surface a gecko cannot stick to this property of teflon even prevents insects from climbing up surfaces coated in it in 1999 at the department of energy ames laboratory in iowa in an attempt to create a substance that generates electricity when heated a super hard substance consisting of boron aluminum magnesium and titanium boride was created this new ceramic alloy called bam was so hard that only diamond and cubic boron nitride was known to be harder aside from its hardness its unique composition exhibited the lowest known coefficient of friction of a dry material 0.04 and it was able to get as low as 0.01 using water glycol-based lubricants bam is so slippery that a hypothetical one kilogram block coated in the material would start sliding down an inclined plane of only 2 degrees bam is currently being studied for potential commercial applications coatings as thin as 2 to 3 micrometers have been found to improve the efficiency and reduce wear and cutting tools as well as other common moving parts susceptible to wear such as pistons and seals similar to how this slipperiest material was discovered the most absorbent material would also be accidentally discovered in 2013 by a group of nanotechnology researchers at upsala university while pursuing more viable methods for drug delivery using porous calcium carbonate the team had accidentally created an entirely new material thought for more than 100 years to be impossible to make this material mesoporous magnesium carbonate or upsalite is a non-toxic magnesium carbonate with an extremely poor surface area allowing it to absorb more moisture at low humidities than any other known material upsalide is so porous that a single gram of it has a surface area of around 800 square meters the team began to experiment with magnesium carbonates using the techniques they apply to calcium carbonate due to its existing approval for drug delivery totally unaware of the fact that researchers had tried to make disordered forms of magnesium carbonates for decades using similar techniques without success the breakthrough came when they tweaked the process a little and accidentally left the material in a reaction chamber over a weekend resulting in a peculiar gel after a year of refinement the process yielded upslight upsilite is created by reacting magnesium oxide and methanol under pressurized carbon dioxide stirring and depressurization of the product results in an alka gel that swells as trapped carbon dioxide expands and is released once the carbon dioxide is released the residual methanol is evaporated from the gel with heat treatment solidifying it and leaving a porous network in the material the scientists have created many new high surface area materials with nanotechnology such as carbon nanotubes and zeolites what makes upsalate unique is the size of its nanopores each nanopore is less than 10 nanometers in diameter which results in one gram of the material having 26 trillion nanopores making it very reactive with its environment this characteristic gives it incredible moisture absorption properties allowing it to absorb more than 20 times more moisture than fumed silica a material commonly used for moisture control during the transport of moisture sensitive goods while upslide is currently being marketed for moisture control in the oil and gas industry as well as a climbing chalk in the sports industry its unique pore structure is being researched for its application in drug delivery poor aqueous solubility has limited the approval of many potential drugs due to their reduced therapeutic effect the pores of upsali can be used to host such drugs rendering them effective as well as regulating their release by tuning the particle size and pore size other potential applications are still being discovered as the material undergoes development for industrial use our final substance isn't extreme because of its innate properties but rather of what it induces in other materials chlorine trifluoride is a colorless poisonous corrosive and extremely reactive gas in fact it's so reactive that it is the most flammable substance known first prepared in 1930 by the german chemist otto ruff it was created by the fluorination of chlorine then separated by distillation because chlorine trifluoride is such a strong oxidizing and fluorinating agent it will react with most inorganic and organic materials and will even initiate the combustion with many non-flammable materials without any ignition source these reactions are typically violent and in some cases even explosive its oxidizing ability even surpasses oxygen allowing it to react even against oxide containing materials considered incombustible it has been reported to ignite glass sand asbestos and other highly fire retardant materials it will also ignite the ashes of materials that have already been burned in oxygen in one incident of an industrial accident a spill of 900 kilograms of chlorine trifluoride was able to burn through 30 centimeters of concrete and 90 centimeters of gravel beneath exposure to its liquid or gaseous form will even ignite living tissue a chlorine trifluoride fire is almost impossible to suppress since it reacts with water-based fire suppressors and oxidizes even in the absence of atmospheric oxygen rendering co2 and halon ineffective the only known method capable of dealing with a chlorine trifluoride fire is to flood the area with nitrogen or helium while steel copper or nickel are relatively safe because of a thin layer of insoluble metal fluoride that forms most of the metals such as molybdenum tungsten and titanium will react aggressively equipment that comes in contact with chlorine trifluoride must be meticulously cleaned then passivated even small amounts of it remaining can burn through the passivation layer faster than it can reform chlorine trifluoride reacts so aggressively that it can even corrode materials otherwise known to be non-corrodable such as iridium platinum and even gold industrially it has found used as a powerful cleaning agent in semiconductor manufacturing it is used to clean chemical vapor deposition chambers due to its ability to decompose semiconductor material it has also been used limitedly in the processing of fuel for nuclear reactors while using chlorine trifluoride as a rocket propelled has been explored handling concerns has limited its use during world war ii it was also examined for use as both an incendiary and the poison gas with over 50 tons being manufactured by the germans though it was never used during the war you
