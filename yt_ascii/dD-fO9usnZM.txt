ladies and gentlemen welcome back to silicon valley scammers in this episode we're talking about the poop testing company revolutionizing the human biome it's a company called you biome and this is their founder now after the fraud has been uncovered they're on the run yes her her and her co-founder are literally their warrants out for their arrest and they are fugitives ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffee zilla and today we're talking about you biome now like i said they're poop testers which is a bit weird but okay that's fine it's a thing guys we all poop and let me say right off the bat you're gonna notice some immediate comparisons natural comparisons to elizabeth holmes which we talked about in episode one and if i were you if i'm netflix right i'd be shooting for the elizabeth home story obviously it's the best story but if i'm like one of the lessers watching the show if i'm like a director for like showtime or something and i'm looking for a hot new doc go with you buy them don't be afraid to dip into the number two no pun intended because this story is honestly pretty amazing all on its own listen one thing that i found interesting right off the bat and we'll just like draw comparisons as we go so elizabeth holmes she was doing a ted med talk in 2014. i believe right remember this individual is the answer is cheese dude she's the worst but in 2013 so that's 2014 ted bed ted med just loves hosting the charlatans because this is jessica richmond giving another rah-rah you know science talk we're all gonna be saved by these new silicon valley people rediscovering medicine and that's what she does with the talk in tedmed scientists win a nobel prize no really this is a real question can a citizen scientist win a nobel prize can a citizen scientist go to jail for fraud it's a real question a sea change is happening in science the technological forces that are globalizing and connecting and integrating all of us are increasingly bringing us together to do science buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz bye guys the increasing globalization globalizing forces there's a sea change going on listen it's all fine there's nothing wrong with buzzwords but you gotta have something to back it up so she pitches you buy em which actually hilariously started on kickstarter and indiegogo yes that's right this kind of belongs in a in gofundme garbage episode truthfully i didn't know where to put it did i put it in silicon valley scams do i put it in gofundme garbage it's the same thing reaffirming my long-held belief that gofundmes kickstarters indiegogos 99 crap again no pun intended dang i'm on a roll today one take baby this is one take so what else with jessica well there's a lot more so just like elizabeth holmes was known for faking her voice jessica richmond also faked her own stuff she faked her age she lied about her age when she was like 46 to go ahead and get into the women's 30 under 30 list or she oh sorry 40. so she was trying to get into the list so she goes yeah i'm like 30 or something and she's actually 40 years old how silly is that that's so goofy man and then she got on the list and then solicited investors with it like the startup founders made sure investors got those articles according to prosecutors so she it's all about lying your way to the top you find out with these con artists which is that it's the same pattern of kind of like sketchy you know morals you know lying when it's convenient that's what you see over and over with these people now something else they lied about was also their marketing materials so you know how i call out fakers all the time for using stock photos hey guess what you biome did the same thing it's not just codmin in the fake guru space it's also silicon valley so-called revolutionaries that aren't afraid to use a good old stock photo when convenient now they say these testimonials really do exist smart gut has played a huge part in helping me create my l plan based on my unique needs but other people say it was basically like a horoscope i mean it's like the technology really wasn't there to tell you many meaningful things and ultimately in the the report from the doj or excuse me the sec you end up finding out that basically it all boiled down to an insurance fraud scheme which is kind of pathetic for all this work about revolutionary we're changing everything it's just an insurance scheme to get doctors to order patients tests they don't need and maybe that's the most boring part about all of this but honestly it's interesting to realize that this is actually what's criminal about what they did because they've been recently charged in a new complaint that yeah they're gonna they're facing criminal charges not just civil charges conspiracy to commit health care fraud health care fraud aggravated identity theft conspiracy to commit wirefraud you get the idea just your average silicon valley charges and maybe the most interesting part about all of this is that they're actually right now fugitives i was looking at the documents and you see jessica richmond is not in custody has not been arrested and is a fugitive and in fact ladies and gentlemen there's currently a warrant out for her arrest as well as her partner zachary you see here that zachary is also a fugitive so ladies and gentlemen i mean theron's thing yes it's very interesting but that story has already been told i feel like this story is only beginning it's an international manhunt where are these people they've committed fraud and they run off after stealing everyone's poop maybe that was the maybe that was their big plan listen i don't know does it sound like a crappy movie or is it good let me know i think it'd be great contact me netflix or showtime or amazon private i'm honestly this is an amazon primer let's be honest it's not at that level it's not a netflix but amazon prime call me we'll set something up in the meantime guys i hope you enjoyed this episode of silicon valley scams let me know what you want to see in the future that's basically it and i will see you guys next time i know what you need this ain't what it seems nothing but a trick trying to sell me on a dream but that was where you lost me wake up and smell the coffee
