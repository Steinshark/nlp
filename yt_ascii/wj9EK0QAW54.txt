what i want to kind of point out is before we talk about why the tower of babel was wrong you need to understand that that the essential idea the essential shape of it is not wrong that's just an unavoidable shape this is what essentially what worship what meaning looks like if you want to have meaning if you if you want to not be scattered yeah then this is what you have to do yeah and it's important to know that because what happens is people have readings in scripture and they'll see for example god telling the israelites to take down the high places to remove the sacred poles and like so there this that language that's really there in scripture but then they take it as a general rule that high places are wrong in themselves and that you know these these pillars are wrong in themselves and then you have the cross and then you realize that the temple itself is actually on a mountain and that you know it's like and then moses goes up the mountain so you you have to be able to understand the fullness of the symbolism to see when it's when it's off and when it's wrong that's right that's right this is jonathan pjo welcome to the symbolic [applause] [music] world so hello everyone we are back with another episode of universal history today we are going to talk about the tower of babel something that i find very interesting that i've been thinking about for years i can't wait to get richard's take on it but before we start i want to make a big announcement which is that as you know symbolic world press has had some problems in the past month or so and myself just problem just dis myself discovering that things were not what they seemed in my in the way it was represented to me and that things were a lot worse than what we thought and i went to dallas and and richard saved my life like literally but he helped me he was we drove around town for days trying to figure things out connect with lawyers and and accountants and you know get stuck his house was full of books for for weeks you know trying to get organized so that we could send your books to you but it's weird in that moment and even a little bit before that i discovered i had an sight which i can't believe i had had before with just how close richard and i's thinking is in terms of storytelling terms of the way we see universal history and the way we see the cosmos but also richard has a lot of skills that i do not have he is a you know he has a computer thinking like he's a he's a manager he he's able to deliver projects and so we've decided to partner up in the symbolical press and so we will be working together very closely in the next few months so so richard welcome to the symbolic world thank you it's you know i when we were talking about all of this i said you know it feels like everything that i' done in my life up to this point was was maybe for this like you know the the weird mixture of i'm into all these ancient stories but also like project software project management and you know i don't know anyway it's it's it's been a whirlwind so far though jonathan i have to say like you know it's already been you know one of the more interesting things that i've under ever taken it's only been you know basically a month but yeah there was so much crazy stuff that happened and it all happened right on kandlus you know and we spent all of candle miss like you know driving around in the pouring rain trying to you know you know it was just i don't know it was just a it was a whirlwind time and i i said this on on der's channel recently but like i remember we were having this this conversation you and i we were talking about some very things and you were like yeah mystical things don't really happen to me i mean i believe that they happen and whatnot and then like there's just all of these insane things happening the entire week that you're down here and i was like oh yeah mystical things don't happen to you sure uhhuh yeah but no it was it's it's been a crazy time my house has essentially been a warehouse for the last two weeks now and so i know a lot of people have been posting on twitter saying they're getting their snow white stuff i know that a lot other a lot of other people still haven't gotten it but we're it now we're on the case so we're going to we're going to make sure it gets done so i have i think i've only got like six big boxes left in my office here and then and you know then the rest will be coming out from the warehouse relatively soon but yeah so i'm excited about this i'm excited about the potential of getting to tell some stories that have been living rentree in my head for a long time and and now maybe we'll get to share them with the world so yeah and so and also before we start don't forget next week i mean richard and i are going to be be together in florida tarpon springs the symbolic world summit jordan peterson's going to be there father steven d young neil degrade deacon nicholas vesper stamper and a bunch of people that are not on the roster like andrew g's gonna be there father silan jano just it's going to be absolutely crazy jordan hall is coming i don't even remember all the people that are going to come and so there are still a few tickets left for the actual event so you can get those on the symbolic world but if you cannot come which i understand then we decided to offer virtual tickets that are deeply discounted until the very day of the conference because we're going to release the videos during that the days that the conference is on and so go to the symbolic world.com and because this might be a once- in aive time opportunity to be honest because it's crazy but i'm not sure i'm not sure we're ever gonna do this again all right yeah and so richard take us take us take us to the tower of babel okay so i thought that it would be fun we were talking about what video we should do for universal history this month obviously the dragons one came out what people don't know is that we recorded that back in like november or something and because life has been crazy we haven't recorded one of these in a in a little while and i thought it would be fun to do something it would kind of tease the stuff i'm going to be talking about at the conference so the the the title of my talk is or one of the talks i'm giving is called the shadow of that hideous strength which sounds like it's a cs lewis reference but the se the title of the cs lewis book which is one of my favorite books is actually a reference to the tower of babel and so we're going to talk about the tower of babel today i'll talk a little more about the connection to that hideous strength and the poem and that that's a reference to and all that stuff i'm going to talk about that at the conference not going to talk about that today but basically what i'm going to do at the conference is really focus on genesis and really focus on all of the things about genesis which in the ancient world and in the middle ages people took for granted when they were reading genesis and it's not to say that that some of these things are completely universal but there's definitely like you could say a constellation of of ways to read and ways to understand genesis what pretty much everybody in the ancient world agreed on is that genesis is the most important book of the old testament when it comes to just understanding why everything is the way that it is and this is one of the beautiful insights that your brother matthew brings out in his book and this is one of the actually to me one of the really cool things about god's dog the god's dog too by the way is is on kickstarter now i know we have a lot a lot of things going on people but u but there's going to be i've already gotten to see some of the stuff from god's dog too it's going to be actually some of the stuff we're talking about today and and right which which i'm not going to like and and then other things which you might hear explained if you come to the conference so anyway but there used to be this way of reading genesis and that way of reading genesis was lost particularly in the west because a lot of the books which contained it were rejected ultimately rejected as apocryphal and at some point in the west we don't need to go into why right now but the i apocrypha became associated with this is bad and evil and wrong and potentially dangerous to read right and those is not the that's not what that word actually means in the church right hisor ly that's not always how we how how we've used it so these ways of reading genesis got lost and then the 20th century comes along especially the say the last 20 30 years of the 20th century comes along and with the emergence of of you have an emergence of material materialist readings of genesis in response to let's say you know atheists basically trying to pick it apart right and so then christians come back but they come back on the same terms the atheists are using and try to defend genesis in a materialist way and so one of the things that ends up happening is when somebody like you or your brother tries to talk about genesis in a let's say like a more of a mythical register people are like are you saying you don't believe god created the world in six days or something like this so what i want to kind of do what i what i what i want to do is to kind of introduce people to a selection of these readings and or these traditions is really the the right the correct word about genesis and explain how this actually still affects the way that you live today for instance if you're an orthodox christian there are certain things that you believe for instance about the liturgy i'm not going to explain this today you have to come to the conference but there are certain things that you believe about the liturgy and about the feast of the church that are true because of the way that we've inherited because of this tradition about genesis that we've inherited so so if you find yourself in the in the orthodox church or in a more traditional branch of christianity there's a lot of the stuff that you still assume to be true actually even if you don't there's still a lot of the stuff that you assume to be true most evangelicals for instance take it as more or less fact that evil spirits are fallen angels there's actually nothing in the bible to say that directly there are things that you can infer but you can only infer them kind of in the light of these older traditions about how to read those scriptural passages so that's kind of one example but so today i thought we' talk about the tower of babel obviously this is one that's very interesting to me as a linguist and it is to me like most of the stories in genesis it is one that is impossible to say everything about like it's impossible to exhaust so we're going to say some things about the tower of babel today but if you're out there watching and you're one of the people who knows all these traditions are like ah he didn't mention xyz you're right i did not but maybe we will in a future video maybe and there's actually more stuff about the tower of bubble i'm going to talk about at the conference so come to that but so i thought we would talk about first of all just what a tower is if you look at traditional images of the tower of babel the one that's most well known is one it was i think it's like a 16th century image yeah that's right it's from the it's from the renaissance and it basically shows kind of a a a a spiraling tower going upwards and that's essentially correct now you can say you know it was a zigurat which is kind of like a stepped pyramid or something it's the same thing though like it's the it's the same thing it's doing the same kind of the same kind of thing so a tower is i mean and you can probably explain this better but a tower is you could say is a fixed point in space right and and it's a way of literally nailing something down right whereas the spiral is this and i love that you just did that video on the leviathan and the oroboros and and all that stuff because it's because that idea of the spiral as kind of like time and change right and then but then also kind of this cyclical or or like say like undulation in time so when you have the the combination of those two things and there's this wonderful uh the opening sequence of the first volume of god's dog maybe we can put that up here for people to see but the opening sequence of god's dog is actually the tower of babel but in a in a good context yeah right and this is the thing to say about symbolism and you mentioned this in your leviathan video that just dropped that symbolism is it's i don't want to say neutral but it's not like it it can be positive or negative right it can have positive or negative aspects depending on the consequence uh depending on the context right yeah and so there's this moment in those i was trying to find my copy of god's dog so i could just show it here to the screen but we'll put it up where where you see the overlap of that image of the tower with the spiral going up which is like the stylight pillar and then oh you got it right there i always have a copy of god's dogs nearby so yeah this image right here yes sorry dr yeah so there's the there's the tower with the spiral going up and then the stylight pillar at the top but then if you flip a couple more pages you see the overlap of that with the candle right and it's it's funny because one of the the yep there it is right there yeah yeah so it's funny because one of the questions that i get asked the most often in my capacity as a catechist is why do you light a candle when you pray what's what's going on there and that is the easiest thing to intuit it and the hardest question to answer like like there is something that's just very intuitively right about obvious ly you would light a candle when you prayed but it's really hard to explain to somebody why right but it's actually connected with the the symbolism of the tower including the tower of babel so the idea of the zigurat or the tower is that it's a it's an artificial mountain right is another way to think about it it's an artificial mountain and you know there's there's overlap between like a mountain and a pillar so it's an artificial mountain because god lives at the top of a mountain as everybody in the ancient world knows it's a hierarchy i mean if people go people think why is a pillar like a mountain it's a it's a connection between heaven and earth it's it's right the vertical it's a hierarchy and you could see it like a right you could see it this way as earth coming closer to heaven but you can also have it as a ladder as a pillar as a rod etc etc it's something that you can ascend and it's got its base on the earth but it's top in the heavens right yeah and there's this and then at the very top there's an altar or a flame right and one of the things we were talking about before the video started the latin word focus right when we say the focus of something means like a a hearth or an altar now you can commit the eological fallacy and say every time that the word focus is ever used then it actually means this other thing but also that's not an arbitrary connection between those two things like if you can think about i mean especially if you've if you worshiped in any kind of a traditional space where the focus is the altar right and those two things become the same thing and it's why even in uh like a like an orthodox home you have a hearth or you know and you usually people put their icons over the top of a hearth right it's just it's a natural thing to do because the the layout of the house is centered around the fireplace actually the layout of modern houses is now centered around where the tv is supposed to go right this is why i tell whenever catans ask you know where should i put my icon do they have to go on e wall or anything like that what i usually tell people is figure out where in your house the tv was intended to go icons there and put your icons there and put the tv somewhere else like if you like i'm serious it'll change the way that you pray and like the way that you live your family life so anyway so the the altar is a point of focus it's a point of intention it is a a place where you could say the meaning of time and space is brought together right so if you've got space is this fix point uniting earth and heaven and then time is this movement and change the altar is the is the is the focal point that brings those two things together and kind of reconciles the meaning and again you can we could talk about how the liturgy does this the way that liturgy uh transforms you know kronos into chyros and the way that it it it transforms space into place and all those different things u those things actually happen in the liturgy and even in the like the eastern liturgy there's even the circular movement that's constantly happening we go around the altar in a process of ascent as we move upwards towards the the kind of the culmination of the sacrifice that's on the altar so anyway all of this to say this is what the tower of babel is i mean if you want to get some more on the religious connotations of what the tower of babel is you can go and listen to the episode the lord of spirits guys did on it it's which is really great what i want to kind of point out is before we talk about why the tarot of babel was wrong you need to understand that that the essential idea the essential shape of it is not wrong that's just an unavoidable shape this is what essentially what worship what meaning looks like if you want to have meaning if you if you want to not be scattered yeah then this is what you have to do yeah and it's important to know that because what happens is people have readings in scripture and they'll see for example god telling the israelites to take down the high places to remove the sacred poles and like so there this that language that's really there in scripture but then they take it as a general rule that high places are wrong in themselves and that you know these these pillars are wrong in themselves and then you have the cross and then you realize that the temple itself is actually on a mountain and that you know it's like and then moses goes up the mountain so you you have to be able to understand the fullness of the symbolism to see when it's when it's off and when it's wrong that's right that's [music] right in 2021 my brother met you and i with the help of cor neelen of philip carton introduced all of you to a new vision of storytelling we launched the god's dog monster graphic novel through crowdfunding introducing the doghe headed st christopher the dragon slang st george to full view as a new epic story began the response was astounded reaching over $250,000 and ultimately selling out our first print of the book now book two of five in this series god's dog warrior moves into the meat this epic story where our dog-headed stranger must be integrated must be trained and must fight the cosmic stakes behind the story become clear the character shine and heart-wrenching choices must be made book two will surprise you with more monsters more giants and a deeper exploration of the mythology underlying it all since book one of god's dog i've also started a publishing company called symbolic world press with some amazing partners to deal with the timely production printing and shipping of all future books we've already successfully published snow white and the widow queen and will expand our activities rapidly the money we raise is to build this whole project and even move towards other media we now have three full-time people working with us plus nine artists six writers collaborating towards at least 14 upcoming books and all of this without any outside funding no outside control it's all of you making this possible this is why crowdfunding is so powerful so on this crowdfunding we've partnered with professional comic artists matt shen jesse white philip ctin and martin crotz to bring together god's dog warrior but on top of that i'm also introducing an entirely new comic book series called the garments of skin which will explore the lore the mythology around god's dog bring the story into the contemporary world where new heroes try to resist a global system of control we are at a turning point in culture a turning point in storytelling and i know i can count on all of you to make it possible we have to take back the reign of storytelling move past the gatekeepers and i thank all of you for trusting us to play a part in that thank you for backing gods dog warrior on kickstarter [music] today so i want to so with that kind of said and with kind of put in people's mind the polyvance between the tower of babel and the idea of like a mountain the mountain of god the zigurat the stylight pillar the candle offered in prayer these are all kind of overlapping images we we can talk about the tower of babel in in specific and i've got here the uh a copy this is from charles worth's old testament pseudepigrapha a copy of the book of jubilees and the traditions that i want to talk about today in reference to the tarot bevel specifically come from the book of jubilees so jubilees is a a text which is not in your bible unless you're ethiopian and then it is but this is not ethiopians yeah lucky ethiopians they get all the good stuff but but i mean this is not a problem for us because of course the um and actually father steven young has a book called apocrypha which you can just go and read if you want to know about reception of jubilees in the eastern church so go and read that i'm not going to repeat all the things that he says there but but the thing to note is that it is quoted in the new testament multiple times there's one really cool example which i'm going to save for the conference people have to come because it's really awesome but but for instance jesus you know famously jesus quotes himself in jubilees right so in jubilees the angel of the lord right he giving the law to moses but but jesus quotes that and says basically that was me right and so yeah so jesus quotes himself in jubilees see peter quotes jubilees seen stephen when he is giving his kind of summary of the old testament in his sermon before he stoned to death he refers to traditions that are if if they didn't come from jubilees they came from the same place that the guy who wrote jubilees got them so anyway all that to say all that to say it is it is it does have a place in our tradition and the account that's given in jubilees of the building of the tower of babel i i'm not going to read the whole thing here but i'll just kind of summarize it so first of all we get we get the clarification and that's how to think about jubilees is it's a sort of it has a frame narrative but it's it's almost like a commentary on genesis or it expands the parts of genesis that you might like have wondered about like okay moses you did not give me enough information here what what's going so one of my favorite examples of this is like judah's repentance after the judah and tamar incident which is like this crazy thing that happens in genesis and then you're like so how were family dynamics what was that like after this you know exactly awkward awkward awward awkward christmases and stuff together so so but if you know so there's some details like that and some more details about how did joseph resist temptation in po's house and so on and so forth so that's kind of what jubilees is doing and so we get a an expansion here or just like kind of an explanation of what's going on with the tower of babel which is that it's not just a tower it's a city surrounding a tower right so it's a tower in the center and there's a city around it and then there's a wall around the city and this is something that you have to think about when you start to think about the descent of the city in the apocalypse right in the book of revelation right that that that and i know that this is one of the key ideas that you've talked about in your videos over the years and probably worth revisiting because it might have been a while since people have really heard it or thought about it but the idea of the city right and all these people in genesis who go and build cities and what's going on there but they take they build it with the the the bitumen right the mortar that they use they take it from the nearby sea so this is another kind of important element of the symbolism here because it's really the rising up of the dry land out of the sea right and so in that way it is a it's an attempt to recreate the world and of course this is in the context if it's just after the flood humanity's been scattered they don't want to be scattered again if the flood waters come they need a you know like a safe place to go and so they build this city and you know we get the dimensions of the tower of babel here are given in jubilees the numbers are interesting i don't know if they're sign ific i've never i've never been able to i what i really want to find is a really old tradition that like attribute significance to the the numbers like the so many cubits and so many stadia and and so on and so forth but i've never found it so we'll pass over that for now but it's surrounded by this wall so a city with a tower in the center or like a zigurat in the center surrounded by a wall and in the account that's given in jubilees right obviously the way that it's translated in most modern accounts of genesis is weird and it's because the hebrew is super old and very difficult right and so the way it's usually translated in english is something like and now nothing will be impossible for them right and so the story gets turned into this kind of like this retelling of uh of a narrative in which god is like trying to keep us from achieving our potential essentially right he's threatened by us right the way that it's framed in jubilees i think is maybe a little more helpful because what it says is the lord looks down on what mankind is doing actually looks on us as we like as as the tower is finished and says now nothing will escape them right and i think that's probably a much more helpful way of understanding what's going on with the tower of babel because it's about this this the creation of a totalizing system right the creation of something again you think about the idea of like the pillar or the mountain fixing space in place right and this is one that's so big it's going to dominate over any other system yeah and that's why the idea that they only have one language is part of this question like it's it's a it is a it's a tyranny in the in the way that we ultimately get you know the final image of the totalizing system in revelation right it's like it it tries to be one thing and that's what god told them not to do bas yes so one of the things that we then get in the account in jubilees is that after the confusion usion of the tong and we'll come back to the confusion of the tong thing because this it relates in an important way to something that happens with abraham later on in jubilees but after the confusion of the tongues the lord sends a wind and the wind knocks over the tower and destroys it which is not something you'll find in the genesis account but is very very important for understanding the story in the way that the apostles understood it which is the argument i'm going to make in a second yeah but it's interesting because if you ask most people like if the tower of babel fell they'll probably say yes but it doesn't say that in scripture right i think that i always you say the way that i absorb the story and people talking about the story growing up i always sort of thought well they were like halfway building it and then just abandoned it and it fell apart right yeah but this is the tradition in jubilees is that the tower is actually completed and then a wind comes and blows it over i would love someday just to talk about the symbolism of wind because it's a weird thing like wind is is obviously it's like related to the idea of chaos right and storms and all so so on and so forth but it's it's unique because it comes from above and one of the interesting things about in the old testament especially when you're going through leviticus and so on and you're getting like don't do this awful thing don't do this awful thing all of these things which we're essentially doing now in our society and but but certain kinds of sins it says if you do this the land will spit you out and then other sins importantly idolatry says if you do this then god will scatter you and so it's like some sins are going to cause the potential that's beneath you to actually reject you right because it because and there always things that have to do with let's say like the fertility of the land right like there are always sins that render what's below us infertile and then there are other sins that are let's say like this is like a this is this is something i was thinking about literally just last night and i'm so i haven't tried to express it before but it's something like there are other sins and and again in particular idolatry that's that's about looking upwards and and and the way that you should be d you know the way your focus should be right that focus that alter that flame at the top of the structure when that's directed wrongly then then then you get the wind right so there's like the flood waters or the land spitting you out or something like that and then there's the the wind the scattering that comes from above yeah so it's it's really the same thing that you see in genesis in the the fall because it's pride really idolatry is a form of pride because it's it's trying to capture everything in in a in an object or an idea it's it's like trying to capture everything into one and not understanding that all things have to be transparent and have to be vehicles for something that is higher and so when human take the fruit for themselves they try they kind of they they think about it like something that tries to crystallize too much and it becomes it becomes brittle because it it tries to hold it all together so then you you blow on it and it shatters because it's too it's brittle and so in the book of jubilees the tower of babel is specifically associated with idolatry and this is really easy to see for instance if you look at the passage immediately before it and the passage immediately after it which are both about idolatry and the evil spirits right and so in jubilees i mean jubilees follows the same tradition that enoch does concerning the sons of god and the daughters of men and so forth so after the flood you got all these evil spirits running around and essentially they're torment ing noah's children and grandchildren and so noah prais the god and god binds n10 of them and puts them in tartarus and then he allows one tenth of the evil spirits to continue to ru the world and basically test mankind right and so and so m masta is the you know or sometimes also the word satan is also used in jubilees but is kind of like the leader of the evil spirits and and the writer of jubilees makes it very clear that he's the one that's kind of instigating all of this with mankind and so there's a lot of stuff in jubilees in the passage immediately following this about abraham and about how abraham is the first person since the the fall of the tower of babel to really worship god and one of the one of the great acts which he does is he goes and he destroys his father's idols and in a way that's kind of reminiscent of what gideon does in the book of judges and this is a tradition that actually gets expanded upon later in judaism but it's very clear that for the writer of jubilees idolatry is is at the heart it's at the center of what's going on with the tower of babel and so that's why there's this wind that comes overthrows the tower and and and scatters it and essentially what happens in jubilees is that after the fall of the tower of babel of course you get the confusion of the tongues and the world descends into chaos and idolatry and what it says is everybody leaves and start building their own cities and towers this is what jubilee says so it's like with the collapse of the one sort of mega structure everybody goes and starts trying to build their own and then they they they they go to war with each other right because it becomes this it becomes everyone's trying to do babble again themselves but now because there's no unity of tongues because there's no unity of like opinion or approach or whatever that you get all of these competing towers all these competing attempts at idolatry and worship and one of the things that jubilee says is that at this time people that the the building of these multiple competing cities and towers are accompanied with the in the increase of what you could call like bespoke religions right so everybody starts making their own idol they start making their own altar they start making their own zigurat they start making their own city like all that stuff goes together and that's basically you know that that causes the the the loss of the knowledge the true knowledge of god and then also for the writer of jubilees the loss of the hebrew language h and so the loss of the heb so the hebrew language was the one language spoken this is this is what jubilees has and it's a little tricky depending on how you word it or basically how you translate a couple of words that either hebrew was lost immediately after adam fell or it was lost after the tower of babel but i think it's the i think it's the latter basically sometimes people will say do there's a reference to the fall and it says nobody has spoken hebrew since the fall right and the question is the fall of what right well there's a modern approach that says that the only that basically adam sin is the only fall right but that's not how people saw things in the time of jubilees and i think that based especially they're talking about the tower falling right the the tower falling but also that the tower of babel was seen as one of the falls of man right and that and that it is the ling it is the specifically linguistic fall and there are a couple of other things in the text that i i would argue really really argue for it's talking about babel and by this is a common belief in the ancient world though in obviously in judaism and in christianity this this idea that that hebrew is was sort of like the adamic tongue unless you ask albanians they'll say it's albanian but anyway actually this this was an argument that some albanian philologists tried to make in the the the 19th century really that albanian was the albanian is the original uh language and anyway that's some bold stuff well if you know anything about albanian national pride it's not even a little bit surprising my joke is that even the king james bible was originally written in albania anyway anyway no no hate by the way for any albanians listening to this i love you guys but anyway it's just just a joke but anyway actually if there are albanians watching this probably like yeah got st it it was originally written in but anyway so you have the the loss of the true knowledge of god and for the writer of jubilees that's the same as the loss of the hebrew language yeah right so he really equates those two things together and one of the other things that happens at this time is of course that ham's son canaan seizes the land that was originally fell to the sons of shem by lot so there's this earlier a little earlier on in the story after the flood there's this this place place where basically they're they're drawing lots for for which son of noah goes where right and the land of basically the holy land lant falls to the descendants of shem and then canaan seizes it for himself yeah and he when he seizes it for himself this this basically everybody says don't do that you're going to be punished by god right and so this is setting up like the conquest right in in in the book of joshua and also the curse of ham in gen in genesis in jubilees it's associated with with this so yeah okay so then the kind of like to close out the jubilees kind of babel narrative i mentioned abraham so abraham in jubilees comes just a little bit after the tower of babel there are actually other traditions that are a little bit later and when i say a little bit later i still mean you know first second century that will will will have abraham actually present at the time of the building of the tower of babylon oh really yeah yeah and and like have him interacting with nimrod and so like when he destroys his father's idols he gets haul before nimrod and he's going to be executed but then god delivers him and all this other stuff this is in jubilee no that's in that's in uh jer the yeah we're talking about earlier but anyway yeah so that's so there are other tr there are other traditions that will place him like basically present at the fall of the tower of b of babel but that's not in jubilees jubilees has him coming on like just maybe a little bit after but certainly as a as a kind of like a contemporary of nimrod and of all these other people yeah yeah yeah so because of his piety we are told that abraham that god sends an angel to open abraham's mouth and ears so that he can understand hebrew which is the language of the heavenly law so one of the main ideas of jubilees is that when the law is given to moses god's not just like making it up like that that the law like when the torah is given to moses and all the the worship and all the things that that he's giving he's giving christ is giving to moses what's already in heaven right that's a like it's a it's so the law is written on heavenly tablets first and then he gives those to moses the law that that even the this is a little bit of a spoiler for my talk but even the feasts even the feasts of the of the old tabernacle and we would actually say of the church were already things being celebrated in heaven for the jubilees that are then given to humans because it's way to participate in the heavenly order and this is why jubilees is like really obsessed with the idea of the calendar and all this other stuff so so so basically there's already this idea that in some ways the feast are heavenly feasts yes but right wow this is my talk oh sorry no it's okay it's okay well it's a really great it's amazing really cool it's really cool stuff please come to the symbolic world conference or buy the virtual ticket or something because i'm gonna i'm going to tell you some things that are going to be really really really cool so yeah people got to come but i want to say one thing about about the idea just just before we continue because the idea of the the wind blowing down the tower and the wind scattering i think it's important to understand it it's related to the idea of symbolism the way we talked about it which is the position of things that that ontologically there's a there's a place where they are and a kind of map think about it that way and sometimes the the effect or the relationship can even be opposite they can even be the contrary to one to the other but if you understand their place and you can see what's happening so right the idea that the spirit is blown into the in gathering of the dust in order to create adam right that's the origin of the of of man and then you can imagine that you could think about it like either god takes the breath out right and then the dust goes back to dust but it still works if you think god also blows on it and then scatters the the dust and so but it's it really is about the idea that god's breath and god's spirit is what is holding or scattering the the the phenomena and anything that has identity it's like basically it's it's it's in god's will that all things are held together you know so i have to go off script here because you're talking about this and i feel like i feel like we should talk about the crows okay so in the book of jubilees in between actually in the the trans transitory passage like coming the transition from talking about the tower of babel to talking about abraham we get crows and let's see here so when when when tara uh or tera abraham's father when he's born it is marked by a devastation of crows it says and prince masta this is the devil essentially right sent crows and birds so that they might eat the seed which was being sewn in the earth in order to spoil the earth so that they might rob mankind of their labors before they plowed the seed the crows picked it off the surface of the earth and therefore he called them called him tayra because the the crows and birds were impoverishing them and they ate their seed and the years began being barren because of the birds and they ate all of the fruit of the trees from the groves if they were ever able to save a little from all the fruit of the earth in their days it was with great effort so then abraham is born and abraham is born and he is born with uh uh he's pious to the point that even when he was two weeks old you know that he refuses to worship the idols right and it says that he began to pray to the creator of all so that he might save him from the straying of the sons of men and so that his portion might not fall into strin after pollution and scorn and then the next part is abraham versus the crows which i think is maybe you know not something most of us woke up this morning thinking about i mean i did because i was getting ready for this video and i was like we're probably not going to talk about the crows because it's a little off topic but then you started talking about the scattering and and this is clearly what's going on here right and so so basically what happens is that abram when he goes out he when he's 14 years old he is he is trying to plant and the crows are coming after him and they're trying to get the seed and he's he's scaring them away and eventually what he does is he comes up with a way to plant the seed and he does this through a use of techy right and so i mean this is the other kind of thing that's going on is the in jubilees as an enoch right the the technology comes from like the demons but then there are these uses of technology that are like counter to the activity of the demons i'll give you another example is that earlier on when noah is like dealing with all the demons that are plaguing his family he's basically given the knowledge of how to use herbs from the earth to counteract the basically the diseases that the demons are so he's given like pharmaca right you know which is like medicine but also sorcery right and and and so this is one of the things that noah is given this knowledge to essentially counteract what the demons are doing i assume it was essential oils but anyway anyway homeopathy is what it was yeah homeopathy so now abraham what it the way that abraham solves this is that in the first year of the fifth week abram taught those who were making the implements for oxin the skilled carpenters and they made implements above the ground facing the handle of the plow so that they might place seed upon it and the seed would go down from within it onto the point of the plow and it would be hidden in the earth and therefore they were not afraid of the crows and they did likewise upon all the plow handles above the ground and they sewed and tilled all of the earth just as abram commanded them and therefore they were not afraid of the birds and so this basically solves the crow problem that's a really i mean it's a really interesting image because again we can see how this structure right and i mentioned this before but the idea that heaven is only good right yes sometimes heaven is dangerous because it takes meaning away right it takes the seed it takes the seed away from the from the earth that's a good example but sometimes that's a good thing that god does that to destroy a world for example when he takes elijah and he takes enoch when he takes enoch away from the earth he's basically saying all right i'm gonna take the best away from you guys sorry i'm taking the seed out and now the thing is going to crumble it's like i'm taking the breath out of a person i'm taking the the the saint out of the world so that now the world will will crumble that's what happen with elijah too there's there's a people forget that one of the names for the enemy is the prince and power of the air yeah right and and that's clearly i mean that's what's going on with with masy here which is the the name of the enemy in this passage right is that he's he sends the crows right which are which are of the air right and so they're they're heavenly in that way but then also crows are you know they they eat dead things you know yeah which also has an interesting connection to the story of elijah but anyway it's right but it's it's like we could go right we all right let's go back to babel here all right so we'll go back to babel all right so the last thing that i wanted to mention here is basically right after this incident because of abraham's piety so he's fighting against the work of the works of the evil one right and he's refusing to worship the idols and so on and so forth that god opens his ears and his mouth so that he can understand hebrew and when he does this he's able to read the books of his father so his father tara has the books which are b is basically the law of god and they're in hebrew and of course these have been basically been passed down from enoch but terara can't read them because he can't read hebrew and he's worshiping idols right and so basically this gives abram the secret knowledge which is actually the knowledge of the calendar it's the knowledge of the feasts which he's supposed to uh celebrate it's the knowledge of circumcision and all these other things that this this is going to give him that knowledge so that he can essentially rightly order the world and one of the things that i want to mention here when we talk about abraham's mouth and ears being opened so that he can understand hebrew right that uh and again the lord of spirits guys have done a whole bunch of stuff on this but the sort of the last thing you do in the ancient world when you build a temple is to there's a a a basically a perform a ritual to open the nostrils of the of the idol and basically so that the spirit of the god that you're worshiping can inhabit it and there are examples we have a like basically a liturgy for this from ancient eg egypt for instance but but and and of course you can draw a lot of parallels to like the creation of the world in genesis with man being the final thing that happens and god breathes into him and opens his nostrils right so hears abraham's mouth and ears being opened so that he can essentially become the full fal point for the worship of the one true god right and then and then when he does this when when this happens he is able to and it's the same it's exactly the same thing as him being able to save the seed right because what he ends up doing is is now there's this this this hidden seed which is the law of god which has been hidden and lost and forgotten but he's able to actually use that to begin to rightly order the world and then that basically is the introduction to abram and from there it goes into the story of abram as you basically know it from genesis although with a lot more sort of calendar stuff thrown in so with all of this said with everybody kind of thinking about along these terms what i want to do is talk really briefly about pentecost now pentecost is shot it's one of the it's the feast of the first fruits it's one of the old testament feasts that we continue to celebrate in the church today and again a little bit of a spoiler here but if you read in jubilees you'll see that they were celebrating this in heaven first which is which is going to be any there's a lot of interesting things there that we'll talk about but the feast of the first fruits right is one of the most important feasts in jubilees it's commanded and celebrated first in heaven and essentially it celebrates the renewal of a covenant so the first time that it's commanded for humans is after noah offers the sacrifice following the following the the the flood right so he gets gets out of the ark and offers a bunch of animals to sacrifice and god smells the sacrifice and is pleasing to him and he institutes the feast of the first fruits for those on earth but it's the idea is the angels are already celebrating it in heaven right there's no hint of that in scripture though this is really from jubilee the idea that that yes that pentecost is when noah offered the sacrifice well pentecost you could say historically used in the worst sense possible but you could say like historically it celebrates the giving of the law because this is what i mean this is what pentecost celebrates is the giving of the law to the the people of israel but but remember that the there's a no adct law there's a there's yeah yeah there's there's there's already a covenant right there's already a law and a covenant that's given to noah and basically the whole premise of jubilees is that when moses is given the law it's not like some new thing yeah but that is actually a revelation of who god has always been and and by the way this this is still as christians this is how we understand the law not as something that is prescriptive but as something that is descriptive right something that describes this is what god is like and if you sort of align yourself on this pattern then your world will cohere right and if you don't then you'll be scattered or the land will vomit you out etc etc right and so and so it's celebrated again in jubilees with the giving of the law which which you have to remember that is is the frame narrative for all of jubilees is the word giving the law which includes genesis genesis is part of the law it's one of the five books of the law right the word giving the law to moses on si and so everything is told in the first person or but it's the angel speaking right the angel of the lord he's he's telling and then i did this and then i told noah this and then i told enoch this and then i told moses you know so on and so so so that's the frame of jubilees is is the actual giving of the law so the thing that pentecost celebrates is the giving of the law which is what jubilees is is all about and so it's this really significant feast all throughout the book of jubilees and it's a at some it's sometimes referred to as like a the two-fold celebration or the celebration that has two aspects and it's this is as far as i've been able to find this is never explained in jubilees but i think it's something like that the giving of the the covenant is given twice your law is given twice first to no and then to moses something like that but all this to say it's the most important feast in jubilees and uh we get some anyway there are some really fun connections that again i'm going to save for my talk but essentially what i think everybody knows or maybe not everybody knows but everybody could know you know if you go to church on the night you know saturday night before pentecost right is that pentecost is an inversion of babel so pentecost is the first of feast of first fruits but the church sees it and has really always treated it and seen it i'm going to ar all the way back to the book of acts has seen it as a reverse of the curse of babel yeah so the apostles are all gathered together where are they gathered they're gathered in a city on a mountain in an upper room right and at the top of that room they are creating an altar a focus point right and that is that they are gathered together i'm going to say to serve the liturgy there's a very anent tradition that is still you can still find in like the malankara churches like the syrian churches the coptic church and so on and so forth there's a very ancient tradition that when the church is gathered together in the upper room you know it's and it's an upper room it's not a basement they're gathered together in the upper room to serve the liturgy u that when they're gathered together that they are serving the divine liturgy for the first time now somebody out there wants to say well we don't know we don't have a single liturgy written down down from the first century blah blah blah i'm this is the tradition though this is the tradition and certainly you know the liturgy of st james who was the first bishop of jerusalem is most people agree is the oldest christian liturgy that we have and so the the tradition is that they're serving the liturgy together for the very first time since the resurrection and that the lord appeared after his resurrection to james and some of the other apostles and essentially gave them the liturgy so st james is serving the liturgy there as the first bishop in jerusalem in the upper room and during the anaura which is the moment in the liturgy when we call the holy spirit down upon the gifts on the altar that that's when the holy spirit comes down at pentecost and this is still still in our liturgy by the way like the right before the anaf the priest prays and you can't hear it if you're out in the nave because it's said quietly but the priest prays you know oh lord as you sent down your holy spirit on the apostles right take not take him not away from us and so on and so forth right and so there's this so there's this calling down of the holy spirit with a reference to pentecost that happens right before that part of the liturgy so anyway if even if you're you know you want to argue it's impossible to prove any of this like textually or whatever i'm just saying this is the tradition and it's a tradition that is still implicit in the the liturgy of all of the eastern churches okay and and so as he calls down the holy spirit the holy spirit descends and he descends not just on the gifts but upon the whole church which is by the way it's what we always ask for send down your holy spirit upon us and upon these gifts set forth right and so the holy spirit comes down and how does he come down he comes down as a wind right which is this really important aspect of the babel story as it's told in jubilees the holy spirit comes down as a wind and tongues of fire right the which is which is i mean they become candles i don't know how it's to say it right the the tongues of fire come and they hover over the heads of each of the apostles and over the head of the mother of god who is also present there in the book of acts and they make each of the apostles into a tower or a candle or a pillar like however you want to think about it right that's exactly what is is happening there and then what happens is that the tongues the confusion of tongues is resolved and it's very tricky in the text actually how it is res because it sounds at one point like the apostles are just speaking in you know probably aramaic but then everybody's hearing it in their own tongue but then some people can't understand what's going on and those people who can't understand what's going on they just hear what they hear babble that's right they hear babel and they accuse the apostles of being drunk and i will just say this is another video but there is some weird stuff going on with pentecost and the symbolism of like pentecost and its relation to drunkenness i mean i'll just give an example so the pentecost is a celebration of the giving of the law and the giving of the covenant right so the first time in jubilees that this happens is after the flood so noah noah plants a vine and gets drunk and he gets drunk and then the second time that this happens is on siai moses receives the law and he comes down the mountain and everybody's drunk yeah right and then the third time is when the holy spirit comes and he gives us the law of flesh in our own hearts and the apostles began to prophesy and the people who can't understand them and this is a weird thing about the miracle like it's not just that some that it's not that everybody can understand them the people whose hearts are ready they understand in their own tongue but for everybody else it sounds like babel and those people again accuse them of drunkenness so there's something about this dissent like drunkenness at the bottom i don't know this is this is yeah no but the way to understand it is to understand what pentecost is doing is something similar to what the crucifixion is doing is that it is collapsing all the symbolism into one place and it's basically gathering it it together in a way that both resolves the whole question but also does it in a way that if you try to capture it in your mind you really struggle to hold all the pieces together because like you said it's like is the holy spirit scattering them the answer is yes yeah because he's going to scatter them to the four corners of the world yeah and is the holy spirit gathering them the answer is yes of course they are because they're all speaking in one mind and in one in one voice but everybody's hearing them in their particular voice and so what it's doing and also there's confusion on the edges and so it's actually a cosmic image of the whole thing simultaneously both the uniting of babel and the splintering of babel and the the confusion of it but all done in a manner that transforms it into into a proper hierarchy like an actual true hierarchy of unity in the togetherness of multiplicity in the way in which it contact it it relates to the particular but then even room for a kind of chaos and fluidity on the edge so it's like it it's recasting the entire world in that moment and in this we we see the way that the saints become the pillars that are now upholding the world and uniting heaven to earth together and like each one of them becomes that little image of the candle or the tower or the mountain or or whatever it is right and even like in our our hymnography in the orthodox church we often refer to the mother of god as being like the the the the you know the uncut mountain right like like like as being the mountain of god you know and then you know the b basically the place where god makes himself known the place where he's manifest and but every single member of the church is supposed to be that right and so you have that happening at pentecost i'll just kind of close this out by saying two things one is that thinking back to abraham's mouth and ears being opened so that he can understand the law of god right that this is really this is what's going on but now it's not just hebrew right it's the idea that there's there's a it's not about the language right it's but it's about the content right um but our mouths and ears are open so that we then become the sons of abraham m right that's the that's the kind of the key image there and then the other thing that i want to do is is just to to show that the i mean at this i don't see how you could like see see the the connection the very careful order of the story in the book of acts and say that this is that the connection to babel is arbitrary but in case anybody was wondering did the ancient church make these connections as well i have this is this is my big big p pentecost arian which is like all of our our hymns the ancient hymns and and and the stuff around p and pentecost is our essentially our most ancient hymnography in the orthodox church we're talking about most of this stuff going back to third and fourth century okay and i'll just read a couple of hymns this these are from these are from vespers i'll read one from vespers and one one from matens for the feast of pentecost says of old the tongues were confounded because of the audacity in the building of the tower but now the tongues are made wise for the sake of the glory of divine knowledge so there's a connection there with with the divine knowledge and that goes back to this i'm going to argue that goes back to this tradition with abraham there god condemned the impious because of their offense and here christ hath enlightened the fishermen by the spirit at the time the confusion at that time the confusion of tongues was rought for punishment but now the concord of tongues hath been inaugurated for the salvation of souls and then also the hymns even in greek they do make a lot of puns between the confusion of tongues and the tongues of fire yeah right that's like people really like that pun in the ancient world it says once when he descended and confounded the tongues the most high divided the nations and when he divided the tongues of fire he called all men into unity so like there was like one tongue and then division and now there's a division of tongues because this the tongues of fire but that actually brings us into unity he called all men into unity with one accord we glorify the all holy spirit so there's actually a lot more in the hymnography of pent but i thought i would just read a couple of examples to show that how it's really what i'm arguing for is how we have always like in our tradition this is how we've we've always read the scriptures right and this is going to be basically what we're going to be talking about at the conference at least in my track is we're going to be looking at some other ways that the church has always read and understood genesis and the way that it actually affects the way that we still think about god who he is how we worship him what it means to serve him today so anyway that's my that's my pitch for coming to the summit or at least get the ticket and get the viral ticket so thanks richard this is awesome i mean i see a lot of amazing things in the future everybody you know richard and i already as we try to get through this logistical chaos we're all already planning out all these wonderful stories of how to connect the ancient stories with modern storytelling tropes with you know we won't we won't spoil what we're going to do but it's going to be it's going to be wonderful so so everybody thanks for your attention thanks for supporting everything we do hopefully we'll see some of you at the summit and if not there will also be online places to discuss the summit if you get the virtual ticket like we'll have spaces where people can and i think that we're gonna do like some kind of like a big live yeah we'll do a live thing after at the end yeah so all right everybody thanks for your attention thanks everyone bye bye
