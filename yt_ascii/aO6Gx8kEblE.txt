where are you implanting this into it into another device what are you implanting this so it's actually going into your ear in your ear how you're pushing it in so i could direct your attention to the first slide here's the surgery location oh that's a bad first line imagine somebody walks in the first slide of their pitch deck is implant injection coordinates ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar you know the thing i'm your host coffee zilla and yes we haven't made many uploads this week which means i'm going back to basics i was going back to the reactions the thing that built this channel and i think i found the perfect one to bring back the reactions with shark tank ladies and gentlemen season one episode one the man the myth the guy who started it all i don't know if you guys have seen season one episode one of shark tank you won't see any other youtubers doing this it's the ionic ear now already you can kind of tell the time period of shark tank from where this is from because of the potato camera quality this is before they all became rich off of cameo like kevin o'leary so let's watch a little together huh next up is darren johnson who hopes his innovative new product will send the sharks into a frenzy the music's tight what the wait a second you you they they tricked us they just went from a regular shot of kevin o'leary to what is this my name is darren johnson and i'm here today to explain the ionic year investment opportunity how much money are you looking for i'm looking for a million dollars for a 15 percent ownership stake and oh yeah you're never gonna get it dude i've seen the shark tank episodes first of all it's kind it's not even about how good your idea is they always want like 80 of your company if they're gonna give you over like a hundred thousand dollars if you've seen a couple episodes of shark tank you know that's true anytime you say fifteen percent they go nah i'll take eighty percent of your company and every dollar you've made since then what we have developed is a implantable bluetooth technology if you are one of the 40 percent of the users of bluetooth technology that currently own it you know that just the natural rhythm blocking many times and perspiration the technology will fall off your ear if you answer the call too quickly many times the bluetooth device will become dislodged that's why we decided to screw it directly into your ear hey this guy might actually be onto something i want to say that from the get-go this is 2015. he might be the visionary we all needed because this indeed was a problem i don't know if the answer was boring a hole in your ear like it sounds like he's thinking but it's interesting i'm sorry where are you implanting this into a into another device what are you implanting this is actually [music] in your ear how you're pushing it in so i could direct your attention to the first slide this is just underneath the ear the surgery location this is this is surgery you would be under anesthesia oh my god [music] you guys are so close-minded please let him finish okay you're about to create a super villain laughing this guy off state he's going to go oh yeah you think that's funny two years later everyone's mind controlled by some ionic ear device at the base of the device is a battery within its center or bluetooth electronics and at its tip a microphone a speaker and an ac charging port stop right there back to surgery 101. darren we're gonna we're gonna operate on people yes we are we're gonna stick something so casual dude this guy first of all i don't believe he's a doctor don't believe he's like yes human test subjects trial one yes we are darren we're gonna we're gonna operate on people yes we are we're gonna stick something in near their brain we may not puncture their you know what is pretty disturbing and it freaks me out i'm already out how do i charge it every night so we have you what this is an apple watch you got to plug your ear in the ac charging port can you stick that needle in your head every night to charge it okay i was with you till then darren i'm out i don't know about you guys what do you think how many of you are still in do a quick poll i'd say probably 50 of you are still in he just inserted a thumbtack into the guy's ear even the model doesn't look pleased the satellite base station enters your ear canal needle in your head every night to charge it yes you would okay you don't think oh my god are you seriously like seriously i need like a small q-tip cylinder you know what half the problem is like the first slide in implant injection coordinates you'd never say that if you're actually going to make an idea that works you'd say something like device location injection implant coordinates all things that sound horrible this guy's like q-tip bass station this guy's like talking about like q-tips docking into your skull this is not exactly a friendly thing now if say you're a billionaire and you just say like oh yeah in order to interface with ai we need to stick something in your ear then everyone loves you and fawns over you but if you're this guy you just don't have the it's he's not pitching it right what happens if you missed that so that you can't miss it you can't miss sure there's going to be safety features built into it darren i need to be clear on this before i write you off as a nut job which i'm trying not to do i have to understand a team of doctors implanted in your neck below your ear sure and then you stick something in your ear in the evening something what convinces you something that's the size of a q-tip or s'more something to charge it everywhere you have a cylinder that delivers ac charge at a very trickle lower knife yeah yes yes we will plug you up to your house circuitry don't worry we'll have a breaker installed we can't miss this guy is the best first guest ever i can see now why the episode was a huge success that the show is a huge success i don't know if you guys have seen this before i had never seen this episode how do i do an upgrade i go back and get another operation you would have to go in and receive an additional operation do you see a problem with that sure there there's certainly i have a problem with that i am out this is the weirdest damn thing i ever heard now wait wait i feel like they're not actually addressing the true problem with this idea so far you have to understand that he's asking people to com have two surgeries dock up to a base station why all because what's the actual probably something the headphones fall out of your ear sometimes that's the problem it's just not too big of a problem darren i don't know what what the issue is here the first time that you heard of breast implants what did you think i love it right okay but as a woman hey okay they're not a plan to get into your johnson okay this is not an enlargement idea i don't know what this guy's thinking they're two completely different things what do you want to do or would it take market acceptance and a lot of testing and a lot of medical treatment before except us in the room about this yes i have and you're still walking around free i see sure don't call me i'll call you i'm out okay darren here is here's insanity here's genius you're somewhere nevertheless i'm out wow that was actually pretty nice i would have just i thought he was going to go here's the saturday here's genius this is you off somewhere off screen because you're fired and you're out thank you [music] well that's it did he actually go on to create create it is is that a real company the ionic gear appears to have never taken off as the cover you don't say the company has no website there is no record of the surgery ever taking place so it's likely the idea failed and darren gave up on it many of the sharks mentioned it as the craziest idea on the tank including barbara on the 100th episode wow so dara basically knocked it out of the park from day one listen i gotta say he's got my vote not as a good idea or an investable idea by the way i mean as the craziest idea ever as on shark tank well that about does it for this episode anyway i hope you enjoyed have a lovely day i'll see you in the next one [music] what a shame what a shame you're a fraud are you the same as so you're saying no you're not
