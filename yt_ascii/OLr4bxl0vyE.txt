hey guys here are the tip and tech headquarters we like to pretty much automate well everything and today we're gonna do just that with python aren't we bro well this is a little awkward considering it is just me justin hey friends today we are going to be doing some really fun things with python to automate our lives now these are some simple things that you can do with python to really make your life easier these are ideas that you can build on your own or on their own or you can also implement and build into a larger project i absolutely love building things or tinkering tinkering with python because it is so versatile you can build things that really solve real world problems or your real world problems and it's a lot of fun all right let's dive into some really fun projects well let's scratch the word projects these are more really cool things you can do with python and build projects around them alright let's go where we're going here so calm [music] all right ready one two three no okay serious okay the first one i want to talk about is creating our own google search with python now you're probably thinking well tiff why wouldn't i just open up google well friend because we like to do everything as little work as possible and this is a fun way to really have this python script that you can just query and get back your search instead of having to open up google more so in actuality or reality where i think this would come in handy is if you are building an application that you want to implement a google search functionality within that application so as you can see on screen here i am inside rebel or the forever debate is it repel it or reckle regardless so let's go ahead and get started so with rebel unlike say vs code we don't need to install packages by doing pip install the package we can go here down to where it says packages and ensure that you have installed for this one google once it's installed go back to your main.pi and then let's start typing so from this we are doing from google search import ant and we are just importing the search then we are going to have a query and this query will be essentially whatever you are going to be asking google so for this case let's say vest courses on it's course on coding let's just stick with the tech theme here once again this could be whatever you want and then let's loop over the results so for i in search see this is really cool i have installed as you can see or not installed but i pay for ghostwriter on rebel so it'll actually help us write our code which is pretty cool even though it wrote it wrong but anyways search query and then let's do t l d equals c o dot i n let's also give it the number that we are going to have it returns a number will equal say 10 in this case and it will stop at once it hits 10 as well and pause equals two all right perfect now let's go print i which will return us the results query what does it look like here name and define search that would make sense now people always ask when i do these tinkering or building videos or like tiff what are you looking at when you're typing well i have this script of what i am working off of i don't have all of these things perfectly memorized to a t what we are building so i built it and then i record it that's a process all right it is updating packages what do we have here do you want import names search from google search from google search import search query best courses on coding for i in search creativity i don't like us but just install the package yeah google okay remove let's try this again here this is real-time coding tinkering whatever you want to call it it's very slow install i don't think it's the code code seems beating me it's so simple we will see them with the cpu it's not happy [music] are you ready i think they're ready i think we're ready yay pretty cool so you can see here now we have the 10 best courses on coding we are getting the results google is returning so this is super cool very simple package google that you can build around but it makes it really fun that you can add it to an application think of getting this list or this result and being able to display it on your application or use it in varying ways okay the next thing we are going to do is convert an image into a pdf and this is something i feel like i always am finding the need for maybe a company is sending me what they think is a document and i need to sign it but it's in the format of jpeg or png and i'm like i need to just send me the pdf but for whatever reason it always seems to be an issue so what i built here or what we are going to build is a very simple script using image to pdf which is a package in python that will allow you to convert images into pdfs let's get into it as you can see here i am using the package image to pdf and then all we need to do is let's go with open and once again you can see ghost rider here we are going to be using this image here image.png so let's update this ghostwriter is cool but it also has its flaws i find with image openness f perfect and then let's add an rv here perfect let's see if he knows what it's doing image equals f dot read yeah actually it's pretty close to what i had then let's do pdf file i guess it could be file a pdf let's call it pdf bytes equals image to pdf convert pass in the image yes correct and then with open output pdf which is taking the image and outputting it as a pdf which is also correct this is scary how good this is and then yes write pdf bytes which is coming from here all right let's see the new pdf generated or if it does work i don't even know why i do know but hopefully and there you go you can see now we have output pdf so this is super handy to have on on file or whatever you want to call it on hand with you for when you want to convert these images into pdfs so you can see here i don't know if it might take a while to load this is the image i mean look at mr mugs he's so cute and i wanted to convert to a pdf if we click here it might take a bit longer it's gonna be super large come on come on and then there we go it's really zoomed in you can see here we have the pdf version of it number three on the list is make your own translator and this is something with python that is super easy to do as well but i always wanted to build my own translator application that you can then use when you are traveling or different things like that communicating with different individuals who might not speak the same language as you so let's go ahead and build our own the first thing we need to do is import the translate package and let's go into here actually fun fact if you simply just run the code after you've completed it it will install packages for you but i find sometimes it doesn't work completely so let's just go ahead and take the extra two seconds and install it hello i'm gonna go get a coffee or something while we're waiting this is taking a long time actually while it's waiting what do you prefer coffee or tea i feel like i've become too much of a coffee person which is becoming a problem i might have to go into coffee detox but i really don't want to all right let's see if it's ready well we'll let it still install we'll continue on so next up let's declare a translator [applause] that will equal translator and we're going to pass it i'm not doing this right import translate we're doing this all backwards here from translate import ant translator thank you very much here we go translator equals translator and then we are going to pass in the to the language let's say two lang for example we are going to do spanish okay okay and then if we want to find the final translation translation equals translator coming from here translate we want to translate this hello how are you i'm fine thanks yeah you know what let's leave it at that i like that that's that's pretty good all right now let's go ahead and print out the translation it's my first time running this i tested some of the other ones but i haven't tested this once let's see whoa hola como estas estoy bien gracias sen for all my spanish speaking people out there i am so sorry i feel like i'm butchering this but it's so fun so you can easily translate say this is for spanish we could do hindi english whatever you prefer all right those are three really interesting and fun things that you can do with python it's as i mentioned at the beginning of this video the possibilities with python really feel endless and they're so fun we we built these small simple things that you can either use on their own to automate your life throughout varying ways or you can also build into further projects which is really fun way too speaking of that i need to find a way to automate coffee to like inject in my system every day how do i do that i need help someone have a tutorial for that all right make sure to hit that subscribe button leave in the comments other videos you want to see around career coding personal any of the above and i'll see you all soon thanks everyone [applause] [music] foreign
