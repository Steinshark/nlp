hello everyone and welcome if you have two vehicles and one is getting 20 miles per gallon while the other is getting 30 miles per gallon which one has the more efficient engine well if you pick either of these answers you could be wrong if it is a moped that's only getting 30 miles per gallon then it probably doesn't have a very efficient engine and if it were a semi truck that was somehow getting 20 miles per gallon well then it has an insanely efficient engine so using mpg is not a way of comparing engine efficiency and the way you compare efficiency is looking at brake specific fuel consumption so what is brake specific fuel consumption well it's simply your mass flow rate of your fuel divided by how much power you're making in other words if you were to take an engine dyno and you hook up the engine to it and you measured how much fuel is flowing into that engine per second you divide that by how much power are you actually making in that moment and that gives you your brake specific fuel consumption so it's the great equalizer it doesn't matter if your engine is small large it doesn't matter if it's turbocharged naturally aspirated what you're looking at with a certain amount of fuel how much power can you make with that fuel and so you know this a great example of this in the real world is looking at formula one cars so formula one cars have different horsepowers right but they're all limited in how much fuel they can put into the engine their maximum flow rate of fuel that can go into that engine is a hundred kilograms per hour however if they're able to make more power with that specific amount of fuel they have a more efficient engine thus they are making more power and thus they have a strategic advantage so it's a way of comparing efficiency by looking at how much fuel is going in versus how much power is coming out so what are the units of brake specific fuel consumption and how do we know how efficient an engine is based on this number so we're looking at a mass flow rate in other words grams per hour divided by power in this example using kilowatts as power so if you take that grams per hour the hour goes to the bottom and then you have grams per kilowatt hour which gives you your efficiency this is the common way that brake specific fuel consumption is discussed a certain number of grams per kilowatt hour now to many of us we don't use grams per kilowatt hour as a frequent unit and we are more familiar with efficiency as a percentage 50 efficient 75 percent efficient things like that so how does this number translate into an efficiency percentage well efficiency is output over input in this example we have the inverse of our break specific fuel consumption divided by the heating value and now you're wondering well what's the heating value well this book does a very good job this thurber like dynamics book does a very good job of defining heating value so i'm simply going to recite that the amount of heat released when a unit amount of fuel at room temperature is completely burned and the combustion products are cooled to the room temperature so what does that mean well look at our combustion chamber right here so we have air and fuel going in we have one kilogram of fuel going in at 25 degrees c we have air going in at 25 degrees c we mix all that up and we combust it and then we measure the amount of heat released from this combustion chamber when all of the byproducts then leave at the same temperature that they entered at so all of our exhaust is leaving at 25 degrees c which of course is unrealistic that doesn't happen with combustion engines but all of that energy is lost as heat and we measure how much total energy came from that one kilogram of fuel and it turns out that number for gasoline pure gasoline not the like ethanol mixes that we use pure gasoline around 44 000 kilojoules per kilogram in other words about .0122 kilowatt hours per gram so when we go back to our equation here what you can see is if you take the inverse of your break specific fuel consumption essentially what you're looking at is how much youthful work did we get out of that one gram of fuel and then we're dividing that by how much energy does that one gram of fuel actually have in it and so as an example we can look at you know an engine might have a brake specific fuel consumption of 300 grams per kilowatt hour well one divided by 300 divided by our 0.0122 kilowatt hours per gram that will give us an efficiency of around 27 a really efficient gasoline engine might have something like 225 grams per kilowatt hour for its break specific fuel consumption and that will give you a efficiency of about 36 percent now a common way of visualizing brake specific fuel consumption is to look at a brake specific fuel consumption map versus your torque and versus your rpm so essentially torque here could be your engine load as a percentage from zero percent to 100 or looking at your brake mean effective pressure we're labeling it here as torque so when you're at these higher torque values that means your wide open throttle at these lower torque values you have a very restricted throttle so you're not letting much air pass through and so here on the bottom we simply have rpm low rpm all the way up to high rpm and you can see these little islands on this plot with different colors and so these islands represent efficiency zones so within this tiny little island right here this is our most efficient zone where our brake specific fuel consumption is just 200 grams per kilowatt hour and then as you go out 250 300 all the way to 450 grams per kilowatt hour so you want your engine to always be operating and it's most efficient of a region as possible so in this case it's somewhere in the lower ish rpm zone with a higher ish torque and then as you go out from that as you go to higher rpms or or lower torque values you can see your brake specific fuel consumption goes down meaning the amount of fuel required to make an amount of horsepower increases so why would this region you know low rpm low torque not be very efficient well you've got high pumping losses because your throttle is almost closed and you have more time for heat losses because you're at a really low rpm so your pistons aren't moving that fast there's more time for that heat to escape to those cylinder walls versus if you get to a really high rpm well now you've got really high friction losses and you also have high pumping losses so a really inefficient zone and then as you get up into these higher rpm higher torque regions well then you start to use a richer air fuel mixture that's great for making power but it is not very efficient and then you also of course have those high friction losses so the sweet zone is somewhere where you have your throttle fairly wide open you know not completely but but a good amount of load on the engine and your rpm is not that high so if you take a look at a plot of rpm versus brake specific fuel consumption there's some sweet zone right too high too much friction losses too low too much heat losses through those cylinder walls there's some sweet zone there and then you can shift this plot up or down depending on the compression ratio so if you use a higher compression ratio you shift that down meaning you're using less fuel to make a certain amount of power your engine is more efficient you want your brake specific fuel consumption as low as possible if you look at brake specific fuel consumption versus your air fuel ratio well if you start to go too rich well then you're just wasting fuel right there's more fuel in that cylinder than can actually be burned so that's just leaving out the exhaust and you're not getting an efficiency benefit from that but there is a power benefit to doing so if you go really lean well then you may not be able to burn all of the fuel injected into that engine so that's also going to be wasteful not going to be super efficient now that doesn't account for all combustion strategies out there there are some efficient lean combustion strategies out there but just as a general rule of thumb you know somewhere close to stoichiometric you're going to have really efficient combustion and then looking back at this now we can kind of look at well what about if we were to just be driving along at 55 miles per hour right if you're driving along at 55 miles per hour you could choose hey which gear do i want to be in you could be in sixth gear which might put you somewhere around right there you could be in fifth gear which could put you somewhere around right there fourth gear third gear or second gear and so all of these are making the exact same amount of horsepower you're at a low load at a higher rpm makes a certain amount of horsepower let's say you know it's 30 horsepower that you're making as you're cruising down that highway same amount of power in third gear same amount of power in fourth gear it's just your trading load for rpm right and so you have these constant power lines that will come kind of across like that and what you can see is if you're operating in sixth gear meaning a low rpm and a fairly high engine load it's much more efficient it's within this really efficient zone and so as a result you will get better fuel economy now if your car has an mpg readout you can actually get a tiny glimpse into what your brake specific fuel consumption map actually looks like by holding a constant speed and then changing gears i've done this in my crosstrek and what you'll notice is that as i go from second to third to fourth to fifth gear while driving at a constant speed rpm of course drops with each increasing gear engine load increases with each gear and because this puts the engine at a higher load with a lower rpm putting in a more efficient spot on the brake specific fuel consumption map i get better fuel economy very neat to see it in the real world now if you start looking at the brake specific fuel consumption of various engines out there what you'll notice is some of the most efficient engines out there are massive so why is it that these massive engines are so efficient and so if you look at brake specific fuel consumption versus displacement you'll see that that brake specific fuel consumption decreases as that displacement gets larger and so there's a couple reasons for this first of all bigger means you have a lower surface area to volume ratio so that means you have less heat loss to those cylinder walls to the piston to the cylinder head and also larger engines tend to operate at lower rpm which means you know they don't have as high friction losses at those lower rpm so how do we know that as the volume of that cylinder increases the surface area to volume ratio decreases and so we're just going to look at a simple example here using a cube because the math is very simple with a cube and so looking at a cube and we're simply going to increase the size of that cube of course all the sides of this cube have the same length width height it's all the same number right and so if you're trying to measure the surface area of a cube you simply have x squared that gives you the area of one you have six squares total so six times x squared that gives you your surface area looking at the volume of a cube it's of course x times x times x so x cubed so let's say x equals one well now our surface area is equal to six times one squared so six our volume is one cubed so one so our surface area to volume ratio is six to one now if x equals 10 well then we have six times 100 that gives us 600 versus 10 cubed that gives us a thousand so now our surface area to volume ratio is 0.6 to 1. and that continues this trend as we go to x equals 100 so we now have an area of 60 000 versus a volume of 1 million so our surface area to volume ratio is now 0.06 to 1. and so you can see that as you increase the size of this cube the same thing happens with the cylinder the ratio of one unit of volume to one unit of surface area you have much less surface area for each unit of volume which in a cylinder that means you have much less surface area where you have that heat contacting and being lost through those cylinder walls and so you have more of that energy going towards producing useful work pushing that piston down and allowing you to make more power now does this mean all you know big v8 engines are more efficient than small four-cylinder engines well no there's many factors that play into the efficiency of an engine but this is one factor that does provide a benefit to larger cylinder engines and also keep in mind let's say you had a two liter inline four cylinder versus a four liter v8 well all of these have half liter cylinders right the cylinders and all of these have the same volume it's the same surface area if you're using the same bore and stroke and so there's not an advantage there simply because you're using more cylinders and in this example they all have the same surface area same volume per cylinder now as far as real world examples some of the most fuel efficient gasoline production engines out there they're going to be getting a brake specific fuel consumption around 200 grams per kilowatt hour that's about a 41 efficiency but you know you can find very large marine diesel engines you know with these massive cylinders and they could be in the 155 to you know 190 gram per kilowatt hour 45 to 55 efficiency so these massive diesels of course diesels having higher compression ratio lower pumping losses but also the help of these big cylinders helping to provide them with a more efficient combustion thus making more power for the same amount of fuel used so pretty neat to compare brake specific fuel consumption and there's also that little test where you can kind of get a glimpse into it on your own car by looking at that mpg readout thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
