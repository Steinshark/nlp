how's it going guys in this video i'm going to be showing you how you can host a script on a server so you don't have to run it on your own computer and in this example i'm going to be running my telegram bot on a server for free online so i won't have to keep my computer open if i want to chat with my telegram bot right now if you have a bot running in a script you're going to have to make sure that your computer is turned on at all times or else of course when you close the computer the bot's not going to work anymore right now i'm running the script and if i say hello the bot's going to respond as normal but of course if i stop this script and i try to talk to my bot over here we're not going to get any response anymore because the script has to be continuously running for any of this to work and that's why one of the main solutions is to host earbot on a server because of course you can buy a second computer but why would you if you can do it for free online but let me show you how we can host this code over here online so i don't have to run it so i don't have to run it on my own computer so the first thing we're going to do is go to a website called python anywhere and this is completely free to use of course there are some limitations to how much you can use for example they have a free cpu usage per day which resets every 24 hours and that gives you 100 seconds of cpu usage and when you run out of that the website kind of slows down your bot a bit but nothing too significant so you can still run this permanently without any major drawbacks unless you're handling millions of users which if you are you might want to upgrade so you can handle that kind of server pressure but for something simple that has a few uses you can absolutely use this for free and it works quite well even with your discord bots but anyways go to pythonanywhere.com and i'm going to leave a link to that in the description box down below and create an account and log in and right now i'm at the dashboard and this is where you should be as well but inside here we can tap on files and we want to create a new file so here it's going to say enter new file name for example hello.pi and i did create hello.pi because i'm a sucker for free ideas but in this one we can type in telegram bot dot pi something simple and tap on new file of course if you have multiple files you're going to have to upload all of them but here we're just going to create a telegram bot in one file to make things simple and it's going to give us this empty window where we can insert our code so i'm going to go back to my script and i'm going to copy all the code it took to make my telegram bot so as you can see it's just a few lines and i'm going to paste it inside this section here now of course we have some packages that we need to install before moving on with the bot so at the bottom there's going to be a section called bash console here and that's what you want to tap on because it's going to create a bash console for us with this script and inside here we can finally use pip install so we need to pip install for example the python dash telegram slash bot and that's the one i'm using and that's the only package i actually need to import to make this work so then tap on enter and it's going to install everything you need for it and most of the requirements are already installed and as soon as that is done we can actually just tap on run over here because i have all of the code inside that and as soon as i tap on run it's going to load it and as you can see right now it's loading it says it's starting up the bot it's polling and it actually responded to my last message because there was a message sent out that it was not able to respond to while the bot was down but now it managed to respond to it in my window over here so now we're hosting it online as you can see the bot is polling which means it is waiting for some input i can even close this window here and i can just play around with my chatbot because now it's going to be hosted online so if i say hello again it's going to respond hey there once again or you can say bye and it probably won't understand that because it literally has two messages to check for i can say something like i love python and i think this will give a nice message back such as remember to subscribe but as you could see it was that simple to host a bot online and this is going to be available 24 7. even if i close my computer it's still going to be running because right now it's hosted on python anywhere but anyways that's actually all i wanted to share in today's video do let me know what you think about this service or whether there's another one you prefer maybe i'll make a video on another hosting service if you find one that's more intuitive more free and more easy than python anywhere i would love to hear about it but with all that being said as always thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next video
