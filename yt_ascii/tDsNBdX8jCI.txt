this was a big win ladies and gentlemen rarely is justice served quickly in the legal system usually you have to wait years to see result but today is an exception and i want to share with you guys because just a week ago we talked about this youtuber atosi getting sued for absolutely insane reasons basically he called out this millionaire crypto youtuber bitboy crypto and got sued because of it what are you doing what did he say that was so wrong well he called him a dirtbag and said you shouldn't listen to him for financial advice which i agree with apparently this was so defamatory that bitboy decided he was going to sue him and wasn't going to stop until atozi had paid him for damages and apparently this lawsuit came while tosi was about to have a kid and to make matters worse he's having to make this emergency response video while his wife is literally going into labor and they're running to the emergency room now i'm not saying bitboy knew about any of this i'm just saying this to show that a toesie was in deep deep trouble and this is why myself and many others made videos about this topic but honestly there wasn't a lot we could do until everything changed because when winnetosie dropped his response video he set up a gofundme for his legal defense which initially raised a few thousand dollars but then bitboy decided to do maybe the dumbest thing possible he decides to mock the fundraiser of the guy that he's suing he says i'm sure they could all borrow ten dollars from their mom's purse to help you out there bud talking of course about otosi's fans and obviously after that things went crazy because atozy's fans and anyone watching from the sideline like realized what this was bitboy was bullying this guy and then mocking him for it like suing you and then mocking you about it and before long and toasty started bringing in tons of donations from everywhere even in a hundred thousand dollar donation from kobe who we've brought on the show before and within like 48 hours a tosi raised 200 000 for his lawsuit to defend himself which suddenly made things a very different story because it's one thing to sue a guy when he doesn't have money to fight you it's a whole other thing to piss off the entire internet and then try to fight a case because in my last video i made it very clear i thought his lawsuit had zero merit but now it was also looking like a tosi didn't have zero dollars anymore and so bitboy started to backtrack but it's important to say bitboy didn't give in quite yet he did double down one time he said quote you can't literally make up lies and accusations about people hate me all you want at the end of the day people will be held accountable so it wasn't actually until bit boy's own like biggest hero like the guy he looks up to came to a toesies defense that he finally buckled and to understand this one you have to understand that bitboy is obsessed with a cryptocurrency called ripple or xrp he calls himself the commander of their xrp army because that's my duty as a supreme leader and commander the xrp army now i have to be clear no one hates this self-title of bitboy more than the xrp fans but basically bitboy makes tons of videos about xrp's legal cases with the sec so imagine his surprise when the cto of ripple comes to a toesies defense david schwartz says quote please identify one specific statement that you can prove is a lie i read your complaint like i did and couldn't find a single one imagine finding out your hero is on the side of the guy you're trying to sue and he responds you know i cannot make specific statements until this is over this wasn't supposed to be you know this whole nonsense and he says i respect you and would love to have this convo i mean just hilarious but david isn't having any of it and he decides to destroy him with this so you're comfortable accusing people of spreading provable lies on twitter but suddenly uncomfortable when asked to show one specific instance of a provable lie i mean guys he's totally right bitboy keeps saying like oh there's all these provable lies but you look at his complaint and there's nothing concrete so finally i guess bitboy got the memo and less than 48 hours after all this became public bitboy decided he was dropping the lawsuit this wasn't supposed to get this far so at this point like i said there is nothing really we can do you know the money is came in on his side the lawsuit was never about money so hopefully you know it told me now that we're gonna be officially dropping this i don't i email my lawyer about 15 minutes where we went on air here so that is gonna be happening now listen guys when he dropped it at first i was very excited for a toast to be honest because here's a guy who was in trouble now he's not you know great otozie announced that he was going to refund everyone who donated to him which is the right thing to do it's awesome everybody sort of wins but then i kind of thought about it for a second and i got angry because rewind that clip for a second and really listen to what bit boy is saying so at this point like i said there is nothing really we can do you know the money is came in on his side the lawsuit was never about money there's nothing you can do because the money came in on his side what what is that about suddenly the guy you're in a legal battle with has the funds to fight his case and that makes your lawsuit worthless do you guys understand what he's saying there there's nothing we can do because the money came in on his side nothing about the facts of the case have changed here guys the only thing that's really changed is everyone found out about it and atosi got money to actually defend himself the fact that that is what seems to have made bit boy drop his case is so telling for the fact that this was all about bullying him in the first place because look i mean what else has changed i think this was a play by bitboy who knows he's a millionaire he knows a toes he's not and he basically wants to punish him for criticizing him too heavily and when that backfired i think he backed out of it and it wasn't just this statement that bitboy said when he was basically dropping the lawsuit that was questionable he also said this we did not want this to become public i guess when i decided to do this back in november i want to keep this behind closed doors i've had another lawsuit it was behind closed doors and it worked out great yeah he wanted to keep it behind closed doors he's sorry it got out it's already suspicious when you start to talk like that but i also don't know if this is really true because bitboy knew this thing would become public which is like what confused me about this whole thing because way back in december guys of 2021 i knew bitboy was planning to sue a tozie and i told him that i was going to make a video about it because i thought it was frivolous and bullying and i gave him a media request to respond to here's the email proving it so this whole thing of like oh i expected it to be private i didn't know it would be leaked to the press that's why i'm suddenly changing my mind that's not true bitboy knew for like seven eight months that this was going to be covered so it's just funny that he's like oh i thought this would be behind closed doors no no you thought you could get away with it and you couldn't he thought nobody was going to come to a tosi's aid he thought that the only people who would support a toasie are kids borrowing from their mom's purse but i just wanted to celebrate this win and let you guys know that your direct support just ends up making a huge difference and it prevents people from getting legally bullied because this happens all the time and it's not always a big youtuber with millions of subscribers who can afford to fight it and can draw attention to it it's oftentimes little youtubers who don't have a voice so i wanted to draw attention to that scummy behavior and then also celebrate the win in this case of how we fought back and we won because it's actions like this that makes this community so cool to be a part of enjoy the win for now i'll see you in the next one
