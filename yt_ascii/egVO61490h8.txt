i don't want you guys to look down on me but i don't know what the zenith gradient algorithm is okay i i i i did do back propagation gradient descent algorithm but i i don't know what the zenith gradient algorithm is is it am i am i stupid unfollowed senior engineer here everybody oh man dude anyways i want to tell you guys something i bought medium i pay a monthly service charge dollars a month so that i can read articles to you and i hope that all of you are happy with my decision i pay for medium motivation let's say you have four tasks to do in a given day work on an essay do some math homework edit a video do some math homework this guy clearly is doing his math homework over here isn't that free isn't there freedum i don't know if there is fre freedum anyways edit video and study for physics exam and let's also assume you have 6 hours in total to spend on all these tasks the question is how should you best allocate time to each one of these tasks to maximize your productivity simple do one at a time that's most important why would you ever do anything else because you're going to waste time trying to figure out how to do your task people that get stuck in analysis paralysis because they cannot figure out what is the most important thing to do is just absolutely silly just do the simplest and most straightforward thing ever which is do the one that's do the first like that's it just do whatever is first because they can't all be do at the same time like that there's just not a possibility you know what i mean there's just not a you cannot have a physics exam and math homework and editing a video and working on an essay they can't all be do at the same time it's just not possible it's just not possible okay it could be possible well i mean it'd be really hard because it's the exam because that's a real time thing you know what i mean it's just real time it'd be very hard let's see a rudimentary approach would be to allocate time arbitrarily or allocate an equal amount of time to each task without taking into account any factors like difficulty of the task etc yes and this would be called being a rookie okay that's a rookie move in this case you could simply allocate 1.5 hours to each task and call it a day but could you do better what if instead of instead allocate one hour of working on the essay in 0.05 or 0.5 hours for the math homework 2.5 hours for editing a video and two hours for studying physics you could spend a total of 6 hours but would this be better i.e would it be more productive how can we quantify these decisions how could we build a to-do app that does this computation for us defining productivity for a given task p of t or however you say that is that row am i looking at row that what are we looking at that's not row what is this thing that doesn't that that's no standard p what is this one is it row it is row okay okay okay i'm already lost lil p bro that's p not row that's a p bro that's not row i don't know man be the amount of progress we have made at the time t then productivity p of t see this is p that's p see there's the difference that's row that's p can be defined as the amount of progress being made per unit time i.e p of t equals the oh this is just straight up differentiate row with respect to time productivity is the time derivative of progress if we make a lot of progress really quickly then we are more productive if our progress doesn't change with respect to time then we aren't productive at all so this is a reasonable definition for productivity it is nice okay we got a we we're bring a fug you we're bring it we're bringing in a little bit of calculus one let's go i like this finding a model while doing a task productivity as a function of time naturally has the shape of the poison distribution it starts at some initial value then increases to some maximum point this can be the mathematical definition of flow state i.e flow state can be defined as the time when we're most productive then decrease as we lose energy yeah some of us kind of i i mean personally i personally feel like i've taken one of those little blue pills except for productivity okay i stay erect okay there's no you know what i go i step function i i'm on and i'm on and i go and i go and i go and then i turn off because i have to build javascript and then i hate my life it's not adderal the blue pill is the one that you know you know what i mean gets the blood flowing you know what i'm talking about or the blood not flowing which one was is it the blood flowing or the blood not flowing is it blood flowing to stop the flow to staunch the flow as one would say blue steel crackhead energy we're not even sure all right anyways let's keep on going then decrease as we lose energy a good model for this type of behavior is the function all right our productivity at time is p0 plus i'm not sure what a t and e stand for yet minus kt i don't know what i don't know what k e and a stand for i see i assume t is time okay okay oh is this some sort of alpha we are we looking at it isn't this called an alpha alpha beta distribution a and k are constants h a a k constant t is time well what what about e is e effort is e effort or is e the natural that that that delicious natural number 2.7 something something some you know what i'm talking about oilers number oilers constant bro i thought it was uler yeah guess what you could uler these nuts it's oiler baby this curve can be parameterized by the effort of the task e the enjoyability of the task beta and the time it takes to reach flow state what is this one is that is that omega what is that guy is that omega i'm not good at all these ones it's not a little omega and it doesn't look like that's not omega what is that is that fe fe yeah fee got it i got close there i almost effed that one up i almost effed that one up i almost effed it up closed my eyes and bam first time here heard from pirate sofware so so far the stream is has not disappointed you're a funny dude hey thank you yeah you know i would just like to say that sometimes my humor can get people a little little little riled up on the internet okay they get they can kind of get a little bit angry and that's it that's all i really wanted to say you know sometimes sometimes i like to rustle some jimmies you know what i mean sometimes i like to trigger the libs you know what i'm talking about like to i like to i like to pone the conservatives own the libs trigger trigger them all as mentioned above flow state can be defined as time when productivity reaches a maximum to calculate this value we can set the differential of of productivity with respect to time equals to zero and solve for t this calculation results in t equals 1/ k we can now set this value i don't know how they got there okay okay i feel like i feel like someone's not showing their math homework right now because i'm not sure how you just went with this this this little with respect to time and then just got a k out of it okay i'm not sure what k is i'm not sure how this happened okay i would have i don't know we can now set this value of t equal to fee to solve for k which results in k equals 1 over fe i don't even know how you got to that value which means that t equals fe my goodness t equals fe based on based on what i'm looking at the t is equal to the fee we can express fee as a function of e and beta all right fe is takes in these two parameters effort and the task we're on or enjoyability and the task we're on okay this makes sense pinpointing this function exactly would be complicated instead we can approximate fee as a linear function that makes sense there's some coefficient of enjoyability plus the coefficient of the task we're currently on plus some sort of constant offset okay that makes sense this looks like a lot of circle joying yeah it is see the coefficients 1 through three are constants that vary from person to person and are within range such that fee is greater than zero i would i okay oh interesting so i would not have thought it was a varying from person to person i thought it would i thought it would be a m it would be kind of like a cross product of person and i i i personally thought that e would almost be related to to to beta i'm a little surprised that e is not related to beta here because and like there should be a hidden there should be a p in here as well and i do think e should be broken down i think b or i think e really is beta p can we be real here and by p like capital p person only makes sense because the enjoyability is dependent on the person and the task let's get some partial derivatives on this son of a the initial productivity p can be defined by the the the task squared over the enjoyability squared i hope i got the e correct that it's enjoyability we typically have a harder time starting higher effort oh e is effort interesting okay well effort again effort again is still related by person and task it's true because he even states it right here we typically have a harder time starting higher effort tasks compared to lower effort tasks and hence our starting productivity decreases as the effort of the task increases this i mean i i guess that that does make sense all right all right increasing the parameters a increases the global maximum of the function and hence increases the value of our peak productivity by the way you can definitely tell i feel like a college student wrote this cu i mean like only only a college student would still be so deep into this 10 years into the or tw what am i at 15 years into the real world and i'm just like yo dog i can't remember none of this we can try to quantify how a depends on the parameters of effort and and task by thinking of how our peak productivity flow state changes depending on the effort of the task and how much we enjoy doing it let's use a video game as an example when playing a low effort video game the flow state we experience won't feel that much different than how we feel on a regular basis in contrast when playing a high effort competitive video game the flow state we experience will feel almost magical compared to any other time especially if we really enjoy the game yeah that's true elden ring you really get into elder it feels real good i could feel that i could i could feel i could feel that dota player can ir med a l league league player probably still in bronze league what's up corgi this tells us that higher effort tasks that we really enjoy correspond to higher peak productivity a good model for this would be this function alpha is the task squared the natural log of effort plus the task squared i can't i'm not sure how you got to this model not i'm just going to throw that out there i'm not sure how we got to the model putting this all together we have the the project with respect the project with input of time equals the initial getting over the hump plus all that which is a replacement for a multiplied by t the oiler constant toga t divided by the interpersonal effort project one okay it seems good seems reasonable in the previous section we've defined the time it takes to reach flow state as feed so we do this all right where c c our constants that vary from person to person so for fee to be non- negative we can define a fixed range of e and b or e and beta we can define some intermediate variables eu and beta u to be effort let's see to be the effort and enjoyability respectively that the person that the user provides for consistency both of these values will range from 1 to 10 and will be mapped linearly to their respective ranges i.e e the true value of effort is a linear function of eu and b the true value value of enjoyability oh i thought i thought he stated earlier that beta was not enjoyability but but the but the specific task were on okay i guess i i've been reading this whole thing wrong the whole time is this article just a dumb down thesis it really is experimentally it was determined that the good range for e is this right here 1 through five we can now linearly map the range of eu the intermediate value of effort from 1 to 10 to 1 to 5 using the following function what is what what what what is this are you trying to okay first off this it looks like you're trying to get fahrenheit out of this bad boy or or or sorry celsius out of this i'm not i don't like what i'm seeing right now anyways the boundary of enjoyability i didn't realize we are in freedom units of of effort and now we're converting to metric effort what's happening here similarly a good range for enjoyability is 1 to two we can linearly map the range of enjoyability you down from 10 to this doing this with this one okay okay okay user dependent contents now we'll explore one two and three to let's see can be determined for each task i a stopwatch can be used to measure the time until flow state fee the time it takes to get in the zone this will give us the data points bam where e sub is the effort of task i and b subi is the enjoyability of task i we can then use a linear least squares approximation to find the best fit play to the data which results in this damn man this is this is this look good man not going to lie to you this little sum right here is just n okay just like looking at this really quickly you're going from i's one to n just return that's just n you didn't even have to do that and therefore i'm out constants one two and three will be updated after a new data point has been provided when to stop doing task let's assume you have a the task of studying for a math exam and you've determined that the effort of this task is on a sc scale from 1 to 10 is about seven that means a 3.65 in that's a seven in freedom units by the way so don't get confused the enjoyability is a three so that's a 1.22 let's assume that the user dependent constants are the the following and your estimated time until flow state would then be 1.75 hours so your productivity curve looks like that nice nice now the question is how long should you spend time doing the task to maximize productivity if you study for too long you will become burnt out and start experiencing diminishing returns i used to be able to study math for like 16 straight hours i don't know about this whole so-called diminishing returns business sometimes you just got you know what i i want to throw something out there that's going to make people angry are you guys ready for this one sometimes you just got to be more mature than how you feel okay i'm just throwing it out there i know this may be a little hurtful i know that i just injured people okay i know some people is just like that one thing with the girl spitting knives and the guy going big more mature than how you feel is difficult but i'm just saying it is really good you have to be healthy to do that you know you can make all the excuses you want okay i love it my favorite thing is when you when you when you say that there will always be somebody that says well actually you know my condition is unique i can't do that i'm i'm i'm i'm unique i'm a unique one actually just saying actually a study for a little too little and you risk not getting enough value out of that session there's a sweet spot and intuitively we know it lies sometime after you reach flow state but how long to answer this we need the measure we need a measure of how prod productive you are on sometime interval for the sake of the example let's say the first 30 minutes of studying into studying a good measurement for this average of p of t would be between t of zero and 30 minutes which can be calculated by this classic classic measuring the va area under the curve everybody knows about this and luckily these are all constants right this would be a yeah everything in here is a constant because we said all i mean it goes from 0 to 0 to 05 right so that's like i feel like that's not too bad we can compare this for a later time i feel like in my back in my days i could have done this maybe o i don't know that whole negative t up there maybe i would have struggled do we need like we need some sort of tailor series don't we we can compute the this to a later time interval let's say between 8 and 8 hours okay all right all right all right we can see let's see as we can see the first 30 minutes into studying was not much more valuable than 30 minutes a couple hours later we can now define as you can see by the way for those that don't know for those that couldn't just immediately tell you actually don't it's obvious okay qed you just know this all right we can define the global maximum for this function to get the optimal time you should be studying for spend studying to maximize productivity just give the man his his his his master dissertation okay just just let him pass he wins okay hey he wins let it go just let it go lotex much lotex for days solving for t numerically we find that t is 3.16 so the optim amount of time you should spend studying is 3 hours and 10 minutes all right generalize if we have n tasks to complete in t hours and we're given the following and an effort vector of this and the enjoyability vector where e subi is the effort of task i and b subi or beta subi is the enjoyability of the task i we can define the following fee like this blah blah which goes all to in here a lot of vectors here and let p of t be the total productivity for the day where t equals all of these numbers and ti is the time spent doing task i therefore capital p of t can be defined as the the sum of average productivity for each task all right there we go now we can find the ma now we can maximize this function under the constraint that this right here happens okay using the method of lrange multipliers we do this ah classic lrange multipliers classic really when you think about it oh did did we actually get we're we're partial derivating the chain rule we're about the chain boys boys we're chaining math stream math stream solving the system of equations let us revisit the example where we started with you have at you have four tasks to do in a given day work on an essay task one tod do some math homework task two edit a video task three and study for physics exam task four and let's assume that you have six hours in total to spend on all these tasks the question is how should you best allocate time to each of these tasks to maximize productivity each of these tasks have an associated effort and enjoyability we can define right here all right i i i do have a fundamental flaw he has not thought of and i would like to talk about it but i'm not going to talk about it yet this is also e of all these things with all these different enjoyability and effort ratings therefore we have all these nice little delicious vectors that are going through assuming some constants right here solving the system of numerically results in the following of 7 1.84 1.1 and 2.35 so to maximize your productivity for a day you should spend 7 hours 42 minutes on working on the essay 1.84 hours an hour and 50 minutes doing math homework 1.11 hours 1 hour and 7 minutes editing a video and 2.31 hours 2 hours and 21 minutes studying physics now we can compare this to a rudimentary approach mentioned at the beginning where would you arbit arbitrarily allocate time for example let's say you allocated 2.4 5 hours for the essay two hours for math 0 five hours for video editing and 1 hour for studying physics all right we did all this look at all these ps a lot we got a lot of p here which means that you would increase your productivity for the day by about 19% using this model 19% increase sanity check it's we're still going if you have a list of tasks to complete that have all the same level of effort e en enjoyment intuitively we would expect it would be best to spend an equal amount of time on each task since there would be no reason to prioritize one task over another mathematically this makes sense that if we solve a nonlinear system above with the same thing okay where all of this happens awesome for the sum value of this okay fantastic proof is left as an exercise for the reader hit him hit him with the qed right there final product i've been developing this app for almost 2 years the model described above has been fully implemented and you can try it out for free i actually might try this out just to see how it goes the demo of the app can be viewed right here dr tom crawford from the book tom rocks math youtube channel has also made a video covering this algorithm nice let's go let's go that's absolutely fantastic all right are you ready for me to hit you hit you with some knowledge okay i do i do have one problem okay i actually have two problems with this person's graph first off if you want to be successful in life real talk don't have a morning routine all right i'm just throwing that out there don't have a morning routine get get up and get to work okay don't don't hit that red light therapy jump in that cold plunge do all that stuff get up get to work stop it just go immediately wake up coffee go okay just throwing that out there okay a lot of people do this a lot of people do this you know it's it's it's an it's an alex heroi take alex heros tes has this take where when he was getting his gym up and running and doing all that he would just get up and work and do it non-stop and then when he got a bunch of money he you know he would start doing all these different you know morning routines and he realized his productivity massively dropped and the reason why is that when you become wealthy you stop caring so much about your productivity so therefore you now just do it easy road right you got that red light therapy shining on your balls blah blah blah blah there you go anyways okay second off here's a problem that i have with this the reason why i think this is fundamentally broken is that there's one assertion in here that is incorrect which is that they do not it's right here let's just take this graph for a quick second and let's save it okay i'm going to call graph webp nice job nice webp nice webp bro we're going to discard and i'm gonna open this up i'm gonna open this up right here now you guys are going to see this immediately are you ready for this so i'm gonna i'm going to take this i'm gonna this is a well actually moment are you ready for this i'm going to create a new one of these okay we're going to create a new one same same size and i'm going to go like this and i'm going to take this right here and i'm going to approximately cut this in half okay approximately i'm going to copy it and i'm going to do that and i'm going to do that and bada bing bada boom and then i'm going to paste it one more time i'm going to create another half right there and then we're going to go right here and so i want you to look at it more like this all right and then i'm going to take this color i'm going to zoom in and try to get the closest i can to that color and then i'm going to take this guy right here and i'm going to drop it down to some smaller this is not small enough and actually let's create one more one more thing right on top and i'm just going to put right here and i'm going to go like this all right so there we go this are not this is not bba or booty okay neither this right here this range right here is what i like to refer to as the trough of sadness when you go from one task in which you're when you're hitting that flow state to a new task there is what what truly does happen which is not being mentioned here is what i would like to refer to as here i'm going to go in here and i'm i'm going to take this and i'm going to actually increase the width by a good amount we're going to resize this i'm going to take this one right here and i'm going to actually move it over here right and then i'm going to take we're going to take the eraser really quickly we're going to jump it back to this one and i'm going to increase the size of it real thick right and i'm going to i'm going to just i'm going to just erase all of this right and then i guess there's more erasing that needs to be erased there we go and then this one also so there we go so there's the line going straight down and what ends up happening is that now you you've reached a whole new problem which is there is a very he does talk about a startup cost but startup cost he defined as enjoy or effort over enjoy enjoyability i might be wrong on that it might be enjoyability over effort yeah that makes more sense it was enjoyability over effort right the problem is is it's not actually that it actually is the cost of breaking previous flow state so it's also the previous flow state breaking cost and so this trough of sadness lasts really long because what ends up happening this is where things get really intense and a lot of people don't understand is that when you're doing a task and you hit flow state this also probably represents your dopamine you're getting you're getting hit with dopamine you're feeling good and when you stop bam you are feeling you're feeling the effects okay now you're you're you're dopamine trout hard right you're hitting the bottom of the bottom and so just like imagine that your startup cost is only based on the enjoy ability and effort to get into the next task is not real you're also fighting a dopamine crash from leaving one flow state to the next now there is a difference though there is a big difference there's something that is also not stated in this which i think is really important at some point deep down this curve when your dopamine has already crashed but you're still pushing through it well past the curve of productivity right you are pushing through because you are mature at this point starting a new task gives you bonus dopamine right you've been trowing hard pushing through being mature taking all the right steps and then when you start a new task it's almost like you get a supercharge right you like explode up in productivity because you're doing something different after so long so there is definitely like it's it's not the problem is the fundamental problem is that he measured it as enjoyability over effort right and there may be squares in there as well i cannot remember but there there is a third factor which is the distance from the previous task and how far past the point of prime did you go right like the the the point of dopamine crash how far past did you go because you have to go far enough into the misery section of doing that task for you to really launch off into the next the next one you know what i mean dick to dick ratio this man gets it all hail king julia julia no sorry not that pigeon guided missile gets it i hate how right you are yeah i i'm tell i'm just letting you know as a man who's very productivity very productive one of the secrets is that you have to go far enough into it after some sleep deprivation something like 24 to 36 hours there is a demonstrated longer period of flow state really that sounds awful moral of the story bba equals dopamine absolutely moral of the story is bba dopamine but clavage tri despair so anyways be careful be careful about switching tasks too fast okay when you're in a good flow state and you break it you're going to crash hard and it's going to be unenjoyable because you're going from an enjoyment state to an un enjoyment effort high effort state when you're in a already high effort state and you can no longer derive any enjoyability from it and you last long enough in the high effort low enjoyability state the change up can give it to you i actually think this is like this is an equation for burnout real talk i think this is an equation for burnout which is you can't stay too long in that long tail you know what i mean like there there's a point of of burnout that happens at some point when you've made it way too long and you need to be able to switch tasks and i feel like this is where a lot of people actually experience burnout i think we've mathematically solved burnout here i truly do obviously this is only work rated burnout i'm not talking about personal life related burnout which is very very important but this is why i i suggest side projects so often is that at this point when you finally reach this really difficult stage when you have such high effort and such low enjoyment coming out you need to go do something that that yields high enjoyment and low effort like that's one of the reasons why we did that stupid video what was that dude what was that the the last video i did it was just like such low effort fun take for me two 2300 devs versus me trying to program faster like for me this was just like the funnest thing i just had so much much fun it was such little effort and it just it made me like honestly the rest of my day working at netflix was literally multiples more productive because i had so much fun building something stupid yes aka this is also why democracy doesn't work that was rigged i know no dot well we fixed it we fixed it so there you go i like this art great article by the way great article who did this who wrote this because you you you deserve some sort of follow all right do you hey jim do you have a if that's how you say your name do you archal dr archal do you have here i'll follow you i don't follow anybody there you go you got my first follow but if you have a twitter somewhere i would gladly promoted if you whisper me this is absolutely just dynamite might i add absolute dynamite arch user you think so well i can't help i can't help but hey great article good job absolutely love it i do feel like my little the my little contribution to your thesis was true that you definitely have to try to figure out how to include a cost of switching into into your formula if you can if you if you make a followup that's just the math about that and how it changes it oh i'd be glad i'd be glad to read it you know what i mean yeah yeah and then yeah someone's linking the app app link very awesome
