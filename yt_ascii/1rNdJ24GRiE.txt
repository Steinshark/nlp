hello everyone and welcome to a collaboration between myself and matt a bleep in jeep so what's going on well matt has tied a tow strap around the engine of a jeep and then he's tied the other end of that tow strap around a tree and then he's going to accelerate that jeep and see what happens when it hits the end of the leash why is he doing this well let him explain that to you real quickly this is scientific we're doing this for you never know when you're gonna get tangled up it's science okay so maybe there's not a good reason for doing this but then i started thinking you know pulling an engine in ten seconds out of a car sounds a lot like a subplot from a fast and furious movie and that also helps me to justify this experiment because i was thinking you know this is pretty sad that we're going to destroy a jeep here but then i thought you know everyone loves the fast and furious movies we know that's effect so if everyone loves fast and furious movies and they destroy cars and fast and furious movies then it's okay for us to destroy a jeep in a hypothetical subplot for a fast and furious movie also can we just take a moment to recognize that fast five and fast six or the exact same movie they've got the characters listed in the same order up at the top they've got the actor standing in the exact same order paul walker's even wearing the same shoes in both films it's literally the same movie and yet i paid for both of them okay enough about fast and furious let's talk about 10-second cars so when matt initially approached me about this idea he said he was planning on getting an older jeep that weighed about 3,000 pounds surprising that jeeps yes did in fact used to weigh less than 3,000 pounds or around 3,000 pounds and would have a 0 to 60 in about 10 seconds that was a conservative estimate so we make sure we have enough length in the tow strap and so it's questions for me or how long does this tow strap need to be and how strong does this tow strap need to be so we're looking at length and we're looking at strength now i know this looks incredibly boring because it's mostly math and you guys just want to get to the carnage i understand that so i'm gonna try to go quickly through the math but you know you could find yourself in this scenario needing to know this information and so i just want to make sure you're prepared for that okay so the first question is how long does the tow strap need to be and so this is basically just asking what speed do you want to get to and then at that speed how long does it take to get there what's the distance that it takes to arrive to that speed so he set the goal of around 60 miles per hour for the core to reach with that zero to 60 being in about 10 seconds so we can calculate the acceleration based on a zero to 60 of 10 seconds we can get average acceleration good enough for an estimate change in velocity over the change in time that gives us eight point eight feet per second squared or two point six eight meters per second squared then from that we can calculate distance so distance equals one-half e squared over a you do the math here these are all in imperial units on this side and then our second question it's all in metric units i did that to make sure everyone was unhappy so we can all complain together in the comments it's gonna be great so this math gives us 440 feet for our distance or about 134 meters and so does that mean we need a toe strap that's 440 feet well no it does not if you start with the truck way behind the tree so you're basically doubling the length of your rope and then you drive past the tree and that way you only need about half that distance and so matt got four different straps each one of them 70 feet in length and so that adds up to 280 feet we multiply that by 2 we get 560 feet then we account for the fact that we have to wrap around a tree we have to wrap around the engine we have to tie these tow straps together and that gives us at least about 500 feet for this jeep to accelerate before it reaches the end of the line okay so now we need to understand how strong the tow strap needs to be and so we're going to assume that the jeep itself is perfectly rigid and that's a stupid thing to assume because it's not true at all and i will get into that a little bit later but basically we need to figure out the force that that tow strap is going to have applied to it and we're going to determine that force using a rigid jeep so it's just one thing that's attached to the end of this tow strap and we're assuming you know the bolts aren't going to go flying it's not going to rip apart it's going to stay together and so assuming that we know that work is equal to force times distance so that's the force that we're trying to figure out this distance is how long it takes for jeep to stop basically how much stretch are we going to have in our toe strap is what we're going to be modeling here because we're assuming that the jeep itself is rigid so we divide the distance over we get force equals work divided by distance work is equal to the change in kinetic energy so when the jeep is traveling at 60 miles per hour it has a certain amount of kinetic energy and then it comes to a rest zero miles per hour it has no more kinetic energy and so that's what we're going to calculate for the top portion of that equation and then we're dividing by distance d which is how much that tow strap stretches now we don't know how much it's going to stretch tow straps are generally designed to not have that much stretch and especially this giant one that has been made for this isn't going to have too much stretch so if we assume you know somewhere in that just like one to two percent stretch range we're going to have a force that's going to be applied to that tow strap of 977 kilonewtons if the tow strap only stretches half a meter and 488 kilonewtons if the tow strap only stretches one meter so what does this mean well in our hypothetical scenario it means that we need a two hundred twenty thousand pound tow strap if it were to stretch half a meter we would need a one hundred ten thousand pound tow strap if it were to stretch an entire meter and that's assuming the jeep is rigid now this is a pretty beefy ask for a you know tow strap to handle but matt actually ended up finding one that had a rating of 150 five thousand pounds now going back to the assumption that this is an absolutely rigid jeep the tow strap really only needs to be as strong as the weakest link on the jeep so i think it's safe to assume that the engine mounts are not going to be able to withstand a hundred and fifty five thousand pound force so this is certainly going to be overkill but we know that the limiting factor is not going to be our tow strap so then matt's question to me was what's going to happen and to be honest i have no idea but i think there are some forces that we can at least analyze and kind of predict what may happen and so the biggest force of course is just going to be pulling straight back on that engine now its wrapped around the engine and then below the front axle and so because of that there's also going to be that downward force kind of pulling back and down on that front axle and so you know if we just assume on this this biggest force having its way well then perhaps it's just going to take the engine in the front axle and just rip it all straight out the back and the car just slides forward so here i have basically a perfect replica of what's going to happen i've got the jeep here and then the tow strap connected to the front axle and so if we take that downward force more into consideration then perhaps it's going to pull it forward rip everything out and then the car flips over and then also i think there's going to be a bit of a side force because it's driving by the tree and so if the tree is planted here and it comes across like that you can see there's that side force where it's going to want to slide out so perhaps also you know best-case scenario for the most destruction it pulls it sideways starts to flip like that yanks everything out and then the body just continues to tumble that would probably be the coolest scenario i'm going to say it's probably going to lean towards the first couple scenarios we're just yanks everything out in the back and perhaps kind of flips over or just kind of scoots out in front of it but it should be pretty interesting to see i have not seen the footage so i'm going to check that out as well i will include a link to it for you guys to check out and we'll see what happens all in the name of science fast and furious and all things great thank you all for watching
