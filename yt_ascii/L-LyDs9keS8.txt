this vague notion of progress that he sets up where nobody really knows everybody knows that they're being on the right side of history and everybody knows that they're working towards the the this great progressive thing but nobody knows what it is and it's like that's still like that today you look around us and we notice people talking about progress and being progressive and you know this is the future and but if you ask them what that means they just stare at you blankly because they have no idea where it is that they're heading this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic [applause] world hello everyone i am speaking with annie crawford annie is a scholar who has studied cs lewis she teaches baywolf she teaches all these things in classical high school she's also written quite a bit and and she is going to head up a class on cs lewis and the ransom trilogy for us something that i've also read recently you know it seems to be kind of in the air everybody's talking about it everybody is buzzing around it because it seems like it points to a lot of things that are happening now in terms of let say the shape of the world but also in terms of the re-enchantment and a return of of of more cosmic thinking and she recently wrote an article for us on gender and cosmology about cs lewis which you can check out on the symbolic world blog and so andy i'll let you also introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your background and what sparked this class that you're going to give for us yeah hi jonathan thanks for having me so i'm from austin texas and i have homeschooled my three daughters and i think i've always been interested in cs lewis very much he played an important role in my own journey toward coming to understand the world and what it means to be human and as i've homeschooled my girls we've just been learning together diving deeper deeper into the tradition and then as i'm educating them seeking around me who else we can invite into this work of integrating education and discipleship and reviving what i call a sacramental understanding of the world and so when the girls were older and i had a little bit more time i continued my studies formally by working on a a degree in cultural apologetics at houston christian university which that degree really focuses on the work of cs lewis cs lewis is really seen as a founder of a new approach to apologetics a new approach to helping people understand not just having arguments for certain beliefs but offering helping make the christian view of the world meaningful helping people understand the meaning of it and as i have been doing that work i found your work at the symbolic world and really feel that what you're doing and what cs lewis was trying to do are very complimentary and so you know in the symbolic world community on circle people were just discussing as you said lewis is in the air the ransom trilogy especially post 2020 there seems to be a lot more attention being drawn towards the ransom trilogy and so in the symbolic world community there was just interest in you know discussing these books in depth there's a real hunger it to at the symbolic world community is really a phenomenal group of people from all over the world people who are eager insightful thoughtful reflective and so i thought well let's just get together and let's study c lewis together and there was so much interest and such a desire for depth that it really became a class and so as you were launching the new bolf class we thought let's make this an official class and really dive in deep together to study these important books which i really think have been given to us for such a time as this i also read the ransom trilogy recently and i was really struck especially that hideous strength of just how much insight lewis seemed to have had about where the world was going you know and also this this strange organization that he sets up this kind of evil secret organization there's something about it which rings so true about things that we're seeing in the culture now first of all in in some ways this vague notion of progress that he sets up where nobody really knows everybody knows that they're being on the right side of history and everybody knows that they're working towards the the this great progressive thing but nobody knows what it is and it's like that's still like that today you look around us and we notice people talking about progress and being progressive and you know this is the future and but if you ask them what that means they they they just stare at you blankly because they have no idea where it is that they're heading yeah well it really is a retelling of the tower of babel which you've done several videos on and what strikes me in what you're saying is i see the tower of babel as our attempt to gather up meaning and reach into the heavens but if we're not properly receiving meaning from above then our efforts to to reach up with our own meaning are going to be aimless they're not going to be a clear tellos or a clear aim because we are seeking independently to do that from the bottom up so that sense of you know we're going somewhere who knows exactly where i think is very much part of the meaning of the tower of babel motif yeah and there's the the whole idea of the head in the the by the way there this is going to be full of spoilers so if you don't want spoilers don't watch it but we're not gonna we're not going to be careful about the spoilers so you should have read it anyways by now so this whole idea of this head right this kind of disembodied head that is the head of their that organization this like massive brain you know it's really interesting to see how you know this was written one in the 40s is that when it was written yeah so in the 1940s having this insight about what really for us would would be ai and you know this idea of this disembodied intelligence and also the tendency to worship it right and the tendency to to create a god there's some of the some of the dialogues that are so close to what the transhumanists are saying now this idea that we're going to make a god you know we've heard that recently from the head of of google in that interview with elon musk where he said we're going to build a god it's like everything you believed in the past it's it wasn't true back then but we're going to make it true you know by creating this perfect this like weird perfect intelligence and also this joining of humanity into into this he doesn't use the word singularity but it feels like that's what he's he's kind of pointing to yeah i mean his insight is is is phenomenal so i let's look at the gender question because that's one of the things i was really happy to see your article because i was struck by a a sentence in the text and i tweeted it at some point where cs lewis says gender is more primordial than sex or something like that like gender precedes sex and that's something that modern people like even modern conservatives were getting annoyed with me because they want to collapse gender and sex together but csis doesn't do that at all so maybe tell us a bit about this idea of gender and how cs treats it as a cosmic force yeah and i think you know how you're saying that even conservatives get confused i think that shows us how much the sacred view of the world really has been lost that even people who say they believe in god really are functional materialists in many way or functional dualists they don't understand how heaven and earth fit together because that knowledge that cultural knowledge has been lost so i have the quote right here that you're talking about from cs lewis and i think this is from paralandra he says gender is a more fun m al reality than sex sex is in fact merely the adaptation to organic life of a fundamental polarity that's key fundamental polarity which divides all created beings and so it's not that hard to understand if you recover even the materialist should be able to understand it it's not it's actually not like a woo woo statement at all in any ways right well you know sometimes what we want to see blinds us from seeing what is there right so you know if you have a symbolic view of the world or a sacramental view of the world or even a pagan view of you the world you know that the fundamental polarity is heaven and earth right in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and you know you talk about this all the time in your work that the heavens being the realm you could see think of it as like st paul says in colossians invisible invisible the realm of meaning the realm of form that's the heaven that is made to fit with and be manifest within the earth that the fundamental structure of reality is a marriage between heaven and earth where god you know is spirit and he is prior he is the logos who speaks the world the cosmic mountain into being and that is as as lewis is saying the fundamental polarity that forms all things and that is repeated in all things in that fractal level that fractal repetition right and so sex is the biological adaptation the the bi the fractal repetition of that cosmic polarity played out on the physical level and you know and i think sometimes what people again get concerned about is the way that that there's a a false polarity a false dualism talked about in our culture right where we say well if we separate gender and sex then we're separating the meaning in a way that makes them arbitrary and that's what i think people get concerned about but but if you understand that even the on the cosmic level that ls is talking about it's still has to do with generation gender has to do with genesis genitals generation it's still the mode in which life is created reality is beeded and so that even if we acknowledge the cosmic level of gender as somewhat different from the physical level of sex still the connection is not arbitrary yeah i think that's the biggest thing this is something that i i talked about with with richard rley in our last discussion which is that the this is really where you see how people struggle to understand a basic symbolic understanding of reality which is that just because there are different levels of of a pattern doesn't mean that those are free floating and that so if you separate sex and gender doesn't mean that now sex can be one thing and gender can be the other it's like no it's actually a connection of different levels of participation in the same pattern and even if for example let's say the customs that we have about how to dress as man or woman how men present present themselves even though that's variable across cultures first of all it's not infinitely variable that's nonsense it's it has it's variable to some extent and but then even though it's variable the polarity still is universal that is you know for example like there are cultures where men ornament themselves and women ornament themselves less let's say and and that's something in our culture which is the opposite but in that culture men ornament themselves and women don't and the polarity is still present and and there's still this sense of this is how men act this is how women act and this is how they come together and it's not like i said and it's also not it's never free floating and arbitrary it's never like it could be anything and that's it's difficult for people to understand that but that's you know it's like we believe that all the time like we think that there are different species of dogs but we nonetheless recognize that you know this species of dog and this other species of dog is still a dog even though there's variation in the species but for some reason with humans if we see that it's like we feel like our whole world is threatened or that it's going to blow all the categories but variation and pattern is just how it actually how it functions in terms of in terms especially in terms of cultural cultural participation yeah tell us a bit about about how cs le represents it because he i mean i think it's a little scandalous the way he does because he literally uses pagan gods as his image to represent this yeah it is scandalous and a lot of people criticize lewis even christians for being misogynistic in the way that he portrays gender and i think that's part of what calls me to this topic especially as a woman i i do feel like perhaps it's a little less scandalous if maybe i talk about it but so in terms of him using venus goodness there's so many directions we could go let's talk a little bit maybe about his world viw the bigger picture that then we can situate the discussion of gender in so lewis has what he would call what i call a sacramental worldview which i do think is synonymous to what you talk talk about with a symbolic worldview because it really is this idea that what what re visible reality is is a manifestation of visible spiritual form right and a symbol is a is a locust where meaning from heaven comes and is embodied within h a visible form and that's the same as a sacramental worldview sacrament means a visible sign of an invisible reality and i think some people get confused about sacrament because you think well no a sacrament is a baptism or or some kind of particular religious point of contact between heaven and earth but i think one way that's helpful to be clear on this is to separate between what the two books that the tradition would call the general revelation the book of nature the meaning that is spoken throughout all creation and invisible to all men and then special revelation where heaven meets earth in particular ways christ the church eucharist baptism but but they're just different levels of the same thing right of heaven being manifested on earth and i think this can help us understand lewis's love of the pagan and that he that that the pagan world had access to general revelation just like everyone else and pagans could read the meaning of the world through the things that are made and romans 1 makes this clear within scripture that that the the the nature of heaven of the divine is evident through the things that he's made and so you know the pagans looking at the cosmos at gender masculinity femininity they're going to be able to see deep fundamental spiritual truth through general revelation and but you know being cut off from cast out of eden and you know perhaps under the rule of suspect rebels from the divine council right you want to go so that the pagan tradition is going to be a mix of truth and distortion and so that's going to be lewis's view of of the pagan world and what he wants to do is is say we can and and this is what the church fathers did when jerusalem met athens right this is what justin mardar did is we're going to sort through the the inheritance the insights from rome from greece and sort through and and take out what is true and what is good and that's going to be the way that we transpose translate the the christian special revelation that has been seen so that's just what lewis is doing in his portrayal of gender he's saying let's look at the cosmos let's look at the tradition and let's use that as a as a way of translating helping us in a modern age understand what sex and gender is is so that's kind of the framework in which he investigates this theme where would you like to go from there do you want to talk about the gender structure of the book no so yeah we can we can talk a little bit i mean what interests me is also how he he structured the two books you know the two first books as basically this kind of male world and this this this female world and then how he culminates it into the figures of these angels which ultimately reveal themselves to be a kind of purified version of what the ancient gods were in some ways his take on it is is quite strong which is that he seems he says something like the version of mars and venus that we have on earth have been twisted by by the evil one and because our own let's say angel has twisted all these these stories and twisted all these images but there is in some ways a fined version of these so it's not like he's saying it's this is why i'm saying it's scandalous in the sense that he's not saying there's mars and then there's st michael right they say that's the way that i would more tend to have a i would tend to do it myself i would say there's st michael and there's mars and st michael is the true marshall spirit and the the the the one that is aligned with god mars was a kind of twisted version of it but what what cs le does he basically makes it the same figure he says there is mars and mars is an angel that that that worships god and the version that we get on earth is twisted by the devil that's what i that's what i find i find it interesting because i feel like you know i'm i'm i'm impressed at how far he's willing to go despite being a very orthodox small o orthodox christian and everybody seeing him as as you know someone who is a apologetics person for for christianity even to so i don't know if you had any thoughts on that yeah i i do think it's important to remember that cs lewis is not a saint and he's not right about everything and that you know and i was listening to your talk on subtle bodies actually and thinking about that and so sometimes it's hard to tell what lewis is doing for the sake of story for the sake of well this is one way to portray it within a a subc created world and when he trying when he's maybe proposing that he really thinks this right so that would be to me the question of how how are we then in lewis's cosmology to fit together an understanding of st michael and mars and it's so it's hard for me to know where sometimes he's been using tropes and images for the sake of the story and where he's really maybe experimentally exploring what he thinks you know a real cosm and one thing that concerns me about some of the things he says is he plays with the idea of maybe there's seven genders or there's you know he he just loved the medieval model so much and and he got i feel like he would get so excited about these symbolic structures that you know there's the seven planets and if two of them are gender then you know maybe are there seven genders and should we understand gender in some kind of bigger way there's a dialogue called unreal estates where he's kind of talking about science fiction with two other friends and in it he says has anyone successfully portrayed three genders in their fiction yet and those things to me are red flags they concern me because i really do think because of what's going on now well yeah that you know in terms of the the just chaotic loosening yeah of gender category and the fact that well what gender is is is a fractual representation of heaven and earth i mean you don't get that's the fundamental relationship between god and his creation between creator and creation between christ and his bride there is a fundamental duality yeah and and to to say well maybe the duality is sevenfold i i think is really dangerous it's dangerous well you might be surprised to find out that for example sam maith the confessor who i i i talk about a lot he he talks about three genders in the way he talks about it he he says there's masculine feminine and something which you could characterize as i think he uses the term extreme and the idea is that there's something something like masculine feminine and exceptional and in his third gender he puts that which is above and that which is below so b basically unix are the are third gender in the loose way that you understand gender understand unic which is like anybody who doesn't really fit it's like whether something happened to them or they're born weird or whatever it is like whoever doesn't totally fit is like is is a is that but then there's also this the the monk the monk is a third gender because he's not engaged in in sexuality and is there is trying to transcend gender so it's actually trying to interpret christ's very strange text which is yeah he says there are unix that are accidentally unix and there are unix that are unix that that i think like for the glory of god or something like that right so i would say that that's probably i i prefer that structure myself because one of the problems with absolute duality is that there really are things that don't fit like they just are and so you don't you you struggle if you if you don't have a category for the monster or the exception or the king or something which is beyond the normal structure of of a of kind of of duality then you then you you run into problems and you try and you try to make the work the world perfect you know so i i would say the best way to see it at least for me is to understand that there are three genders and that the third gender is is undefinable you could say is not is is is the exception is the is the thing that doesn't fit in the normal right the normal categories anyway can i can i try to to maybe resolve that i do feel like saying three genders is going to be confusing particular in our context but i do think there's a way to fit in the third category so let me let me try and like sketch this out because if you think of gender again as meaning genesis the way in which we generate new life i mean that what it is heaven and earth meet right and then that we gets new life on a fractal level right so you have adam and eve man and woman they participate in a certain way with the generation of new life and that new life itself is a fractal representation of heaven and earth right so the reserving gender for that language for the way in which new life is generated right and so if you have someone who doesn't fit that duality let's say i feel like calling it a third gender well i can see how from some perspective but one is there's in in this world there is discology there is the effect of the fall there is the lack of function right and and so people who don't fit because of something gone wrong that's one particular category and it's really important to to be willing to acknowledge that because it's by recognizing a discology that we can then in love and care seek to restore to proper order right so if someone we is born without let's say an arm or a leg we recognize that as dis function and form of what it is to be human and by recognizing that that's how we know to care about that person and to help supplement to restore them to the fullness of order as much as we can but then i think there's also so one way people don't fit the duality or that category is because of the fall because of of discology but another way they don't fit is because of of transcending to another level yeah right and so i think that and this might be the monk this would be the unic this would be the person who's going to transcend that generative duality on the biological level because they're going to participate in it on a higher level right the that they're going to more fully and directly participate in the marriage between heaven and earth that's going to generate new spiritual life and so i think that's another way those who don't fit so there's the dis teologico and then there's those who transcend who kind of move up a fractal level to a different meeting of heaven and earth and i just hesitate to like call that a third they're all the same no and i think you're absolutely right that it's wrong it's it's a it's dangerous to just it's dangerous to not to be able to distinguish in that category between that which is which transcends transcends above and that which falls out below and i think you're right i say that all the time right i talk about this too it's like you know in in scripture there's the separation of waters there's the waters above and the waters below ultimately they come from the same source but in reality like in practice they're not like they they are the opposites you know you the water that is below is mara and bitter and the water that comes from above is sweet and is you know and is and is let's say consumable and so i i totally agree with you but but just so you know that that it is the idea that there are three genders is something which is not completely alien of of christianity that it's there you know and trying to figure out how to deal with that that problem of some people transcending above and then like you said some people kind of falling out from from below so so so back to to to cs lewis he he ends up presenting in that hideous strength like the end of hideous strength is almost like a it's almost like a caricature like the way that it ends and that it's like everybody gets married like everybody gets you know everybody gets married even the animals and everybody is like getting everybody is is is uni uni unifying heaven and earth you know i was actually i i'd read it a long time ago but i reread it like a month ago and i was just surprised at just how much he put in there like just how how far he was willing to go in his in his analogy well you know it's like a shakespeare play on steroids that's right yeah that's what you know it's a tragedy if everyone dies and you know it's a comedy if everyone gets married even the animals yeah and he was very he seemed very conscious about that like he was very conscious that he was in some ways pushing the pushing the limit because you can hear the animals and everybody is is like is h is getting married so yeah but but you do you do have a representation of that person who transcends the physical you the level of sex right because ransom himself is in a sense a unic or a monk or a mystic so you do have i mean the key character in a sense the hero who himself transcends that duality on the material or physical familial level in in order to participate on the heavenly level and and he literally is ascends into heaven at the end of the book yeah and it's important also to explain that in a way that also helps people understand how you transcend which is that he doesn't transcend his gender by becoming confused that he doesn't he doesn't manifest confused gender in fact he manifests a refined version of gender a kind of hyper gender where he becomes a kind of hyper masculine not in the ridiculous way that we think of that on youtube now but in some ways he becomes a kind of purified version of of a man you know and there's even that scene where the the i forget the name of the characters but the the woman the the wife you know she's attracted to them and it's like but she's attracted to him in a in a strange way where in some ways it's almost like it doesn't make her want to sleep with him or anything but she's attracted to him in a way that makes her think of her husband ultimately like kind of brings her back to her husband but he becomes like this model of masculinity that reminds her you know that she's a woman let's say like something like that and and that's also i think the way that even in terms of monastics you see that in in the monastic life there isn't this sense of like confused gender but but rather the monks become very masculine you know and they they kind of have a they have a beard and they have a kind of discipline and they have a sense of their masculinity but it end ends in them transcending ultimately the physical the physical aspect of of just of just their their bodies and the same with nuns too like if you look at traditions of nuns how they would get married with christ like there's this very feminine aspect of how how nuns would exist in their in their monastic life but in the same way they're called to transcend the so so it's different from the way we think about it now which is you hear people now talk about transcending gender but what they the image of that is a confused gender right it's like a hermaphroditic idea but there's a difference between mixture and transcendence those are not the same right that's a good way of putting it and you know this idea of the cloud of unknowing above the waters above and the waters below i think that's a really helpful framework this is kind of an aside for the discussion of psychedelics yeah exactly right there's a way of opening up to the beyond the unseen in a way that dis integrates the mind actually and and then there's a way of transcending into the to the mystic the cloud above that does not disintegrate the mind but is a proper ascent where we do not turn over i don't want to say the word control because i don't mean control but full integration of the consciousness yeah and cs lewis has a really great image of that you know in the great divorce for example where he represents heaven as hyperreal in some ways right it's like he's not he doesn't have this kind of floating thing it's as if the more you transcend the identity the realer it actually becomes it's not a it's not a it's not a kind that's what that's the difference between christianity and some forms of mys ism which is that we don't believe that as we are united with god that we lose our our our uniqueness but rather the the fact that we are unique creatures in god becomes more and more bright as we come closer to the light that made us and so and i think that se lewis some of the images he has in the great divorce are really powerful to they're obviously they're they're they're imagistic you know we have have to be careful how serious we take them even he warns us about that in the great divorce but you know this idea of like the blade of grass that cuts right like the sense that that reality that the colors are so intense and that the the reality is so solid that it would that it's almost dangerous to a normal person because of how real it is right it's it lewis loves to play with flipping things on its head which i believe he really gets from dante right this is dante esque so dante you know in the medieval cosmology and you talked about this with richard roland in your last podcast there's the earth is at the bottom this you know the center but is a bottom and then as you move out from earth at mount purgatory through eden up into the heavens out into the third heaven which would be the the throne room and abode of god what happens and when dante finally gets there is that the whole cosmos flips inside out and all of a sudden the the the throne of god the the revelation of christ the the the yellow rose of the the church is the center and earth is the periphery earth is the outside and it's this kind of spatial inversion which i think lewis loved and that he saw it also in plato right where we think these material things are the most real but they're really in a sense shadows in the cave and as we move out toward god and toward reality there's a reversal and those are the really solid firm things and so lewis has always i think he really felt that the modern imagination had been inverted and he's continually working to try and flip the way that we're understanding understanding things yeah maybe go ahead maybe you can tell talk a bit about that because you you said that the whole trilogy is also modeled after in your impression like it does model after the divine comedy and so it's something that i didn't perceive as as simply maybe you can tell us how you see that yeah so the first book out of planet opens with a pedestrian in midlife on a journey in a dark wood right and so you always want to pay attention to the opening the beginning and so you know lewis here is very much evoking the archetype of the every man on a journey and you know it also hearkens to pilgrim's progress but i i think it also alludes to dante but rather than starting in hell and then progressing to through purgatory up to eden eden's at the top of purgatory right and then into the heavens i think what you have is a three book structure that reverses it is lewis takes his hero his pilgrim into heaven first and then from the heavens a vision of the heavens he moves to paralandra which is really paradise it's a new eden right which would be at the top of purgatory and then from that eden he descends to hell and most by the time we get to that hideous strength most scholars recognize the dantesque illusion and imagery there's one scholar david downing who actually thinks that the antagonists who participate in the nce are actually revealed to us in order of the circles of hell and so you start with kind of the virtuous pagans who would be like the the best scholars but they're kind of inept and ineffective but and then you're moving and moving and moving until you get i mean think about this the treacherous are the worst and they're the ones literally munched on by the mouth of satan yeah okay well how are the treacherous punished at the end of that hideous strength and the you've got this false head we talked about yeah and then they're munched on by i think the bear right so that there the animals come in and and and eat them basically yeah right so i really do think you have that kind of a a retelling of the divine comedy but in a way that's inverted for a world that's become inverted right so when dante was writing he could assume that his readers knew what heaven was that they believed in a heaven that they that they understood there's a highest good at which we aim and if that can be assumed then i can start by talking about sin by the way we miss the mark we we miss that highest transcendent aim but modern we don't believe in a highest aim we don't believe in that highest good or that heavenly aim and so then we don't understand what sin is because to turn one way is just as good as to turn another and so you know what i think lewis realized he need to begin with if he's going to tr seeking to revive a renewed understanding of a sacramental or symbolic world is he has to start with what was obvious to everybody there's a heaven and so he starts his pilgrim by taking him into the heavens and baptizing his imagination where he expects to find the emptiness the alien hostility of space instead he discovers the beauty the ecstasy of the heavens and the light and the glory and the joy so that's my proposal for how the ransom trilogy is a retelling of of dante's divine comedy but with a flipped structure for a flipped world i mean that when you say it i yeah i think that's right i had i hadn't totally understood it because i was not seeing the structure but now if you if you flip it and you see that that's exactly what happens because he goes to he goes to to eden you know and then even in the second book he goes down into like hell it's weird like he goes out he has he has a little like goes down to hell and then he goes up the mountain and then he comes up to the to the marriage between adam and eve ultimately like at the at the end of the of the book and he has that kind of basic structure in there as well but if you think of the whole structure like that yeah yeah that makes that that makes a lot of sense and so one of the there there there are a few more things that i'm that i'm questioning one of the things that really shocked me a little bit and in some ways it what made me write the made that video on the subtle bodies was the way in which he describes the angels you know and and and it's like i think that i have to i have to be careful because i think it is also possible that we have to see it from within the subc created world right we have to see it from within the world that he tried to create but because so so just so people listening know what i mean is that he describes the subtle bodies of the angels really as kind of like made of light or made of this translucent material and and because we have ghostbusters right because we have like slimer that you can kind of see through and but then he leaves a trace of slime all over where he's going and we have this but csis would have known about ectoplasm and about edgar case and about this idea of subtle the way that subtle bodies were interpreted as just basically material bodies that are less that are that are less physical but are still physical in that weird way i was a little worried about the way he described those bodies because i felt like like it could lead people to a kind of misunderstanding about what it is that we're talking about when we talk about these subtle bodies so i don't know if you had thoughts on that yeah i i do because i i really see what you're saying and so i did a little bit of research and i found a letter that lewis wrote to children so one thing i love about him is he people wrote him all the time and he did his best to respond to everybody even to children and so there's a collection of louis's letters to children that you can get that are really delightful so some children wrote to him about angels and his portray of angels and here's what he said to them the view that angels have no bodies of any kind has not always been held among christians the old idea early middle ages was that they had bodies of ether as we have bodies of gross matter the opposite view your view was one of the great scol plastics albert magnus thomas aquinus etc of course i just took for the purposes of a story that one that seemed most imaginable so i think this is what you're saying well within a story story is like poetry it uses the forms that sensory images in order to construct meaning so in a sense that's what you have to have work in that sense i get like i totally agree because it's like after i made that critique i was thinking about it myself it's like i just published a graphic novel with with a with a man with the head of a dog you know and it's like you know and so i don't and so i also i don't think that st christopher you know had was the descendant of a canine you know it's like i don't think that but i think the best way to represent whatever he was and the whever he presented himself was is that way because he's a monster in some ways and so it's like so then after that i i realized i'm being critical to cs lewis and the same critique could be applied to me which is like or did he really believe that st christopher is like a is a half man half dog in the in the kind of gross sense you know right and so and so so so then i i kind of i kind of so i think you're i think even reading that letter helps me to see that he he he definitely had a a sophisticated understanding that he was representing in a story yeah well there's a little bit more there's more of the quote though okay go for it yeah so i mean this part of the difficulty is we see right now but through a cloud darkly we the only way we experience heaven is through its manifestation right in the visible okay so he says i have no scruples about this because religiously the question seems to me of no importance i gotta think about that more i'm not sure the questions of no importance but then here's his last line anyway what do we mean by matter so that's what i find really interesting and and kind of what i was playing with and wondering and kind of wondering what you think this is just testing a theory is that lewis more than trying to use like say ectoplasm or i think he was kind of trying to tap into images that come from quantum theory okay that because there's one passage where he's talking about you know the difference i think it's one of the sorns who are like the philosophers and out of the silent planet he talks about speed and so we experience these things is solid because we live at a slower level whereas the a elila they they they move so quickly and i i might be getting this wrong but some of what i wonder is you know lewis was an idealist before he became a christian okay so he's gonna be he's g to be maybe biased towards an idealist understanding which which is opposite of the materialist so rather than dragging the angels down to the level of the material i wonder if he's playing with the idea in light of quantum theory of the fact that what is matter anyway isn't it all form elevating matter into the realm of form just slowed down yeah yeah does that make sense maybe yeah that that that that that is that is possible and but i think it's funny because now when you talk about this whole discussion on speed and stuff again it's like i'm kind of cringing of i cringe a little bit about those types of discussions and it's mostly because my own i think it's because of my own allergy of yeah of of when i when i grew up you know i was in a world where people were trying to constantly give scientific explanations for for the bible and for spiritual things and they ended up just constantly stepping in massive holes that they could never that they couldn't dig themselves out of and that's why like i always worry about people who talk about that quantum stuff because it's like you don't know what that stuff is and that stuff's meant to change at any moment and so if you make your your description like descriptions of things based on that you are you're i know you're in some you're a little bit of in danger you know it's like i remember people tell me things like angels are another dimensions and i was like what the hell are you talking about like you mean that scientifically are you sure you wanna you want to push down that road like are you sure that's what you want but anyway so i mean i i have to say like i those are the little parts of that that trilogy that we're kind of ah i didn't i i struggle with but you know obviously cs lewis was was clearly had insight amazing insight the last thing i i want to bring up with you and ask you what you think about is the whole merlin situation you know that is a that i think of of the in the that hideous strength is to me the most fascinating part of the story which is how cs lewis perceives merlin as a character and the way that he uses trickery like you know i've kind of joked about this idea a of the the the trickster or the joker you know the fool that that brings the king back it's something that mat talks about also quite a bit in his thinking but it seems like cs lewis did that in the book where he brings back this very strange figure to kind of bring about even more chaos which then which then sets things right so i don't know if you thought about merlin in the in that yeah it's it is one of the more controversial part parts of the book and one that i don't feel as that i have my head around as confidently as i do maybe say the way he's using gender but i i do think the best way that i understand it is if you go back in time so lewis was very influenced by owen barfield right and i even think that idea of speed that he is getting that from barfield's poetic diction and um saving the appearances where barfield's theory basically is is in the beginning we perceived things as holes so whereas now as moderns we we separate the thing and the meaning the sign and the meaning whereas in maybe our original unity we experience thing and meaning as the same and lewis he alludes to this in the language so he there's this old solar language which merlin speaks which ransom learns and it's he says it's pure language itself it's where the sounds and the the words themselves are not like our words are lar arbitrarily connected to the meaning right old solar is where you basically speak pure symbolic language and he talks about how the words fall like great stones you know just a really beautiful passage and so that earlier on our consciousness was a unity and it it started to separate right subject and object started to separate i start to know my thing as separate i we start to separate everything and you know for barfield's theory of language this is kind of you talk about this that that was an inevitable yeah but that the way forward is a reuniting and i really do think think this is important in lewis's vision is that you know the old sacramental view of the world was full of meaning and purpose and order and it and you talk about this it's still phenomenologically true it's still the way we experience the world phenomenologically okay now we have this objective way of knowing through science and analysis and coming from the outside and we feel like they're at odds but they're not they're not at odds odds because christ the logos in him all things hold together all you know and that and this is david bentley's heart and beauty david bentley heart's argument in beauty of the infinite which is phenomenal i think the best answer to postmodernism i've ever read except it's almost unreadable for most people so we really need someone to do a popular version of this book but you know because it's all love and grace the logos guaranteeing and creating so that our subjective meaningful experience of the world fits together with the objective way that the world is structured that the logos in me resonates with the logos in the world and that there is a connection these do fit together so barfield and lewis thought that okay our we we had an original unity where we didn't and they separated and then that's going to it's a little bit hegelian give us a greater synthesis where we're able to know both the subjective and the objective and reunite them in a a a a a higher level unity of of being and perception and barfield talks about that in terms of speed he kind of imagines and and so not speed maybe a physical motion but speed of perception that and this would be the higher consciousness where our our speed of perception is able to know both and integrate them at the same at the same time so that's the way i understood lewis looking at this idea of speed that the angels have that higher their their speed of perception and being whereas ours is slower and we experience thing as separates so but then to to connect to merlin right so his idea that as the world is moving from this original unity towards separation merlin stands at kind of a transition point and that that in that process of separation there would be unities between humanity and nature that we're not elicit but that as we've become as we've started to see ourselves objectively and separate from nature have become elicit and so and this is just the idea that he's playing with and he talks about one of his characters say that as the world you think of this in terms of your idea of the center and the margin the world in history in sense in a sense unfolds this way we began with a primal unity in in eden and as history is moving forward there's a a fragmentation and a separation that is happening and that so he's bringing back merlin from a a point in that process where he could still enact a certain task that has become illegitimate for us based on where we are at in the unfolding of history history all to say i do think it's speculative and you know in a world fascinated by the occult i feel like this is you know similar to the the problems people have with like harry potter right she's playing with certain ideas and and powers in a way that with our world who who is fascinated with the idea of tapping into the cloud of knowing below can be maybe misleading or confusing yeah one of one of the things about merlin that were fascinating to me was you know i like i had read i had read that a long time ago like in my early 20 even i think late teens early 20s and so there were some parts of it i didn't remember and so rereading it now that merlin part really stood out for me because i am i'm working on rewriting a story which is in the merlin legendarium it's a it's a romance called silence where there's i did a video about it but in that in that story merlin appears and merlin is the one that restores order in the end but the way that he does it is through laughter he laughs he laughs he mocks everything he laughs at everything and he laughs at all these things that look like scandals or that look like you shouldn't be laughing at them you know like let's say a funeral or or some tragedy or some beggars and he just laughs at them and at the end he kind of reveals the secret of why he's laughing for them and what it does is it restores everything in its proper place and there's something about and i was wondering like if first of all seef lus had read that text but then i realized that it's there also in other texts like in jeffrey monmouth's poem about merlin where merlin kind of plays that trickster role but a trickster that that restores the the world in the end through a kind of yeah through and and that's what happens in in the hideous strength because he all because there are some narrative tropes that he that he uses that he weren't necessary but that are almost there to kind of bring confusion to a brink where merlin is there in the in their in the ni but he's actually not him he brings someone else and that person is merlin but he's the other guy that is the translator but the translator is actually merlin and so there's this like everything is is confused and the appear nothing is what it seems and then through that he brings about like the liberation of nature and the kind of the return of this he almost brings about a kind of flood basically that destroys the the ni and so it's kind of weird it's fascinating because he because in some way cs swis presents merlin he says that great atlantean magic which that is like that's cod that's code word for pre flood like pre flood world and so he's a remainder of the pref flood world and that in some ways plays the role of what those ancient magicians would have done which is to bring about a flood right think about like the idea of the nephilim of the giants like their excessive magic and their kind of weird science and technology basically brought the flood about we don't know exactly how but they that's how it brought about the flood and so merlin does that but to the good ultimately it's weird like it's this whole weird flip thing where he brings about basically flood but it's to the salvation of the of the world so i i just thought like it was such a profound story trope and i and i was like how did he i mean i guess he was reading also all these medieval these medieval texts but i was really surprised to see because it does sound controversial but it seems to me that there's something about it which is if we're gonna bring the world back to if we're gonna make everything make sense in the end and everything is going to come together then it's like he undoes the pre flood world uses it to basically solve the problem of the end of the world and then brings about the final marriage like the final heavenly jerusalem anyways i'm still thinking about this but i was really surprised that how how how insightful his use of merlin was because it doesn't it seems weird like it's so surpris like why is mlin in this space trilogy of all things right it just looks like a like a at first you're like what is this random weird thing that it's like starts with the science fiction thing in space and it ends with like a sorcerer destroying the this weird secret society but i think i think yeah i think those he had very deep insights about how things play out right well that connects to what you're saying about the ai you know what we think that science again the tower of babel is raising up science is building up powers that we think come from science but then when the mask is revealed there's powers and principalities at work behind so i love the way that he uses science fiction as a genre genre to you know he thought it was the the locust in the modern world where the imagination was still open right where there was still an openness to discovery to new and so he uses that genre again to you know to he's always flipping things on its head to return you to an openness to powers and principalities and spiritual powers and i agree with you the first time i read it i thought what is going on it took me several reads and and i think everything you're describing makes a lot of sense and i just need it's just a part i haven't meditated on but you do note merlin is a big man so in terms of that connection to atlantis and to the nephilim he is portrayed as a giant but he's also he's not he's not clean he's dangerous like he's he's like why don't you kill i think he he he he like proposes to like kill like whatever transgression like and he's just like he's like this wild dangerous thing that you don't really want around you but that ultimately ends up and and but it makes me think a little bit because you know this whole tradition of merlin being the son of the devil or being the son of the dragon or something it makes me think about something the father step d young has helped me to understand something i've had intuition about for a long time which is how the church fathers talk about how the demons ultimately without knowing they're end they're gonna end up playing a role in service of god it's not we're not justifying them we're not saying that they're right and that what they're doing is good but that god is in god is ultimately in control and and through a mysterious way that they play the left hand of god right they kind of without even wanting to they end up playing this role in divine providence that will end up bringing about you know the final restoration and it's like it just seems like lewis had insights about that like very deep insight about that and that's why at first when you read it you're like why is merlin in this thing and then slowly it starts playing but i i haven't figured it out completely i'm still you can see i'm still working through it right now but i think there's something there are things to be meditated upon and how he uses this character in that way right i love what you say about laughter because very much in the medieval world you know you had a very well-ordered world right and and all things were to be in harmony with the the the the order of the cosmos the song of the cosmos and we're to live in that order and in that harmony but things you know because we're fallen and things get out of order they get out of tune they get distorted out of proportion and for the medieval that's what laughter does is it pokes that distortion it pokes that disorder and and and that's actually a kind gracious way to bring back humility and order to that which had become disproportionate out of tune and and i just i love that view of laughter i very much you know raising my own girls we talk about the importance of being able to laugh at yourself and that being able to laugh at yourself is the gentlest way to become aware of you know your weaknesses and and and so i love that merlin plays this you know div so he has this interesting figure and and i wonder okay so he lewis is using merlin to look at how do we deal with the end end of the world chaos where all is moving towards confusion where things are turned upside down and so you very much do have that doppelganger like that shadow figure you again i love harry potter snake plays this role you can never tell if he's good or bad yeah yeah yeah that's right right until the end and and ring also does this where it's actually voldemort's own spell that kills him right where it's it's actually playing that trickster so as to allow chaos to collapse in on itself yeah that's what that's definitely what you see in that hideous strength it's basically it's like you know everything the nic basically like just collapses on its own in its own thing and there is this return of nature you know the the idea of the animals coming it really is a flood although i think it there's mostly fire in the when how it's destroyed but it is that imagy of like just nature it's like if you if you distort reality nature comes back howling like you can't distort natural order long to for too long at some point it comes back and when it comes back it's it's not going to be nice to you you know and that just that's is that's is true about something as big as the ni in this story but it's also true that if you decide to eat junk food all the time like you if you if you try to distort order for too long it's like some point you're reality comes crashing back you know and that's something that i that that i see very powerfully and it it fits with cs lewis's basic idea about how in some ways hell is led from the inside and how you know in the great divorce he he's has the most powerful vision of how hell is basically you getting what you want and that you know and so and that it's not just this arbitrary thing but it's just a playing out of the of the of the of the patterns that you're involved so yeah right you which you see with the the antagonist and that hideous strength where what they wanted was to turn themselves over to the macrobes the demonic powers you know and and that that's what they get but it's revealed for what it is right which is a collapse into you know total total disintegration and you know what i i do think you know when we think about merlin and those end of the world spaces at the margin and the confusion and the chaos how do we live there what i wonder is you know i don't know that we're being offered i don't know so i really want to know what you think i don't know that we're being offered merlin as a model for our own i don't think so i think i think i don't think so i think that i think maybe it's the role of some people to play that to play that but i think mostly if you look at the way it's set up it's like the people you know the the people on ransom side they basically just wait like they they they basically keep them themselveses pure you could say they they they work you know they stay together they help each other they they kind of create this little world of of of holiness and then it's like it'll play out merlin basically will do what he has to do and he ends up working for us without us totally understanding why and it ends up happening and so i think that you know i think that it is the role of some people to to play that but merlin is destroyed also by the way in that in that act he's not he's not saved you know right yeah so i definitely think ransom and his community is the model and you know to to live faithfully yeah in natural communities right they they properly husband and steward their garden their nature they have rightly ordered relationship with themselves and they faithfully wait for the salvation of the lord to appear and like you're saying you know some someone might be called to be the merlin figure but woe is me i mean it's not it's not good for merlin doesn't end well for him and that story basically runs to his own destruction yeah so maybe that's how he save but still nonetheless that's what happens you know yeah all right well annie this has been a great
