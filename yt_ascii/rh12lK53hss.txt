the tesla model s plaid is the first and only production car i've ever seen that accelerates better than it decelerates in other words when you hit the go pedal it goes forward very quickly but when you hit those brakes it's not quite the same hello everyone and welcome in this video we're talking about whether or not the tesla model s plaid has crap brakes now if you haven't yet seen it the wonderful channel throttle house recently did review the model s plaid and one of their main concerns with the model s plaid was the lack of breaks so in this video we're going to break down the numbers and talk about how it is possible to accelerate faster than you decelerate so let's start with the first question does the plaid have crap breaks by comparing it to its most natural competitor the porsche tycoon turbo s so the tycoon turbo s having a peak horsepower 750 versus the model s plaid significantly more at 1020 horsepower the tycon turbo is heavier at 5 100 pounds versus the model s planet about 4 800 pounds but really i think the power is the more important factor here when it comes to braking we'll get into why in a moment so the porsche having 16.5 inch rotors up front brake rotors pretty massive 16.1 in the rear versus the tesla's 15-inch up front 14.4 in the rear so ticon turbo brakes significantly larger 1.5 inches in the front you know about 1.7 inches in the back larger so significantly larger brakes now does that mean everything well look at a ford f-350 this is a vehicle that weighs 7 000 pounds 14.3 inch brakes up front and in the rear so the tesla is bigger both the front and the rear than a 7 000 pound truck right so these aren't small brakes by any means but something to take into consideration is braking is all about kinetic energy right the car is moving really fast and you have to put that kinetic energy somewhere where you put it you put it in the brakes so kinetic energy one half mb squared a model s plaid traveling at 150 miles per hour has about 50 percent more kinetic energy than a ford f-350 traveling at a hundred miles per hour you have that velocity squared so that's very important the plat is capable of going very fast so it's going to be putting a ton of energy into those brakes a ford f-350 hopefully you're not driving you know 150 200 miles an hour it's going to be pretty sketchy and you're going to run out of brakes for sure so you know it's just not something you do in a truck versus this claim top speed 200 miles per hour so a lot of that is all about how much energy can you get rid of and we're looking at larger carbon ceramic brakes on the porsche tycoon versus smaller cast iron brakes on the model s plaid so it certainly is under braked in comparison to a tycon turbo s now what about braking performance well 60 to zero on the tycon turbo s takes 103 feet 104 feet for the plaid so on the road you know pretty much identical stopping distances on the road these brakes are fine 104 feet is good it's not a bad number the best car production cars are getting you know around 88 feet that's using better tires and they're lighter cars so considering that we're 104 feet pretty good braking for the road nothing to to look at and be like oh that's embarrassing great brakes for the road as far as the track now one interesting thing to look at as a comparison is lap times so lap times on the nurburgring for the porsche tycon turbo not the turbo s so the last powerful version did a 742 on the nurburgring versus the model s plaid it did it in 736 now that was claimed to be a completely stock car so stock brakes now something worth mentioning so i mean looking at that fairly similar numbers right it has a lot more power it's 670 for the turbo so significantly more power and you know kind of close six second gap there with them so it's able to do it right it's able to do that lap time quickly one of the things road and track pointed out is that they are lifting and coasting at some of the ends of those long straights so why would you lift and coast at the end of a long straight if you're trying to set the fastest time possible not a great idea but perhaps it is being done to save those breaks there could be other reasons relating to the battery but perhaps it is under braked and that's why they're doing it so for the track would i say that these are phenomenal track brakes no i definitely wouldn't say they are you can find smaller lighter slower cars that are using much larger brakes on them the big problem with the model s plaid brakes is that it has so much power right so it's able to get up to speed really really quickly then you have all this mass all this energy and you have to put it somewhere and so if you keep cycling that that's a ton of energy going into those brakes and they're not that big in comparison to some other vehicles out there so under brakes for the trek yeah i would probably say so that said i don't necessarily think this is a track car right it's not a track car so if you are going to take it to the track probably worth upgrading the brakes now that leads us to our second and much more complicated question how in the world does this thing accelerate better than it breaks so the numbers are 0 to 60 on an unprepared surface in 2.28 seconds requiring 98 feet to do it versus stopping from 60 to zero takes 104 feet so an additional six feet there on 0.1 second 2.38 seconds to stop so the thing here we need to think about is traction versus power limited most cars are traction limited when braking power limited when accelerating this tesla is in a very rare spot where it is traction limited in both scenarios whether it's accelerating or whether it's braking so your tires don't care right whether you're accelerating whether you're braking they've got about 1.2 gs you know we're talking good tires here that they can use to accelerate or brake now for a toyota corolla you're driving at 60 miles per hour you slam on the brakes it only takes 119 feet right it's traction limited the tires are the limiting factor to stop but when you try to accelerate that toyota corolla to 60 miles per hour well it takes over eight seconds it doesn't have a ridiculous amount of power to accelerate very quickly so the tesla has that combination of an absurd amount of power and you know it has brakes that work so that is a very rare combination that something has that much power and it's actually traction limited all the way up to 60 miles per hour they're averaging 1.23 g's for that first zero to 60. that is pretty incredible versus averaging 1.16 gs while decelerating the closest i have seen to something having these numbers reversed like the tesla does is the porsche 911 turbo s doing 0 to 60 and 98 feet same distance as the tesla here except a little bit slower about 0.2 seconds slower and 60 to zero in 97 feet so it is able to break just slightly better than accelerates one foot so why why is it doing this right well some people will say things like oh you know the tread pattern has a different way whether you're accelerating or whether you're decelerating it's acting on the ground in a different manner some people will say well the rear tires are larger right that explains it easier to accelerate where you put most of the weight on those rear tires versus when you're braking you've got those smaller front tires that are doing most of the work i don't think this is really the issue here i don't think these are the big factors that are playing into why these numbers are the way they are so the first part of this explanation has to do with anti-lock braking systems versus traction control and so we have a graph here to help understand this and i want to be very clear and that i made up this graph this is not a perfect demonstration of any vehicle out there i spoke with several engineers to understand the logic behind this but the graph itself is just a tool to help understand what's happening with the car so what are we looking at well we have a dotted line right here which is our available grip meaning you're driving down the road and there's a certain amount of grip between the tire and the rope your car doesn't know what that level of grip is right it has to figure it out and so what happens is when you floor it in that electric vehicle you request a certain amount of torque to apply down to the ground right you're saying hey give it all this torque so it's trying to figure out well how much grip do i have and how much torque can i put down so it searches it searches it sends more and more torque and then eventually your tire starts to spin right and when you start to spin it's like oh we sent too much torque to the ground we want to lower how much torque we send and you have this little corrective action occur and then it tries to stay just below that available grip right so you can get the maximum acceleration possible now abs is going to do the same thing but kind of in reverse right as you slam on the brakes it's trying to figure out hey how much grip do we have on this surface so it gives you more and more braking force more and more braking force eventually you start to lock those wheels up too much right and so as you start to lock those wheels up too much their speed of rotation you know decelerates well as that wheel starts to lock up you say oh we went past our available grip we want to come back down and you're hunting to go just below that available grip same thing with a combustion engine as you're accelerating right except the response time is even slower here because there's so many factors involved with changing how much torque does that combustion engine deliver an eevee is much better at doing this so you have a bit longer and more delayed reaction here to finding that correct perfect little spot where you want to set your torque at so you can accelerate perfectly and stay just below that available grip so if you look at response times for these different systems an ev may have a response time of about 50 milliseconds abs at 70 milliseconds combustion engine could be 100 to 250 milliseconds so realistically an ev is going to do a much better job of this you know two to five times quicker in reacting meaning it's finding that perfect little spot quicker than abs or an internal combustion engine and so when this is tested when motor trend does this test and they get these numbers that i've posted here they're starting that test at about 60.5 miles per hour and then they slam on the brakes and you have you know that abs trying to figure out hey where do i go so that's included within the test that figuring it out of where is my grip and so because of that you're going to have that slight amount of you know extra distance that you travel while breaking as that abs figures out hey where's the perfect spot to sit our you know braking force at and if you zoom in these aren't you know perfectly straight lines they're actually changing and it's always trying to figure out where is it at but it gets very close and it tries to stay in that region once it figures out what your grip is and it doesn't have slip occurring so that's part of the explanation right the electric car figures it out quicker it saves time in doing so getting to that desired grip and accelerating versus the abs may take a little bit longer to do so and not predict it quite as perfectly and it can't react as fast now one thing you might be wondering is how in the world did porsha do this so well you know these numbers are almost identical how are they able to do that if it takes so long for an engine to correct and find you know how much actual power can we put down okay change the torque level how do they do that well a couple things here first of all they're going to run multiple you know braking tests and accelerating tests in order to get that perfect number so this is going to be you know idealized it's not going to be like every time this is what you get second of all porsche does something very clever and so if you launch in one of their cars what you'll notice is they have dual clutch transmissions and you'll feel that clutch slipping so the rpm will stay high you'll hear it you'll see that you know the engine isn't really dropping that much in revs and it's allowing the clutch slip to figure out the traction rather than the engine so you're more dependent on that hydraulic actuation of the clutch rather than the actuation of your engine and saying oh we've provided too much torque from our engine let's cut that back you can react quicker using that clutch slip and so that's what i think gives kind of a reason of why these numbers here are so close and they have a very clever launch control methodology so abs versus traction control that's part of the story but the other part of the story is what i'm going to call the corvette effect because this is a vehicle that demonstrates something pretty clearly so under steer is a good thing in the eyes of car manufacturers why they don't want you to oversteer meaning the side of the car swings out the back of the car swings out you run into a tree it hits you from the side instead they want you to plow forward if you lose grip right so the car stays facing the direction you're heading you may run into something but you've got all that area in front of you to keep you safe so car manufacturers like understeer just a little bit because it's safer than oversteer so one of the things that happened that's very interesting is when we switched from the c7 corvette where the engine was towards the front versus the c8 corvette where the engine was towards the back we had a 50 50 weight distribution now we've got a 40 60 weight distribution meaning more weight on those rear tires the c7 also had older tires an older generation of tires versus the c8 gets newer tires and yet the c7 has a better braking distance 60 to zero and 90 feet versus 60 to 0 and 97 feet so what's going on here i actually spoke with corvette engineers and i was like hey why did your braking distance get worse when theoretically you've got better tires you've got better weight distribution meaning the rear tires are doing more braking so you're better distributing where that braking is occurring so it should be better overall and it's not right you've got another seven feet here so why is that the case well because they want to build in a little bit of understeer so why is that well if you have your mass located in the back right and you slam on those brakes so you have your weight shift forward your mass is of course still you know where it is so that engine is still in the back and you apply a steering input when you apply that steering input if these rear tires were at the limit and you have all this weight in the back well then the back's going to want to come around the second you start turning because you've taken the load off the rear tires you've got a lot of weight back there and so you provide that steering input and it slides around so how do you fix that well you slightly reduce the amount of braking that you have in the rear so they're not quite at lock up right they're not just barely below that line you leave a little buffer so that when you turn you still have grip available for rotating the car rather than sliding around so that helps explain why it went from 90 feet to 97 feet a little bit worse breaking these are both extremely good numbers right the corvette can break that's no issue but slightly worse because they build in so that you don't have that instability under braking so clever you know way of kind of getting around an oversteer problem with a car that has the engine towards the back so the same sort of logic can apply to this tesla model s plat it doesn't have quite the same weight distribution like the c8 48 in the front 52 in the rear but again think about what's happening under acceleration where you're putting all the weight on the rear of the car you're lightening that front end if you provide a steering input you've got that really light front end it doesn't have the grip to turn and so you understeer safe condition now what happens when we slam on the brakes well we shift that load forward so now we've got a really light rear end not much you know load on those rear tires and so if we were to provide a steering input under that load that rear end is light and you're providing you're saying hey turn and do some braking when you're already at the limit and that's going to cause you to oversteer you don't want that oversteer to happen from a safety perspective so you dial it back a little bit you take back a little bit of the braking so that in a straight line it's not perfect but it won't allow you to get rotated too much under breaking it'll keep you nice and stable so that's kind of the logic and i think these are really the two big reasons between these two here that explain why this very strange thing occurred where it is able to accelerate quicker than it breaks pretty well thank
