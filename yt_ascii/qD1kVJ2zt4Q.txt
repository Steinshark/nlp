ladies and gentlemen connecting the dots on crime isn't always an easy thing sometimes you want a nice neat narrative to answer all your questions and the reality is such a narrative doesn't really exist and when that happens it's incumbent on us to set the record straight to do the digging no one else wants to do the story we're setting straight today was actually talked about yesterday on this channel the story of defy 100 a crypto coin which allegedly exit scammed everybody and left a page on their website saying that we scammed all of you and you can't do about it new details have come out including fake doxes revenge developers and the actual person in charge of it denying all these claims have come out and i want to examine all of them today with you to find out who's innocent and who's guilty ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio i am coffeezilla the internet detective and today we're talking about d5 100 again we talked about this yesterday but some really big massive breaks in the case came out yesterday after i had made the video and i want to talk to you guys about them today to make sure that we're all on the same page because the last thing i want to do is leave you with misinformation unclarified unexamined now let's start from the beginning yesterday a website selling defy 100 tokens put up this image on their website and quickly crypto accounts began reporting on this the most notable was mr whale who said breaking defy 100 coin exit scams and runs away with 32 million dollars in investor funds but personally i was interested in finding out who was responsible for this i told everyone if you have a tip who the developer might be my dms are open i've been trying to hunt them down all morning i also warned everyone that someone had already been falsely doxed because he was thought to be in connection with d5 100 but he wasn't he just forked the github repo and as an aside don't dox people unless you're sure that they're actually part of something because i've seen now multiple doxxing of the developers that i don't think they actually were the main guy and i actually got the person who first leaked this docs to remove it because it wasn't actually the guy that they thought it was but anyway i said i said this and i got a response logo blog claimed that he was the developer of defy 100's website and he had to put the message up to bring out the developers from hiding and then he gave his telegram handle right here kiss my axe now at the same time this was happening defy 100's official twitter account which last tweeted on march 15th also went public and started posting things on may 23rd they said the website was hacked yesterday and the message was shown by the hackers it has been taken down in response to this crypto whale says they were doxxed and now are trying to claim they were hacked nice try to cover it up no one believes it but i wanted to investigate it anyways so i contacted this guy bloggo blog which i kind of expected to be a troll or something like that i got a lot of troll accounts telling me that they were connected or they knew who this guy was and of course they ended up not but i feel like i have to chase down you know a lot of these rabbit holes anyway just to see where they go so i got on telegram and i actually messaged this guy i said you sent a twitter message saying you're the admin of their wordpress can you prove that i was yes lol i'll send you screenshots of chats with devson now bear in mind devson is the develo the original guy the lead suspect in our defy 100 case and he said he developed their website so of course i asked for proof because this is pretty extraordinary because he's claiming to have put up the message that they scammed everybody he responds with the chat log between himself and devson the profile now i immediately checked and that is the guy's actual profile picture but then i found something that even further corroborated his story this screenshot from the official telegram group of d100 where devson himself claims that kiss my axe is updating the website he messaged me earlier to show the site he developed so far wow this is actually a massive break in the case we still don't know who devson is but now we know who's responsible for posting this message of we scammed you guys and you can't do about it now interestingly he signs off devson but now he's saying that actually it was him that put up the message the guy who originally made the website so i have asked of course why would you do that he responds that basically for two months the project was dead and the guy had basically abandoned the project and when the project began to fail he had originally offered to do website work for free he completed the website for them and basically was trying to launch the coin but devson stopped responding after waiting two months seems like he got tired and decided it was his job to bring devson to justice now at this point i'm wondering a lot of things about this guy's motives why he would do this so of course i asked him did if he lost money in the project he said yes and i asked how much apparently twelve thousand dollars or in finance token 30 b so this is a disgruntled developer who's working on this project for free and the original guy who started the whole project has it basically abandoned it and so he posts something it sounds like to try to get a bunch of like attention to it and try to make the guy come out of hiding or whatever by saying that basically they scammed everybody and signing it off as the guy i of course asked this person if he thought that devson had scammed everyone and he said this he is a loser who is technically poor and can't manage what he started of course he has made money but then he bailed when he couldn't handle community pressure it's kind of and this is his words a soft drug pull so if i'm reading this right he's saying this guy got way in over his head took the money and ran i'd call that a scam but it definitely complicates his motives now interestingly he still is anonymous even to this internal developer i asked him if he knew who it was he said no and then he said he even tried to put an ip tracker at one point when he wanted to know where this guy was but the guy's ip couldn't be recording he must be hiding it which is a perfect segue for our sponsor today express people no i'm just kidding little youtube sponsorship joke guys very very hot very hot anyways the guy was hiding his ip which to me once again that further implicates him i mean yes the story's gotten complicated but it definitely seems like this guy knew things could go wrong and wanted to protect himself if things did go wrong this devson guy if you're hiding if you're anonymous we have to ask why if you're masking your ip from even your own developers and that's why i said smart if he knew he was scamming so that's basically where we are now d100 has basically denied this saying that the website was hacked but that's not entirely true it was a real developer for the project the website guy who just got annoyed because he had lost tons of money with the project and the guy had ditched the project and he decided to basically draw a bunch of attention to it with this bombastic post and i thought you know we have to explain exactly what's happened defy 100 has gone on to say that the real losses to investors were smaller than originally reported rumors of scamming 32 mil are false and baseless and then he talks about the market cap but one thing that pisses me off is that this person says there is no exit scam and we're still working on finding a way to bring the project back on its feet and to this i have to say no you're not stop lying okay if your last tweet from this account before you got publicly called out was march 15th you're done with the project right you left in march 15th you weren't gonna suddenly come back you didn't suddenly feel bad for everybody if the one of your main website developers says he hasn't been in touch with you for two months you were done with the project you feel bad because you got caught out but you were done with the project so i really hate to see this back pedaling or whatever and you know what this developer he's anonymous you can't trust him no matter what especially if he tries to start a new coin or something saying he's gonna make everyone's money back do not trust him do not believe him anyways that's basically it that concludes the we scammed you guys and you can't do about it saga ladies and gentlemen it's been a journey stories of revenge false doxings i mean you have everything the the guy coming in denying it saying we were hacked that sort of being true but also sort of being not true this story has been a wild ride but either way i hope you didn't lose money i hope you were smart thanks for watching and i'll see you guys in the next one wake up and smell the coffee
