you probably know it's an exciting time to be in the market for an affordable flagship phone but that's never been as true as it is right now because of this let's get it open this is the xiaomi me 8 probe which has literally just been announced in the uk about five minutes ago the packaging is well put together but nonetheless a pretty familiar experience and inside you also get a transparent silicon case which is pretty normal but makes a lot more sense on a phone like this you'll see why in a minute there's a usb type-c 2 headphone jack adapter and if we just tip the phone out underneath there there is an' watt fast charger and of course a usb type-c cable for charging and data transfer [music] the me8 pro feels like xiaomi's equivalent to the 1 plus 60 both are in a similar price bracket and both offer in display fingerprint scanners over their predecessors and xiaomi has taken a different approach using what they call a pressure-sensitive scanner unlike other scanners that constantly ping to check whether you've placed your finger on them this one only activates when it detects pressure which means it not only saves power but can also work at just the right moment to speed things up to be honest i'm not a massive fan of in-display fingerprint scanners in their current state but the oneplus sixty kind of gets away with it because of how fast it is what surprised me then is that the me 8 pro is just as fast and the position is actually a bit higher up which means that i don't have to readjust my grip every time i want to use it like i do with the 60 so in a way it's better than the 60s which is a real achievement considering this is one of that phone's main selling points then we've got that transparent back which is an interesting one tear downs have shown that the components you're seeing here aren't the real deal just plastic cutouts made to look pretty which in my opinion kind of takes away from the charm of it at the same time i take this over a solid flat color any day it manages to look clean whilst also appealing to the nerd within me and while it might look like a toy it definitely doesn't feel like one the glass is firm with next to no flexing in terms of power the phone matches up almost perfectly with the wom plus equivalent it snapdragon 845 8 gigabytes of ram and 128 gigabytes of storage so in terms of gaming it's not gonna run into any issues but me ui the skin on top of android doesn't feel quite as snappy as the oxygen os on the oneplus 60 not to mention the playful aesthetic with soft pastel colors is completely at odds with the hardcore circuit board design of the phone but there are features in the software that i appreciate being able to adjust display color temperature using a color wheel is great and the built-in photo editor has all the features you'd want plus a few you didn't realize you wanted like being able to triangulate photos which turns them into a pretty neat wallpaper camera wise is the same setup as the standard me8 which makes it solid but it needs good lighting both cameras have a 12 megapixel resolution and in the day photos have a certain kris penis to them landscapes and buildings seem to come out really well but with only an f 1.8 aperture and no night mode of any sort low-light is an area where differences with more expensive phones become very clear also video stabilization leaves a lot to be desired and there's no option to record video at 60 frames per second even when you set the quality to 1080p from the front the phone doesn't look too different from cheaper phones like the pocke 4 and f 1 which is to say it's not bad but also pretty unsurprising like the pocke phone you do get an infrared face scanner hidden in that notch the me 8 pro has a 6.2 inch 1080p amoled display which reaches a brightness of 600 nits so you're generally okay outdoors but at the same time you won't confuse it for the galaxy note 2 9s display which can reach about 710 what worries me though is the battery while the standard me 8 had a 3400 milli ampere capacity this phone has only 3000 and my suspicion is that it's smaller here so they could fit that fake circuit board in it's not the end of the world and is somewhat helped by support for qualcomm quick charge for plus so full charge shouldn't take much longer than an hour so this is not a full review but so far the me8 pro feels like a very good phone but just one that's a little bit lost in this new wave of other very good phones i really want to love it but it's more expensive than the me 8 it comes with a smaller battery and is up against much fiercer competition what do you think if you are new to the channel it would mean a lot to me if you could smash that subscribe button i've got plenty more content on a lot of upcoming phones coming very soon but that being said my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
