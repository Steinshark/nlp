i lost a bet and you know what that means wait wait wait before we get to that not only have we now donated ten thousand dollars to save the children they actually reached out to us the channel for advice that's right the actual charity saved the children reached out saying they needed help getting the word out that they are not the same thing as save the kids they have been mistaken many times and so naturally i wanted to help and so i told them to highlight the difference we'd have to create a marketing campaign that appealed to the same people that save the kids reached and so to help spread the word after weeks of planning we created this hi i'm coffee zilla my name's ally and i'm a writer at save the children my name is ettore on the digital team at save the children my name is corey i work on the corporate partnerships team my name is austin lead multimedia producer and i support save the children charity save the children save the children it's come to our attention that there's been a lot of confusion thanks to all the crypto scams so we want to clear things up save the children had nothing to do with save the kids token this is the actual save the children logo it's a real non-profit that's been around for more than 100 years helping children this is save the kids it's not a charity so don't put your money there you could be saving the children instead wow that sounds like something i'd support and if you feel the same you can donate at the link below but with that out of the way there's nothing left to do but give you guys what you paid for time to go bald oh no [music] this is terrible oh my gosh it's worse than i thought this is bad enjoy it promises made promises kept well here you go guys this is this is what you all wanted it could be worse i guess besides looking like i'm about to join a cult it's really not bad and the important thing is that we raise some money for charity so thank you so much for a great year it's the best year of my life and i'll see you in 2022 [music]
