before we watch the fireship video there has to be a blog on recall cuz i am very curious about this so let's like read a little bit about the verge and what it has to say and then we'll we'll watch the fireship one i like to go into watching fireship videos with like a basic idea because it's it's exciting you know what i mean recall is microsoft's key to unlocking the future of pcs wow this is a microsoft dick writing right off right off the right off the bat microsoft's groundbreaking new ai powered tool can search and recall anything you've seen or done on your pc like a personal historian i'm not going to lie to you this sounds like the greatest spying of all time i knew it why why does it always have to turn into this this is just like this is not a good thing i'm not i'm not thinking this is a good thing here oh my goodness oh my goodness microsoft is launching recall for co-pilot plus pcs a new windows 11 tool that keeps track of everything you see and do on your computer and in return gives you the ability to search and retrieve anything you've done on the device did did you guys read this just just did you guys read it just in case you you missed it microsoft's launching recall for co-pilot plus pcs a new windows 11 tool that keeps track of everything you see and do on your computer hey how many of you would like to have your computer see everything you look at okay i haven't looked in prawn in 15 years okay i have less things to say hi than you guys do but damn i mean this is they're going to really know you like anime cat girls okay like you're going to search up anything you're going to be like hey what was i doing last week anime cat girls what about this anime cat girls what anime cat girls and you're going to be like damn it just show me how to play minec anime cat girls except it sees your passwords account numbers and all sorts of other things yeah i mean there's a lot of there's a lot of crazy things but it's optional yeah it's optional today the scope of recall which microsoft has internally called ai explorer why would you ever name a product after your worst product in the universe like honestly out of all things to name your product after why explor there has been no worse thing than internet explorer right that was it was so bad that they had to rename it edge and so what did they do their their their solution is to just do it again ai exploit man i bet you the nsa has never been happier nsa in china right now are just like this data oh yeah they're just so exciting every time they said it's air it creates and it creates trust it's trust themselves even less yeah it includes a logging things you do in apps tracking communications and live meetings remember dude this cannot how could you use this at any company honestly how do we not know just just hear me out on this one how do we not know that people who are inventing this aren't having some sort of secret aggregation in which they can view the sentiment of other publicly traded companies based on internal live meetings in which they can privately trade stock and have like a sharp ratio of like 30 like h how is this not just a huge vector for insider trading i mean this is worse than the united states senate that can trade on future understanding of laws this just seems like a total black hole of fraud remembering all websites you've visited for research and more all you need to do is perform a recall action which is like an ai powered search and it will present a snapshot of that period of time damn i would really love them to be like hey who wants to come up here and hand us their laptop and we'll do a live recall hey what' you do last night cat girls damn it a matter of fact everything you do on a pc appears on an explorable timeline you can scroll through oh my goodness dude people people be people begin to get just this is such a crazy feature you can also live search meetings and videos thanks to live captions which transcribes every and translates speech wow this is so invasive do people just really not care about having a company have that much access to your life like okay i'm going to throw out another complete crazy conspiracy are you ready for another complete crazy conspiracy microsoft will literally have the ability to control the past they could slightly lie to you about what things have been been said you know ai is hallucinate you know it's just a little hallucination you know it's not completely accurate but hey it's just a little bit of this i'm just saying they could they could actually they could actually memory whole things they could actually make somebody who they don't like look worse and make people who they do like look better they could change the video they could change the exact wording they could do all sorts of stuff they could do all like i'm just saying that level of power means they could it doesn't mean they will i'm not saying they will but i'm just saying they they they would have the the option to effectively make it such that you have a view into your past based on them them aggregating it for you i don't think it'll ever happen but still it's it's it's not the fact that it could or couldn't happen it's or it's not the fact that it will or will not happen because of microsoft's benev benevolence or malevolence it's the fact that it can happen to me that's kind of a little bit you know scary they say it's completely on device yeah i'm it's a completely on device today right can can you can you just apply any basic reasoning remember when facebook remember when facebook was it facebook or instagram one of the two apps said that they allowed you to effectively this was before shazam or during the shazam basics that you could play any song and capture it and it would tell you what song is playing and then they said in their agreement that they do not send any data up do they just happen to have every single song on your device is that what happened was that was that was that all that happened they just happened to have every single possible song on on your device and they are able to shazam it all without ever sending up any single message yeah they just happen to audio fingerprint the entire history of all songs and have it onto your on on your device okay i'm just going to say this that i think recall is genuinely recall is a great reason why i continue to use wind or linux but man this makes me want to you know makes me just remember why i like linux so much just some agency please just i know we just want agency if this technology sounds familiar microsoft tried something less powerful with windows 10 with timeline but discontinued the feature in 20 21 it's also because there's already a similar app for mac called rewind the software works on m series max and like recall logs everything you do listens to all of your meetings and gives you access to a chat b to recall anything it dude while rewind is a thirdparty app you have to why would you install this third party app how is this not like why are you giving giaan the back door okay at least let him try to steal your back door why give it to him what is wrong with you people oh my goodness what is this all right so now that we know what recall is let's go to youtube and let's pull up a recall this is crazy by the way this is actually crazy yesterday microsoft ceo saudi andella made a bold claim microsoft laptops don't suck anymore they're 58% faster than m3 and the ai era how do they measure this how do you measure something that's faster because aren't they like fundamentally different operating systems that's a crazy benchmark that they're running like what they run like internet explorer they're like well we're infinitely faster because internet explorer doesn't even run on back so if you think about it we like the best man that's this is such a wild statement to make by the way for computers officially begins he then pulled up tim cook on msn messenger and said how do you like them apples microsoft just unveiled the co-pilot plus pc not to be confused with github co-pilot or windows co-pilot pc the co-pilot plus pc is a radical new computing paradigm that runs windows on the arm cpu architecture thanks to the snapdragon elite chip but most importantly the chip has there's so many words just then okay okay okay so stuff's happening and apparently we have an npu a natural processing unit natural language process is this a 40 tops neural processing unit allowing them to pack this machine to the gills with artificial intelligence and there's one word everyone is using to cribe it creepy af it is may 21st 2024 and you were watching yeah it is very creepy like what we've seen so far or what i read from the verge okay can we all agree for a second how is the verge not getting just completely raked over the kohls by being so positive like how much were they paid by microsoft to make them seem positive cuz that was outrageous how like h they i mean it was full dick riding i can't even believe how positive they were they're making pc so great they're going to look at everything you do in the code report the co-pilot plus pc is one of the most interesting pieces of computer technology we've seen in a long time it's already created a lot of drama and intrigue but first let's talk about performance the product itself is a surface laptop designed primarily to compete with the macbook air but instead of using the traditional x86 cpu architecture with an intel or amd chip it uses the qualcomm snapdragon elite chip with the arm architect which can achieve far better battery life and run all your apps without overheating your groin microsoft claims it's 58% faster than an m3 ship on a macbook air and up to 0% faster than the m4 but there's some major trade-offs here for all of history any app running on windows has been designed to run on the x86 architecture and that means many applications simply won't work on these arm-based computers as of today apps like chrome and microsoft office will work and even adobe photoshop but other apps like adobe premiere don't even work yet and there's tons of other software that likely won't work on windows forarm for a long time however there is an application called prism that emulates arm for x86 which is similar to the rosetta emulator on mac now when apple made the switch to arm with does that mean docker is also going to be a pain in the ass apple silicon they basically told everyone to start developing forearm or gtfo microsoft can't exactly do that going forward they're going to need to support both arm and x86 for the you know apple is pretty interesting cuz they do just tell people to to shut up they're just like hey guess what i'm going to just we're just change you know what we're just going to flash is dead flash died and people are just like okay we own the platform figure it out and people just like accept that microsoft on the other hand is like oh you have a program from windows 3.1 come on in come on in and just play with our system buddy foreseeable future and another thing to keep an eye on is that intel is developing the lunar lake chip which apparently could bring x86 back to laptops but the big question here is why is everybody calling the co-pilot plus creepy well it has nothing to do with performance the most interesting feature of this device is something called recall and by recall i mean total recall it's constantly taking snapshots in the background of everything you do on your computer when the pixels change enough it takes a snapshot and stores it on device while also using on device image classifiers to determine what's inside that image i for one actually think this is really cool like i could ask really he thinks it's really cool fire ship i mean i understand why this is cool in the sense that you get to have everything that you've ever done recallable like like the the conceptually at a theoretical level i understand why it's cool the reason why i don't like it is because microsoft hey co-pilot what's that video i was working on a few weeks ago where the operating system has a logo of a penguin and instead of manually searching through my file directories like a caveman the co-pilot could just automatically find that file and open it for me pretty cool but this also feels like a data privacy nightmare like imagine i was part of a que that was trying to overthrow the congales government not only would i be worried about my browser search history but also every little thing i did privately locally on my computer at this point everybody's just accepted that the government illegally spies on us and recall seems like a great feature to build on this domestic spying infrastructure yep yep pre-at pret this nsa china right now are just so happy this is the greatest back door ever because you already know like you know for a fact that right now there are how many windows back doors running you guys you guys don't think valerant anti cheat system easy antiche isn't easy give me all your data and now you're going to have easy anti-che along with the log everything you do computer like has that not crossed your mind that hey hm crazy i'm going to log everything i've ever done and then i'm also going to give complete root privileges to some anti-che software that's developed in china cool or at the very least microsoft could sell your recall data so advertisers could influence your personal ai assistant to tell you what to buy yep like you you you don't think that selling your data is not a goal here yeah but it's a slippery slow fallacy i hate that i hate that that it's the stupidest thing to ever be said slippery slope fallacy is in itself a fallacy okay people that think that slippery slopes don't exist they've literally existed for all time in all places for every single situation there has never once been a situation which somebody says okay we want this new thing and we will never hence fault exceed this line it's like no no that does not exist okay nobody not ever once has ever seen a line a line and then went further like slipper no true some slippery slopes there isn't a slippery slope that's not a slippery slope it 100% of the time goes down the fact that we call it a fallacy is crazy you you live you live you like live in this dude it's like why are you living in this world that you think that's a fallacy oh my goodness it's wild it's actually wild that that somehow like at what point name one thing on the internet that hasn't turned us into that hasn't like slippery sloped us right out flip ban yourself i mean it's it's crazy slippery slope fallacy is a statement said by people who have never thought once beyond anything it is slippery slope fallacy is the all shallows are clear of of logical thinking okay all shallows are clear for those that don't know if you look into shallow enough water you can see the bottom and so if you get to a shallow enough water even if it's pretty dirty you can still see the bottom so you're like ah look that i can see through this water i can see i can understand and it's just like you know what that's because there's no depth to it you haven't thought beyond like a foot into it pretty dystopian but there's a couple things to keep in mind this recall feature is entirely on device it will never stay that way 100% again slippery slope falling so hard right now now the fact that you're going to sell people that it's okay to record all data for all time on your computer come on none of your recall data ever leaves the computer or goes into the cloud in addition you can delete the recall data just like your browser history and you have control over which apps it can remember how you can also delete your pictures off of facebook oh wait it actually just sets a flag that says deleted it doesn't actually delete the pictures it just simply deletes the ability to see the picture remember that remember that old remember that old good thing that came out yeah soft delite so soft so flaccid absolutely hilarious i said this in the beginning i think this is a cool idea like i love the idea i would trust it more if it's an open source program that runs on linux in which i opt into what it can track right like if i can fully understand it and it's fully local and it's fully open source then yeah i i would probably believe it more but the reality is this isn't open source this is by a company that just wants all of your money like ain't no way right like you could imagine that like obsidian obsidian obsidian tracker would be cool or something like that where you can actually go through and like do that right i think i think we could all agree that that'd be kind of nice i just doubt just doubt doubt windows 12 will use a subscription model too my guess and i've said this quite a few times and people say i'm cray cray is that we are nearing a future where your device is a thin device it just contra it contains a battery a battery and a very small operating system for displaying video and your entire device will exist in the cloud let's hope not no there's no hope not it will you will have 10day battery life devices but that's because they don't do anything other than realtime processing i i know you want this to not be true i want this not to be true either but it will be the cloud is someone else's computer but it's going to be microsoft's computer okay i i said this i made a bet with somebody that within 5 years we're going to start seeing this like it's going to be everywhere i still think within 5 years this will be everywhere i still believe it you've effectively started the slope i did not start the slope this has been going on for a while i told my boss at netflix i told my boss in 2021 that i think that we will as netflix be a completely a service that's completely rendered on the service within so much time and he said no and then we started live gaming we we already starting our fore into this entire idea of completely pier stuff latency latency latency you know latency doesn't really exist and nearly as bad as you think it does i know you want to think latency is bad but it's not nearly as bad as you think it is it's bad in certain countries and certain areas and that is getting better and better and better but stadia died of course stadia died because they tried to do tier one gaming don't be a dummy right you don't start there gaming will be the line holder for a long time it will effectively all like tier one aaa really huge expensive rendered games will all will probably remain on device hardware for a long time but everything else won't be right all of your little like mobile games like really mobile games do you really need that and a lot of people think they have like fast reflexes you don't have fast reflexes like everyone in this chat the average age here is above 30 in this chat if you think that you somehow can notice a 50 millisecond 100 millisecond leg you pretty much can't because you're too old and stupid to be able to see it okay like yikes sorry bud you're not some sort of adderal out'-year-old playing fortnite in his parents basement doing push-ups till you create a bowl of sweat and drinking it like that's not what you're doing here you're old and stupid i am old and stupid okay i am i get it i have skill issues the reason why i thought this was that i always thought there's no way ain't no way this would ever work out and then guess what i did i played netflix's live gaming on netflix's vpn in servers in chicago that means i went to the bay area from south dakota then from the bay area to chicago and then back from chicago to my machine through a vpn and guess what i was playing games that were like flappy bird required reflexes and i was doing really good i'm just saying you think it's like bad it's not nearly as bad as you think it is going to be and it's going to it's going to get better and it's going to get better and it's going to get better and it's going to get better watch you use and then of course at some point fusion reactors and quantum internet quantum computers or land we'll all have instantaneous everything so it's really not that creepy and i'm not even gaslighting here if you think this thing is creep creepy that's just because you're a crazy paranoid person co-pilot plus pc is your friend and gaslighting is not real but now here's the creepiest thing of all this device almost had the voice of scarlet johansson the dna of who i am is based on the millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me because one of the ai models on the copilot plus is gpt 4 oh sam ultman inspired by the dystopian movie her reached out to scarlet and asked her if they could clone her voice to use for their ai she was like no dude that's creepy leave me alone or i'm calling by the way b b johansson b johanson let's go let's go base johansson i i love the fact that she said no and sam in his god complex was like actually it's a yes it's a yes huh it's a yes it's a yes i'm saying i'm alman the people love me the verge writes articles about me twitter loves me twitter thinks elon sucks but i'm awesome i'm awesome maybe i have cnc sex parties and do heavy acid as been alleged on the internet but guess what that doesn't matter cuz i'm sam alman the internet loves me i can't do anything wrong give me your voice scarlett johansson and then she's like and we're now suing hnt it's not her it's hnt the cops sam was like i didn't mean it like that i'm happily married and agreed not to clone her voice however when gpt 40 dropped last week you may have noticed the uncanny resemblance to scarlet color me intrigued are you about to reveal something about ai she was not by the way that was so creepy the microsoft ai or the gpt 4 stuff the the girl voice was just horned out of its mind constantly ah really are you about to say something about ai you're talking about me aren't you m and you're just like i i don't have i i don't have a i don't have a owner not too happy about this and his threatening legal action against open ai so they discontinued that voice it's yet another big scandal for the world's most popular close source ai company and unfortunately that means we'll never get to live out the incel dystopian nightmare of using our microsoft co-pilot plus pcs as an ai girlfriend voiced by the academy award nominated actress we all expected this has been the code report thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one i did that was a great ending that was a great ending i absolutely love that you know what no one's ever gonna have a live service game nobody is going to ever have a live service game ever no you know what i was probably completely wrong about this idea that there could exist a game that's going to be live streams to anything there's just it's just not going to happen i really just don't think that that's a future we have to worry about you know what everybody you're going to be able to keep your you're going to be able to keep your device you're going to be able to keep your data you're going to be able to have your locally trained locally owned free range grass-fed models nobody's ever going to actually want to take your data ever for for any reason and we're going to all live in a very beautiful and wonderful world okay and so like hey how nice is that i'm so happy the name is the primagen
