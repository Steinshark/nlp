i'll keep the version of the story relatively short i always joke the long version is over scotch the short versions over beer but it's always entertaining so we started red octane as an online video game rental service so if you think all the way back to netflix when they were still shipping movies we were doing that but with games and that's kind of how we got into the game industry one of the games we were renting at the time was dance dance revolution ddr that was a really fun game and a lot of our customers really enjoyed it but they were asking us hey you rent the games but do you sell or rent the dance pads and for months we were like no we don't do any hardware we just rent video games online after we figured out that we had to actually generate revenue and raise money that's when we decided well why don't we start selling these dance packs so we were renting games on our website redoctane.com and then on the side we had this little tiny business that was like you know buy dance pads and that's really what helped helped us learn about music games and it also sort of what helped us learn about hardware so after about six months of reselling these dance pads we were getting a lot of feedback from our customers you know fans especially video game fans love to tell you what's good and what's bad right either oh this is great or here's some ideas or boy your product you know really sucks you know it's breaking or it's broken and so we took all these ideas and the feedback that we got and we decided well rather than just buy and resell we decided why don't we try to make dance packs because a year of knocking on their doors but we finally got in and were able to sell into brick and mortar retail so coming off of holiday in 2004 you know we had a good sort of sales year with our dance pads which were very high margin and we decided hey we need to expand our business we didn't do software at the time so we went to a lot of the japanese video game publishers konami sega namco they were the ones who created music games in japan but they kept them all in japan dance dance revolution was one of the few games that they brought to the us so we went to them and said hey why don't you bring your music games to the us we just wanted to make hardware right because that was kind of our business at the time and universally they told us well we don't think there's a market for music games in the us given a reason or kind of like i think you know if you look back historically they said outside of dance dance revolution music games just don't sell in the u.s startups are all about creating new markets right they're not about sort of following generally or expanding markets they're about creating new markets so we believed it we didn't know how big it would get but we decided well if they're not going to do music games in the us then we had to do it ourselves right at that time our business was dependent on them if they didn't release music games we couldn't make hardware for them right so the only way to sort of take control of our own destiny for our business was we had to get into the video game publishing business when did you realize that like this guitar hero product was starting to really take off like was there kind of like a turning point yeah you know they were a lot of different sort of little hints especially at the beginning i heard that somebody at sony had booked a conference room and set up guitar hero for the entire day and people were just going in and playing the game which was pretty fun to hear and then we also heard that they were playing the game up at nintendo which again we didn't make the game for the nintendo platform we only made it for sony so they were bringing the sony playstations at nintendo headquarters and playing guitar hero there hope you enjoyed the little video go check out the full podcast episode with kai huang over at the startup island taiwan podcast amazing episode link below i guess toast there from time to time interviewing various people about the taiwan startup community if you like it check it out subscribe and yeah i'll see you guys later
