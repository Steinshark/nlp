prompt engineering is the new c plus plus so does that mean it's a shitty experience in which we're going to continuously make changes that will never actually be kept up on is that is that what it is what is what does it mean what does it mean to be the new c plus you'd think you'd pick a better language to begin with like anything over engineered prompt engineering they made this with a pruned engineer did you know that then they got python and apparently see i don't get this image at all this image makes no sense okay can a programming language ever get replaced one might say that c was replaced by c plus plus who's that one which was later replaced by python am i getting chad zipadeed we're not even we're literally one sentence in i'm getting chad chip and eat out of my mind right now like right now this is happening c plus plus was replaced by python you heard it here first folks though python has been able to stand its ground amid a rapidly rising languages like rust the latest competitor is our beloved english writing on proofed engineering prompt programming is something that python folks are forced to hate foreign former deepmind and ex-microsoft researcher put it the history of computer science is the history of smirking at one thing that's about to replace you okay english cannot even sort out dude this is very confusing during the microsoft build 2023 there was a great emphasis on the fact that now everyone's a developer my mom's a developer a picky in the audience i was just wondering something really quickly i was wondering if your mom needs me to come over and debug her program i mean now that she's a developer and all i could come over and develop her i could i could come over and debug her program maybe a little one-on-one training you know just let me know let me know i'll be over with the rise of models that can write codes for everyone oh i love i love pearlized code nothing says hey everybody i'm a boomer like throwing the word like just just putting an s on anything i love it it's my favorite my favorite boomer activity is putting an s on something anyways so anyone can write with the rise of these models like write codes for everyone with just a single prompt but on the other hand the creator of models such as chad jeopardy sam altman believes otherwise he believes that the current state of proved engineering is only because of the temporal temporary limitations and capabilities of large language model he believes in his mind i mean i guess you got you could believe in your mind or in your heart right like there's kind of two locations when you really think about it there's two locations in which you can believe this is just an example and i actually just pressed that i just pressed the link he believes in his mind that anyone who does proved engineering right now would not be doing it in the next five years that is not because it will become a that it will become a fad it is because everyone including llvms would be too proficient in understanding what the user wants and generating it perfectly is it a tall claim firstly it might be true technologically altman being the creator of such models might be able to estimate the possibilities that these llms hold in the future so just so you know historically people that have researched ai we're talking about from the 60s and on have been some of the worst projectors of how much ai is going to take over pick pick are you calling it are you calling it right now damn it i don't have it up picks calling it okay pick's calling it we gotta go to downloads really quickly wait where's my downloads where is it unnecessary dick riding we're calling it calling everybody flag on the play everybody flag on the play right here right now sorry sam altman flag secondly secondly language language being the most important tool in the world is not something that anyone would deny text is the projection of the world said open ai's co-founder isla suits caver while he was talking about the capabilities of llms and the text-based models would possibly lead to agi it could it can also be said that the perfect arrangement of words to bring out meaning and information is always going to be mightier than any sword ask man that's what we're talking about huh huh boys it's article sexist let's see c plus plus java python c x86 mips html javascript access group bash ruby squeal this is great what if the sword is like really big like elden ring big yeah i don't think you can talk your way out of that one coming back to programming languages just as python could not replace c plus plus okay now you're giving me a mixed okay these are mixed signals hold on hold on scroll up to the top here for a second which was later replaced by python just as python could not replace c plus blood okay what's happening here what is what's what is happening here please just be consistent i you know i don't care that you have a bad idea i just care that you have the same bad idea every time i read your bad ideas okay not in the single course of one bad idea do you have two confounding bad ideas prompts may not be able to replace coding some people still use assembly c c plus plus for building frameworks and algorithms python is good for machine learning and proved engineering is good for building models quickly but to build a foundation from scratch c or c plus plus is always going to be there would have a lot of questions for someone that's like hey what are you gonna do i'm gonna build a new company what are you gonna do with it c plus plus i'd be like okay okay okay you get that virtual constructor that is not to say that proved engineering holds no value it has already found its niche and is probably going to stay here for a while i'm certain cases a lot of proved engineering jobs pay more than python temporarily it might look like proved programming is actually replacing python what will replace print engineering if we think about it you know binary is the only real language absolutely prompting is very similar to a lot of other languages it is just a language that feels closer to human languages going on chad jeopardy or codex is just typing in what you want does not work that easily it's a skill to learn well i actually don't know how to do i i'm trying to become a great proofed engineer and i'm just not quite there yet anyone who has tried building models by throwing proofs at these models would know that it's not a piece of cake the best part about printing is that it's mostly just trial and error if one prompt doesn't work try another it might work out eventually but isn't that the case with a lot of programming languages as well you need to have the basic knowledge of coding before you jump into python proved engineering just removes that barrier to entry as well this is like a milky this is a milk this is a milky joke apart from the legal and ethical issues of copying code from stack overflow ethical issues ethical what the only ethics you should have about copying code from stack overflow is the fact you're putting stack overflow code into any of the programs you are writing you should feel ashamed of yourself more than anything else okay that's the only ethical question you should be asking yourself is do i really want to put what's in stack overflow into this program because it's a it's a roll of the dice that is a roll of the dice gee and other programmers the problem with these co-generation platforms is that they are not perfect even if two people generate the same proof the results might be different moreover debugging the code written by these models is a task in itself one would require the knowledge of programming languages yes so what would kill proved engineering probably in a few years as llms gets better it would be in everybody's ability to generate perfect outputs every time by the way the most interesting thing that would kill proved engineering would be the would be thought printing with neural link oh man is that like a tesla business we're gonna get tesla right is elon musk going to put an a on my brain oh gosh oh gosh with similar projects coming into the picture soon just like poop python puthon developers smirk at proved engineering proved folks would jeer at them these thought-proopers can't even type their own prunes losers and that's the end of the article all right everybody you heard it here first python has officially replaced c plus plus python hasn't replaced c plus plus and neural links going straight in your butthole and you're gonna be able to think programs up thought printers that actually sounds like 1984. i don't think i like this article anymore hey kids is that how it's gonna become popularized plus ai energy classic equals mc squared plus ai energy 10 out of 10. i hope everybody likes neural link going in the brains you know this is not written by jeopardy because it's dumb at least jeopardy would have a sensibility not to toss out that ending okay come on marker end of pruned it's not even a brilliant i know you should have proofed out the article come on hey the name is the primogen sorry for dogging on the article but it was especially bad
