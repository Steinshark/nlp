we're going back to fluids, my favourite! we're going to talk about the drag equation. this tells us the friction, or the air resistance, i.e the drag, acting on an object which is moving through a fluid. let's say our sphere is moving that way, then as it does as it moves through the air the air pushes back and it's going to create this frictional air resistance drag force and we actually have an equation for what that is- (brady: the air being fluid by the way? 
you keep) (saying fluid but air is a fluid?)
- air is a fluid! right, fluids are things that change shape to fit the container that they are inside. so all gases, all liquids, even 
some things that you might think of solids blend over into fluid. so yes, here we're thinking air is definitely a fluid for the purposes of fluid dynamics in this particular equation. so the equation says that the drag force is equal to one half times rho, where this is the fluid density, multiplied by my velocity squared multiplied by the drag coefficient cd - so this will depend on your object, the shape of your object what it's made from lots of things are going to affect
this. finally a which we call the 2d projected area. so you can think of this as the bit of your object that's kind of like hitting that wall of air. 
- (brady: the leading face?) the leading face, yes. so if you were - gonna test my artistic talents - so if you're like a car you've really got like the bonnet and then kind of it kind of angles up and this would be like your windscreen and then like the roof, and then you'd have your tyres sticking out. so this is a car coming towards you, this area here is the frontal area because this is what the air hits as the car is coming towards you. so imagine like, in all of these situations the frontal area is as the object is moving towards you what do you see? and this is it, we just need to know these values and this will give us the drag force for a particular object. also it is important to say that this will vary depending on the reynolds number, which is something i've talked about before. and what we tend to assume here is that the flow is turbulent so that means you're working here with a reynolds number of about 10 to the 4. that is true for dropping a ball off a building, that is true for a car driving; it's turbulent flow, that's when this equation is true. if you have laminar flow which is a bit more relaxed chill you're going much more slowly then it's a different equation. you get what's called a linear drag equation, but we're talking about turbulent flow quadratic drag, this form. so if i have my sphere and i've got the air coming at it like this then this has a cd value of 0.47. if we then compare that to say a cube this has a drag coefficient of 1.05; and then something else that perhaps some of you picked up on is the orientation here is going to be
important. so if we change the cube and had it same size, put it on its side like this, and then you have the air coming in. it makes it more aerodynamic, the air is going to hit and kind of pass around that shape; so here the drag coefficient
goes down. there's less drag because it's a more streamlined shape.
- (brady: tom does the) (material the object is made of make a) (difference towards drag coefficient?) yes. it will in some contexts. i think if you've got a sphere that's, let's say made from metal versus made from lead, it's not really gonna have a big effect because it's still the- (brady: but lead is a metal!)
- it's definitely having no having no effect, okay. if you've got like a steel sphere versus let's say a concrete sphere it's still smooth enough that the change would hardly have an effect. but if you had a steel sphere versus, i don't know, a sphere made of like candy floss that's going to have an effect because they're actually- there are like holes in the candy floss; or if it's like made of like a mesh, there are holes and that's what's going to have an effect. or even- it's more the
the smoothness of the surface. so like a golf ball is a sphere but has a lower drag coefficient because it has the dimples to make it more aerodynamic. so with the angled cube, just to sort of complete this, it actually drops from 1.05 to 0.8. and then the most streamlined thing, it's literally called a streamlined body or an aerofoil, this has a drag coefficient of 0.04. these things, this shape kind of comes out of the the actual computation and calculation of how do we make this as small as possible. so the air kind of comes in, it sort of separates here and goes around like so and then this tail kind of causes it to come back together at the
end. rather than it breaking off and creating all of this turbulence behind it that adds to the drag, so the fact that it can sort of stick and come back together at the end makes it really nice and streamlined. so what we're going to do is we're going to
take some well-known objects and we're going to pretend that we are dropping them through the air, or maybe in the ocean. so race one, we are doing falling objects through the air. (brady: this is a drag race!)
- it's a drag race, okay it's a drag race yeah we're doing a drag race. imagine taking a human being and let's say a bowling ball; and we're going to drop both of these out of a plane, something like a normal skydive jump let's go with that. so we're going to drop both of these objects out of the plane and then the drag equation will tell you who will win the drag race, like which object will hit the ground first between the human and the bowling ball if dropped
from a plane. so we need to figure out these parameters; but before we do that we also need to think about what other forces are actually present in this situation. so we've talked about drag, so if this is my bowling ball which is falling as this is coming down the page towards the ground the drag force is acting in that direction, it's pushing 
it up. the reason it's falling in the first place is from gravity, it's pulling it, gravitational acceleration. so the force there is mass times gravitational acceleration. so you've got a force balance and this will be the same for the human. and so what's going to happen is when you drop your object, you're initially at zero so we're going to start start from rest that is important. so we're starting from rest so we're jumping out of a plane or dropping out of a plane. so we're starting at zero velocity. so at the beginning you're going to accelerate, gravity is pulling you to the earth you're going to speed up. as you speed up velocity goes up, drag looks like velocity squared. so as v goes up drag goes up. you're going to speed up more and more from gravity and you're going
to have more and more drag pushing against you and eventually they're going to be perfectly balanced. you will not stop, you will reach a constant speed. (brady: you won't just float in the air?) that'd be great, wouldn't it? 
so you accelerate most at the beginning and your acceleration slows down, but your speed is continually increasing until it reaches a flat point and that's called your terminal velocity. whichever one has the fastest terminal velocity will win.
- (brady: unless you've) (dropped from really really low) unless you drop from really low, yeah, no you make a good point. your your velocity in general looks something like this; this is time and this is going to be v for velocity. and then you can see here, so this would be your terminal velocity your maximum vt. so what you see is you you increase faster faster and then you slow down slow down slow down slow down slow down slow
down and then you'd never get- so this is the shape that you get and you can solve the equations and get this exact shape. so we actually know the- these the time it takes to reach your terminal velocity on a skydive, because lots of people do it! so after three seconds you're about 50% of the way there, after eight seconds you're about 90% of the way and after 15 seconds you're about 99%. it's tending towards this as time goes to infinity, so you're probably never going to exactly reach the terminal velocity but you're going to get so close that we can say you are. we're assuming here, we're reaching it and that's going to be our speed and that's going to determine who wins the race. so to actually get the equation then we've got to solve drag force equals gravity. so we want to know when these are equal, we know the formula for drag force, so we just say that's a half rho v squared cd a equals mg; and this is what we're interested in, right, the velocity is what we care about so you rearrange this and we're going to get: v equals 2 mg, now i've got to divide by the rho, the drag coefficient the area and then i've got a square root. and we take the positive square root because, well we're falling down, but we have a- we're taking the positive value of velocity. so this is going to be our terminal velocity here. so in order to figure this out for our human and for our bowling ball we need to know these values. and we just plug them in and whichever one has the highest terminal velocity is going to win our race. what's your- what's your money on? human versus bowling ball?
- (brady: i think the) (bowling ball is going to hit the ground
first.) okay, all right, yeah, well we'll see we'll see. it's kind of like it's- obviously the human's heavier but yeah there's something else going on i think- (brady: there's more area, it feels
like more area.) (and not quite dense enough for its mass) (to overtake- well we'll see.)
- yeah yeah, (i'm not totally confident.)
- okay, all right, so so we're going for we think it might be the bowling ball. (how's the human falling?)
- yeah, like star jumping let's say kind of (sort of pancaking? they're not, they're) (not going head first?)
- not going head first yeah, no that is important. 
- (so you're almost) (giving your maximum amount of area you
could?) yes yes you're not like going head first and trying to go really fast yeah, which would be terrifying. we need to just know all of these values now: 2 doesn't change, gravity - so i'll write that over here because that's not going to change, that's 9.81 meters per second squared, gravitational acceleration on earth. the mass m, that matters so m. a human 100kg ish? (that's heavy but yeah but it's around-) it's a nice number yeah, we like nice numbers, we're going 100kg. a bowling ball i think around like 5 kg? they're about eight and a half pounds i think so 5kg. then we've got the air density, so that doesn't change because we're falling through air. it's a bit of an approximation, we're going to just take it to be constant. right so 1.225 kilograms per metre cubed is sort of average air density i think at 15 degrees at like sea level. so obviously when you're a bit higher up it's a bit thinner; it's the same for both of them as well so it doesn't really matter too much does it? now the interesting ones: we've got the drag coefficient, and then we've got the area. so the bowling ball, it's a sphere, we already said what the drag coefficient of a sphere was, it's 0.47. so even though it has a couple of holes for your hands they're not going to have that big of an effect so it's about 0.47. and it is nice and smooth as well, so that's- maybe maybe the super smooth it's really well polished maybe that overcomes the little holes for your fingers. now for a human; so this value this will depend on the human, right, because you can have somebody who's really really skinny is possibly going to be more aerodynamic than someone who is more round. 
- (brady: doesn't the) (area take care of that though?) yes but it's also going to have an effect on the drag coefficient as well. so the area, yeah the area is obviously gonna-
- (and you could be) (hairy and not hairy..)
- exactly, very good, yeah hairy and not hairy etc. so so this is about 
between 1 and 1.3. so you can- you know, various experiments have been done on humans it's somewhere between 1 and 1.3. now the area; so bowling ball it's a sphere, as it's coming towards you it's 2d projected area will be a circle, you're seeing a circle. it's quite- potentially hard to visualise but it would be a circle, it's like the projection of the sphere into 2d is going to be a circle. so it's-
- (it's not) (that hard to visualise, you've drawn one
there!) right so so the area then is is going to be pi times the radius squared; i think the radius for a bowling ball is about radius i think is 11 centimeters for a standard so the area is going to be 0.036 metres squared. it's quite a small area.
the area for a human, this is going to vary quite a bit depending on the size of your human. i did some rough calculations and said well using nice numbers about two meters tall, about like half a metre wide, it's kind of like one metre squared - about. ranging from less as well. 
- (that's a big human, but yeah.) it's a big human so i think i think i went for like 0.5 to 1 metre squared i think here. that was you know there's enough of a range in there, i think i actually used 1 in the calculation so it's a reasonably big
human, feel free to obviously import your own numbers, maybe measure yourself and find out what your frontal area is and plug it into the formula, see how fast you would be. so now we've actually got everything and we can get the terminal velocity, so this is the big moment, whichever one of these is bigger is going to win our race. so the human, you get around 37 metres per second which is pretty fast. that is really fast, you're moving 37 metres every second when you fall at terminal velocity through the air. now the bowling ball! so this is what your money was on wasn't it? so the bowling ball, the velocity here is about 69 metres per second.
- (boom!) boom! i know. so it's actually wins by quite a long way. you had the right idea when we were chatting about this, right? the the bowling ball is a lot smaller, so it has a much lower
mass, so its velocity is less because m is going down. these two on the bottom are much smaller as well, the drag and the area is so much smaller for the bowling
ball compared to the human it really wins out. so it would be almost 
twice as fast, i think if we did an average skydive - somewhere between 10 and 14 000 feet - i think i did 12000 to get a nice average number, you can calculate this so time to fall i think i did 4 000 metres, 13 000 feet or so. for the human this would take about 108 seconds whereas the bowling ball would take 58 seconds. so just under a minute, the bowling ball hits the ground,
whereas the human you're going like 1 minute 40, 1 minute 50. so bowling ball wins quite a long way actually.
- (brady: have you ever been skydiving?) i haven't. i'd be up for it!
- (you seem like) (someone who would have done it!) i've done a bungee jump, and this kind of put me off. i always wanted to do a bungee jump and then the- i was, i got to the top and the guy was like right you're gonna go i was like okay fine straight away and that that moment i don't think i could describe, it just felt so wrong. i'm facing the ground, you don't feel like you're attached. and so it kind of scared me that if i jumped out of a plane i'd have the exact same like urgh-
- (i think a plane's) (so much higher though it doesn't seem) (real?)
- that's the other thing, because yeah because with the bungee you can see the ground; the plane you're just kind of like i'm floating this is great and then- (anyway i haven't done it either so) so now we're going to look at a second example, we're going to compare much bigger objects and imagine dropping them overboard from a ship and allowing them to sink to the bottom of the ocean. because you've got the same forces; you've got gravity pulling them down to the depth of the ocean, and you've got the drag force pushing up. so it's in a slightly different fluid so some of our parameters will change but it means we can sort of pretend to do this with larger objects. so we're going to consider the eiffel tower; versus the empire state building; versus a wrecking ball.
- (brady: orientations and) (where we're dropping them)
- so if we have the eiffel tower, this is where you're measuring the drag. the eiffel tower is kind of falling down
like this, turn on its side and let it drop like that. 
- (and that's because you've got all) (the drag coefficients?)
- exactly that's because to be able to do these calculations you need this drag coefficient and for the eiffel tower in the empire state building we actually have estimates of the values based on wind blowing into them, so that's what we need for that particular sideways angle. (all right, oh, so what's going to win?) yeah so this time you've got like the, the very big heavy box-like empire state, like lots of concrete and metal; you've got the eiffel tower which is a little bit smaller but obviously still quite tall, still quite heavy- 
- (are we taking its sort of) (holeyness into account? all the
mesh of it?) yeah yeah exactly, i was about to
say - that's the key with the eiffel tower it's- the empire state is just like glass and concrete and metal, the eiffel tower's got lots of holes. and then you've got, just just to throw it into the mix, you've got
just a big like concrete wrecking ball. 
- (brady: i reckon the) (wrecking ball first-) all right so is that based on the bowling ball having won last time? you think there's something about the sphere? (just the- my intuition is it would) (just plunge quickly.)
- yeah (and then i think- although the one thing) (you're not taking into account; when) (things sink) (i imagine like doing that, but these) (aren't going to do
that are they? they're) (just going to push straight down?)
- yeah, yeah they're all heavy enough that there's not- yeh they're going to just
drop, they are going to just drop. (in that case the empire state building.) all right so you think wrecking ball first?
- (wrecking ball, empire state but-) (the empire state building might beat the) (wrecking ball actually...) (and i reckon the eiffel tower last.)
- all right. (for some reason.)
- okay so it's the same idea, we need to just know what is our terminal velocity and whichever ones have the highest value that is going to win our race. so now we're moving in water, so in the ocean. gravity of course doesn't change, 9.81 metres per second squared. now the density does change. so we're going to do this at the, uh, let's do it at the marianas trench- mariana trench. the the deepest point in the ocean at 11000 metres. so the average density of the pacific ocean is 1036 kilograms per metre cubed. so we've got gravity doesn't change, the density is fixed for all of them 1036 kilograms, so obviously because we've changed fluid that's the key thing that's changed here compared to the first time; the density here is like a thousand times bigger than what we had in air. but everything else is is still dependent on the object. (brady: so that's doing its work 
on the bottom) (half of the equation? okay.) exactly. so these are going to be much slower because the number on the bottom is now much much bigger. it makes sense, you would expect to fall faster through air than you would through water. if you jump into a pool you don't sink as fast as if you jump out of a plane. so the objects then, so we've got the the wrecking ball just a nice big sphere. we've got the eiffel tower with lots of
holes in it, and then the empire state building; so for these three objects we again need to know mass, drag coefficient, area. so a wrecking ball, average size wrecking ball 2250 kilograms - they're heavy. the eiffel tower weighs about nine million kilograms, perhaps unsurprisingly is pretty heavy. the empire state though is going to be even heavier, it's 
365 million kg. so some very big objects, these two are much much bigger. drag coefficient, we've got still a sphere; the eiffel tower, so this is estimated to be between 1.8 and 2. the holeyness and the fact that it has this steel frame actually creates a lot of drag because as the wind hits it it kind of- some bits go through and it just creates lots of turbulence and that's actually not- (or as the water goes through it?)
- as the water rather than the air, like yeah. so the empire state is a bit better so that's about 1.3 to 1.5. so definitely the most streamlined is indeed the wrecking ball, as we might have thought, but the empire state is more streamlined than the eiffel tower. now the area: for a wrecking ball again it's a sphere, so it's going to project into a circle, so if you plug in these are about just under half a metre in radius, about a metre across - i've got it as 0.67 metres squared is going to be your pi times the radius squared. the area for the eiffel tower, so you can think of it as a triangle, kind of do half base times height; but then there's loads of holes. i've got a value here of about 750 metres squared. and then the empire state building, much less holes, it's just a big old block of glass and concrete. so i've got that estimated about 28000 metres squared. so there's a really big difference. now, plugging in the numbers, this is the this is the moment. 
- (brady: this is interesting because) (i see the mass is going to go on the top) (of the equation so the mass is going to) (get things moving but-)
- the mass has a really big effect, yeh. (but how big an effect?)
- but then it's also going to be slowed down by, by this one being very big on the bottom. which one did you- should we go with which one you said was gonna- (let's go let's go with the 
eiffel tower first.) the eiffel tower first, all right. so the eiffel tower; plugging in all of these numbers this terminal velocity comes out about 11 metres per second. it doesn't mean much at this point, it's just a it's a number. what we care about is where the other two fit. so you've said that you thought this was gonna be the slowest? okay so we thought that was gonna be the slowest and the wrecking ball was going to win? so let's go with that one next because if this isn't faster 
then you've just- so the wrecking ball then, you plug in the numbers for that and you get 12, about 12 metres a second. (brady: wow it's really close!) really really close, yeah. and it's it's because it's because of that mass, because there's such a big difference, the mass on the top there, it's it's so much times bigger it's 9 million compared to 2000. 
- (so you need more mass) (to push through that water) yeah yeah. so even though the area is obviously so much smaller of this the wrecking ball, the
eiffel tower's isn't quite big enough to really slow it down too much. (all right go on then, put me out of my
misery) no you do- you're actually winning
so far! as long as this one is somewhere between 11 and 12. 
- (i'll see what might) (happen though.) so the empire state is 13 metres per second. it's actually the fastest. it's the biggest, it's the heaviest, so yes it makes sense it would go the fastest. but we've seen that the eiffel tower is bigger and heavier than a wrecking ball and goes slower. so there really is a lot it's a- it's really to do with the drag coefficient and the area. for me the interesting thing about drag equation, terminal velocity, this whole thing; is just how important how aerodynamic your object is and how streamlined and that actual frontal area, that projected area; making that as small as possible, making everything nice and pointy is going to make you go so much faster compared to being really heavy.
- (brady: so when) (you hear all these much) (loved and hackneyed stories about) (dropping ball bearings and bowling balls) (off the) (leaning tower of pisa and they should) (hit at the same time, you must be like go
away!) (you're not even thinking about drag.)
- well that's the point, yeah. so because the air on the earth is sufficiently thick it has an effect. so there's a really nice experiment that nasa - there's actually a nasa video of this on the moon of one of the astronauts- (brady: dave scott.) oh you-
- (my favourite- my favourite astronaut.) dropping the feather and the hammer? (falcon feather)
- yeah yeah yeah yeah the video is awesome isn't it? [dave scott: well in my left hand
i have a feather, and my right hand a hammer...]
- so he drops the hammer and the feather and they hit the ground at the same time. [and i'll drop the two of them here and] [hopefully] [they'll hit the ground at the same time.] [how about that!]
- obviously that's because the air is so much thinner that drag 
doesn't have- (there's no air)
- well. so the drag just doesn't have that effect whereas on earth you do have- drag does have an effect so if you did that on earth it's not going to happen, right? the hammer's obviously going to beat the feather because there's more drag on the feather. (brady: so density, because 
the density of the) (air on the moon is zero) (means you've got you've got a zero on) (the bottom of your equation.) (does that mean it's going to-)
- so the terminal velocity will just be really big. so you'll just keep accelerating. yeah if your density is really really small or is in fact zero this formula says my terminal velocity will keep increasing.
- (regardless of mass?) yeah if it's zero completely 
regardless of mass yeah because because what you're going to do, instead of flattening off this would just continue to increase. this episode has been brought to you by brilliant. in-depth interactive courses like these ones, well that's brilliant's bread and butter. but i have to admit i'm also a little bit partial to these daily challenges, have a look at some of these: one to five... stylish socks, they are kind of stylish. and a mystery of dice. to check these out in more detail, plus everything else on the site, go to brilliant.org/numberphile. have a look, it's elegantly designed, educational and frankly it's kind of fun too. there's the address again, brilliant.org/numberphile. by the way there's 20% off a premium subscription, unlocking everything on the site, if you use that /numberphile.
