you read the title. python 3.11 is finally here! make sure you're subscribed. because two lucky 
 subscribers will be getting a free license to any jetbrains ide, 
 including pycharm, intellij, and more. it's october 24th, also known as release day. which means any second now, the final  
 official release of python 3.11 is going to drop. it's definitely going to come out on time. previous releases have gone perfectly 
 with no unexpected last-minute catastrophes. so let's just jump into it. the main thing to know about python 
 3.11 is that it's going to be significantly faster. upgrade to 3.11, and you'll most likely see an immediate 10% to 60% 
 performance improvement in your code. of course, if your code 
 already spends most of its time waiting on packets from the network 
 or calling out to c code like numpy functions, you won't see much change. pure python code is where 
 you'll see the biggest improvements. the work to make this possible 
 comes from the faster cpython project, which is run by guido 
 van rossum, the creator of python, mark shannon, who's the tech 
 lead, and a small team at microsoft. this is just the first release 
 in a series whose goal is to achieve, wait for it five times faster python 
 over the next four years or so. there are already alternate python 
 implementations like pypy, python and micropython that can achieve these speedups and even more. but importantly, all those other 
 implementations give up something from cpython, like c compatibility or dynamic typing. whereas the faster cpython 
 project will be giving us performance benefits without requiring any user code changes. this is still python. so we aren't trying to compete 
 with c or other compiled languages for speed. that's not the point. but it's always nice to get a free speed-up. next up, i want to highlight an 
 unsung hero of python doing great work. pablo galindo salgado. pablo, who's also the release manager for 3.11, has been working on what 
 i consider one of the most important, useful, yet boring improvements to python. better error messages. python will now show you not 
 just the traceback with line numbers but also exactly where 
 on each line triggered the error. this will save years of developers' lives, which they can then spend doing more 
 important things like watching mcoding videos. it's such a small change. but literally 
 every python developer will benefit from it. so it's going to make a huge difference. and hopefully even other languages 
 will take a lesson from python and do the same. now, to some new features and libraries. python 3.11 adds support for exception groups. for when you went to the store to buy eggs, 
 they were out of eggs, and also you got a flat tire. just like in life, sometimes more 
 than one thing goes wrong at the same time. using the new `exceptiongroup` and 
 `baseexceptiongroup` built-in exceptions, you can now easily conglomerate exceptions together. a trace back of the exception group contains a 
 tree of information about all the individual exceptions. in this case, we try to update the 
 database, call an api, and send a heartbeat. each of those things failed in its own separate way. and we see those tracebacks over here. additionally, using the new `except *` syntax, you can peel off and deal with 
 subgroups of certain types of exceptions. `except*` recurses through 
 the entire tree of the exception group. and finds all the exceptions 
 matching that certain type or subclass. the result here is going to be 
 another exception group of connection errors rather than just a single connection error. you can also now add notes to exceptions. for when you go to the fridge, find the milk is bad. and want to let everyone know the milk is bad. but don't have the capacity 
 to handle the problem for yourself. you just attach extra info 
 to an existing exception and re-raise it. for example, here's a fuzz tester that 
 tries to find errors in the function you give it. it tries random inputs. and eventually, it finds 
 an error in this quadratic solver. it adds a note to the exception 
 containing the input that caused the error. we can then see any 
 notes at the end of the traceback. you might find something like this 
 used for real in a testing library like hypothesis. there's also a new built-in library 
 for parsing toml files called `tomalib`. this is good because python moved 
 to the toml format for project configuration, as in `pyproject.toml`, some time ago. but there was no built-in 
 library for parsing or writing toml files. sadly, there is still no ability to write toml files. but at least you can read them from python now. one thing to watch out for is 
 that toml files must be read in binary mode. attempting to load a toml file 
 from text mode will result in an error. then there's a whole slew 
 of new type hinting features. the average user should care about 
 these not because you yourself are going to use them. although props if you do. but rather because very popular 
 existing libraries will start to use them. and once they do, this is going to make 
 your ide's autocomplete much, much better. autocomplete in many ides takes into 
 account type information to give you better suggestions and catch errors you write 
 before you ever have to run the code. that's why with no type 
 annotations when i hit dot, i get no suggestions. but if i annotate the variable and do the same thing, then i get good suggestions relevant to strings. so what are these new type hinting features? first up is variadic generics. this allows you to annotate a finite 
 but unspecified number of type variables using this new `typevartuple` tuple. this will hopefully be used in numpy, 
 tensorflow, and other array implementations in order to allow users to annotate not just 
 this variable as an array but the dimensions and data 
 type of the array as well. right now, what `typer` 
 tuples can do is pretty limited. but this is an active area 
 of work in the typing community. so keep an eye out. then there's data class transforms, which will allow third-party libraries like 
 `attr`, `pydantic`, `sqlalchemy`, and django to have the same level of support for 
 their custom model types as built-in data classes. previously, type checkers had 
 special logic for built-in data classes. but outside libraries that had 
 similar functionality-generating methods like `__init__`, `__eq__`, `__repr__` couldn't 
 properly be annotated easily. well, now they can. however, as you can see, my ide is 
 still not understanding what's going on. and that's because just because 
 the support for this feature is in python itself, that doesn't mean support for this 
 feature is part of your ide's type checker yet. that's why i'm not getting 
any useful suggestions in this case. but if i was using the built-in data class, it knows that `id` and `name` are 
 the parameters to the `__init__` function. once type checkers add support for this feature, you'll get the same level of 
 suggestions that you would for the built-in data class. then there's the literal string type annotation that says this variable isn't just a string but a literal string type somewhere in the source code. or it's generated from literal 
 strings type somewhere in the source code. so, sums, joins, and f-string substitutions 
 involving only literal strings will still be considered literal. this is primarily to prevent sql injection attacks by having your ide and type checker warn 
 you as soon as you try to fill in your query string with data that you got from `johnny; drop tables`. although sql injection is mostly a solved problem, a survey of open-source projects using `sqlite3`, python's built-in sql library, found that 33% of usages of queries calling 
 `connection.execute` were using potentially unsafe strings. this literal string annotation 
 will allow ides to gently remind users that queries should only involve literal text. you should use parametrized queries if you 
 want to fill in a query with user-provided information. of course, there are far too 
 many changes to list them all here. so let me end with a gem 
 that i personally am excited to see. and that's the `asyncio task groups`. a very common issue with 
 coroutines is just forgetting to await them. it's kind of like opening 
 a file and forgetting to close it. whenever you're in a situation like 
 that, a context manager is the way to go. so, instead of creating tasks and using `gather`, now we can use an `asyncio.taskgroup`. this gives a convenient way to 
 create and schedule a bunch of related tasks and ensure that you don't forget to await all of them using this new `async` context manager. at the end of the `async with`, you 
 can be sure that all of your tasks completed. any errors that happen during the tasks 
 are combined and raised as an exception group. of course, if you want the result of a task, say the result of calling this api, you can do that by asking 
 for the results from the corresponding task. in 3.11 and onwards, it's now 
 recommended to use `taskgroup` methods instead of manually calling 
 and creating tasks and gathering them. that's all for now. if you want to hear more about a
