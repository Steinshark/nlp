i really look forward to hear about your mentoring program and i've been like you know seeing last year that you've built this up and put a lot of effort into it so let's hear about that take it away rana okay thanks yes first of all i'm happy to speak and in particularly happy that i can present my mentally broken because as you may know i'm a big fan of my mentoring program only a few words about me because i'm the most the least interesting part in all of it i give classes since 22-24 and i start with python i did it for our product i did it for c plus plus you and since 28 i give remote classes you see i have a big big or long history of giving remote classes today i want to talk about my mentoring broken because i think mentoring is the future not classes not three day classes so let's start this you see here this is my landing page and so far i have two mentoring programs one is called fundamentals for c plus plus professionals and one design patterns in ice detection patterns with c plus plus i will explain my mentoring program by explaining you yeah i'm explaining you my web page so each mentoring program consists of 60 to 30 stations let me put it differently the first mentoring program i have is this fundamental thing i showed you here and this takes eight months or 30 weeks the second one i have is this design panels program in this takes 60 weeks you see this is the reason for this strange numbers and here's my key idea my key ideas the following you must invest at least or you should invest at least three hours a week to master my program and the main reason is the following one i want that you can integrate my mentoring program in your daily business life in the etl case your company sponsors you meaning you get three hours each week and you get into your company paste this mentoring program so let me type a little bit deeper i will always dive a little bit deeper each station station is or you can also say week consists of theory practice and mentoring i make it a bit bigger to be to ensure theory consists of pure theory with about 10 videos it also consists about of about five examples means i have recorded videos in which i actually explain the theory and additionally posts and training videos this is the theoretical part then we have the practical part which consists of exercises i explain you the exercise in i explain you also the solution to the exercise and which i will come later there's also an active c plus plus community with my mentoring program i have four rooms this is the three practical and this is the mentoring part each friday i have two q and a's typically 60 to 80 minutes in which i address questions from the forums and this q a's are recorded my program is worldwide meaning have literally from each part of the world participants therefore i need two june is because of time time cap issues for example you have people from seattle and from sydney and this is they are i think around 80 hours in between on the end when you want to have it you can also have a one-to-one mentor with me maybe you want to go in a different direction regarding your career or do you want to have any additional information or tip also it's just over so this is the mentoring part okay you may ask yourself which mentions programs do i have so far this other one i have so far you see fundamentals for c plus plus professionals all this layouts not so fine fundamentals for c plus plus professionals which takes eight months the one i started in february and from may on it's open for new participants design pattern architecture pattern with c plus plus and this is my future plan meaning each mandarin program is based almost any is based on on one of my books or my my training programs all my classes i give one is about clean code will come about clean code one is about c plus 20 about channel programming templates about concurrency and finally high performance computing only the first one takes eight months the the remaining one only four months and you see i'm not sure which i will which one i will implement next and probably c plus 20 or concurrency okay there's another idea which is it worth in my mentoring program when you mastered my mentoring program well by the way this was not my idea this was the idea of my mentees because i'm still in the process of making this mentoring program as valuable for you as possible so when you you part of my mentoring program you are a so-called multi-member you see mentee member and the point is the following you can become a community member meaning even after the mentoring program is over you can still be a convention member and and consume the entire material material i have as long as we want so you can become a community member this fee is extremely low i think 250 euro or some or something like that there's only one restriction for community membership you cannot participate in the q a session because this would not work when i have too many peoples in one q a the only limitation but you can even consume the recorded tune a session or you can participate in the forum and ask questions which i will answer after one would answer only not part of the q a session okay so far no question i'm a little bit fast as always so let me just dive in one of let me just give an overview of both mentoring programs and then i dive a little bit deeper in this first one this is the fundamentals and you see 30 stations and this includes the calling which is literal types value move semantics memory you see classes inheritance templates and then we go in the direction of the standard template library string regular expressions and finally to pick the fun stuff concurrency so 30 stations and these are the stations ah i want to say something additionally okay the idea for this mentoring program was essentially the following what let me put this in this way when i would want to hire you what i would expect you should know when you say you are c plus plus professional and this was the idea of this mentoring program here based on two books i have written okay this is the fundamentals let's go back and this is not the side pattern thing you see only 16 stations and now the first iteration of this program is running we are currently in week four and you see i start with a few several things and i talk about design patterns exactly the parents you know from the game of four then i talk about idioms so let's say pattern applied in a specific programming language of course the programming is c plus plus about ic texture patterns and finally this is what i also talked today about about concurrency related patterns okay let me jump back and let me show you what's inside the programmer i go into fundamentals and there's your samples a simple station and this is what we use now and you see this is the week six move semantics this is a honestly a little bit a heavy week because of move semantics and this is what's inside first i explained first i introduced what's the topic of this week then i explained the keywords default delete which i essential for move semantics i talk about copy versus move semantics and then about stood move and finally is the tls in the next one here we are move semantic for use defined types this is a pretty complicated signal wrong button sorry okay now let me just jump here into default deletes you see i explained the theory this is a video this is the slides which i explained here in this video then let's just jump through i explained the foil using the example by the way each weeks has around 40 50 minutes of pre-recorded stuff i explain delete here's for example the exercise here's the exercise and here's the solution this is a pretty short exercise and finally this is the stuff which is not part of this three hours the additional stuff here there's only one additional posts but sometimes it's way way more let me just jump here inside earth does not work let's use this button you see two posts i have written which i linked here and this is a a talk from a clouds which you should know which is hosted on on youtube about back to basic about move semantics this is a two hour talks which is not typical for back to basics but this is a two-hour talks and this is listed here and this is essentially what i have in each week and the final part was move semantic for user defined types you see there's there's an example an exercise here that's the explanation there's first information as always i'm extremely fast sorry for that so let's make a short break and do you have a question so far yes there's a question okay are you planning any of your course or wanting sessions to collaborate spirit now i will do all on my own i had a few of contacts with them in my past past but this is essentially only hosted it's only my stuff i will in the future maybe i'm not sure which direction this goes but my plan is honestly when i know it works extremely good i'm extremely good collected in c plus plus community maybe other c plus plus trainer helped me to to improve this program for example i'm not i'm not the expert in press driven development refactoring therefore i would ask someone or someone who knows a lot about how to switch from c to c plus plus would you like to make a mentoring program on my platform that all is hosted on my platform i hope this answers your question and any additional question so far i think wait i will okay thanks yeah one question give me a second to copy it okay fine and here we go what do you consider an advantage of many ways of the children what are the what other sorry this is the answer i could could talk hours about so what is the benefit of mentoring just first what keeps in my mind when i for example talk about move semantics when i do it in a class i do it executive once and when you are fine with it it's good if not it's bad but when i do it here i talk for i explain move semantics from the technical point of view then i talk about it from the best practice point of view i talk about it from maybe from a design or format design point of view i talk of it also i can always talk about one feature from different perspectives at different points in time and this makes it so valuable because when honestly when i give a three-day class to to you do you know what's happening after three days you are totally exhausted i'm totally exhausted but here we have time this means you can also come in you can use in in the form your business questions or your c plus plus related question and ask them there you have a community which helps you you see this is way very very more complete this is not only one aspect a three-day class honestly when i give a three days class i would assume two days later you have at least forgot 50 at least okay now let me show you because honestly this there's so much stuff inside i cannot explain all in half an hour but but let me show you something i have here in four room and here are the topics which we'll discussed so far and do you see it here there's one general one there is introduced yourself so the people introduce themselves because this makes communication easier industry is not so interesting and for each week i have a special forums you see types types here are eight topics with 23 replies and so on and so on you see this was the first duration one or five topics there's a lot of discussion happening i just click here and you see inline static members there was a discussion and i answered this was extremely short answer but this is the additional benefit when you want to have answers let's see wrong button forget about it when you want to have answers regarding or topics regarding context but these are all constant related questions and you see it's yeah this is one question i got no one wrote on topics therefore i did it by myself and this was a very interesting question because it's new i elephant in my head the question was can you overload a context but no you cannot but this was the this was the point of this question you see and therefore to each week i have a forum which is a place to discuss your things and it's the same is here for the next mentoring program you see exactly we are now in week three because so far no topic in week four this is the form second here's the q a here are all recorded q and a's and this is the last friday you see and here additionally this were the questions i discussed in this q a this is the one i showed you before you see so when you go here you directly jump to the question the q a which i just could question the firm which i discussed in the q a so this is the q a all of this stuff is recorded i have a page with additional resources i put only this stuff on this page books blocks things you should know which i think are really really good and here's a page with additional resources and all examples i show are on github several when you want to have them just jump to github oh i should do it but you see these are the examples i use you continue memory okay here's the calendar showing you when the next q a will happen including also the link to the q a you see it here and so on and so on okay once more i make a short break i was a little bit too fast but anyway now i have presented it to you in 20 minutes but once more do you have a question maybe our early effort is for this to master this so you already said three hours a week that's what three hours is the minimal time you should invest but i have at least material for six to eight hours each week or let's let's put only six but this is traditional stuff and this is what what what i said before about this community membership you can consume it longer when you switch from mentee membership to community membership because i didn't mention it i still they're running mentoring programs i still improve them when i found something interesting where i wrote something interesting which is valuable here i put it there meaning i still i permanently improve the stuff yes already mentioned it i started with this mentoring program last april so it's not it's i had almost a year old you see so i'm still in the process of of improving this and this one is pretty good now fundamentals and this other one which i do the first time there may be a few issues but the issues are gone when i mastered it the first time but now as i mentioned it we are on week four so three hours but you can invest more let me let me say what i mean by three hours around 40 minutes watching videos maybe 40 50 minutes made in the exercises and study the stuff and around an hour for the q a so this is the minimum and let me add something which i forgot now i go into the other program only to see this is the same just let me add something let's do the pattern which you may probably not like let's jump directly into the thing in the first information part to each resource i added here i classified as good to know and intermediate this means i have two kinds of classification good to know nice to know and beginner intermediate advanced therefore you can you see good to know beginner this is what you should consume first once more clouds terrible anyway sorry this was not against clouds but it was just by accident okay so any question and you see this is always the same structure yes there's a question like do you plan to have mentoring on tooling like package managers for example this is an excellent point but i have to say i'm not an expert in this domain i know what i can or what i cannot do meaning when you really want to have it i will contact someone from the community i already have someone in mind and ask him if he wants because what i want to build in the long run this is a very ambitious goal i want to have a platform you can come and you know there's something i there's all is here what i need from a c plus plus point of view and this what i can do which will take in the end around you see it here we'll take in the end then around [music] june 2025 this is what i can do this is what is what you see here and this additional stuff i hope for other c plus plus experts which will make this because what i want to do is essentially you can just go to me and you know the stuff is there and i can only provide half of it a roughly set okay yeah all right so i think so what target what what audience do you target with with the mentoring what it's like this is what what you see here beginner is really beginner honestly in my last program i had two really beginners one was a guy who knows a lot about python and wanted to learn c plus plus it was a little bit cherishing for you of course and now i have someone in my program which is put in youtube programming a little bit of titan background and she wants to learn c plus which is a challenge but honestly she is now on week 11 and she is really really good she will mastered so this is you see it here beginner you can also say when you want to go in when you want to do intermediate you should have the level of beginner to put a differently and this is beginner it's a little bit more important here it becomes really really advanced but templates is advanced feature concurrence is advanced feature and high performance computing of course also so the ideas really this is a kind of a curriculum this is your starting point this does not mean you have to take it but you should at least have the level to to the level which is how should i say it the level which is uh exactly yeah thanks by the way i have to say a short anecdote i have a few minutes left and then we are done this fundamentals for c plus plus professional thing is is i created for a special reason when i give a class i often i have one month before a talk with an expert and he says to me you should talk explain this set and this one then i i start the class i say one keyword such as default delete or what else and all people look in different directions and therefore i created a backup material which contained 400 slides which one should know and based on this material i created this course meaning when i would give this as a class this would be a 20 days class this was the reason why i created it it often happened to me that my participant in my class had not the level had not the level say they should have therefore i did with some something totally different and i therefore created this material okay if you have any more questions let us know i'm happy to post them here foreigner to see and see there's let me add a few words when you have question and you may want to ask them later just drop me an email yeah that's the other thing i think you wanted to tell us how to reach out to you because probably there's somebody interested in you know talking to you about this so right now how to reach you [music] how does one contact you if they're interested in mentoring any email you can just use any email address i have so i have at least five of them so for example this one let me contact me hey you see it here contact me here we are for example this one is fine but i don't care i have so many you can go to my blog to my blog and write a comment anyway i will react you can go to linkedin you can write and comment on twitter anyway you will find me just search for grim in c plus plus yeah there's more than one hit okay and you see on this page there's always a a contact a field which you can fill in and submit by the way there's also when you like it and you want to know what's happening in my mentoring program here you can just switches this therefore i send you information when i give a presentation when i show you what's new when i say to you hey there's a new mentoring program coming and there are different ways to to not to get notified either this one or use this one of course yeah there's a new subject great so let me look through this any [music] here's one more question let me bring that on screen [music] expert level but have only rudimentary c plus plus knowledge let me be more specific let me just jump back this program is probably an etl fit for you this one fundamentals but i would not suggest that you use wrong button that you use one of the ones which are based on that you see this one this is maybe two at once for you you should ask first node basics i had people which had pies in background which is probably far more away from from c plus plus and c and they mastered it because this is the great thing about this mentoring in a typical class you asked me why so traditional but you asked me what's the difference the difference is here i have the time in a class i have an issue because i have only three days and i want to teach what i want to tell teach what what you bought but here i have to have the title and i can also do something and you can use the form to ask you special questions okay then how much time do you spend on fridays in the q a usually it's not this is a nice in the past it was special the late session was always longer but the reason was there were two people from the us and the people from germany or from europe are not so verbos but now it changed a little bit i would say 60 to' minutes is typical okay and that brings us to the end of this there is a question on concurrency patterns on linkedin but i think [music] we'll probably yeah let's let's start your talking a minute but that is like a nice segue to quickly look at that would you concentrate right our concurrency patterns be suitable for developing and real-time os operating system and the industry productive systems for embedded systems but i'm not sure if that's your domain this is a pretty sophisticated question this is open question okay let's let's sorry this is because i'm not sure if he really wants to have a real-time hot wheel time or week real time i'm not sure what he actually asked for it and i know what the actual system is for from java or scala but so far we don't have one in c plus plus okay this is an extremely specific question let me delay it to whom the who asked the question please write me an email i think this is not the right frame here to answer this question the right room yeah so you can reach out to to run on on exactly yeah this question came from linkedin so which means we are now at the end of the sponsored time and thank you very much for the sponsoring runner was really interesting to see a little bit about this and hear about things also yeah so it's you provided let's get ready for your talk about concurrency patterns
