climb, cheat codes. - cool, she's already higher than me, fun! - i really can't feel
my fingers right now. - hey, do you need a banana? - oh my gosh, she's about to make it. - [chandler] wow. (becca screaming) - children, gather around. i'm gonna be honest, becca did a good job. she deserves it, here you go. you get the badge.
- thank you. - i haven't gone. - oh yeah, karl, your turn. - thank you - [chris] karl, everything about you looks just so uncomfortable right now. - oh, it is. - are you gonna do this? - i was actually born
on a rock climbing wall. - nice hobbit feet, weirdo. - [karl] i am weird. - you're doing great, karl. - what if we just tickle his feet? (karl shrieking) - no! no, stop! my whole body hurts so bad. oh, my whole foot is bleeding. - oh gosh! - karl cut himself and is forfeiting. becca got a badge for
going up pretty high. was karl high enough for a badge? - karl was, yes. - maybe three more rocks,
i would give it to him. - three more rocks, i
woulda gave it to him. - all right. - are you honking with me right now? - the next badge is cross the log badge. walk across the log to the
other side and touch this cord. chris, you're first. - [chris] all right. - go whenever you feel like it. (quirky orchestral music) boom, log-crossing badge. chandler, your turn. - [chandler] me? (whimpers) all right, i'm gonna go. (dramatic music)

(karl squealing) he got it, he got it! all right, to the next one. teams of two, you must get to
the other side of this wall. chandler. - becca, just one has to get up, right? - all i said is they have to get to the other side of the wall. i didn't say they have to go over it, shh. let's start off with karl and becca. - [karl] okay, i'm gonna get on my knee. - do you think they can get
to the other side of the wall? - probably. - nah, there's no way. - [karl] okay, ready? - [becca] yeah. (intense orchestral music) - [jim] oh, wait, wait, wait. - child's play baby, (grunts)! - [jim] wow! - [chris] we're just
gonna do the same thing. - by the way, yeet, there's your badge. - just another day in the park. - [chris] onto your shoulder. - [chandler] oh my gosh! - timber! - [chris] full shoulders! - [jim] chris, go! you got it. - oh yeah, baby!
- four! - he did it.
- it's done. - i just got really dizzy, hold on. - you might be kind of dizzy,
but maybe this will help you. hey chandler, here's your badge? - this just keeps on giving. - next up, you're gonna
climb the rope of doom. - why is everything of doom here? how many tries? - let's do one. - three. - [jim] one. - two. - [jim] zero. - one. - deal.
- all right. i'm really trying, i'm not even joking. i'm just not really good at anything other than watching tv, okay? - dude, that's a long way up. - [chris] shut up, i don't like heights. - heights don't like you, do
you ever think about that? - [group] chris, chris, chris! - you can taste it, chris! - one more!
- one more, he did it! - [chris] i'm spinning. - [chandler] it's like a
little spider coming down. - here is your rope climbing badge. you're up to four badges. becca has begun. - becca's annihilating. - [jim] this seems much
easier for you than chris. - [becca] i would just
like to thank my mom for being so short. - [karl] wow, good job! - i did it. all i have to say is that you're garbage and you don't know what you're doing. - hey, gottem. - here is another badge, chandler's turn. - go boy! - climb on.
- you go this. (chandler grunting) - so at this point in my life, i'm deciding whether i
want to go up or not. - [karl] don't do it, you nerd. - [chandler] i don't feel
like doing this anymore. - no badge gang! that's what the badge you
would've got looked like. - at least, you get a hugging badge. [music] i been missing the
way you touch me, baby [music] don't worry, you don't got the... - oh boy, oh.
- yep, yep. - [karl] gotta go fast! - five more, you did it! - thank you. - so anyways, karl, here you go. let's continue. next badge is the navigation badge. i want all of you to
put a hand straight up. now, point which way you think is north. - oh. - just went with my instinct. - we'll start off with becca. you're not ready. north is that way, you moved
it, you're disqualified. (buzzer dinging) north is that way, chris was the closest. he gets the badge. (audience applauding) i have a very important announcement. whoever has the most badges
gets 10 grand, right? - [group] yes. - [jim] not anymore, it's now $20,000. - you're going down. - i will try my best,
that is all i can do. - stay in the lead and i'm
gonna bring him this 20 grand. - i'm the underdog and i think that i deserve
it the most because of that. - first place has six badges, i have five. guess what? doesn't matter, i'm gonna
earn that right now. - [chris] too bad, i already took 60k from you, loser. - the next few badges are a little slow so i'm just gonna tell you how they went. chandler actually won three badges. karl also won three badges and somehow, chris won four
badges and becca won one. this next badge is the slingshot badge. you're each gonna fire three times. the two people who hit it
the least don't get a badge. all right, let's begin. karl, fire! he hit it. chris. (buzzer dinging) missed. becca.
(buzzer ringing) she hit it, no? - it was the wire.
- i hit it. - [karl] i'm sorry. - wait, really? - [karl] yeah, it was the wire. - chandler. - [chris] he just took my... - woo!
(buzzer ringing) chandler hit it. so far, karl and chandler has hit one. another round, chandler, fire! wow, becca, fire! chris. (buzzer dinging) - [chris] oh, it went under it. - karl. (buzzer dinging) so only chandler hit it,
you two never hit one. you two did hit it and you two get badges. (mellow music) you get your badge on your hand. chandler, here you go, boom. what if you guys did
rock-paper-scissors for a badge? - i can afford to lose one. - one and done. rock-paper-scissors shoot. hold up, turn around. - i went with scissors, man. - you lost, you're too happy. - 'cause i still got
one more badge than him. - no, you don't. - nine-seven, now it's eight-eight. - why do i do math? i'm so bad at it! - let's do archery again. but this time, we're moving
the targets further back and giving you three shots. the target in front of you is yours, fire. no. raise the bows and fire. - [karl] oh, i hit the wood. - chris, didn't you do
competitive archery? - yeah, but i used- - 20 million people are watching. - i used a different kind of bow! - [jim] and fire! - yeah baby, badge me! - i'm angry because my
pride is hurt twice. i couldn't start a fire, i couldn't shoot the bow right, i'm not... - the bow hit me in
the arm as you can see. after that, i just got shaky. - i was off to a rocky start and then it ended in a rockier start. - i'm counting nine badges on mine and eight on those posers over there. - next boy scout badge
is the basketball badge and you have to hit a
half-court shot to get it. - that's not a boy scout badge. - shut up. everyone gets one try. - [chris] i'm really bad at basketball. - all right, becca. all right, karl. - [chandler] karl's gonna make it. - [jim] oh! - [spectator] not even close. - chandler. (chandler grunting) (metal clanging) oh, the gopro! - the gopro literally blocked me tarique, from winning $20,000. that is your fault. the council said if you make a free throw that's proof that you won. - i'm terrible at free throw. - if you make this, i will
give you the basketball badge. - [chris] miss it.
(group groaning) - he made it. - just take this badge with pride. - chandler got the
basketball badge, next stop. we just finished the half-court shot and i'm actually gonna leave this behind and have them race to get it later. this next badge is a very
hard badge, arithmetic badge. first to give the correct answer, wins. the math problem is
two times two times two times two times eight times
eight times eight times 10 times eight times 10 times zero. - zero, same exact time. - you two tied, let's do this again. two times two times
two times two times two times two times two is? - 128.
- 100. - got it right. - i got math right.
(audience applauding) - chris, congratulations. - thanks man. - this next one's very,
very, very important. remember the basketball court. i left a bottle of sunkist
in the middle of the court. whoever can grab the bottle
of sunkist first, wins. - okay, everybody's in the car. gentlemen's agreement,
one, two, three, go. we all get outta the car and go for it. (becca screaming)
(energetic rock music) (chris screaming) - who got it? wait, how did chris get it over chandler? - [chris] i said gentlemen's agreement. - [chandler] he's a snake. - and then i didn't. - thought he was my
friend, he betrayed me. - [jim] chris, you got the
badge, but at what cost? - jerk!
- who cares? - i hate you!
- i don't care. - if that's all that matters
to you, there you go. - [chandler] hey, have
fun walking back, buddy. - where's the not being a jerk badge? - so you have four badges. you have nine, you have nine
and you have nine badges. except, i haven't given
you the sunkist badge yet. you now have 10 and are in the lead. there's only one badge left. if you guys win, you can tie with chris. chris wins, he wins. this next one is woodworking. whoever can carve the best picture wins. - [chandler] i'm not even gonna try it. - chris is really going hard. (intense orchestral music) well, here's the thing, boys. we did team trees, we
don't like to hurt wood. wood is our friend, chandler never did. chandler ends up winning the badge because he did not harm mother nature. - yeah, but there's a tie now. - there is a tie. - i made plank from ed, edd n eddy. - that's actually kind of funny. i think we need to give him one as well. - so three-way tie? - yeah. - so you just go back
on everything you said? - since you didn't harm
the wood chandler, boom. karl, you made me laugh, boom. everyone, salute becca,
she did a good job. - thank you. - you did well. - it's a three-way tie and
you all have 10 badges. pull out your phone. turn on your screen recording. open up youtube. are you subscribed to our channel? - [chandler] duh. - duh.
- let me see. oh, karl wasn't! karl wasn't subscribed. - i made a new youtube. - oh, sure. - and i lost hide and seek and boy scouts, so now i'm out $80,000. subscribe to mrbeast, 'cause
you don't wanna lose $20,000. it hurts, man! - all this work has led us
to this, the epic finale. we end how we began, first one to start a fire gets the $20,000. - [chandler] good luck. - [jim] let's go boys. this is it, $20,000. it needs to burn for at
least 30 seconds, begin. - oh my god. - [jim] chandler, use
everything you learned today. - [chris] it's not for the
money, it's for my pride. this was the one thing that i should have been
able to do and i couldn't. (suspenseful orchestral music) - you gonna light your sock on fire? - nothing says you can't do it too. (lighter clicking) start the timer. - oh my gosh, dude! - [jim] halfway. time, congratulations chris, you have won. - i made fire! and i lost a sock. - chris won the fire part two badge and is now the most elite
boy scout ever to exist. hug it out guys. - [chris] i love you
though, you did so good. - [jim] chandler, do you still love chris? - yeah. - [jim] didn't sound too convincing. - i'm upset, okay. - congrats on the $20,000. now you can take care of your
unborn child slightly better. i don't know, subscribe, bye. [music] mrbeast6,000, oh [music] [music] mrbeast6,000 [music]
