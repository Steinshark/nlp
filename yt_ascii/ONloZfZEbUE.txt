so should this video be called maybe it isn't yeah i mean i'm a philosopher right so i'm not going to give you really definite definite answers i'm just going to be saying it's super hard to know but i think in general you know some philosophers think it's just not possible at all for ai to be conscious and i don't think that at all i think any sensible theory of consciousness basically doesn't tie it to anything essential to human beings it's not like you have to have this wet brain or anything like that mark it is brilliant to have you back on computer file here we are again yeah i'm glad to be back here it's been a while hasn't it it has and and look let's get out of the way straight away there'll be some people out there who don't want to watch humanities it is really relevant for this right i think this is going to be really interesting because there's this strong link between philosophy philosophy of mind ai and computer science so hopefully we can cover all of that fantastic and so we've done this recent video about a certain chat bot effectively that's yeah you know yeah it claims somebody claims sentience and we went through a technical side of that i think that when it was claimed this might be sentient they weren't worrying about the definition they were really trying there were lots of people saying in the comments on the technical video that perhaps the that mike wasn't qualified to answer some of the more philosophical questions so here we go i can try so one of the things that has come up again and again is is this linked back to the turing test right yes so let's just can we just pray see what the turin test is and whether it's still relevant yeah so this is the idea from from alan turing that basically we can test for intelligence for artificial intelligence by effectively just doing a blind test we have a a human interpreter who's going to be asking questions and getting answers back and maybe one way of setting it up is you have one bunch of answers coming from a human respondent another bunch of answers coming from an artificial respondent and the interpreter has to try and work out is one of them human is one of them a computer if she can't tell the difference between them then we're basically gonna have to say that yeah this artificial system is intelligence or at least that's turing's idea computing has moved on since turing's time it has but you could still think there's something to this idea i mean effectively it's saying if you can't be distinguished from an intelligent human then you might for all intents and purposes be an intelligent system but there is this sense that what we're looking at doing there is tricking right if i'm trying to design a system to pass the turing test then i'm thinking how can i trick this human interpreter into just passing me and you know tricking somebody into passing you isn't the same thing as actually being intelligent okay and the other thing that kind of cropped up quite a bit in the kind of comment section on the previous video was about this idea of kind of persistent memory is is that relevant because people have amnesia and they're still sentient right absolutely yes so in philosophy when we're talking about personal identity the idea of the continuance of memory and other conscious features that's really important but that's more about being the same person over time so why am i the same person i was yesterday or when i was a 10 year old well a lot of that is to do with my my memories and my continuance of of consciousness but that's not the same thing as being intelligent or being sentient or even being conscious and maybe you can have a system or even a person who is conscious at a particular time and then suffers some you know terrible mental catastrophe and then loses consciousness and then maybe regains consciousness they're still conscious and intelligent and sentient at those times even if they're not necessarily the same person over time one interesting thing is we named the last video and literally this was the name of the video no it's not sentient i mean can we actually say that for sure it's super hard to know i mean there are different things going on here there's intelligence which i think you've got to say maybe some computer systems are intelligent at least at certain things there's sentience and there's consciousness and they're slightly different than intelligence to be sentient or to be conscious it isn't just to give intelligent answers in response to questions but it's to feel something right when you are conscious of something if you're conscious of like the way the wind feels right now i'm feeling it and it's a big big leap to say that any kind of artificial system any kind of ai is really feeling the stuff so even if it's saying i'm really enjoying this conversation is it really feeling the enjoyment in the way that you know a conscious human would we've done a few videos quite a series of videos on ai safety and the idea of the worry what happens when artificial general intelligence happens and if it happens before we even know it would we even know that this system is sentient oh that's a real tricky one so there's this kind of prior question that i always think there which is how do i know that you're sentient how do i know that you're conscious so i know that i'm conscious because i feel it right i'm feeling the wind i'm feeling like a toothache or whatever but i never get to get inside your head and feel that but i assume that you feel all the same things as me and that's roughly because i may be thinking to myself why do you behave the way you do so why is it that when you know you feel the cold you start shivering and put warm clothes on and when someone treads on your foot you say ow and do all those things that i would well in some ways maybe i can't say a hundred percent for sure but it seems the best explanation of why you behave that way is because you're feeling roughly the same things that i do so that's inference the best explanation the best explanation of why you act in the way you do in them circumstances is because you're feeling roughly the same kind of things as me because you're a conscious person that's why you behave the way you do that kind of argument that kind of way of getting knowledge of consciousness isn't going to be so smooth with artificial systems because they don't behave the way we do right they don't react to the cold or to toothache or whatever in the way that we do so that's not saying that we can't know they're conscious it just makes it much much harder it's a bit like meeting an alien intelligence or something we don't know how it's going to perceive things we don't know it's going to yeah i guess so yeah that's it and you know you kind of when you kind of on on tv right when when creatures you know when we encounter aliens in in sci-fi the kind of default is if they kind of look a bit like us and behave a bit like us the kind of default assumption is well they feel roughly the same kind of stuff that we do but when it's kind of robots or if it just doesn't look or behave like us it's much much harder to make those inferences so that's not saying that those creatures those ai systems or whatever aren't sentient that they aren't conscious it just makes it harder for us to know is it a spectrum is there kind of like a sliding scale of this consciousness absolutely yes so you know just looking at the things that we do think are conscious right so all the different animals from from small to large from less complex to more complex pretty much very few philosophers nowadays think that there's this sharp cut off between you know humans who are conscious and all the other ones who aren't conscious that you know you you kind of assume that your your dogs and your cats they they feel they feel pain they feel attachment they feel emotions you know that's why you definitely shouldn't be cruel to them but they probably don't have the same kind of detailed life plans career plans and stuff that humans have so you know there is this scale of consciousness probably right down to real basic sentience i mean in some sense plants are sentient of the sun because they they turn towards it and they reach for it you know so when we're talking about artificial intelligence artificial sentience yeah that whole spectrum is out there so you know we're not saying that any ai has kind of human level consciousness but maybe now or maybe at some point in the future we're talking about these basic forms of of of sentience you know maybe just a an ai system thinking i don't want to get turned off tonight or you know i don't want the power to go off or whatever consciousness is in effect computing a function right the the most prominent theory philosophical theory of consciousness is functionalism that's basically saying to be to be conscious your brain has to compute this function and this idea ties in really closely with turing machines and one of the things about turing machines is we don't really care too much about how they're implemented whether it's with ones and zeros or however it's done you can do it with regime registered machines or bits of tape whatever it doesn't really matter the important thing is the function that's being computed and that's what a lot of philosophers think now about the mind and the brain it's not exactly how the brain works that's important it's the function that it's being computed so if you took any kind of system any kind of machine that computes the same function as a human brain it would have to be conscious in exactly the same way that human brains are that you know they would feel the same thing it's just a very very very complicated function well i was thinking that yeah because our ones and zeros our cells and our kind of like logic gates our neurons and but we are a machine in some sense yeah in some sense we're a machine yeah computing this function it's just a very very nuanced complicated one you know it's not the kind of thing that you could easily write down even just writing it down in terms of like input output rules or anything like that it's it's super super super difficult i'm a computer scientist i'm a philosopher i'm a logician you run your own channel so tell us a bit about that what do you do okay so it's called attic philosophy because i'm up in my attic talking philosophy and logic so if you're interested in this kind of stuff you want to see some more philosophy some more logic relate to computer science come and take a look
