so the big idea that i wanted to sort of pitch is that there's only one pentecost and that this pentecost happens at one point in like an eternal moment and noah and abraham and moses and the apostles all participate in that day of pentecost but so did the people at the tower of babel yeah so did the people of the tower of babel and that if you participated it correct ly then it will unify and also multiply and if you don't give it your focus if you don't give it your attention correctly then you're going to be divided and you're going to be scattered this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] so hello everyone i am back with richard roland for universal history this is the first episode we're recording after the symbolic world summit if i remember correct that's right yeah and so what we want to do is go back into the tower of babel story because richard has some amazing reveals about that story and how it connects you know to the to the old testament i mean how it connects to pentecost in crazy ways that that that yeah just blew me away when i found them out so i so i think that we definitely need to go back into that so richard take us take us away yeah so i'm going to kind of give away the farm now there were some things that i was teasing a little bit in the last tower babel video that we did and i said you've got to come to the summit to get the rest of it and of course lots of people couldn't come to the summit so the good news is i'm going to i'm going to basically kind of give you guys what you know what was missing because actually at the summit i still couldn't say everything that i wanted to say because because it just wasn't time and i was trying to be respectful of the other speakers and and not take their time because that's like the unforgivable sin as a presenter is is going over your time so so i'm going to talk a little bit there will be like a little bit of repeat because what i want to do is to just just frame things up a little bit so there'll be a little bit of a repeat here but we can we can go but that'll that'll right so we talked last time about the book of jubilees and the book of jubilees is really important to the christian tradition actually it doesn't matter if the book of jubilees is not in your bible it doesn't even matter if at some point the reading of the book of jubilees was maybe banned in your church sometime a long time ago there are a lot of things well that did i don't think that happened with jubilees i know it happened with enoch in the in the west but but the book of jubilees just has a lot of information that you probably take for granted uh as a christian that's but it's actually stuff that's not explicitly in the scriptures if you've ever had the idea that the devil and other demonic spirits are fallen angels the idea that the sons of god mentioned in genesis are fallen angels or the idea that the sons of god mentioned in genesis are descendants of seth actually both of those ideas come from this whole body of of literature that includes jubilees even the idea that righteous people go to a place called heaven or paradise and wicked people go to a place called hell and that there are rewards and punishments that are proportional to your righteousness or your wickedness these are things that are not explicitly oldest spelled out in the old testament unless you have third eis in your old testament which some of us do in which case then you're you're gold but anyway yeah so so some of us i love i say some of us like who is the us that it's just the russian orthodox church really i didn't even know that russ if you're in that sort of like slavic russian orthodox tradition then you can make the case that third eis is actually in your old testament well luckily we are so we are that's right third eis by that is getting us ready for dante by the way that is yeah third eis as i mentioned in yesterday in the retrospective that we did for the summit somebody asked a really fun question about apocrypha in the retrospective and i said you know my favorite apocryphal book although actually it's in my old testament is third erris and it's it's actually one of the important foundational texts for understanding the divine comedy which i think is something most people don't know so if you like this sort of thing we'll be doing we'll be starting our first class on the divine comedy it'll be five weeks it'll be just on the inferno and then we'll come back in a few months and do purgatorio and then paradisio and it's starting orthodox bright week so that's the week of i'm just going to go ahead and tell people because i think you'll be able to order the class soon it's going to be the week of the 5th so that'll be thursday the 9th may the 9th thursday may the 9th is when our first class will be so anyway okay so all of these things that people assume to be true about the scriptures and how we read the scriptures come from jubilees and from these other works generally referred to as the apocrypha and so u with that with that kind of being said i want to look at specifically the idea of feasting and sacrifice in the book of ju jubilees real quick so one of the main themes of the book of jubilees is the idea that the old testament lurgical calendar that is the feasts of the law uh are ontological realities that at the way the book of jubilees puts it is that these feasts have been celebrated in heaven since the creation of the world so and this includes the things like the observance of the sabbath and then also the great feast of the mosaic covenant now obviously you can see the establishment of the sabbath in the genesis story right but jubilees sort of takes this idea farther so jubilees is kind of what you could call like a midrash or like a commentary really like an expansion of genesis sometimes it's called like lesser genesis for that reason and so it takes this idea a little bit further and it says that along with the observance of the sabbath that the great of the mosaic covenant which which importantly uh genesis predates the giving of the mosaic covenant right so the great feast of the mosaic covenant actually predate the covenant now what's the implication of that by the way for christians well is that you keep celebrating these feasts like even if you're not part of the mosaic covenant you would keep celebrating these feasts more on that in a minute and the reason that they ontological realities is because they basically they basically like reflect how do i say this you could say that these feasts reflect certain heaven real heavenly realities that are kind of baked into the world at its creation so participating in these days of rest and feasting like the sabbath the day of atonement first fruits tabernacles the hidden significance of the eighth day and of course pca or passover which is the last those are the feasts that are introduced in jubilees wait so you in jubilees there's already an introduction of the eth day idea because i know it's in rabinal text people have told me that that in rabinal commentary there are places where it say says when the messiah comes we will no longer celebrate on the sixth day but on the seventh day and i was like what that's wild this is in this this happens in jacob's visions that he has around the birth of benjamin and the death of rachel in in jubilees yeah yeah so this is that's that that that is in there wow that is in there yeah so all of this stuff is kind of there in jubilees and as as we're going to talk about in a minute this becomes very important for the formation of the christian lurgical year yeah so the idea is that by participating in these things it's a way to join human life and activity that is bounded by time to eternal realities right so that you know you could say somebody might say so that god's will is done on earth as it is in heaven right someone might say someone might say that so much much of this reflects and the the the community community that wrote the book of jubilees or that at least copied and and preserved it was a was a community that's very concerned with calendars the f cycle all these different kinds of things father steven d young has a great book on the apocrypha it's just called apocrypha and he's got you know if you want to get the historical background who wrote these things and who preserved them by the way almost all these texts were preserved almost exclusively in christian monasteries so that's that's how we still have them so other than the sabbath the first fruit to the first feast to be instituted in jubilees is the feast of the first fruits and this is known variously in the old testament and the jewish tradition shabot which is the feast of weeks it's also called the festival of reaping and also simply called pentecost although it's not usually called pentecost in jubilees because pentecost refers to the fact that it's the 50th day after pca or passover which hasn't actually been instituted yet like humanity is given p pentecost before they're given passover in the in the narrative in jubilees so but yeah but but i'll probably call it pentecost most mostly or the feast of the first fruits yeah so we shouldn't be surprised to find that this feast has a certain primacy of place in jubilees and this is because the law is given to moses on the feast of the first fruit so when moses goes up the mountain and he receives the law from god that is happening on pentecost and so the thing that pentecost is you could say is primarily a it is a celebration of the giving of the law of god which is is actually a revelation of who god is and then the making of a covenant between god and man or the making or the renewal of a covenant between god and man mh so that's what pentecost is that's the we'll talk about maybe the shape of of more of the shape of the feast in a minute but that's the event so jubilees has a frame narrative and the frame narrative is that the angel of the presence who is jesus by the way we know this because jesus quotes himself in jubilees in the in the gospel according to st matthew and by the way jesus and various apostles quote and reference even st steven in his in his his sermon before they stoned him to death right st steven the proto marter he he makes several references to things in genesis that aren't in genesis but they're in jubilees wow so he's either quoting from jubilees or he's quoting from some sim some sim a related tradition right so the frame narrative is that the angel of the presence is giving the law to moses which is an event that happens on pentecost and so therefore pentecost is the most important feast throughout the book of jubilees it's even more important than pca which isn't actually introduced until the very end so what we're told is that the very first pentecost the very first feast of first fruits happens in the aftermath of the great flood when noah offers up his offering to the lord now as you would expect if you know the story in genesis noah's offering pleases the lord and god makes a covenant with noah and the covenant is not to destroy the earth again but one of the things that people forget or not with a flood anyway one of the things that people forget though is that god also when he made the covenant he also gave certain laws yeah that's true us call like the noide laws yeah don't eat the uh meat with with blood yes and actually certain laws that don't affect certain laws that affect animals by the way one of the things that happens is god puts the fear of mankind into animals that's why animals run away from you usually when you're in the forest right and things like that like so there so so there's a there's a change in the state of what creation is right that happens at the giving of this law and of this covenant yeah many people like by the way even today jews understand that that law in some ways precedes the law of moses because it is the standard by which all of humans are judged and so all the non-jews are not judged by moses's law but are judged by noah's law that's right and you still have this understanding in for instance the very first church council the first council of jerusalem in the book of acts that's what they said basically they take the the noite laws and they apply those to gentile converts they say for gentiles coming into the church you have to live by these laws but you don't have to keep the torah they explicitly i forget did they explicitly say which laws those are and they're exactly the laws that are yes yes yeah it's don't eat things strangled abstained from fornication all that stuff because basically all of that stuff goes along with idolatry that's kind of the subtext there is that is that even fornication in the ancient world like there were just random prostitutes in in towns in the ancient world of course but most prostitution in the ancient world is uh is connected to the cults of certain deities right so even even fornication and things like this i mean even if you're like committing adultery or something you would still say that there's like a god involved in that it's like arrows or something so so the the things that we're specifically supposed to abstain from as they understood in the book of acts are things that have to do with idolatry and that's also a tradition that comes from jubilee so i'll just kind of go over the the account of the giving of the the noide laws as as it is in the book of jubilees we're told that humanity can e all animals which the implication by the way is that's not something they were doing before but that they can never eat meat with the blood in it so nothing strangled and in jubilees this is connected to specific instructions about worship and sacrifice mankind should offer worship to god and seek his forgiveness each morning and evening so this is the establishment of the cycle of the morning and evening offerings the morning and evening sacrifice which is something that we still basically maintain in the church with the services of matens and vespers and then also that mankind should keep the festival of the first fruits each year so this is this is the third thing and now we'll note something that's been sort of added to what you find in genesis so it says and he gave to noah and his sons a sign that there should not again be a flood on the earth he set his bow in the cloud for a sign of the eternal covenant that there should be by the way bow means like literally his weapon that's what a rainbow is i super hate all the people are like it's actually a circle and that's to make you think of a wedding ring and and like i this is this is a common explanation for the rainbow it's like well nobody knew what that meant until we got in airplanes and then we flew above the world and we saw that from from the air rainbows are circles and therefore it's a wedding ring and that's why the wedding ring is the sign of a covenant and like whatever this is a thing you hear at protestant weddings sometimes by the way anyway super annoys me it's his bow because it's his bow it's his weapon it's the weapon with which he destroyed the world right that's that's what a bow is anyway this is very common like ancient eastern semitic language so he set his bow in the cloud for a sign of the eternal covenant that there should not again be a flood on the earth to destroy it all the days of the earth for this reason it is ordained and written on the heavenly tables so that this idea of the heavenly tables is a is language that jubilees comes back to again and again and it's the idea that there's a heavenly torah or there's a heavenly law and that's what everything is referencing back to and that's basically you could say that's the thing by which the world consists is by that by by the heavenly law and the earthly law like the the torah that's given to moses is is like the earthly manifestation or repres presentation of that but the real one is is this divine law so it's ordained and written on the heavenly tables that they should celebrate the feast of weeks in this month once a year to renew the covenant every year and this whole festival was celebrated in heaven from the day of creation until the days of of noah 26 jubilees and five weeks of the year and noah and his sons observed it for seven jubilees and one week of years until the day of noah's death and from the day of noah's death his sons did away with it until the days of abraham this is an important detail and they ate blood and as we're going to see here in a minute eating blood is connected to idol worship but abraham observed it and isaac and jacob and his children observed it up to thy days that is moses's days and in thy days the children of israel forgot it until you celebrated a new on this mountain so remember that the context here is the giving of the law at sin yeah and do thou command the children of israel to observe this festival in all the generations for a commandment unto them one day in the year is the in this month they shall celebrate the festival for it is the feast of weeks and the feast of first fruits this feast is twofold and of a double nature according to what is written and engraven concerning concerning it celebrated so these laws are written or engraven upon the heavenly tables of the law and by keeping them what god promises he goes on to promise noah is that if you keep these laws so don't eat things strangled which is related to idolatry worship god twice a day morning and evening and keep the festival of pentecost every year if you do these things things then god promises that humanity will continue to cohere that they will be safe from the ravages of chaos as exemplified by the flood and there's a really interesting reference here by the way to the double nature of the feast yeah what is that what are they referring to not everybody agrees on this it might refer to the two occasions of the giving of the law and the covenants right after passing through the flood and then after passing through the red sea but it might also refer to the fact that it has a heaven and earthly nature that the say that every ancient agricultural society has a feast of first fruits right that's just something that everybody has but it's like a joining of that part of the earthly cycle to a heavenly reality and by the way this is not a problem whenever somebody like looks at a christian feast or a jewish feast and like oh this is just a leftover from some fertility religion or whatever like god made the world and the cycle of the seasons is is what it is like yeah it's it's not it's it's so silly to think that that that the relationship between the natural cycle and heavenly realities should be arbitrary in fact no christian has ever really thought that and when i say this i mean like we have had arguments and even even sisms over calendars and i know that the calendar thing is something that sometimes people are like oh that's just stupid whatever and i'm not trying to start a calendar argument so nobody nobody come at me you know i'm on whatever calendar my bishop is on but yeah there you go the idea that a calendar doesn't matter that it's arbitrary and not really important this not really a christian idea so anyway all right so so so the yeah my question is too like the double aspect of the of the feast you know one of the things i'm seeing with these with the notion of pentecost is that it seems to be a feast that is that is about the man which heaven and earth touch each other right that's like this that's exactly what it's about and so when heaven and earth touch each other then you and it makes sense with the idea also of first fruit which is the idea that you see if you think about it in terms of agriculture as well right so you see the effect of the seed the first effect of the seed that has come from heaven in the world and that would be the equivalent of the law because the law is the is a fruit it's not it's a fruit of the connection of heaven and earth it's not the actual connection it's like the it's like the fruit of that and so you can imagine the same with all the the laws or all the manifestations of that covenant and so in that sense already you can kind of see that sometimes you know some you know when jesus talks about how you know you the wheats and the tears grow together yes right that there's that there is also an aspect of the fruits or the first fruit that can be maybe negative anyways all right continue on and we'll see no that's good that's good that you yes so the angel of the presence then goes on to give us certain details in jubilees about the history of the feast after noah noah kept it and also the related laws of daily worship not eating meat with the blood in it etc and it's forgotten after his death and this leads to the scattering of the nations at babel abraham k a abraham is then the first person to start keeping it again and also his sons isaac and jacob keep it and this is all in jubilees we get actually accounts of when did abrah keep pentecost for instance we we'll come to that in a second but their descendants also forget it and that leads to their captivity in jacob right so if you don't keep the feast then you're scattered or you go into captivity and structurally this will set up for set us up for the next episode in in the genesis material that we find in jubilees and that's the tower of babel so in between the account of the aftermath of the flood and that of the tower of babel in jubilees we get several important details which really help kind of fill in the gaps of genesis which is the whole again the whole point of jubilees and and and help us understand the tower's significance so first we get the account of noah's drunkenness which is also there in which is also there in genesis obviously now the account of noah's drunkenness is very important to the pattern of the feast of pentecost i'll talk about this maybe more in a minute but but every time that pentecost is celebrated in the scriptures you'll have somebody receives the law from god and they come down to the people and then there's some strange episode of drunkenness that happens for noah it's it's he gets drunk right and then his son takes advantage in whatever whatever that means whatever way we want to understand well there's there's there's a couple of things that it means it i think there's a strong case father stephen the young has written about this but i notice the same thing too like there's a strong case to mean that it it there's a strong case to be made that it means that he had incestuous relationship with his mother while noah was drunk because that's what if you look at the phrase uncovering your father's nakedness every well in the old testament that's what it means that's what it means and then that makes that that makes kanan then this you know like a product of incest which explains why the the curse comes on him instead of on him anyway anyway yeah we talk we have a video about that with father steven so yes i know i know i know i know so yeah i just yeah people go back and watch that if if you want to but ohh yeah pleasant stuff so but but another example another example is of course the apostles right when the apostles are at pentecost they're well actually we'll talk about the apostles in a second but another easy example is when moses comes down you know at at pentacost right he's received the law he comes down the mountain and the people the people are you know engaging in like a giant drunken origy right so there's this weird thing of like drunkenness happening at the end of pentecost which i think is which i think is interesting so we we have that and the curse of ham and then right after that we have noah's sons divide the earth among themselves by lots and this basically foreshadows the table of nations in genesis which is as we've talked about many times is a vital passage to understanding the whole idea of medieval universal history so after this happens noah makes a kind of a final testament in which he restates the noak laws and then shar cares his fears for what is going to happen to his sons and their sons after his death you know as far as they're going to stop keeping the laws and that all of these things are going to happen of course that's what happens yeah and then what we're told is that unclean spirits so demons and the offspring of demons led by masta who is also satan or the devil like he's got kind of different names throughout jubilees but they're used interchangeably they torment humanity and they start to lead humans astray after the flood and so this this sets up another very important idea in the new testament is that on the prayers of noah these demons are imprisoned in the underworld all of them except for oneth who are allowed to continue to roam the earth and test mankind this is an idea which st peter will refer to when he talks about talks about the ones chained in tartarus right this is the one this is like the whole idea when when you know jesus you know comes to the demons that are inhabiting you know the come to torment us before our time yeah that the time is the end of is the day of the lord right which they think is the end of the world but the day of the lord is actually that's when god comes to you right so so it i mean that's the subtext there is it actually is their time but yeah so anyway all of this once again see father steven d young's published works but so they're allowed to continue to roam the earth and test mankind and including afflicting them with like various diseases and so we are told that noah is then given a series of books and he's actually given them according to a related tradition he's given them by the archangel raphael who's the sort of the patron angel of like healing that he's he's given a series of books with the knowledge of the medicines and seductions of the demons and how to combat them interestingly with herbs from the earth this is such an interesting idea to me because it's like you can already see the idea of the garments of skin or or like the the old word for this is pharmacon right the thing that like it's death but also you can use it to to to off death right that's what was where we get our word pharmaceutical from it's also interesting to think that in some ways it's it's the redemption of the you know of the of the book of enoch story because in some ways those things were revealed to humans by the demons and so the archangel gabriel has to in some ways reveal them with their solution you know so it's like it's the it's this completion of the pattern of how a civilization and and this is also makes sense because that's what noah is that's what that's who noah is noah is the one who takes tech who takes these revelations from this the sons of god that became civilization became technology and weapons and he makes the ark out of it you know and that's why noah is often said to be married to tubul kain's sister right because he integrates he's able to use this aspect of the world kind of turn it and so the idea that in jubilees that gabriel would reveal raphael but yes sorry sorry sorry that rapael would reveal this again to noah you know the more pharmacon aspect of it which was part of the eth the the enoch tradition it makes a lot of sense well and and the fun thing is that rapael does this again in tobit right so so the book of tobit which is actually is in your old testament for the majority of christians that that have lived you won't have if you're if you're a protestant then it'll be an apocrypha but but most most christians at most times have had the book of tobit in the old testament and p patristic commentaries on tobit by the way are awesome very very fun the venerable bead an anglo-saxon anglo-saxon monk and and and and you know writer theologian etc he he is a wonderful commentary in tobit but anyway in the book of tobit this is exactly what this is exactly what the the archangel raphael does is he comes to he comes to tobit and and helps him helps him overcome the ws of the demons by doing things that part of the reason that luther didn't like tobit is because he felt like it was too magical like there too many things too many things that are like magic as like oh you're going to go catch the certain fish and do the certain thing with it and then you'll make some incense and the incense will drive the demon away and things like this and and that really like you know when they're trying to like purge all the superstition you know from the world or whatever like toit has to go but but but but this is this is this is kind of like i mean that's the thing that raphael does that's what raphael does like he's a healer but he's more than just a healer he shows the basically shows the way that the demon works and then gives you a way to to counteract it so yeah so and then we're told that in the days of pale the city of the tower of babel or really the city of babel is built and it's not simply a tower it's a city and a tower and father steven d young i made a point about this at the summit father steven d young got on to me was like well obviously there's a city around it i would just continue to maintain that most people don't always don't necessarily connect the the tower with the city really like well when i was a kid pe we knew there was some kind of connection between babel and babylon obviously they're the same thing but we knew there was some kind of connection between the two but but i think that i was always told that the tower of babel was built first and then later people came along to the ruins and they built the city of babylon or or something like this something like this but but the tower was always just like like even go look at artistic depictions of it sometimes it's shown with with a city but most of the time it's shown alone like just like a big tower standing out in a field or whatever which which makes no sense if you think about it for like three seconds but a surprising number of people myself included grew up with like that mental image and so i think it's worth mentioning so so we're told in jubilees that it takes 43 years to build we get it mentions these are details we don't get in genesis of course and we're told that it's you know again not simply a tower it's a city and a tower the city is in a square or rectangle and so the the idea of the city being a perfect square so it's not a round wall it's a perfect square this this is actually very important to understanding you know the apocalypse that's right and the the scent of the new jerusalem but and the lord says and in genesis the lord says now nothing will like nothing will be impossible for them or something like that but in jubilees it's like a little clearer it says the lord says now nothing will escape them mhm which i think communicates very well the totalizing nature of the spirit of babel right and then he confuses the tongues so after the confusion of the tongues a great wind comes and casts the tower down and the mention of the wind which destroyed the tower references this very old jewish tradition which by the way is also found in the cilene oracles and also in josephus and josephus account of the fall of the tower of bab so this is something everybody in the ancient world believed about the tower of baby is that had been destroyed by a great wind although that's not a detail in genesis and this passage is bracketed by two passages concerning masta and evil spirits one of which i mentioned just a moment ago and these passages make it very clear that the context in which we are meant to understand the building of the tower of babel is that of idolatry so it says the sons of noah began to war on each other to take captive and to slay each other and to shed the blood of men on earth and to eat blood and to build strong cities and walls and towers and individual began to exalt themselves above the nation boy that's not a fun thing to think about and and to found the beginnings of kingdoms and to go to war with people against people and nation against nation and city against city and all began to do evil and to acquire arms and to teach their sons war and they began to capture cities and to s sell male and female slaves and ur the son of ced built the city of ur of the cades and called its name after his own name and the name of his father and they made for themselves molten images and they worshiped each idol the molten image which they made for themselves and they began to make graven images and unclean simulakra which is not i don't want to know what they mean by that and malignant spirits assisted and seduced them into committing transgression and uncleanness and the prince masima exerted himself to do all of this and he sent forth other spirits those which were put under his hand to do all manner of wrong and sin and all manner of transgression to corrupt and destroy and to shed blood on the earth and it goes on it's a really bad time so so basically so now he's talking about the foundation of ur yeah so so that so ur is built after babel falls after bab okay yeah but basically the point of these two episodes before and after the tower of babel is to show that the idea of building a city and a tower is connected to the idea of of idolatry right that that's what it's for so this general state of affairs continues until abraham and abraham is pious and as the is the first man since the death of noah to reject idolatry and to worship the one true god this is what we're told in jubilees so as a result of his piety u by the way there are other traditions that actually have abraham like contemporary with nimrod and like he's there at the fall of the tower of babylon that stuff is really fun but anyway that's not necessarily in jubilees the timeline's like a little foggy yeah so as a result of his piety and his efforts in defying the work of masta destroying his father's idols so on and so forth god sends an angel to open abraham's mouth and ears so that he can understand hebrew and hebrew is the knowledge which has been forgotten since the fall of the tower of babel it actually says that that the word the language of hebrew has been lost since the fall so if you're reading that like an a post post augustinian context you would be like oh since since abraham sorry since adam since adam and eve like that but it probably means the fall of the tower that's the most recent fall that's been been talked about and that's where you know confus tongues are confused everything else and and the the fall in eden was not like before augustine it's not the defining fall for everybody certainly not for ancient jews there's various ones so so he's given the the knowledge of hebrew and this allows him to read the books of his father tara now we don't know exactly know what these books are they seem to have been passed down from noah so maybe these are the books that raphael gave him but they recount the true history and the nature of the world up to that time and it is from these books that abraham learns the law of god and all of this is many generations before the same law is going to be given again to moses on si so all this culminates in jubilees chapter 15 when abraham sacrifices at the feast of the first fruits and offers a sacrifice to god god accepts abraham's sacrifice and this is the occasion of the first giving of the abrahamic covenant so this is the next covenant that we meet in genesis and everybody knows the story abraham cuts all the animals in half and then like god comes between them like a smoking lamp and a burning furnace and all this stuff but in jubilees that happens very explicitly at pentecost so noah celebrates pentecost and god makes a covenant with him abraham celebrates pentecost and god makes a covenant with him and all of this is being told to us when moses is celebrating pentecost and god is making a covenant with him is there is there in abraham is there a of drunkenness after that or something i was just wondering that i can something skew there is something and i can't remember what it is now hold on what's the story right after the right after the oh so in in jubilees it is a sarah's laughter huh that comes after the yeah it and and and i think this is sort of like to counteract the drunkenness right it's the institution of circumcision so that's right so right after that okay so right after the which first the laughter first yeah it's circumcision first oh the other fun detail that you get in jubilees and this is something that i think father sten d young has talked about is we're told right after the institution of circumcision that all of the nations have been given to have been given to demons to rule which itself is a kind of disorder it says the laws for all the generations forever and there's no circumcision of the days and no omission of one day out of the eight days for it is an eternal ordinance ordained and written on the heavenly tables everyone that is born the flesh of whose foran is not circumcised on the eth day belongeth not to the children of the covenant which the lord made with abraham but to the children of the destruction and it goes on it says for the angels of the presence and all the angels of sanctification have been created from the day of their creation and before the angels of the presence and angel of sanctification he hath sanctified israel so actually israel has been set apart even before the angels were made so that they should be with him and with his holy angels and do thou comm the children of israel and let them observe the signs of this covenant for the generation as an eternal ordinance and they will not be rooted out of the land for the command is ordained for a covenant so this is still the giving of the law and there's a u by the way it says for ishmael and his sons and the brothers of and his brothers and esau the lord did not cause to approach him and he chose them not because they are the children of abraham because he knew them and he chose israel to be his people and then it goes on and yeah we get sarah's we get the the announcement of the prediction of of the birth of isaac and sarah's laughter and the angelic visitation like all of that stuff and then the the destruction of sodom and gomorra it all comes right in that sequence which is the same sequence you get in genesis i think think finding the drunkenness parallel here is maybe a little difficult yeah it might be difficult yeah i i'll think about that a little bit more we have to think about it we symbolism for sure the laughter is yeah is is a kind of counter reaction to the revelation right it's like this this this lack of control that's at the you know that's so in give give ter a little flack by the way people like you know that's what else would you do like i i think that no we often have to put ourselves in position of these characters like some of the the reactions even that god will punish are completely reasonable like the arc falling over and someone going to to like stop it it's like what would you do i would do that you know yeah yeah i think that's like sarah's sarah's laughter like is one of those things like it's not a haha that was funny laughter it's a what else do you do but laugh like in the face of somebody of god telling you this when you're in your '90s like what else do you do but anyway okay so we'll think about that a little bit more i think that there probably is something there i mean like all the sodom and gomorra stuff happens right after that yeah so so that's something that something i got to think about now at this point i have to confess to everybody that i buried the lead so this is the big secret i apologize for all the repeated material but i wanted to set this up so this is the big secret that we didn't share in the last video here i must once again mention that the author of jubilees is hyper attentive like obsessively attentive to calendars he always tells you the day or at least the week in which significant events are occurring and if you pay very close attention you will find that god descends to confuse the tongues and scatter the nations from shar in the fourth week which is how jubilees usually introduces the feast of pentecost in other words for instance jubilees chapter 15 the context of babel is thus a bad it it it's it's a celebration of pentecost that's what's happening at babel they're celebrating when the tower is destroyed it is celebration of pentecost they're celebrating pentecost but it is a act of false celebration of idolatrous worship and the lord descends what happens at pentecost god descends like earth meets heaven right so god descends as he did with noah and with abraham but this time it's not to make a covenant or god's law but it is rather to bring confusion and scattering which is the promised consequence of idolatry so jubilees relates to us this tradition which contrasts the worship and the giving of the covenant to two righteous men noah and abraham and actually later isaac also celebrates jubilees pentecost and jubilees to idolatry and therefore confusion and and dispersion it contrasts the generation of babel against the people like the people of god and so these are we could say three different events in linear history but remember that pentecost has been celebrated in heaven since the world was created this is what we're told well that means pentecost is always being celebrated in heaven right like it's always like it's a it's a it's a reality there that our experience of linear time is is connects to through the act of celebration right and this is this is a really important way i mean i i the the symbolism of of of feast and celebration and i know it's heaven meeting earth like you can just say that or what but like if you really think about like what is happening when you celebrate something i feel like that's the whole like to me that's the whole enchilada like if you could just understand like what's going on with celebration then you'd understand everything in the bible and also everything about the world like it's i just like i get stuck on it so much because it's celebration is the act of celebration is the way by which we connect to higher or lower realities right and it's it's really it's the way that you know you you gave this great keynote at the summit talking about how human attention right through the the figure of the son of man right is the thing by which the world orders itself but celebration is the primary action that gives attention like that's the primary way you give something attention is by giving it a celebration so we need to really this is to me this this idea that pentecost and the idea of the first fruits and also the notion that this has to do with multiplication like that's actually what because you let's say we look at theophany for example like our celebration of theophany theophany is also a joining of heaven and earth right the spirit comes down on the waters the earth is gathered up together you know there there's definitely a relationship between the two but the idea that that pentecost would be related to the multip to multiplication yeah is makes a lot of sense it also makes a lot of sense of this weird covenant that abraham does it's the weirdest thing in the world how why in the world like i've never understood it why would you cut things in half like why are you cutting these bulls in half and then you're walking through the middle there's no good explanation for that outside of this by the way people will again like covenant olog is like a big deal in like reform circles that i came from and people would always be like yeah the word covenant comes from the word cutting because you have to like kill something to make a covenant or you know some something like this but it's like you have to kill it and you have to split it in half and then like and then walk god reveals himself like listen weddings would be a lot gorier anim did it this way yeah but this makes a lot of it makes a lot of sense of it in the sense of you know first of all this idea that god manifests himself amidst the cutting like adits the separation right it makes sense of the separation of the waters in the in genesis one but then it also makes sense of the idea that you know if you think about how creation works there's two aspects of it one is unity one is unifying and one is separating that's how the world works in order for any identity to exist two aspects have to to be true you have to separate it from other things and you have to unify to itself and so the idea the idea of that is what the logos does or that is what the influence of heaven does is that it unifies and it separates and and what's interesting about the pentecost image is that it seems to be god revealing himself in the separation right in the multiplication right so it's like think about it it's first fruit so you know the seed comes down all these fruits appear and then god manifests itself in this multiplying but if but if it's not celebrated then it's just separation yeah right so if it's not if it if it's not celebrated properly then the influence of heaven becomes scattering it's like it it it will it it the scattering without the unifying and you can think about it like everything makes sense like think about the judgment of god too you know that's what that that's what happens when the you know the idea of of the goats going away scattering away or the idea of the burning of the chaff this idea that in some ways you know when heaven and earth when god manifest himself that's what happens unity and separation but if it's not proper then it then it ends up being end up being separating that unity and diversity those two things together is that's that is the trinity right and and and and in this point i think that i can say nonh heretically always like i'm nervous about speaking about the trinity in public because you're going to do like an accidental heresy but that this is this is an essential aspect of of divinity this is what god is right is is these two things together like unity but really really it's a comm community like community right a communion of love and that this is an essential thing to the way that god is and and when he reveals that aspect of himself if you don't celebrate it or you try to instead focus on yourself and celebrate yourself there's there's this sort of self reflexivity to idolatry i think and if you try to like sort of celebrate yourself or focus on yourself even that that that chilling sentence people put the exalted the individual over the nation right that even that kind of an idea right that's then yeah by the way richard i think okay so it's not sarah's laughter what is it it's lot's drunkenness it has to be l so stupid of course it is it has to be lot's drunkenness and his incest with his daughters like it's right downstream from the oh my gosh i'm i'm very dumb that is that's correct that's that's right well i'm dumb too cuz it's so obvious and you it's like it's so obvious i'm like just let it run jonathan let it run go there you go at some point it's like of course i mean that's and and what does that lead to that leads to the the the even the the sort of the scattering of the of the seed because like lot's a righteous man and he's part of you know but then it creates moab and it creates ammon like these two like long long-term ancestral enemies of israel right it's cra yeah okay that's there we go all right so now we need so we need to bring it down that's the second that's also like the second incest connection with pentecost too if you take that one interpretation of what ham did yeah anyway okay super weird all right yeah so to kind of like bring this down so the the basic idea i think we talked a lot in our last video and we're kind of running through our time here so i'm not going to restate all this but we talked a lot in our last video about the account of pentecost in acts chapter 2 and paralleling it to these accounts of pentecost in the old testament actually to the tower of babel which is something in the orthodox church we literally have you know hymns of old the tongues were confounded because of the audacity and the building of a tower but now the tongues are made wise for the sake of the glory of divine knowledge right and so even by the way like the way that all of this interacts with language is also something and the the the like connection and jubilees of like language and law and those two things together like this is something i'm still trying to think about but so so i mentioned last time that there's this early tradition that you can still find recorded in the writings of many like oriental orthodox communities that the day of pentecost is the occasion actually of the first divine liturgy so in the divine liturgy we have a part called the epiclesis which is the calling down of the holy spirit upon the gifts in the divine liturgy of st john chrism for instance we say send down your holy spirit upon us and upon these gifts here set forth right and and and so if you think about it like what are the apostles gathered together to do well they're all still basically pious jews right christ always kept pentecost we know this from the gospels so they're gathered together in the upper room to celebrate pentecost together so they're keeping this sort of ancient law that's written on the tables of heaven and they're celebrating pentecost together and they call down the holy spirit and what happens this wind descends on them and the wind unifies it multiplies but it also scatters remember that there are people there who think the apostles are drunk yeah now and this is a weird thing because if you pay very close attention you will find that the apostles are not for this is not an example of of glossolalia they're not just like babbling like you know like pentecostals or something not trying to throw anybody any shade but that's not what's happening in the book of acts people hear in their own language people hear them in their own language but some people hear drunkenness yeah and that is a weird thing and but it it only makes sense if you kind of have this understanding because some people hear drunkenness why because they're not keeping the feast yeah right they're not they don't have their attention oriented correctly so what they here and they experience it as drunkenness and scattering they say these guys are drunk what do you what are you guys listening like they're just babbling right and and in that sense it's like a funny almost like kind of a funny pun on the whole tower of babel thing right that word that means confusion and has come in our in our language now to mean a particular kind of linguistic confusion so the big idea that i wanted to sort of pitch is that there's only one pentecost and that this pentecost happens at one point in like an eternal moment and noah and abraham and moses and the apostles all participate in that day of pentecost but so did the people at the tower of babel yeah so did the people of the tower of babel and that if you participate in it correctly then it will unify and also multiply and if you don't give it your focus if you don't give it your attention correctly then you're going to be divided and you're going to be scattered so we've been making these universal history videos for about two a little over two years now i think we you know by my last count probably had like 23 videos in the series maybe this would be number 24 they've been genuinely generally popular very well received i've gotten such an outpouring of of appreciation from people which i'm very grateful for but i do get some funny questions and sometimes these funny question question are just people like missing the whole point of a video and sometimes it's people like trying to educate me about their favorite forms of like hetero esoterica like have you tried you know tarot or have you tried like psychedelics or whatever is like no no no thank you but one of the most common questions that i get from people like normal people is what do you mean by universal history where the emphasis is on the second word right and the word history like in its early sense from greek means like inquiry or or knowledge gained from inquiry and so we still preserve this in sense of terms like the natural history museum and so forth uh by the time the word makes its way into old english by lat via latin it's picked up sense of being the account the description the written account of past events a story or a narrative and by the 12th century when it's being used in the middle ages it means something like the account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general so the story of your people mattered because it was your story because participation in that story makes you a part of your people and if you forget yourself you cut yourself off from reality and this is what happens at the tower of babel is that people forget noah they forget the laws that were given to noah they forget the covenant of god but they're really forgetting themselves they're forgetting what it means to be human and so taken in this sense you universal history is a history of everything and everyone it's a history of who we are how we got to be where we are and how the laws and the customs and the rituals and traditions of our people give us meaning and allow us to continue to cohere so that we can be long in the land and every work of jewish and christian history from the first writings of the books of moses until modern times has seen it necessary to begin at genesis because genesis has the answer to the questions so the anglo-saxon chronicle a work which is mostly concerned with events in the eth and nth centuries in england begins with the incarnation but also takes pains to trace alfred back to noah so later on our 19th century german friends will try to move history closer to the sciences to make it a vis shaft and there was uh as one of the fathers of modern source-based historiography put it history should be concerned with what really happened but that this is only knowable through what he called genuine and original documents and so this attitude towards history so what that meant was you couldn't actually trust ancient historians like you have to ignore them and you have to go for like other things and this attitude toward history is it's not unlike the obsession with like the idea of like the original articles in biblical textual criticism which has has driven many people away from the faith quite frankly since since we don't have any such articles so this is how this all relates to pentecost taken in the medieval sense jubilees is this work of history this is why i'm so interested in it we'll probably do more videos about it it's a work of universal history because it shows the way in which the basic patterns of religious life which are feasting and fasting sabbaths and holy days are the very shape of reality itself that's the whole point of the book of jubilees and by conforming our liv to these patterns we exist and cohere we remember ourselves and we host angels like if i could tell tell on myself a little bit when i was a protestant there was like one year and i was on staff at the church so i'm telling on myself there was one year when people just like sort of forgot that easter was next week and so it was rolling around and we're like oh crap easter's next week we didn't plan anything and and somebody said well let's just push it out month because there's no reason we might have actually been on on old calendar easter that year i don't know but yeah but they were like well let's just push push out a month it doesn't really matter when we celebrate it right if you live this way your life and your society your culture will be scattered and overtaken by a ro roing chaos of competing principalities because all of these lower principalities are basically fighting over a vacant throne and i think that we see that the the account of pentecost and acts alone is enough to kind of convincingly show for instance the way that histories like jubilees are seen by the anent jews by the apostles by the early church and there are a lot of other examples of that that i haven't mentioned but when i first kind of conceived of this talk i was just thinking let's just do neat extra biblical traditions about genesis like and i'll just talk about that at the summit but as i started digging into jubilees more closely and the more closely i looked at the traditions around the tower of babel i realized that this is really a perfect study for the whole idea of universal history right this is why we're doing this project it's my deep belief that the time of scripture is the time of our own lives that we're not fundamentally different people from the human beings who first attempted to build babylon the great right so the question that i'm asked most frequently by listeners is how do you integrate all this universal history stuff into your daily life like what should i do and the suggestions that people sometimes come up with worry me a little sometimes it seems like everybody's reflex is to like make up some own little rituals or practices to give their lives meaning and i just want to say like don't do that that's what i want to just tell people is don't try to roll your own okay instead start by doing what god commanded noah according to the book of jubilees every human being that has ever lived is commanded to pray each morning and evening together with your family or with other people if you can if you need help figure out what to pray i have suggestions keep yourself clean from idolatry and keep the feast of pentecost and i mean really keep it be present in church on the day of pentecost participate in the sacrifice of the people of god and of course st peter ends his his great pentecost sermon repent and be baptized right that's how he ends it actually like i like i like how even st peter ends with go to church so yeah so that's and but he says he says that when he says repent and be baptized for forgiveness forgiveness of sins he says this promise is for you and for your children and this idea of the promise being for you and for your children even in there there's this idea that thing we're doing in religion in christianity or really any other religion for that matter isn't just like here's a nice individual choice that i am making on behalf of myself but rather i am joining myself and also the people who come after me to a community to a story right and therefore the promise and what's word for promise well it's covenant right is for you and for your children and so peter is showing them the way here's how now if you want to participate in the covenant right god's law coming and being written as it was prophesied in the old testament not on tables of stone but on our hearts if you want to be a part of that you have to join that covenant and and and come in you know come in as a family into the family so to speak so anyway that's that's just a some of that's rehashing and some of that stuff that i ran out of time to state the summit so but i think the big the big interesting reveal at least for people interested in the the idea that pentecost is the anti- babel right we hear that in church and when you see the story in scripture you you can see it but it's very odd it's kind of you get a sense of what it is but then the best way to understand it is that pentecost is really the full revelation of that pattern because it has both you know the unifying and the multiplying right in extreme in an extreme way because the multiplying is is an aspect of unifying right so as the people hear in their own tongue as there's this celebration of diversity right in the right way which is that the logos can manifest themselves all the way into your own culture which is what we keep saying in terms of what universal history is is that that all true cultures all true stories can be connected to the universal one right to the story of the logos manifesting in the world without completely losing its quality right because that's also what christianity is and so in the story of pentecost you really get in some ways the full revelation of what universal history is and you know this image of this sorry the wind i mean it's the wind the same wind it's the same wind the wind that knocks over the tower is also the wind that fills the the holy the the apostle is the holy spirit like in both cases like i mean i'm sorry i i i i interrupted you but just like the idea that of like god manifesting as wind by the way is something that really bothers me like in a good way but like it's like well you know it's so funny because the the people people they're they they're so hung up like they as soon as when you start to see it a good example you know if you you know during the liturgy if there are sever priests in the altar they'll take the i forget what the name of the cloth is right and then they'll do this over the called yeah yeah and so i remember a priest once saying oh we have proof that maybe this is just to chase away the flies and i'm like really to chase away the flies well actually maybe it is to chase away the flies but that doesn't prevent it from being not at all exactly what it is which is the descent of wind onto the thing even even the action of chasing way flies by the way is deeply symbolic action like yeah it's exactly like this you want the things that don't belong to scatter and you want the wind to come and unify that which is there in it's but and by the way do you know why it's called the air no what do you mean well i'm trying to remember if if that the particular thing they're moving is the air i think the air is actually the veil that you put over the the some priest out there will correct me on this i think the air is actually the you know what i have a theory about this but i'm going to stop talking because i words confused in my head and i don't want to embarrass anybody so but but for sure what you can see is that you know even in the story in the gospel when jesus actually blows on the disciples like he just he just blows on them you know all of these things which which oh no it is the air it is the air okay what is the air it's it's called the air a e r ae r that's what the cloth is called and it's but it's i mean the word means like air it means it means the atmosphere mh and if you the there's that prothesis ritual like the the liturgy before the liturgy the little thing that the priest and the deacon do to get the gifts ready prepared and if you pay attention to the service they're actually like it's like it's the it's the recreation of the world the genesis but it's also the cru of fiction and both of those things are happening so the air is like that's the that's the atmosphere that's the airc the dome the dome of heaven that's placed so anyway that's always been super cool to me because like when st maximus the confessor says something like you know when christ was on the cross he was creating the world or like finishing the creation of the world right like you actually see that in the prothesis ritual itself like it's it's like that's just baked in and i'm sure nobody did that on purpose so to speak like it's just like this is what we do but anyway yeah so so but yeah the but the air like the the wind descending the air descending the spirit i mean that's what the word spirit me we don't and we don't have to you know once you understand that these things are not separate sear at that yeah that the the use of the physical let's say manifestation of the deep pattern is not a superstition right it is the uniting of heaven and earth and so of course blowing on something is not sufficient like i could if i blow on and if i blow on the on a cup just out of in my home does not make it the eucharist but in the proper context within the proper meaning structure you know in the proper hierarchy then the this physical act becomes the vehicle for the higher pattern necessarily because that's actually how the world functions and just two more instances of of of like air and blowing right so christ when he comes to the apostles when he appears to them after his resurrection says that he breathes on them and says receive the holy spirit and of course like the fullness of that doesn't come till pentecost which is a weird thing by the way yeah i don't really understand why but it's also to show that look folks the that the disciples receive from heaven is already the spirit that makes the world exist it's like there is a newness to it but there's also a deep continuity it's not like this thing that all of a sudden happens and ever it is it is in some ways something both new but also a repetition of something that has always been true so i'm not i don't want to to to say that can i say this i don't want to diminish the reception of the holy spirit after baptism but it is activating something which is true about being human so there's an important difference between something being new and something being novel like novel is like oh i've never seen this before something being new is in the sense of like it it hasn't like hasn't decayed right you know like so it's like you can have something that's that's that's new in the sense of of it's like the we seeing in like the pascal canon come let us drink the new vintage right this is the new vintage this is the new line right but it but it's not like pcco or passover wasn't around before right but this is the this is the better vintage right you know and it's not like adam wasn't literally created that way like created by this holy spirit the same spirit on pentecost the one you receive after baptism going into adam and that's actually how humans are made so and that brings me to the other example which is when we make a catechumen in the orthodox church okay the priest reads exorcism prayers and by the way those exorcism prayers kick all kinds of butt they're so cool he reads exorcism prayers and he comes over to the cumin and we'll actually do this even if it's a baby or an adult or whatever will come over and he'll breathe three times in the face over the face and breast of the of the person who's being received in the shape of a cross and that breathing is especially with connection to baptism right there is a sense of like god breathing a spirit into adam right but it's also it's also like a scattering right because it comes with the exorcism right it comes with the exorcism the whole point of that breath blows out it does like i don't like there's there there's there's probably like a a more intellectual way to explain this but yeah like you're just like it's a it's a it's a wind that scatters the demons right it blows the demons out like and and and there's something about the in the context of the right that's bring performed the context of the person who's doing who's a priest who's who's you know been ordained for the purpose etc like but but it's it's just i mean that is to me that's one of my favorite that's one of my favorite writs because it's so earthy and and you get spit on the devil and i know that some people are like oh the spitting on the devil think that probably came later and and and whatever like i don't care i like it u but anyway the the the like there's no way to like explain this stuff to to like a modern person without them like feeling it it's superstitious but more and more i think people are are coming back around to being able to understand the world in this way and it's it's it's the like for for a child or for a saint it's very easy to understand what's he doing he's blowing the demons away right yeah and then if you ask a stupid person like me then you what's he doing oh well it's like the bre and and you know like it's expl the symbolism and stuff like this like i have to i have to like couch on all these things but then like basically you know it's but it's both of those things it's the way it's the way that the wind works right great name for like a 70s like i don't know like celtic band anyway the the way that the wind works it's the it's the it's the way that the wind works in terms of it gives life but then it also blows things away that shouldn't be there so yeah going back again to like keeping the flies off the gifts or whatever which is you know this is one of the purposes of like the lurgical fans as well right well that has nothing that that does not in any way negate like the symbolism of what's happening on a spiritual level like that's the whole point yeah somebody's like this was to get rid of the flies i'm like i know i know but like you know there's l literally a demon called lord of the flies so you know you do what you want to with that but anyway so i'm rambling now but this is good so i think i think that you know what the point i wanted to make before we end is mostly to understand how this is what universal history is universal is is about this idea the pentecost as being the possibility of both multiplicity and unity fully you know that everybody hearing the word in their own story in their own logos in their own the logos here in the logos in their own their own lives and in their own traditions all of this is possible it doesn't mean that everything is good and that everything is kept and it's all good that's not what it means but it means that that possibility is there and that the connection between the two will reveal what is true and what is good about about the story so yeah yeah it's beautiful it's beautiful like that and that's why like when i started looking i was like this is what this is what we have to talk about because it's the whole project it's the whole thing that we've been trying to do like all contained in a single story and i would just tell people listen you're going to celebrate pentecost actually whether or not you want to and and the the the so the society that you live in is trying to build babel right and we see you can see what's happening you can see the scattering coming right so you know celebrate pentecost be like noah be like you know and then yeah anyway that's it all right everyone and so so yeah this is we're continuing on with the universal history pay attention we you know we're coming back so we'll see you very soon and everyone pay attention because as we hinted at earlier richard and i are going to go to hell soon actually we're going to go to hell after pca which is a bit odd yeah well lent was really busy too busy going to hell in other ways in other ways exactly and so and so we are going to do a first pass at dante we're going to go to to to do the inferno you know we're going to do the contos go through the contos we're going to give ourselves a lot of time now for each episode to to listen to richard's analysis but then also i'll do some symbolic interpretation as well with questions this is going to be a massive symbolic world feast and so we're definitely looking forward to going to hell with all of you after pasa my favorite thing about dante is that it by the time you get through the comedy you will have talked about everything it is it is in many ways the sort of the apex of the whole universal history project of the middle ages because dante leaves almost nothing on the table he integrates something from everything that came before him and so it's going to be incredible i love the comedy as most people
