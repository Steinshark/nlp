today we're talking about a fun little find and a hundred thousand dollar little heist jake paul tried to pull one over on you guys but of course the blockchain doesn't lie and we caught him and we're going to expose it today jake paul thought man i really snuck that one by everybody but he didn't because the blockchain just never changes so even if he gets away with it for a week or a month eventually we catch him and we will make him suffer no that's a little dramatic listen guys i'll be honest i never make any kind of pretensions about saying that these people will go to jail or that it's a crime as you know kryptos very unregulated right now but i can say without a shadow of a doubt what has been done here is deeply unethical and in my opinion the sentence is you know what i mean like i mean i'm not saying anything but i'm just saying my opinion sentence is there we go so in case you were wondering what i thought about it let's jump into today's video we're talking of course about jake paul sort of the lesser of the paul brothers but he's been talking a lot about boxing all this stuff but behind the scenes he's been getting into crypto nfts the influencers favorite grift and so when i saw this i got curious f it i just jumped into this hype and minted my first nft definitely living in a simulation these devils are clean af for real at sacred devil nft sacreddevilsnft.com now you're thinking to yourself if you're a jake paul or you're thinking to yourself oh boy you got to get in this new nft that jake's really interested in guys he's just clean clean dude these are the first ones he wants to mint so of course as a jake pauler myself i had to investigate and what i found out shocked me jake paul is not actually that interested in the sacred devil's nft project he has been paid behind the scenes six figures for this project to pump it always guess respect the pump that's right ladies and gentlemen and not only that he tried to hide it let me show you now the first thing we need for this investigation is to know his nft account luckily it wasn't hard to find your mom 169 that's definitely him the second thing we need is the league of sacred devils account which is listed right here now there is no connection between jake paul and this account and that's i think important to say it was hidden through a friend of his named john marionek this is john's instagram right here and as you can see he hangs out with his buddy jake paul a lot they have similar interests and he calls himself a marketing and crypto god now once we find his nft account things become much clearer here's his nft account and here's what you need to know jake paul posted this tweet shilling this nft project on september 8th but on september 7th something very interesting happened the league of sacred devils that we just found paid john marioneck his buddy 43 aetherium and the very next day on the day of jake's tweet september 8th john marianeck then pays jake paul's nft account 40 of that aetherium this leaves three ethereum for john marianeck himself as a finder's fee but to put this together league of extraordinary devils paid jake paul 40 ethereum in an undisclosed deal that is currently worth 178 thousand dollars to shill an nfd project i seriously can't believe they thought they were gonna get away with this by just shuffling it through his little crypto buddy john they thought they were going to get away with not disclosing this now to be clear for everyone out there who's wondering what's wrong with not disclosing well quite a lot actually see if i do a sponsorship deal of any kind and i'm not even talking about like a regulated stock i'm talking about if i'm doing a manscaped commercial if i'm doing a g-fuel ad i have to tell you guys that i am being paid for it because obviously you guys listen to every word i say and if i didn't tell you guys in advance you guys might be influenced in a direction if you didn't know that i had been paid to make that statement so it is highly unethical and against most guidelines for influencers to not disclose that you have been paid a hundred and eighty thousand dollars for shilling an nft project an nft project by the way which has cratered they used to do like 400 sales a day now they sell on average like two to three of these profiles because obviously all the hype was just driven by jake paul tweeting about it and then never tweeting again because he ultimately doesn't care about this now i want to be clear i wasn't the only one who found out about this kyreel.eth first had the story want to disclose that sacred devils paid you 30 that was actually more than that before you made that post and you didn't add at ftc now when this happened the guys over at this team sort of panicked that they had been caught and so two days after they had done this undisclosed post they decided to come clean they said we want to announce something big as you know jake paul tweeted us and since then he's minted several sacred devils we spoke to him and his team before he tweeted and we decided to create a partnership the goal around that partnership is to be charitable guys and give back oh man if they had only said that before i mean gosh it's charity guys where have we heard and a crypto project is for charity before i don't know my name's frasier and i support save the kids token and they go on to say that as part of this partnership that they didn't disclose they're going to be donating a jake paul nft and auction it for charity guys because this deal jake paul they're about charity giving back to the community now guys would you like to know how much this charity nft auctioned off for i mean bear in mind it must have auctioned off for a lot because remember the purpose of this whole partnership is to be charitable and give back so would you like to know they're paying jake a hundred seventy thousand dollars to tweet about them how much are they giving back to charity ten thousand dollars it auctioned off for ten ten thousand ten thousand dollars 2.5 eve guys let's give it up for charity guys jake paul is supporting charity he makes a hundred eighty thousand dollars the charity makes ten thousand dollars and you guys get some worthless nfts that you're never gonna be able to sell frankly this is the grip i keep trying to explain to everybody and i will explain until i'm blue in the face and these influencers no longer have any credibility when these guys go push a project they make the majority of the money so does the project the project has now traded 348 ethereum which is about 1.5 million dollars worth of volume right 1.5 million dollars worth of volume jake paul's made 150 to'0 000 depending on the price you're using and charities made ten thousand dollars and you guys have made absolutely nothing this is a grift ladies and gentlemen this is what it looks like they are actively trying to hide it from you they pay his buddy his buddy pays him he silently tweets about it doesn't disclose that it's an ad you guys rush in buy the worthless nfts and they run off with the money is the fbi gonna show up i don't know what do i think should happen that's that's it that's i you know what i mean i can't i'm not a judge right i'm not i'm just here to expose these guys that's my job i'll just tell you what they did and you guys well honestly the police should decide is this a crime i mean right now crypto so unregulated but you still have to disclose that something is a sponsorship so again i don't know if jake paul is going to go to jail but in my opinion sorry i've done that too many times at this point i'm just saying i'm sick of it dude i'm sick of watching these guys take people's money take their fans money and then just pretend it never happened after this do you think jake has continued to tweet about sacred devils nft no dude no he was paid he got his bag and got out when are you guys gonna realize that so yeah this this is a light investigation it's fun not let's not get too serious about it okay just a cool hundred thousand plus heist by old jake paul he thought he was gonna get away with it but not on our watch guys i hope you had a great one thank you for watching more investigations in the future and i will see you guys [music] but things will be different if i was balling
