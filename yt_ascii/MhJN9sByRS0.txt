if you wish to play along with the start of 
this video think of any number b i mean don't   think of a letter think of a number when i did 
this i picked 440 producing nicole when we   were practicing picked 17 your choice any 
number we're going to call that number b this   is optional by the way but more fun if you play 
along so take whatever number you've got and now   raise it to some power which is going to make it 
a lot bigger you might have a much much bigger   answer on your screen i'm a huge fan though of 
exponents big exponent of exponents so whatever's   on your screen now i subtract one and that's 
your mystery number and i guarantee whatever your   mystery number may be it is divisible by one less 
than whatever number you started with yes b to   the power of and subtract one is always divisible 
by b minus one some people are underwhelmed by   this i was stunned i was like wait why on earth 
is any power subtract one divisible by one less   than the base of that power and i was like oh 
it can't be in terms of like prime factors cuz   if i start with my 440 which has got a bunch of 
different prime factors when i then take that   and raise it to a power in my case i cubed it 
yes you do keep the same factors because these   are now just all cubed but everything changes 
when you subtract one cuz if you subtract one   off a number you don't get to keep any of the 
factors cuz two can consecutive numbers do not   have any factors in common so these are now all 
gone we subtract one off down here these are now   all gone but why on earth is the resulting number 
from taking one off this power a multiple of the   number we started with why do subtracting one off 
of power and subtracting one off the base still   mean they've got those factors but now there are 
new factors down here that we didn't have before   why on earth does that work i thought i have 
to prove this and there are several ways you   can prove it and the reason i'm making the video 
is because i realized there's two different ways   you can prove this fact both of which illuminate 
something about doing mathematics because there's   the kind of standard way that you would do which 
is where you take some off-the-shelf pre-existing   mathematics and you just hit the problem with that 
for long enough until you get to a solution and   that's that's what that's what you actually do if 
you're out doing maths as a job or in your career   you just take some math exists and you use it in 
this case you might start by looking at the easier   case of just b^2 - 1 which is the difference of 
two squares which factorizes as b -1 b + 1 and   oh there we are we've now got our b minus1 as a 
factor in general if you think back to pols if you   find the root of a polinomial which means a value 
you can put into it where you get zero out the   other side in our case b to the n minus one if you 
put in one for b you definitely get zero so one is   a root of this polinomial doesn't matter what n 
is and if you've got any root of a polinomial if   you subtract that root off whatever the variable 
is in our case b you definitely get a factor of   that polinomial and that proves it that's all you 
got to do proof done but if you have forgotten   why that is the case for the roots of polinomial 
or you never knew or you know you just pick it   up and use it as a technique it's not giving you 
any insight into what's going on which brings me   to the second proof this is why i wanted to make 
the video because by putting this in an unusual   context it suddenly becomes obvious something that 
surprised and stunned me is now patently obvious   and we're going to switch to base b so whenever 
you do this problem you' got to think about it   in the base of whatever b is so i would have to do 
it in base 440 but whatever the basse may be which   we just going to call b if got a power of b then 
that would be written as just one and then a lot   of zeros that makes sense and if we subtract one 
off that well oh well we're going to have whatever   the digit or symbol for one less than b is which 
we just call that a so if you subtract one off b   to some power it's now in base b a a a a a where 
a is 1 less than b and if i now said would you   believe this number is divisible by a of course 
it's all all a's it's like saying take 10 raise   that to some power you could cube it or i know 
power of six 10 the 6 is a million if you take a   million and subtract one it's 999999 one less than 
any power of 10 is all n if i then said hey would   you believe that number is divisible by nine of 
course it is it's all nines it's nine * 1111 and   that works in any base because whatever number 
b you pick that's an you can use that as a base   for a number system and so by turning the problem 
into an unusual base and i don't think anyone's   ever used base 440 before but if you put it in the 
base of whatever b is then suddenly it makes sense   of course it's true and i like that because it's a 
proof where i can follow the steps and at the end   it's obvious now don't get me wrong there might 
be more insight to be had like what of the other   factors there's always more maths you can do but i 
like the fact as well as the kind of function just   got to do math for my job or to do something else 
i want to achieve you've also got the fun oh that   gives me some insight and it was an unexpected 
pattern i didn't see coming thank you so much   for watching this video i should mention my book 
love triangle we are still taking pre-orders this   will be out in june in the uk and august in the us 
and if you pre-order this on mass gear at mg.co.za dust jacket we're currently handing out the 
tetrahedral edition of the dust jackets and   when they run out there's plenty of the 
triangle one once they're gone then it's   over so oh and it's cheaper cheaper on 
other websites like amazon on mass   gear we have to charge full price 
um because we pay all our taxes yeah
