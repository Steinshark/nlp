okay so i've been studying the story of job and jo story of job is the story of suffering yes and meaningless right what seems like random events right well or worse than random malevolent malevolent right so so worse than random okay so this is how the story sets itself up so we're told at the beginning of the story that job is a good man and so and we have the testimony of god himself on on job's account and so god up in heaven bragging away so to speak about how good job is and his sons come to observe and one of whom is satan and satan says i don't think job's that good i think he's just fortunate and god says no i think he's good and satan says why don't you let me have a crack at him and we'll see if he's good and so god says yeah okay have do your worst and in consequence and that's the malevolent element let's say at least the arbitrary element but perhaps the malevolent element job loses everything that he's worked for virtually everything he works for he loses much of his family he's he's he becomes very ill and not just ill but in ill in a way that's disfiguring and shameful and then his friends come along his friends and tell him that well you know if he had been a better guy none of this would have happened so really it's his fault and then job job has a response and this is why i'm bringing up this story job's response is to insist that despite proximal evidence it's a requirement to maintain faith in the essential goodness of the individual especially an individual who's been conducted himself ethically which job has been by his own testimony and by god's testimony we know job is a good man and job job's wife tells him when she observes his suffering she says there's nothing left for you to do but shake your fist at god curse him and die and job says instead and he insists this to his friends he refuses to lose faith in his essential goodness and he also refuses to lose faith in the essential goodness of god and there's something it's something like this and this is what's relevant to the shattered assumptions notion is that in order to stabilize the structure through which you view the world it is necessary to adopt as axiomatic the notion that whatever happens to you if you conduct yourself ethically is the best thing that could happen regardless of the proximal evidence and also it's necessary for you not to lose faith faith in the essential goodness of being itself and those are those are religious proclamations right they're proclamations of a kind of religious faith right right well and it seems to me to and tall and tall orders at that right oh god the the yes the tallest in fact the tallest of ers exactly well it's interesting a because the book of job is one of the books that really sets the stage in the biblical corpus for the story of the crucifixion right because the crucifixion story is the story of job expanded even more thoroughly right now these shattered assumptions that you describe they they seem to me to be identical to axioms of faith conceptually speaking right they're eight prior commitments except yes at some level except you know they develop you know the way we think we should need to think about them is these developed from early infancy from childhood i mean these are they're based in you know it's not like somebody's taking a leap of faith faith is based on you know you don't need sort of there validity in the world is irrelevant do you know that's what faith is about right you don't things don't have to there's no proof right it's it's it's it's it you take it a leap an act of faith these are fundamental beliefs based on experience they're not they're not just you know sort of pie in the sky they're not things that you know i i i want to believe that these are not desires they're based on let's say the infant who is getting good enough parenting not great parent good enough parenting realizes the world is predictable the child cries the mother the father come and help the world becomes meaningful becomes benevolent you know it's good world i'm getting fed i must be worth something i mean these are very you know rudimentary kind of beliefs but it starts there and and it builds and you know what comes first obviously gets confirmed i do think though you were calling them naive at one level it's what allows us to wake up in the morning and approach the day okay yeah assuming our assumptions haven't been shattered they haven't been shattered that's right but even if they have been shattered the the the the what we what is also important to recognize is people that started with these positive assumptions actually do better in coping with the shattered beliefs because they actually have something to kind of move back to okay if you start with very negative beliefs about the world if you start with you know you are going to be more prone to possibly the a realistic view of the world being bad if that's what you know when bad things do happen in the world right to good people right bad things happen to good people then nevertheless you are going to be more prone to depression and anxiety just you know living in the world world is harder so some of these what seem like illusory beliefs are you know are what allow us to be you talked about motivation it allows us to get be motivated on a daily basis to function and operate and you know love and care and you know so i do think and and they have long-term consequences when bad things happen because what happens if after the shattering is people try to rebuild these assumptions in the best cases and by the most cases not the cases that all go to psychologists and whatever if you if you did huge community surveys which we did you find lots of people have gone through some really horrible things and don't necessarily go to a clinician you know now everybody goes to clinicians 30 40 years ago that wasn't the case people people coped they did well know they had people who cared around them they their own sort of internal worlds allow them to to tr of deal one thing that i found that was fascinating for example is that self-blame was remarkably common after all of these things even when i i i was i i i did some work with people who are paraplegics or quadriplegics from being shot randomly on the street or just you rand truly random events you and i would unquestionably call random when as a v for for the victim and this it would still engage in some self- blame now why it's it's not and by the way the only literature that talked about self- blame were rape victims because everybody was blaming the women anyway right which was just because victims blame themselves doesn't mean they're blameworthy okay so why why blame why engage in this in in you know in ways that seem inappropriate given the true situation it's because that allowed people to get some sense of control to start believing the world isn't random to start believing the world is not as bad as they thought taking some of the blame on themselves now the sad part of that is of course other people could then blame them more if they were blaming themselves when that is not appropriate or legitimate but what we do in terms of our own coping i think is really kind of fascinating and that was something that was surprising to me seeing all this self-blame but there are lots of other ways people cope you know they think of worse cases but people would you know sort of try to rebuild assumptions of course initially there's a lot of numbing and people can't kind of deal with the situation but over time you get all the intrusive thoughts right not the denial but the intrusive thoughts when you're ready to work on it and our brains are are our our human species systems are remarkable at working on things that need to be solved even when we're not conciously doing it right and over time what i found is people did remarkably well that doesn't mean they they never rarely return to the same as you would say naive assumptions but they turn to more positive assumptions about the world and were sadder but wiser
