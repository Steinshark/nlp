[music] hey what's up guys i'm qvhd here and the car that i'm driving right now is called the tesla model y performance and this car i was going to do like a whole big review of it but since i've already done an autofocus on the model 3 i think we can keep this one pretty simple so this car it looks like a model 3 from many angles especially when you're outside from the front you look at it just like a model three same front end same headlights same idea but as soon as you see it from the side then you get like a little more of that profile you start to see how much more headroom there is how much more of that dna from the model x is coming in so it fits right into the family and i think it's good as far as electric cars go that it does look pretty familiar and then you start to see some of the bigger differences so on the model 3 where there was chrome everywhere every single model y has a matte black trim around the windows and the mirrors and the door handles all matte black trim which is sweet i happen to think it looks pretty dope and also i don't know if you can tell on that back window every single model y i've seen on the road has tinted back windows and this one came with tinted back windows i think from the factory they're tinting the back windows and rear window of every model y i don't think model s or model x or model 3 do that but i also think that looks pretty good and then inside it's got this huge amount of uninterrupted glass for the roof right from the front seats all the way to behind the back seats it's perfect for visibility or just stargazing or whatever you end up being into but the point is visibility from pretty much every angle except rear is pretty good i think when you look straight back from this car the tailgate comes up kind of high and then that roof line goes down pretty low so the rear is a little bit tight but other than that you can see everything oh and also speaking of the tailgate this car also has a power liftgate unlike model 3. all right doug demuro style we have a quark feature the power liftgate trunk has a memory just like model s and model x so typically when you open that power liftgate from either in the car or outside it opens all the way this is the max height this is great but maybe you don't want to reach up this high every time or you have a low garage so you can bring this down a little bit maybe halfway and then hold that button for three seconds you hear a little chime so now every time you open the trunk from here on out that'll be the memorized height so if you ever go back into your garage or that low space again it won't ever open past the memorized height so if i did it right it should stop about halfway there you go so model y because of this tailgate has a lot more uninterrupted storage too thanks to being a hatchback so without even putting the seats down thanks to no transmission and no gas tank you already have a ton of space in here and it's nicely separated too and then putting the seats down gets you like eight feet of uninterrupted space to the point where i've seen people put a bed in the back of the car here like this and camp in it and the seats powerful by the way so the switches are on the left side of the trunk you flip them and it folds right down i think really though there's two main things that you think as you're sitting in the driver's seat driving a model y number one is that you're just higher off the ground than a model three of course and then number two is everything else is just like a model three so the being higher off the ground part i think there's some upside and some downside to that a lot of people like the utility of being higher off the ground you obviously have more road clearance you have more visibility and you just generally feel safer when you feel like you can see more i can see like right over the nose of this car pretty easily so being higher off the ground is nice literally it's the same seats as model 3 but on risers it's easier to get in and out of the car all that is real but the downside if you care about like the sportiness or the feel of the drive is yeah you are further from the road so you feel a little less connected to the road i'm not like a i'm not a car reviewer i'm not i'm not going to go top gear on you is what i'm trying to say talking about driving dynamics and all that sort of thing but pretty clearly when you're further from the road you feel a little bit less sporty but that's not to take away from the performance of this car this car feels nimble agile same steering wheel same turning radius all the sport settings on this car feels really nice half my driving around roads like this is like swerving around potholes roads are pretty rough in the northeast all the time and the ride quality in the performance model y it's actually kind of harsh sometimes i feel like with the coil suspension which is the same as the model 3 and then also with these big 21-inch wheels it's not as forgiving now if you get the non-performance version you can get it with smaller wheels it'll still have the coil suspension but it'll feel a little more forgiving but honestly anytime you're driving an electric car with all the torque you get right away it's always going to feel really fast so then when i say it feels just like a model 3 that's not really that surprising because this car shares like 75 percent of its parts with the model 3 inside and out it almost is a model 3. the interior is of course almost exactly the same and it's this like staggeringly minimal look it's a super clean look to it of course and there's also literally no buttons anywhere in the car except the door handles the steering wheel and the hazard button which i think is one of the buttons legally required to be in the car so everything else is on the single center screen like everything else so that's the speedometer the navigation everything and you know i've now that i've had this car for it's almost been two weeks actually i've gotten used to a lot of it but some of it i still kind of wish actually was just a regular butt like i don't know there's just so many little things that were just used to being buttons like the windshield wipers are on the touch screen anytime you want to change their speed that's where you'll find the controls the glove box there's no button for that even next to the glove box itself you have to get to that through the center screen and even even the air conditioner vents like if you just want to reach up and adjust the air to make it point at your face or something you can't even do that you have to do that on the screen now it is a super cool futuristic looking ui where you have all this directing the air wherever you want but still sometimes i just want to just i just want to just put put the air on my face like with one little so i know i don't know there's a lot of stuff happening on the screen it's all super cool but at the same time i kind of wish i had a little bit more manual control the key this is the key it's a it's a card key you can also connect your app but this is the key and when you get in the model y it tells you to put your foot on the brake and put the key right here next to the armrest which is this very glossy slippery surface there's no magnets or anything and so as soon as you drive away or if you accelerate kind of hard which you might in an electric car or break kind of hard or do anything that's not a straight line it just slides off and falls into the seat or on the floor and that's not very elegant so i understand most people will just use the app on your phone because you got a car that can do that you'll use the app but i kind of wish there was like a dedicated place that could just hold the key and not have it slide all over the place it would feel a little more a little more not professional what's the word refined i talk about a lot of this stuff in the model 3 autofocus episode about how this is a high-tech car with all the autopilot and computer vision and software updates and supercharging and all that stuff and also did a second video about how tesla's improve over time so i'll link both of those videos below the like button if you want to check them out but i think the main focus for tesla right now is manufacturing and quality control those two those are the two main concerns starting a long time ago but especially with model y so at the time of me recording this this fully loaded spec model y i'm driving with autopilot costs about seventy thousand dollars and that's that's still an expensive car so they haven't started making all the cheaper versions yet and so for that price even if you're not the most picky person about that type of stuff which i'm not actually you still want things to be built well and even in this model y that tesla gave me i found it have some pretty big panel gaps the one back left over the trunk is pretty serious potentially letting like water into the car and i think causing more wind noise the sun visor on the passenger side is pretty loose like it could just fall off if you pull too hard the hazard button up top is a little bit indented and just not quite aligned right and the front trunk lip isn't quite even all the way around and you kind of notice it after you look at it for too long and this is the one tesla gave me so you know people who are obviously not getting a review unit that can be looked over five or six times before it's shipped off to be in front of a high-res camera you know people are gonna also have some of the same issues potentially more issues as we're still in this early stage of manufacturing now like i said i'm personally not actually very picky about things like panel gaps like i like high quality materials but generally i'm someone who's more focused on when i'm driving the actual driving experience so i'm paying attention to the handling the way the car feels when you're steering the zero to 60 and for all of those fundamentals and all the extra high-tech stuff like autopilot this car crushes it it just does maybe it's kind of like a smartphone review where i can only i can only tell you so much about the phone that you're definitely gonna get like i can tell you about the hardware and the performance and typically how it works but a lot of the little stuff like that can be tweaked and fixed with software updates you can expect to be probably different from the phone that i'm reviewing before it comes out and that's kind of the same thing here with a tesla they changed so much stuff over time that you know all the fundamentals the driving the acceleration the autopilot the features the minimal interior all that is still going to be the same about anyone who orders a model y but a lot of the smaller stuff like the fit and finish and a lot of the little things like the seats and the little software features may very well change by the time someone else gets their model y but as far as that stuff that i pay attention to that matters i'm a big fan of this car [music] you
