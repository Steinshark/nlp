when people say that they speedrun a mario kart game it sometimes raises some confusion how do you speed run mario kart isn't the point already to just go as fast as you can and they're often right for most mario kart games the run consists of just driving around each track as quickly as you can it doesn't look like much of a speed run but more to someone being really good at mario kart mario kart 64 however is a little bit different [music] the speed running scene for this game has had a really long history one that goes back to pretty much right after the game came out in 1996 most players are just focused on the time trial mode where they tried to beat each track for just a lap of each track as quickly as they could dozens of players held a world record at some point or another in the time trial mode and over time each track had its time slowly come down this has led to some of the most optimized world records in any game that i'm aware of when time comes off from a time trial world record today it's never by more than a couple of frames but one other thing that these players quickly discovered was just how broken mario kart 64 truly was nearly every track had some sort of unintentional shortcut or skip that you could do to drastically speed the time up some were easy some were hard and soon in addition to the standard time trial races of racing around each track without any shortcuts people began to do races with these shortcuts included as well this went on for more than a dozen years all these world records are well documented on mariokart64.com and are still being lowered to this day eventually though people decide to start doing something a little different with the game instead of only racing one track at a time or in some cases even just a lap at a time runners began to do full runs of the entire game they would play the 150 cc mode the fastest mode and go through the game black by lap track by track cup by cup if they did it without using shortcuts it was 150 cc no skips if they used shortcuts it was 150cc skips both categories i ran today but the one that has received much more attention is the one that i think really redefines what mario kart speedrunning is all about 150cc skips [music] [music] so just how broken is this category to answer that we'll start by looking at one of the first runs of the category with video evidence 3211 by dntn31 in february of 2013. he started off by doing this skip on luigi raceway with her blue shell sending him through the roof and skipping half a lap the blue shell works a little differently in this game than in the recent ones you shoot it on the ground and it hits anybody in its path on the way to the first place driver this balloon always gives you a blue shell which is usually only available to people in the back shooting this item in first place means it will come right back and hit you shooting you up into the air and allowing you to skip the half lap the next course moomoo farm doesn't have any skips and the next one koopa troopa beach doesn't either although it does have a glitch where you go next to the finish line the game thinks you're in eighth place and if you use an item during this brief period of time you get an eighth place item which could be something useful like a star or a mushroom calamari desert the last course in the mushroom cup has a major one there's a trick players do called sand backing hanging back and dropping into eighth place at the start to try and collect a specific item that you need normally an item that can only be obtained on one of the lower rankings by doing this to collect a star at the start you are then able to go into the tunnel drive halfway through and turn around and activate the star which skips a lap this was intended to be an easter egg where you drive into the tunnel and activate a star continue driving and eventually do end up a lap ahead but speedrunners found this way to abuse it toad's turn bike the first course in the flower cup wasn't designed too well the rails on the side are fairly easy to hop through as it turns out if you hop through the railing then get placed down on a specific spot and immediately turn and hop through again you'll go all the way through and land on the track below skipping half a lap as if this wasn't enough once reaching the finish line again all the player had to do was hop into the railing again and lackatu would get confused and put him back down halfway through the lap perhaps snowland is extremely broken there's a trick at the start that anybody can do without any difficulty if you hop off of the bridge at the start directly onto the snow like this and drive out of bounds lakitu will place you back on the bridge except you're gonna be a lap ahead do this three times and you'll completed the course in about 30 seconds choco mountain is the first course to have you jump over walls by driving straight at a wall and jumping on the exact right frame you can jump over it unfortunately sometimes this jump is impossible to make when you drive at a wall the area where pressing the jump button to work is sometimes smaller than the frame in other words if you get unlucky your cart travels a longer distance in a single frame than the window you would need to jump if this happens your player tumbles like this and you're forced to try again the first place where you can do it is against here if you miss it you can go back and jump off of this wall curiously dawn man opted to not go for these tricks at all in his run perhaps felt him to be a little bit too risky mario raceway has escape that you can do right here by getting a speed item like a mushroom or a star by activating it and jumping at the right time you can completely clear it and save a large amount of time domain didn't go for this trick in this run either possibly because of the time it would take if you missed it heading into the start cup wario stadium could potentially be the fastest track in the entire game if done correctly you can simply keep doing this over and over unfortunately the zero frame jump sometimes applies here resulting in a time that could be much slower after a few more courses without any real major skips we go into the special cup the first track here is dk jungle parkway by driving into this wall at a perfect angle you clip straight through into the cave and go past the finish line which extends out to the left if you do this correctly three times in a row you can finish the track in well under a minute yoshi valley has a famous skip that requires a mushroom or star if you line up just right and jump over at just the right time you can hit the exact seam on the wall that you need when lakitu drops you back down you'll be a lap ahead ideally you want to get triple mushrooms for this to work so you can do it once on each lap unfortunately though the odds and getting triple mushrooms is no better than 25 so it's a pretty big risk to go for naturally since he was on a good pace he didn't go for this trick finally after the skipless banshee boardwalk comes rainbow road which features this famous skip and start to cut out much of the track do it three times once on each lap and you're saving a boatload of time in all this is an extremely broken category and dntn's 3211 runs seem to be pretty insane but little did they know this was just the beginning of the slippery slope that the world record for 150cc would go down dotman1337 was the next runner to sort of completely take over the skips category by executing the tricks that dntn did better and more quickly by getting zero framed a little less often by going for the skips on choco mountain and by going for the triple mushrooms in yoshi valley he pushed the time all the way down to 30 26 by december of the same year [music] but let's fast forward to a couple of days later here's dawman on a run of 150cc skips he's off to a good start has a good mushroom cup builds a good lead after fraps snow land after some miss skips and a bit of sloppy driving though he falls back behind nothing too crazy he has a pretty lackluster special cop and goes into rainbow road 20 seconds behind world records should be impossible but after getting to the end of lap one he does this and once he does it once he does it again [music] track done run done 2852 new world record by nearly a minute and a half let's take a look at what happened here after doing the standard skip at the start dominant needed to get a green shell which he got by launching it against the wall and driving into it at a perfect time you can get thrown from the track and assuming you have enough forward momentum go past the finish line and complete the lap lakitu will set you back behind the finish line and do the trick again with another green shell drive forward and run over about half a year later partially thanks to a new start skip on luigi raceway which lets you skip half a lap instantly dawn man once again lowered the record down to 28.36 while i didn't have all of the time trial records it seemed that domain was the premier 150cc skips player and nobody else could catch him so here we are a few months later in october of 2014. this is mario kart 64 runner flippy as you can see here his personal best was a minute and a half behind the world record he was definitely a good mario kart 64 runner but certainly wasn't considered to be a world record contender by many people on this particular run though it seemed like everything was aligning he got skip after skip and gained more and more time over his personal best he knew he had a truckload of time to skate in the last cup so once he got triple mushrooms on yoshi valley he knew he was going to have a chance yes  yes [music] oh my god i got the rng where's the spot after getting to a minute and ahead going into rainbow road he needed to get the green shell skips yes yes okay yes second okay skips a lap because you passed the finish line and then it pushed it back on the track where you were already and i have it i have the second green show i literally just need to execute for this and it's war reckon [applause] yes okay is this it is this good enough i think it's i think it's actually there i think it's there [music] there's tens yes this is it this is worldwide yes  yes [music] meet aveny317 his personal best was very similar to flippy's old personal best 2950 and just like flippy did he got on a ridiculous run and this happened [music] yes yes crutch is this it [music] oh my god oh my god [music] world record [music] there it is [music] all right happening off the world record i'm sure that'll be the last we hear of albany right wrong it's back but i end up with the 216.66 [music] [music] hit my green 2751 oh my god what did i just do [music] so yeah it turns out aveny was pretty good at mario kart 64. by june 2015 he took the record down to 27.31 there must have been new strategies that he did to help him take it down another full minute right oh he just did everything perfectly because his name's abney that's how it is he got unbelievably consistent with every trick in the game a few days after getting the 2731 he got on another run that was slowly fading by the time he got to rainbow road thanks mostly to a slightly sketchy wario stadium even getting a gold split on rainbow road wouldn't get him the world record so he decided to go for a trick at the start known as the spiral jump normally when you jump off at the start of rainbow road you land here to the left of here further up the track is a spiral if you do a series of really difficult inputs that includes braking turning at just the right time and jumping at just the right time you can actually jump all the way to the spiral and save 10 more seconds the issue was this trick was really hard and especially given the nerves you would have at the end of a run nobody would be expecting to get even close to getting it oh my god no way with the wall hit oh my god dude if this happens this would be so crazy even after getting it he needed a green shells and a perfect setup to get the green shell skips at the end it was going to be close [music] oh my god dude did i do this i think i got it the greatest comeback dude no way i cannot believe this what the huge gold split i just got a golden split by like 20 seconds just another day in the life of abny317 shortly after it was discovered that there was another way to do that jump on rainbow road if a heavyweight opponent gets in second place on bnc boardwalk so they start rainbow road right next to the runner and you drive into them with a boost and jump off of them this could potentially happen get there get there yes let's go thanks to that glitch and some good playing throughout the rest of the run abney dropped the record down another four seconds 27-17 since the time was a low 27 by now abney figured that a good goal for himself would be to get some sort of 26 minute time with the following months he was on pace for it multiple times but lost runs due to not getting triple mushrooms that he needed on yoshi valley please [music] dang it dude any run finally though he had a beautiful run and actually got the triple mushrooms on yoshi valley bowser the heaviest character in the game came in second place so he was all set up to do the cpu jump on rainbow road here's how it went [music] this run was a crushing blow it seemed like the wrenches couldn't quite get strung together something would always go wrong whether it be rng or runner error but in early may 2016 something major was discovered that would forever change the category the red shell skip on luigi raceway the first track in the run he either went backward or forward to get an eighth place item and got triple red shells you could use one on each lap to launch you on the top of the grass here and when laka two puts you back down you'll be a lap ahead one thing to note though this trick only works on the japanese version of the game so all future runs that happening did of this category had to be on the japanese cartridge doing this correctly seems more than 20 seconds over the old route so each run that avenue did with the strategy saved at least 20 seconds right out of the gate if this wasn't enough around the time that this was discovered people found out that if you got triple red shelves on mario raceway you could do this unsurprisingly abny was able to get a couple of quick pbs with the help of these tricks and later that same month even though parts of the run were sloppy he was able to get the 26. still though the triple mushrooms that were needed on yoshi valley for a good run were really brutal abney needed to find a way around it and luckily for him he found one if you take the correct path around yoshi valley jump right here and hit the right seam on the wall for whatever reason the game gets confused and skips a lap so ideally you would do this jump off of the start with the boost to skip the first lap which is hard to do but then again this is abney we're talking about then drive around to do the lap skip here get placed down and finish off the lap it would only be a bit more than 5 seconds slower than triple mushrooms and required no rng whatsoever armed with this new yoshi valley strategy abney set out to continue lowering the record he set a goal in mind he was going to get a 25 minute run he slowly lowered it but it was soon obvious that a 25 is going to require a nearly flawless run both rng wise and execution wise eventually though he was on 25 pace going into rainbow road he got the cpu jump and got the green shells all he needed to do now was execute the trick twice [music] god damn man even though he didn't get it on this run it wasn't longer than a couple of weeks before he had another shot of it [music] let's go dude insane wrong completely insane i missed the yoshi valley yolo jump okay [music] oh my god it's like other than that one thing this is like it's like a perfect run and as of today 2549 is where the world record stands mario kart 64 has been speed run pretty much ever since it came out even though it doesn't receive all the attention that games like super mario 64 or ocarina of time do its dedicated community has been one of the most diligent and patient group of players ever seen players like abney continue to test what their limits are and figure out how well they could push the time down to and odds are we're not done yet abny is still streaming skipped attempts on his twitch page and there's several other runners that go for the record in the future but right now 2549 is ridiculously optimized and does such a crazy category great justice thanks for watching everyone see you next time [music] you
