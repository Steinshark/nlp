we are going to be sharing or talking about five alternatives to chat gpt because as you know chatgpt has been everywhere in the media and online and honestly i think it's a great tool for various cases but there are many tools out there for coding productivity and different use cases that are so much better than chat gpt today's video we're going to focus on tools around coding and productivity most of them that can be used for either so we're not going to cover very common tools such as tab 9 or copilot ones that we're all familiar with i'm going to try and find some ones or some tools that are very different or that you might have not heard about that you can implement in your daily life whether you're coding being more productive wanting this tool should do varying things for you that you can use all right let's jump into it also hit that subscribe button if you haven't already let's go i don't know where we're going i'm sitting down here oh okay have you heard of autonomous ai i recently came across this and am blown away by this technology it no longer needs you to put in a prompt the the ai can learn from past prompts and tasks and continue iterating this is wild let me talk more about it before we get into exactly what agent gpt is i wanted to take a step back though because agent gpt is one of the first of its kind we've been hearing a lot or maybe you are just starting to hear about it now about autonomous ai which is essentially being able to train your own ai chatbot with its data so it will continue to learn from its own data getting smarter and smarter it's really wild like it kind of puts chat gpt to shame in my opinion as to what it can do okay i have some notes on it here because this is something i'm still learning about so auto gpt is a tool that lets you achieve your goals by allowing llms to think plan and execute actions autonomously so what this means is unlike chat gbt where you need to input your question or your prompt you do not need to do that with autonomous ai it will continue to think and take decisions rationally on its own it's really the next step in ai and up until agent gpt if you wanted to play around with autonomous ai you needed to code to do so which there are tons of different tutorials out there and it's a really great exercise maybe we should make a video doing that actually leave in the comments if you're interested in that but you needed to do it locally on your machine and have some knowledge of code now with agent gpt if you are a coder or you are a non-technical person you can play around and have access to autonomous ai so let's pull it up on screen here okay as you can see on screen here i have agent gpt pulled up and let's start by giving this a name can you see the door move behind me mr mugs hi mr mugs hi mommy it's like a ghost anyways agent gbt let's give this a name let's call this code gpt because we want it to help us with code this could be productivity gpt whatever you wanted to name it and the goal is let's say let's make the goal to build websites fast i don't know if that's the greatest goal for this let's try it deploy agent so it's in thinking it's thinking meaning it's going through its data looking and adding some tasks here develop a website builder implement an automatic okay it's let's just let it live its life for a second here all right develop a website builder implement an automatic content generation feature utilize the code generation tools integrate responsive design framework like these are the steps that it is going to start doing which is incredible integrated content management system i mean it's brilliant it's taking the steps to how would i build a website fast and well we're sorry for this demo we cannot have our agents running for too long so of course you need to sign in but this is incredible so you're essentially giving it a goal and letting it take on these tasks to complete them so if we were to sign in and go through this process even further it would start executing as you can see here and continue through this entire process so this has been used i've seen cases of it being used for people who wanted to manage their entire social media channels people who wanted to build them websites or apps manage their calendar it will literally take on the tasks for you it's really incredible and kind of terrifying at the same time once again this is agent gpt but you can also make your own autonomous ai through the code a lot of times there is examples with python which is really interesting but this is a great way to have a platform to tinker around with next on the list is more for you app developers out there or anyone who is really interested even from a business perspective of coming up with really interesting ideas for technology so maybe you want to build the app maybe you just want to understand or have some ideas around apps or technologies to build you need to check out aura.sh okay i have up on screen here or sh and this is really cool it allows you to build essentially ai apps in seconds and let's keep in mind this is some marketing material in seconds but it does happen very quickly that you can use existing prompts and build a smart contract or build a web application whatever you are looking for you can get get that code in seconds and they say on the website they use gpt4 i have heard mixed reviews that it's a gpt3 that they structured to appear as gpt4 in their responses but regardless it's still a very interesting tool to play around with meet cody is a newer one that i've found and i've been really tinkering around with it let me show you more okay so i found meet cody a while ago and i've just been using it for tinkering i haven't actually used it for business purposes which is its whole it's whole spieler it's whole main thing but i just wanted to see if it could help manage some aspects of my business and it's very interesting here on screen so what it allows you to do is instant answer to your business questions it understands your business over time as you are continuing to feed a data about it you can upload any documents whether it be google notion etc and to continue to build upon its knowledge about your business and then also too what i like is it's essentially they refer to it as an assistant like chat gpt with the benefit of being able to train on your business your team processes and clients so also too the fact that it can train with your processes and clients is another big one for me this is a tool i think that so i'll put up on screen here some prompts that it's really good at i love this one where it's explain what we do like i'm five which honestly sometimes especially if you're working for a technical company having a clear way to explain what your company does even if you've built the company is sometimes really difficult and this is just a really fun way to do it but once again it can be human resources marketing i.t procedures and it really understands your company so this is an ai that you can utilize to what is the word it's so much more custom than say chat gpt or any of these other ai systems out there i really like it so far and it definitely will help boost your productivity by being able to understand your business the way the script is written for this video script i don't really do scripts but i mean script meaning like bullet points of information is always on this tool that i'm about to talk about it's pretty much been it's not a free tool but it's pretty affordable and it's something that in my opinion is the number one ai tool that i use today that is worth actually paying for i feel like i've re-emphasized this so many times but i use jasper on the daily like way more than chat gpt even actually and i use it mainly for helping me with script writing with blog posts when i'm writing blog like technical blog posts for work when i'm writing scripts for youtube it and what i do is i give it my current script so it's not as though i get ideas from it but i will feed it my ideas my scripts and then in turn what it will do is it will reword it for me in the tone i would like so you can choose tone of voice keywords you want to add different things like that i also use it a lot when i'm writing emails i hate writing emails i am terrible at it and it's a great way to for that what i'll do is i'll write like a super terrible like mind dump of an email like this is kind of what i want to say and get it to reword it for me like a tech professional like a software developer however i want it to sound based on who i'm speaking to and i'll kind of always alter what it gives me but it just gives me a good guided path for next steps so jasper is it's not free i don't know if they have a free version i don't think so but honestly it's something that after exploring it for months now i think it's totally worth it for my personal use being able to utilize its templates from ads blogs business e-commerce seo social media i just have so many different areas that you can really dive into so jasper probably i don't want to pick a favorite i feel like a mom who has a big favor but if i did it's probably my favorite tool that i'm using right now with ai this tool is so hard to talk about because it has such a weird name it's called literally anything no like that's the name literally anything this as i mentioned is an app that i've recently stumbled across and it's pretty pretty crazy i mean it's just it is what the name says which is literally anything and right now it's for desktop only but for example you can input let's pull it up here you can input for example let's use one of these examples personalized budget tracker with spending analysis so you build and it does take depending on how many people are using it at the time it can take a few minutes to to fully build not even a few minutes but it feels like that in today's world when it's a few seconds and it will literally build out your entire application so you can use this to create ui to create apps to create photo carousels to create a trip planner whatever you want this is similar to chat gpt but i do find the ui and the experience on literally anything to be much more to be much more better to be honest like i just really enjoy using the platform more i'm someone who uses desktop a lot i i don't really do work on my phone from a browser for example so i just find that the fact that they only have it on desktop doesn't really affect me but it definitely is something that you can use for both the code aspect whether you want to help it build out your ui so say you're more you're not necessarily a great ui designer but you want to build out a front-end application i would use something like literally anything it sounds so weird literally anything.io to help you build the ui and then take that and then build with it so it's pretty cool it's ai nowadays it feels like almost it's kind of like your assistant or your friend that for the areas that you don't want to do or you're not good at and you don't want to become better at you can get ai to do it for you so i don't necessarily think it's a bad thing to get ai to help you with all this when you think nowadays when the first digital camera came out or let's stick with that example it's not like at the time people were like or maybe they were like oh this is going to completely take out photographers all their jobs are going to be gone we have been continuing to evolve with technology and the roles that technology is helping us with we continue to evolve as well with so it's not something that's going to take over all of our jobs or if it gets to a point where it does take over all of our jobs it's not just in tech it's at that point it will be all of our jobs taken over but i really don't think that will happen in turn what i believe is we will have more room in space like we always have to continue to build interesting things and continue to build new ideas creativity it's gonna allow for more time for us to focus on the bigger picture things so it's doing some really interesting things and these are just five tools that i'm obsessed with from a coding productivity standpoint but they can be used really for so many different use cases i just wanted to hone in on those two that i'm really passionate about alright i hope you enjoyed this video leave down in the comments if you have tried any of these tools if i miss one that you're like
