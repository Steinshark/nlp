my mind was so blown by the 12th gen alder lake reference validation platform motherboard that i had to do an entire video about not just it but the amazing test benches that intel uses in their validation labs why is this so mind-blowing to me well not because it has the most features or overclocks better than a retail board or even fits in a normal computer case but because the tools that intel creates for cpu development including these boards are absolutely freaking incredible incredible like this segway to our sponsor i fix it whether it's your first time repairing a device or you've been doing it for years ifixit wants to make it easier for you to keep your devices functioning stay tuned to the end of the video to learn more about ifixit's toolkits [music] every new cpu that intel builds needs an accompanying development platform motherboard and i'm sure they'd be happy to have asus or gigabyte do it for them but the cold hard truth is that no one but intel could possibly hope to build a motherboard for a cpu that hasn't even been manufactured yet oh and also most of the features and tools of these boards are both specific to the process of designing and debugging upcoming platforms so not of much value to general consumers and chock-full of proprietary ip that could enable intel's competitors to clone their development methods whenever these things leave the building it is under tightly controlled circumstances this is so cool out of the gate the reference validation platform or rvp has a lot in common with a normal motherboard you got your lga 1700 socket 8 pin cpu power connector 24 pin motherboard power your pci express slots but it's when you get into the details that you discover the difference between a motherboard that's designed for the general public and a motherboard that's designed for day-to-day use by engineers for example check this out the m.2 ssd slot up here this is the one that runs off of the cpu directly pci express gen 4x4 instead of having a little screw or a little plastic retention mechanism this is so cool you could mount an ssd to this thing in probably less than two seconds you just throw the ssd in turn this little half of a thumb screw around and boom it's locked into place those are the kinds of quality of life improvements that a normal person doesn't need but an engineer who's installing and uninstalling constantly absolutely will let's go ahead and build up this board everything about this feels so naughty right now i know it's just a regular cpu socket but it's it's a forbidden one like any motherboard we've got to install our memory in this case we're installing some 4 800 mega transfer per second ddr5 because of course that's one of the key new features of the alder lake platform then moving over to the i o things get normal for a little bit audio usb display and then not normal on most desktop motherboards you wouldn't find one of these this is a female ribbon connector for edp and the reason that they have these on their test motherboards is because these super cool extruded aluminum test benches actually have little mounts for bare laptop displays that they can quickly and easily move around because they're so light and so convenient to use and just pop on here plug in and boom they're able to monitor everything the system's doing through this ribbon connector right up here at the top of the board and the board is chock full of similar quality of life improvements for the engineers so in addition to headers that you would normally see like fan headers or internal usb 3.1 or i don't know what do they call it now even even here nobody can remember the the new names for all the stupid usb standards anyway the point is in addition to those you've got stuff like this this is a perfectly common connector but normally you would find it on the back plane of something like a hot swappable server chassis right because what it allows you to do is take a two and a half inch ssd and just plunk it on like that here's a fun one do you guys use ps2 because it just always works pretty much why's it got ps2 why not why not why not indeed bring back ps2 that's what i say here's another one this is super common on server motherboards because it's pretty typical for a server to boot either from a usb drive or from the network so having a usb type a that you can just plug a little usb key into when you're off to the races is pretty nice but for most desktop users you'd have no purpose for that and even on any server board that i've ever seen i haven't seen two of them so that's clearly to save them the trouble of hooking up front i o here's a fun one another thing you wouldn't normally hook up on a test bench is your front activity leds so instead you've actually got activity leds for the sata ports built directly into the motherboard so that you can monitor the functionality another big difference between this and a retail board is that modern motherboards try to make as many of the parameters of the motherboard adjustable through software as they possibly can either because it's more work to develop that software or because sometimes it actually is just quicker to move a jumper or flip a dip switch an engineering board like this is absolutely littered with little jumpers and dip switches that are gonna allow all kinds of different functionality to be enabled or disabled or altered as the engineers are going through their testing oh this is another thing i really love the pcie 16x slot has no lock that is i just honestly i hate them so much i just wish every board had no luck as for the rest of these headers honestly the majority of them are either so proprietary or so specialized that most of the people in this room wouldn't even have any reason to know what they're for however there's one really cool thing that i absolutely have to show you guys i was really curious about this immediately i looked at that and i thought oh okay that's a really unusual cooling solution for the pch or for the motherboard chipset but i was wrong what this is actually for is so that as they are revising the hardware of the chipset they can remove it from the motherboard swap it out for the new revision put it onto the board flash a new bios and there's no reason to completely recycle or remanufacture this board that is an enormous time savings in development because while i'm sure the engineers would love to wait around for a partner to manufacture a holy motherboard for them ain't nobody got time for that here's one i didn't recognize but we found out what it does it actually here we go you can see it running on this system right here is connected to the cpu through kind of like a you could call it a back door but really what it's for is monitoring and diagnostics and it goes out to this proprietary box which goes into this usb hub right here that actually communicates to this guy so this you could think of as kind of like the brains of the test bench because something you might have noticed throughout our series of videos here is that most of the testing stations don't actually have an engineer sitting in front of them staring at the screen watching the test run that would be kind of silly in this day and age so almost every parameter can be adjusted other than physically unplugging and replugging something into the device remotely through this host system and they've got some other really cool quality of life devices as well there isn't one on this bench but we saw one on the gaming test bench down in the demo room that's basically a bios emulator so under normal circumstances if you want to flash the bios it's extremely slow that's very very slow memory that you need to overwrite in order to put a new bios on the motherboard so instead what you can do is you can get a bios emulation device that you can just quickly dump a new bios on to and you can have it become a new version of the bios in like three seconds now of course the reference validation platform is compatible with normal air coolers like this one but the engineers here have much much cooler toys this is called a thermal head and we kind of glossed over this one in one of our previous videos but in a nutshell it connects to a water supply that is run throughout the building so it can either be chilled or heated as well as an air supply that runs throughout the building and this puppy is capable in fact this just came off a running test bench so you can see if i flip it over it's got condensation on it because this thing is capable of reaching sub-zero temperatures which is what allows intel to validate their processors at the entire thermal operating range that they advertise and according to the engineers here a lot of the time they'll push it quite a bit beyond that just to see what happens now i can't give you too many details about how this puppy works in fact i can't even show you the rig on the bottom of it because it's for a processor that's not really released yet but you can see that in addition to water and air in which is handling heating cooling and then condensation management they've got this interface right here that plugs into their control module that can be configured either manually by the technician or remotely as part of one of these complete setups like we see running behind me another super power of this board is that intel obviously has many different motherboard chipsets that support the features of their accompanying processors to various degrees maybe overclocking or not or fewer pci express lanes or other connectivity so naturally i assumed that since they have a swappable chipset socket system that they would just swap on a b series chipset or whatever they need think again ladies and gentlemen the chips that they use here are actually called a super sku and they can be reconfigured to be whatever the engineer wants it to be of course as you guys can probably imagine not everything intel wants to test can be done on exactly the same motherboard welcome to the overclocking lab where they've actually got a different version of the rvp that instead of having eight phase power is equipped with 16 phase power and at least at the moment an ellen two pot for a subzero overclocking demo that they've got set up for me so you guys are running i'm assuming this is going to be a 12 900k is that right okay this is obviously the ddr5 version of the platform and i see xtu is up here so here's one of those test bench control hosts and then what is this connected to them to the motherboard where here in this usb okay so it's the same thing we saw before and then you guys are allowed to go in and just play around with cpu parameters live yeah sure check this out okay check this out dennis okay we're going to close it okay so we're going to reload it with a new configuration that we just changed through the host okay that is hilarious now for the rest of us i know one of the big things that you guys are proud of with alder lake is the new one touch speed optimizer is that right so we did an overclocking demo yesterday where basically they demonstrated that with one button you can get about five percent extra performance out of the platform but i think your intention was to push it a little bit further today is that right yes and one more thing as you as you mentioned we can do it all through the top access you don't need xto no need bios nothing wait so you're gonna wait you're gonna overclock it using your developer interface okay i love it i love it so wait so what so that just interfaces using usb doesn't it have anything else the one upstairs was connected to like this guy or something there are several connectors oh there is xdp there is typical engineer things why have one interface when you can have three okay okay do it basically he's got like a terminal open over there so this is like legit hacking the mainframe level overclocking hit me now tell me something as part of your overclocking validation do you guys go and like hand cherry pick silicon to see what the limits are you can see here we're about to see a golden sample ladies and gentlemen so this is so is this the percentile out of like 100 for quality or something like that so if i want a really nice e core overclocker i want this one right here it's a joke it's a joke because it's it's yeah it's yeah terrible i know now tell me something this one looks really nice is that the maximum peak or overclock we're watching the frequency okay we're at 5.2 just like that ladies and gentlemen is the power of the tap box which i've been informed stands for top access probe fun fact you might think the top is because it's like top tier but actually it's because the probe used to be on the top of the cpu now it's on the bottom but then the name is still the same and you're just going in and you're just changing values on the cpu right now we're changing the ratio you have internal access through the registers ridiculous whoa those e-core clocks though 4.8 on the e-course how high are you guys expecting to go here till i think 5.2 5.3 maybe more on the e-course yes five plus on e-course okay it's official i need like now you're dead oh that's okay honestly for our purposes that is an amazing demo of the kinds of tools that you guys have to go in and just make alterations to the cpu while it's working a lot of what we learned about the reference validation platform though was actually here in the demo room where i got a chance to chat with some of the folks who work on the gaming performance validation team so they explained to me in real world terms why functionality like this is so important so we're looking at hitman 3 running over here right now all of the tests that they do are automated so it'll run through 10 loops of the benchmark and then it'll pull all the performance parameters that you would normally expect your average fps your 99th percentile lows all that good stuff but that's not enough because they're going through so many revisions of firmware for example that they would end up running a benchmark suite like this literally over a thousand times over the course of product development and when you're testing that many variations of the bios the difference between waiting around two to five minutes for it to flash and being able to do it in three seconds is absolutely critical you might have noticed by the way that this test platform isn't using the intel integrated graphics and that's because this team is laser focused on treating the soc as a gaming cpu so instead they're using a high-end third-party graphics card in this case an rtx 3090 and they're actually running all of their benchmarks at 1080p because they are mostly concerned with situations where the cpu would end up being the bottleneck so if say a security fix rolls in they want to make sure that that's not going to cost you any fps today and even if you were to upgrade your graphics card you're still going to be able to get the most out of it and since we're here the demo room was full of all kinds of other cool stuff that's worth taking a look at this crazy monitor stand includes a next level thunderbolt dock that not only does everything a thunderbolt dock does but allows the notebook to run in a completely hands-off manner so it can even control powering it on and powering it off the new killer networking app allows you to connect via two wireless bands simultaneously and steer your high priority apps like games to the fast lane while you redirect background tasks to 2.4 gigahertz this animation here demonstrating alder lake's thread director is super cool basically what you're seeing is the cpu's ability no matter what types of tasks are being thrown at it to provide hints to the operating system about which processes should stick to which types of cores in order to help achieve the enormous generational performance gains that we're seeing over rocket lake and you can see those on display at the productivity table absolutely incredible stuff guys but the most unbelievable part of this whole trip was walking into a place like idc and seeing the engineers and techs clamoring to get a selfie with me i mean i'm flattered thank you but you all know that you're the real mvps right like it's like it's kind of like watching a weird comedy sketch where the professional sports ball game ends and then the players
