hello everyone and welcome in this video i have teamed up with progressive and we're going to be talking about five different driving techniques in order to drive efficiently how to achieve good fuel economy so there's really two main factors that are playing a role in what fuel economy you're achieving first of all what car are you driving and second of all how are you driving so we're going to be focusing on that second aspect how you as a driver can change your driving habits in order to achieve better fuel economy and we're not going to get into the super obvious ones like hey you shouldn't have a ton of stuff in the back of your car for no reason that's super heavy and giving you terrible fuel economy i think most people realize that or the dangerous ones like hey you should just follow a tractor trailer on the highway because you'll have great aerodynamics obviously that's a dangerous and silly idea and you shouldn't do that so we're going to focus on ones that are actually practical and can actually give you a real fuel economy benefit on different techniques that you can use while driving so the first two here are going to sound slightly counter-intuitive but we'll get through them and explain it so the first one being drive fast when you need to stop basically keeping your speed as high as possible and then the second one being drive slow when you need to go nice little rhyme there but basically meaning keep your average speed as low as possible so looking at this first one here we've got two different scenarios a bad scenario and a good scenario more efficient scenario right here so let's say you have a stop light coming up there's two different ways here we're approaching this so the first car it's driving along at 45 miles per hour it maintains that 45 miles per hour up until it starts to get pretty close to that stop light and then it drops down to zero miles per hour and sits there in that stop light and waits for it to turn green this is wasting energy because we took all of that energy that we had of the core that inertia of the core traveling forward and we brought it down to zero we put all that heat into the brakes when we could have actually used that to continue moving along so the other car is approaching this same stoplight and it sees that it's red so they let off the gas and they slow down to about 25 miles per hour and then they just sit here at 25 miles per hour until they get to the light the light turns green at the same time for both of these scores this one's already going 25 miles per hour so it doesn't have to accelerate from zero it's only accelerating from 25 so not only is it more efficient because it's not accelerating from zero up to 45 but it's also faster because once you get to that green light you're now moving forward where this one is all is only at zero miles per hour so when you're approaching a stop light you want your speed to be as high as possible for when it actually turns green now our second point is drive slow when you need to go meaning maintain a low average speed and i'm not saying you should just drive slowly everywhere obviously none of us have time for that but what i'm saying is there actually can be a major difference in fuel economy simply by slightly reducing your average speed so we're going to take an example here looking at a car on the highway traveling at 80 miles per hour versus 75 miles per hour so as you're driving along on the highway the amount of power that you need to produce has to equal you know the resistive forces that you have so you have aerodynamic drag going against your vehicle and you have rolling resistance in the tires now looking at aerodynamic drag the amount of power that you need to overcome it is equal to the force of that aerodynamic drag multiplied by the velocity of your vehicle and within the equation for the force of aerodynamic drag you have velocity squared so you multiply that by velocity again you then have velocity cubed for the power needed to overcome aerodynamic drag what does all this mean well it means that the amount of power you need to produce increases exponentially as your speed increases because the aerodynamic power required is a function of velocity cubed and so this is just a simple illustration here if we were to plug in you know some numbers here for the same vehicle traveling at 80 miles per hour versus 75 miles per hour it would need 26.3 horsepower at 80 versus 21.7 horsepower at 75. so we're traveling five miles per hour faster just 6.7 percent faster but we need 21.4 percent more power in order to do it so what that means is your fuel economy is going to exponentially decrease as your speed increases and so you might be saying but jason i don't want to drive super slow then then i'm not going to be able to get anywhere and that's a fair point so but if you look at the time required to travel 100 miles whether you're traveling at 80 miles per hour or 75 miles per hour at 80 miles per hour it takes 75 minutes at 75 miles per hour takes 80 minutes so you save five minutes but you use significantly more fuel if you do a two day road trip and let's say you drive 1200 miles you drive for 16 hours rather than driving for 15 hours so as you start to get these longer distances yes you know an hour is a significant amount of time but you know you're splitting that over two days perhaps it's worth it to you if you do want to save that fuel economy so you can save in fuel economy quite significantly by reducing velocity because of how much power is required to overcome aerodynamic drag now in the case of rolling resistance it's actually very minor 80 miles per hour taking just 1.3 horsepower 75 miles per hour taking 1.22 horsepower so not a huge difference in rolling resistance the amount of power required to overcome it really it comes down to aerodynamic drag and having that velocity cubed as part of the function the third technique is engine braking so in modern cars if you let off the throttle and you leave the transmission in gear the engine actually injects no fuel at all so you're not using any fuel so you can use this knowledge to your advantage in different scenarios so for example here if we are approaching a stoplight and we know that we're going to have to stop there's too much time that's going to pass we can't use that first technique we were talking about we know we're going to have to come to a stop so if you have this first scenario you're driving along at 45 miles per hour you're coming up to that stop light you maintain that 45 miles per hour until you get fairly close and then you decelerate down from 45 down to zero so that whole time that you're driving at 45 miles per hour you're using fuel then for this short duration you won't be as you're decelerating but engine breaking and then once you sit there idling and you're going to sit there for a long time because you got there very quickly you're going to be continuing to use fuel as you sit there idling assuming the engine doesn't have start stop so then in our other scenario our car is driving at 45 miles per hour we know we're gonna have to stop at that light so we just let off the gas immediately and so we just coast down to five miles per hour we're not using any fuel in doing so and then we start you know you get on the brakes and you bring it to a complete stop at the light and you're not idling for as long of a time because you didn't drive as quickly up to the stop light and during that entire time you weren't using any fuel so you're only using fuel once you come to the complete stop there and you start idling which is less time than you're going to spend idling in this scenario so overall a way better technique to approach a stop light is to just let off the gas immediately as you start going towards it don't maintain your speed to a red light another scenario if you have a long descent coming up so if you're going to be driving downhill for quite some time well if you just simply leave it in gear not only is this safe because it's putting the heat from decelerating into your engine's cooling system which is far more capable it can take a ton of heat versus putting it into the brakes so you won't overheat your brakes that's why engine braking is recommended going downhill but you also won't be using any fuel if you have it in gear and you're using engine braking to decelerate or maintain your speed as you go down a hill now speaking of hills our fourth tip is how to efficiently drive over small elevation changes and the rule is very simple slow up fast down so in our first scenario not doing the ideal thing so we're driving along at 45 miles per hour we come up to a hill we maintain that 45 miles per hour up the entire hill and doing so of course requires a lot of fuel because you have to fight against gravity to go up the hill you're at that 45 miles per hour then you come back down and you're using your brakes to maintain yourself your speed at 45 miles per hour so you're wasting the energy you could be getting you know free acceleration basically here from gravity yes you had to work to get up there but then you can use that gravity to overcome some of the fuel that you've lost to bring you back up to speed but instead you're using your brakes because you're already at the speed limit so in this scenario you're doing everything wrong as far as an efficiency an efficient way of getting over this hill the alternative if you're driving along at 45 miles per hour you see a hill coming up you let off the throttle perhaps you still maintain a light throttle or you just simply engine brake and you use inertia to get you up to the top of that hill now you slow down you're only going 25 miles per hour now well below the speed limit but now you have this long hill to bring you back up to the speed limit so you come back down and gravity helps accelerate you back up to the speed that you were at by the bottom of course it's not a perfect exchange maybe you're at 40 miles per hour or something like that and you use some light acceleration to get back up to the speed limit so in this scenario you know you're not you're either engine braking you're using less fuel as you go up the hill and then you're allowing gravity to accelerate you rather than just wasting that energy and putting it into your brakes as you come down the hill so significantly more efficient way of going over an elevation change now our final point is to shift gears early and generally you want to use light acceleration while doing so so how do we know this well if we look at an engine efficiency curve most internal combustion engines tend to operate at their highest efficiency at a low rpm and a relatively high load load meaning how much throttle are you applying so the two rules we get here as engine rpm increases well then our engine efficiency is going to decrease so we want to shift so we remain in this efficient region but we're also learning that our engine efficiency is correlated with load and the more load we have generally speaking the more efficient it is so does that mean that you should be flooring it at every stop light since we know that the highest efficiency occurs at a high load and a low rpm and then just short shift well it doesn't quite work out that way you don't get to drive faster and get better fuel economy so here is why so if you look at two different scenarios here we're starting at a stoplight and then we're accelerating up to 45 miles per hour and then we're coming back to another stoplight so as we accelerate here in this first scenario the bad scenario going from zero miles per hour to 45 miles per hour very quickly so we're using high throttle and we're shifting early and we're keeping that engine in that very efficient region we get up to 45 miles per hour we stay there and then we start to slow down for that stop light and let's say in this scenario our average speed is 35 miles per hour in our other scenario we're operating we're at a lower efficiency region we're operating at a low load but a you know low rpm so somewhat efficient but not as efficient as the acceleration in this first scenario but we're doing so more slowly so our average speed as we get up to 45 miles per hour and then slow down to that stop light our average speed is just 25 miles per hour so if we go back to our first scenarios we were discussing you want to maintain the lowest average speed possible generally speaking that's going to be the most efficient because you have the least amount of resistive forces as your average speed is decreased so generally speaking and yes there are different circumstances where it could go the other way but generally speaking you're going to be better off and get better fuel economy if you have that lower average speed so you accelerate more slowly up to speed and overall maintain a lower average speed and better fuel economy now just one additional thing that i think you should keep in mind is that if you're applying different driving techniques in order to maximize your fuel economy you should at least be cautious of the drivers around you so don't annoy the drivers around you don't sit in the left lane at a slow speed don't slow down way too early for a stoplight head if there's a lot of traffic behind you so use common sense out there driving and apply these techniques where they make sense and where you can actually gain the benefits from them without annoying other drivers so thank you all so much for watching thank you to progressive for partnering on the video and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to
