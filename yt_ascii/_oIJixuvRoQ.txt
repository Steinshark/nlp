hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by nrs brakes we are going to be covering the fascinating world of aftermarket brake pads i have brake pads in front of me from five different reputable companies and yet some of them make questionable decisions that you could never actually see as a consumer so we are going to peel back the curtain or in this case quite literally the friction material to show that not all aftermarket companies are playing by the same rules as the oes and what should be done about it there are four fundamental elements of brake pad design that play a critical role in brake functionality and safety rust protection for the backing plate how you attach the friction material to the backing plate the flatness of the backing plate and tolerances of the apartment areas ensuring the pad slide smoothly within the caliper in this video we're focusing on just one aspect the attachment of the friction material to the backing plate so i have five different brake pads in front of me one is original equipment one is from nrs brakes and then i have three additional aftermarket brake pads now a mechanical attachment uses metal hooks to connect the friction material to the backing plate and you can very clearly see with the cutout on the original equipment brake pad these little small metallic reflections revealing that it uses a mechanical attachment and yet you can buy brake pads for this exact same vehicle without ever knowing that they don't feature this technology that the original equipment pads specify okay so there's a lot more detail we need to cover about each of these specific brake pads but first we need to back up and understand how we got here early on back in the day all friction pads were mechanically attached to the backing plate so here you can see the old school style you've got your backing plate and then you have these rivets which are attaching the material to that plate now there are advantages to this design but it also means you're littering your brake pad with all these holes you don't really want to be removing useful material and it also means you have uneven heat and pressure distribution wherever you have these holes in the material well eventually adhesives completely change this design the industry developed adhesives that could bond the friction material to the backing plate glue essentially in addition you could also use im holes so as the pad material is pressed onto the backing plate some of it is squeezed into these imholes which helps with the attachment to the backing plate and also allows for degassing though they're not necessarily required on modern brake pads now you may still see some gaps in the material like this slot these function as stress relief especially as you have changing temperatures and can also be useful for degassing or providing a channel for any wear debris to exit keeping the pads quieter but the main point is the industry shifted away from mechanical attachments and switched over to adhesives hey it was cheaper and it worked or did it well in many applications this remains true oems will use pads with adhesives for the friction attachment but not all of them in the world of heavy duty truck works towing sometimes even track oriented sports cars manufacturers continue to specify mechanical attachments for certain applications so that's exactly what we have here with these five examples all five of these different brake pads are for one of the most popular heavy duty pickup trucks sold in america if you own this truck you could very easily go online or walk into a parts store and purchase one of these sets for your truck the oe pads as i've already mentioned you can very clearly see they use a mechanical attachment and here we have the nrs pads they obviously believe mechanical attachment is the superior technology hence they use it on all of their pads regardless of what the oe specifies and this one is interesting this is an aftermarket brake pad brand that is owned by a major car manufacturer so it was satisfying to me to see that they used a mechanical attachment but these two surprised me and i promise you if you are at all familiar with the brake industry you know the names of all the undisclosed brands here these are all major players not some random small scale made who knows where brake pads i'm intentionally not calling them out by name because this video is sponsored i don't want to in any way insinuate that nrs brakes is endorsing one of these aftermarket companies while saying two of them have no idea what they're doing that's not the point the point is not everyone is playing by the same rules and as a consumer it's nearly impossible to know what you're getting so this is a major tier one supplier in the automotive parts world and as you can see despite the oe specifying it they don't use mechanical attachment we have one more example and again this one was a surprise to me huge name in the break world tier one supplier these pads are made in america and yeah as you can see no mechanical attachment to the backing plate so yeah i can only imagine how sketchy things get once you go to the super budget brake pads out there that is not who these are and again this is just one of many important aspects of brake pads that we're talking about okay so why is mechanical attachment better well as you might suspect this discussion is about heat which is something that in general adhesives do not like so nrs brakes performed a really interesting test the idea is simple the brake pads are heated to 550 degrees fahrenheit to simulate extended use in a heavy duty application much like it would in the real world this heat breaks down the adhesives in the brake pad then you simply perform a shear test where a machine presses against the side of the friction material and you measure what force is required to shear the material off this allows you to measure degradation that results from a certain amount of time at high temperatures so there's two important pieces of data here what's the force and how does it fail nrs took 10 different brake pad options and put them to the test on the left you can see what these backing plates look like some options have imholes some do not some options have mechanical attachment some do not and every backing plate is tested with and without an adhesive use to attach the friction material to the backing plate and if you're wondering wait a minute how would you attach a friction material to a backing plate without any adhesive the friction material itself has adhesives within it to bind all the materials together and so this adhesive alone can hold it to the backing plate though as you'll see not that well on the right you can see the pads with the friction material attached so how did they all do well looking at our graph the x-axis is time in days that our brake pads are cooked at 550 degrees fahrenheit the y-axis is the amount of pressure required in psi in order to shear off the friction material from the backing plate now the results can be mildly overwhelming to look at so let's focus on a few specific examples to understand what this all means first the black line with squares this is a test of just a block of friction material no backing plate it's showing us that as a friction material is cut it it loses its strength and is easier to shear apart okay this is a critical piece of information so i want to make sure it's understood if you're going to have failure of the brake pad occur you shouldn't have any variables in the system that are weaker than the friction material itself so think about this there are numerous parts in this system but all of them exist to facilitate the brake pad material being pressed up against the brake rotor so in the ideal world you want the attachment between the backing plate and the friction material to be stronger than the friction material's internal strength so that you never have to worry about this as a failure mode simple language if your pad material fails well that sucks if your attachment method fails well that really sucks because now all of your material has disappeared despite holding up just fine alright so going back to our graph remember the black line is basically best case the friction material degrades with heat you just want to make sure that you don't introduce a variable that does worse than this and as you can see with the dark blue line one of the mechanical attachment options tested basically follows that exact curve in fact all of the mechanical attachment options performed really well you can see after four to eight days in the oven they're all shearing off at nearly the same pressure as our baseline material but this isn't true for the non-mechanical attachment options which used adhesives so we can see that im holes and glue are both helpful versus nothing at all but none of the options using adhesive rather than mechanical attachment are following the same sheer results as the baseline material so the sheer results tell a very clear story but there's another part and that's how they fail pictures explain this better than words do here we're looking at the brake pads after the shear test after eight days at 550 degrees do you see the difference using just glue the failure point is the interface between the backing plate and the friction material that means the weakest this point is the adhesive interface not the friction material and yet notice with all of the mechanical attachment methods you still have leftover material remaining the failure point was the friction material not the mechanical attachment interface this remains true as you roll back the clock at four days it's the same story glue fails before the friction material whereas the mechanical attachment holds strong and at just two days in the oven basically the same story even at one day results are similar going back to brand new pads you can see that the adhesive does hold a small amount of the friction material in place during the shear test but again nothing like a mechanical attachment and that's only well new now something that's important to mention is that this test was performed using good quality control measures this isn't some sketchy factory churning out parts in a dirty environment the reason i bring this up is that quality control can have a huge impact on the results for adhesive based solutions you have to tightly control the environment to make sure you have no oils soaps dust or anything else get on this surface in the process not to mention having too much or too little adhesive now i have no doubt oe suppliers have good quality control practices in place but i bet that's not the case for every single brake pad you can order online and for mechanical attachment obviously you should still care about quality control but it doesn't have as big of an impact on the end result so for example say i have a piece of wood with a nail in it and oh it gets contaminated with oil if i then attach another piece of wood to it despite the contamination the nail can still hold the two pieces of wood together okay but now let's say i'm using wood glue instead but oh our wood surface was contaminated with oil before i applied the glue well that oil is going to prevent the glue from creating a strong bond with the surface so the two pieces of wood won't end up sticking together well the same idea applies to brake pads contaminations have to be taken very seriously because they can ruin the effectiveness of the adhesive yet with mechanical attachment with our graph we saw that whether glue is present or not the results are quite similar now there is another conversation which is very important but will only briefly touch on and that is rust with standard pads you can have something called rust jacking where the rust starts to creep in behind the friction material eventually splitting the friction material free from the brake pad as you drive that split off friction material shakes around breaking apart into smaller pieces which can then leave a void meaning next time you press the brake pedal there's a gap this as you can imagine is incredibly unsafe and has caused terrible car crashes nrs does two things to combat this first off the entire backing plate is galvanized to protect it from rust and second these mechanical attachments ensure you can't just jack the friction material away from the backing plate with traditional pads using an adhesive for attachment you need to have a bare metal surface in order for the glue to have a good bond you can't paint it like the back of the brake pad as some do because that paint would then be the weak link in the chain between the glue and the backing plate but using bare metal means you're leaving the most important interface layer of the brake pad susceptible to rust this alone is a huge advantage for pads using mechanical attachment okay so what's the solution for consumers well this is a really interesting question there are roughly 300 million vehicles in operation in north america and about 60 million of these vehicles around 20 percent have mechanically attached backing plates specified by the original equipment manufacturer so the number of vehicles on the road this impacts is actually quite large but as a consumer it's difficult to even know what your car requires what's interesting though is that it doesn't have to be this way aftermarket companies know what the oe specification is so there's something called the friction material standards institute which basically provides all the specs with standardized parts numbering to parts manufacturers in this book you can look up the part number for specific vehicles and if there's a z at the end of the part number it denotes that the oem specifies a mechanical attachment for the friction material now as a consumer you don't have this information so what's the fix well some of the aftermarket companies including nrs have started applying z-label stickers on the box so that you're aware of the brake pads inside use a mechanical attachment as the oe specifies and this seems like a smart easy fix for the aftermarket just put the claim right on the outside of the box so the consumer knows it's that simple closing out if you haven't yet seen it i'd also highly recommend checking out the previous video i did with nrs where we did a huge comparison test taking five different brake pads all at different price points from super cheap to original equipment to see how they stacked up in different torture tests it wouldn't be an internet video without me saying that the results may and most likely will surprise you if you're interested in getting brakes for your car you can check out nrsbrakes.com huge thanks to them for sponsoring the video and thank you all for watching if you have any
