hello everybody this is my first video since i got back from europe and i had covid and i've been in self-isolation i thought i would be making videos during my isolation but it turns out my brain was so much in so much fog that it was just impossible to make videos and so i'm happy to be making videos again hopefully my strength will hold up and i won't get too tired so i wanted for the past month or so or i guess a few months i've been making more videos on scripture i've been doing some interpretation of christ's parables of the the sermon on the mount and just trying to help people see the pattern the symbolic pattern in scripture but what i wanted with to do with you today is to look at a short text in saint from the syrians hymns on paradise i've told you guys many times about many times about this book if you haven't read it and you're watching my videos you really need to read synephrine's hymns on paradise i'm going to read three stanzas from the hymns and we're going to revisit some of the videos that i did and look at another story of christ and hopefully it'll help you see how it is that i draw all of this together and why it is that i see the patterns that i see it's a lot of it is using san ephraim as a guide to interpret scripture of course he's not doing it arbitrarily he himself as the guide is pulling together all these threads in scripture into very short and condensed stanzas and so it's sometimes difficult because it can take some time to unpack them but hopefully you'll follow me along and it'll give you a few secret keys to the interpretation of scripture [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [music] and so the the stanzas that i'm reading i'm gonna read three are from page 78 of the the the saint vladimir seminary edition of the hymns on paradise translated by sebastian brock with a great introduction so sinephrus starts he says with the eyes of my mind i gazed upon paradise the summit of every mountain is lower than its summit the crest of the flood reached only its foothills then it kissed with reverence beyond turning back to rise above and subdue the peak of every hill and mountain the foothills of paradise it kisses while every summit it buffets not that the ascent to paradise is arduous because of its height for those who inherit it experience no toil there with its beauty it joyfully urges on those who ascend amidst glorious rays it lies resplendent all fragrant with its sense magnificent clouds fashion the abodes of those who are worthy of it from their abodes the children of light descend they rejoiced in the midst of the world where they have been persecuted they dance on the sea's surface and do not sink for simon although a rock did not sink bless it is he who has seen together with them his beloved ones below in their bands of disciples and on high in their bridal chambers so those are the three stanzas that i wanted to read to you now i could have kept reading i could have read a little bit before a little bit after and i would have found as many nuggets of amazing of amazing interpretation in terms of paradise now of course the first important part is to notice the cosmic aspect of the paradise that is he starts and he says with the eye of my mind this is very important because he is already placing the relationship of paradise in relationship to the person with mind or with noose or with you know the highest aspect of human faculty and so there's already a hierarchy being set up in the structure of the text by even saying that he gazes upon paradise not with his physical eyes but with the eyes of his mind because there's something about paradise which is impossible in terms of quantitative understanding and so he places the summit of the mountain of paradise higher than all the summits of every other mountain and then so he starts up high says the the the summit of every mountain is lower than the summit of paradise and then he says the crest of the flood reached only its foothills the foothills of paradise kisses it with reverence before turning back to rise above and subdue the peak of every hill and mountain now remember of course the image of paradise the image of everything that i drew or maybe the image the second one i did with the arc of noah you'll notice that i really draw in from this interpretation that is the height of the mountain and then at the bottom of the mountain you have the waters but here it's very interesting because you notice that in reference to paradise the relationship between paradise and the waters is something like a romantic relationship where the waters kiss the feet of paradise but when the waters act on that which is below paradise it buffets the summits and so even the chaos of the lower waters in relationship to paradise have a relationship with his which is not threatening which is something like the the relationship between a man and a woman which is which is very important because you'll notice other allusions to that sexual relationship in the rest of the three stanzas now the second stanza con continues this this relationship of how that which is below and that which is above has doesn't necessarily have a relationship of austili but that that which is above the hierarchy in that which is below the hierarchy is really can be a relationship of joy and of discovery and so he says that the ascent to paradise is not arduous because of its height for those who inherit it they experience no toil there with its beauty it joyfully urges on those who ascend amid the glorious rays it lies resplendent all fragrant with its sense magnificent clouds fashioned the abode of those who are worthy of it and so this going up the mountain he shows how obviously you know that this is what happened as you go up a mountain you come closer to bathing in light let's say and so as you he goes up the mountain he says that those that inherit the mountain in paradise receive it as more light as you go up and then the houses which are at the summit of the mountain are fashioned by clouds that is they're more subtle they're not as material in the way that we understand it they're not as heavy they don't they're they are more subtle bodies you could say you know and so this is also related to the fact that saint ephreme says that he views paradise through the eye of the mind so just like thoughts are have more subtle bodies that is you can have intuitions and then thoughts and those thoughts are more subtle there's something like cloud let's say that form houses for these pure intuitions in the same way the houses which are at the summit of paradise paradise are fashioned by more subtle bodies but even all the way to the bottom of the mountain like i said the the the relationship is not one of of contradiction or one you know of hostility but even the waters at the bottom of the mountain which in the body would be something like the the be something like the the physical body you know the or the desires or whatever that is that's at more at the lower parts of the of the human psyche or the human body then those nonetheless have a relationship can have a relationship which is closer to the lover's relationship and so the third the third sansa is where most of the amazing meaning is so he says from their abodes the children of light descend they rejoice in the midst of the world where they have been persecuted and so for them even the world of hostility is because they are coming down from the summit of the mountain of paradise persecution to them is actually joy it is actually not hostility it is transformed into joy because they get their life their light from that which is above and they don't focus they're not attentive or they don't base their life their light and their joy on that which comes from below the thorns the the waves all of this stuff which can be dangerous to them it is joy they dance on the sea surface and do not sink for simon although a rock did not sink blessed is he who has seen together with them his beloved ones below in their hands in their bands of disciples and on high in their bridal chambers i'm gonna look at this idea of coming down the mountain and dancing on the sea a little just a little later what i want to look at it first is the basic structure of talking about blessed he is he who has seen together with that with them his beloved ones below in their bands of disciple and on high in their bridal chambers so here you have a relationship of quantity to quality and so you have the idea of this band of disciples the band the band of disciples which are below the mountain and the the the highest aspect let's say of a relationship which is something like the closeness this this bridegroom bride bridegroom relationship which is at the height of the mountain so if you think about some of the stories that i've told you in the past few years if you think about some of the images that you find in the gospels you'll notice for example when i talked about the the parable of the vine dressers in the parable of the vine dressers it talks about calling people to the wedding feast and calling people to the wed to the wedding feast which is in the king's castle and in the in my interpretation i kept saying it's at the top of a mountain and of course in the text it doesn't say that it's at the top of a mountain but as you start to notice the patterns of how scripture works saying something like it's at the top of the mountain can help you understand how it participates in this pattern so you can see how sin ephraim puts the bridal chamber at the top of the mountain because the bridal chamber is equivalent to moses encountering god in the secret place it's the equivalent of going into the holy of holies we know that all of these images of intimacy and going into the secret place are related to going up to the top of the mountain where the earth and heaven meet and this is the sexual relationship between heaven and earth and then down below is where you have quantity and so you have the band of disciples you have the body of christ now think of images stories for example like christ going up to the mount of olives where he goes up alone to the mount and then has an encounter where he's consoled by an angel but then leaves the disciple below and tells them to remember tells them to stay awake but they can't they fall asleep now remember now again the story of moses who goes up the mountain to meet and receive the law of god and leaves the people below the band of disciples the body of israel below and while they are below and and god and and not god moses has has went to encounter god they forget about moses and then they fall into distraction just like the disciples fought fell into distraction at the bottom of the mount of olives as christ was ascending but he's saying it's also possible to have both it's also possible in the in the best world to to to be able to have this loving encounter up in the highest place of the bridal chamber and the intimacy of the bridal chamber and also rejoice in the quantity of the band of disciples of this communion of many in which we are manifesting the body of christ i wanted to go back at the to the to the little part about coming down the mountain and dancing on the sea and so i mentioned this a few times in many videos about how i really love this image that said ephraim brings about but what we need to do in order to understand you know where is it that saint ephreme gets this idea he gets it from scripture he gets it exactly from scripture so let's look at the text in which christ walks on water and you'll notice something that maybe you hadn't noticed before so the text where christ walks on water is from we're using the the virgin the gospel of saint matthew chapter 14 starting at verse 22 immediately jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up the mountain by himself to pray now when evening came he was alone there but the boat was now in the middle of the sea tossed by the waves for the wind was contrary so notice now what has just been set up for you what has just been set up for you is the cosmic image so christ sends the multitudes away like he did in the virgin of the of of some of the parables that he tells where he he sends the multitude away and then he has only his disciples but then he also tells his disciples to get into a boat ahead of them then he goes up to the mountain alone to pray now while he is alone on the mountain the band of disciples are now in the boat on the flood so the the image that you have is that is the cosmic image it's of the garden of paradise with with with that which is above the meeting of heaven and earth where christ is praying to his father at the top of the mountain and the noah's ark down on the flood in the waters in a place where they feel as if they have been forgotten by god and the waves are tossing and turning and the chaos is dangerous because in a certain manner they the the the spiritual principle the the highest principle of their world has gone up in order to encounter god and they have forgotten him we could say something like that now in the fourth watch of the night jesus went to them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a ghost and they cried out of fear now remember the way that it was presented by saint ephraim he said up on the mountain the abodes are constructed by clouds and so you can you can understand that this is also what is being referred to that is as christ descends the mountain he is more subtle you could say because he has he has gone up to the place where heaven and earth meet so coming down the mountain he is encountered as more subtle they see him as a thought as a projection as a phantasm as something which doesn't fully have body but immediately jesus spoke to them saying be of good cheer it is i do not be afraid notice again what he's saying he's saying what saint ephraim is saying he's saying rejoice e on even on the flood even in the place where you are persecuted this is a place of joy because i am coming to you from the top of the mountain i'm bringing heaven down to you and so this place which looks like a place of chaos to you right now is actually a place of joy it is actually a place which is full and so you do not need to be afraid and peter answered him and said lord if it is you can ma command me to come to you on the water and so peter comes out and walks on the water this is of course why synephrine says that there's a there's a there's a whole play going on in this situation which is christ is making even the rocks walk on water he's bringing he even peter who is supposed to be that which sinks the bottom of the ocean if he looks upon christ then that which is meant to sink to the bottom can actually rise up and dance upon the sea just like christ has come down to walk on the waters and so he said come and when peter had come down out of the boat he walked on the water to go to jesus but when he saw that the wind was boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried out saying lord save me and immediately jesus stretched out his hand and caught him and said to him o you of little faith why do you doubt and when they got into the boat the wind ceased then those who were in the boat came and worshiped him saying truly you are the son of god. and so of course there are many things going on in this which are not necessarily related to what saint ephram said but maybe we can go over it a little bit that is it's interesting to notice for example that when peter comes out of the boat and he walks towards christ what he notices we often think that he notices the waves but it doesn't say that in the text he notices that the wind is boisterous and is that which made him afraid and and then that is what made it begin to sink and a good way to understand that in terms of analogy is to understand how it is usually our thoughts that make us afraid it is actually the more subtle things which make us afraid and is not necessarily the world itself that is our it's our thoughts about the world which make us doubt it's our thoughts about the world which make us not trust god which make us or our thoughts about ourselves which make us be prideful or hate others and so the danger is actually often in the middle space between heaven and earth you could say that is where sin takes its root in the more invisible aspect of yourself that is your thoughts your your ideas about how reality is and that's is actually what then makes them sink in the water it's not that the water isn't dangerous of course the water is dangerous but it's only dangerous to those who who get caught up in this whirlwind of thoughts and and of desires and all of this stuff and so and so saint peter sinks and then christ immediately switches out his hand catches him and says why did you doubt and so all of this then also becomes about doubt now the story of saint ephraim the story that saint ephrem tells and the story that we find here in scripture is fractal it is a fractal story which means that it applies cosmically to the relationship between god between heaven and earth manifestation in general but it also applies to at a smaller level to anything that you are ever involved with so the way that this works you can use any project that you're involved in and you can understand the same problem now think imagine you're working in a team in order to build a new a new product and so there's something which is above there's a leader who manifests who's supposed to hold together the reason why you're doing things he holds the leadership together he holds the the the attention of the team he directs the team and he also is a placeholder for the reason why you're doing things in the first place now if that leader goes away or has or is you know has to go somewhere else or meets with the boss for a very long time you can imagine the the team members now don't know where to look and they can be in danger of starting their all their different ideas of starting to conflict with each other and not just that but maybe be starting starting to focus more on their own rivalries their own little desires their own idiosyncrasies and forget the reason why they are doing all of this in the first place and this is when things start to break down this is when the chaos starts to happen and so in order for you in order for the team to be able to solve their problem they need to be able to recognize once again the reason why they're doing things and that reason is something like a ghost in the sense that the reason why you're doing things together is not in the things you're doing it's above it it holds it stands above them it has an invisible purpose and looking to that invisible purpose will rebind the world together will pull the rock from out of the water pull the earth the body from out of the water just like christ is also actually in this this this story christ is actually showing us an image of the actual creation of the world he's actually pulling the earth out of the waters like you see at the beginning of genesis and so this can be applied to a team but it can also be applied to yourself as a person with all your multiplicities of thoughts and fears and of desires when they forget the higher purposes of what you're doing they can start to fragment to break apart and then you can start to sink but looking up above up above that and remembering your purpose remembering the reason why you do things can bring you out of the waters now of course it's important to understand that this only holds together if it culminates into the transcendent if ultimately all of these fractal patterns are held together in a cosmic image of paradise the the very same image that sent it from the syrian tells about how the very cosmos lays itself out and how it's held together by this by this mountain of meaning which moves up to the place where we encounter god and so i wanted to give you a little hint at some of the ways in which i come to the interpretations that i come i don't not always explicit because as you notice it can take quite a while to explain it but hopefully this has been helpful to you we'll encourage you to read the hands of paradise and will also encourage you to start thinking in that matter and start understanding the manner in which scripture pulls together these patterns and so
