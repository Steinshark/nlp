so in the wake of the death of george florida and the ensuing protests and riots and with all the craziness that happened afterwards including the destruction of statues i wanted to take a little bit of time before i gave you some of my analyses on the situation i'm going to separate this in to a few videos i'm going to talk about the toppling of statues i will probably put out a patron video about watching defeat but for this first video i want to look at the narrative how it played out how it connects very much to symbolic patterns to our religious impulse to things like human sacrifice and catharsis all of these patterns that we find in human behavior and religion and in narrative and so hopefully we can navigate through that and do it in a way which will not be polarizing but will help us understand how things are playing out in terms of storytelling [music] this is jonathan pezzo welcome to the symbolic world [music] so in order to understand what is happening in terms of the protests we of course cannot separate it from the the corona virus pandemic and the narrative which surrounds this pandemic the way that it has separated society the way that especially in north america there has been some polarizing discussion much of the problem of the pandemic of its how serious it was how bold we can be facing it became politicized very fast and so it was difficult to navigate through the facts and through the scientific analyses without giving into narrative it was almost impossible i would say that i have not heard anybody who has succeeded because although science can tell you science can tell you the facts how many people are dying how many people are sick how many hospital beds there are the science cannot tell you what is acceptable cannot tell you how many people should die cannot tell you how cannot help you weigh between sign between the death of innocence and the economy the fact that food might become scarce all of these things are impossible to weigh and so it fell back on to the narrative and as we're watching the identity and the narrative of western culture break apart it inevitably would play out in that term in in terms of the decisions and the people complaining about the decisions so that's the first thing we have to understand so what ended up happening in the time of the corona virus is a type of fasting a type of fasting and a weird type of separation because of all the masks all the the confinement everybody became isolated in their houses stopped working stopped communing with others it really became almost like a monastic fast and strangely enough it happened during lent which adds to the strangeness of it all people ended up being forced to too fast from sports which is a big deal it's difficult to understand how important it is because sports is a place where we can non-violently put our identity where we can non-violently enact the patterns of aggression and violence related to identity by identifying with the team by seeing the other team as the bad guys and by putting all our emotions into the simulated conflict we're able to get rid of a lot of our of the dangerous aspects of being human let's say but this was taken away from a lot of people and everybody everything just got pent up and things started to to accumulate within the communities within people and the death of george floyd was like a mastiff which was put in and everything exploded now one of the thing that's important to understand at how religious the narrative ended up being is the first thing we need to see is the fact that people watched the death of george florida i have to be honest with you i did not watch it but i would say most people ended up watching it and what i'm told is it's very long it lasts you know almost nine minutes where the policeman is crushing this man's neck and he is crying out for his mother it is it's a horrible scene and so people watched someone being tortured now we have to understand the mechanisms of of catharsis to understand what exactly that can do to you one of the things that is meant to happen when you're looking at something like that narrative lee in terms of drama is that is why tragedies had had such an effect on human human culture the greek tragedy was exactly this thing you're supposed to watch the hero die the hero go down and in in this particular case you watch someone being killed you are watching them you are identifying with the purse dying but ultimately what is also what was also meant to happen was you're supposed to identify with the person being killed but let's say as a white person you're also supposed to identify with the policeman who is killing george floyd right that is the that is the catharsis moment that because you identify both with the victim but you're also identifying with the killer then that is what is leads to the explosion the religious explosion which came after the witnessing of this murder and so it is almost impossible to understand the massive protest without understanding that and so on the one hand you have the people of african descent who are portrayed as the victim in the situation who are being killed but most people the great the vast majority of people in north america and in europe are still white people and so the event most people in the protests were white most people in the rioting were white as well it seems maybe i don't know about the statistic but a lot of the images that i saw were kind of these like young and tifa types who were provoking the the the riot i don't know but in terms of narrative it's important to understand that that as you watch a person getting killed and as you identify both with the person being killed and the murderer that is that which that's what leads to the catharsis explosion that's what leads to people going out into the street and then communing together in mass protest and the mass protests are really a form of religious event where you are communing together you will say there's mass contrition you are asking forgiveness you are pouring out your your sadness of seeing of i how you identify with the suffering of the one who is killed but you but also the sadness and the the the emotion of identifying also with the killer and so it is a form of ecstasy it's a form of religious ecstasy which we saw some people get it being engaged in if you look at the manner in which the mayor of minneapolis was acting if you look at the manner in which the mayor of minneapolis cried and and did had these gestures which were extreme in terms of someone who he didn't know you can understand that he was he was activating a form of religious ecstasy as he was engaging in these acts and that is why the if you watch the protests if you watch images of the protests they were religious in nature they included kneeling they included chanting they included forms of like i said forms of contrition because what was being called upon in watching that video was a a form of religious catharsis which led to all of this coming together and we need to also also understand that what had been happening until then was that everybody was being pulled apart everybody was being held apart from each other everybody was being held in their houses and now they were coming together and they were coming together under a religious guys into a common principle into a common value and the only common value that they are allowed let's say to come in together in two is the value of openness it is the value of inclusivity it is the value of the global system it is the value of you know the only value left the the value of woke nests of inclusivity as the principle the only principle which can unite us and so usually principles of unity are exclusive exclusionary right deep what unites your family together is also what separates you from other families what unites your country your knit your nation your his your soccer club or whatever it is that unites people together also has an exclusionary aspect to it but the last religion we could call it the religion of the of the end is a religion of inclusion it is a religion in which the only value which brings us together is to include everything and we can see it in in the speeches of those who embrace that type of thinking justin trudeau comes to mind especially because he really has been a prophet of this type of thinking where he says things that would know when he talks about how diversity is our only value our only value is diversity we are a post nationalist nation all of this is the last value this last value possible and so and what it does is it creates also a radical exclusion now that is very important the only sin left is the sin of exclusion and it is a sin which is unforgivable it is a sin which cannot be you know that you can any and there's a there's a strange contradiction in there come on the one hand all the people who are meant who are supposed to identify with the chauvin the chauvinistic chauvet are supposed to understand that they have this sin it becomes the reason why they are able to commune with all of each other but ultimately it is an unforgivable sin and it is a it is the only thing which will exclude and so the only way that you cannot be excluded is by ramping up the acts which show that you are inclusive right all the virtue signaling we saw all the oh the desire to to take the sins onto your back in order to then at least be safe inside so that although you cannot be forgiven you nonetheless are able to be inside the inclusive group by doing that and then all then by criticizing and by criticizing all those that aren't as being the ultimate outsider the only outsider is the one who won't include everything and the final part of this the final part which really does make it into a religious of religion of wellness is of course the human sacrifice now some people will say that i'm being hyperbolic in saying that human sacrifice was involved in this story but i have to tell you that there it is it is clearly there within the very narrative that the people who are engaging in this are proposing themselves now of course the first human sacrifice was george floyd he was of course the first person to be sacrificed unwillingly for the this communion of inclusion but the very coming together the very act of communion became a form of human sacrifice now like i said it is within their own narrative that it is so because we saw that because of the coronavirus what we were told is that if you come together if you come and meet in groups if you go to church if you go to your work you know if you're if you go to parties if you invite people to your house all of these things is killing people you are killing people if you engage in this and of course the the ultimate version of that was when we saw that that the people who were protesting the lockdown they were telling they were presenting them as being completely insensitive completely selfish because here they are killing their grandmothers and grandfathers in order just so that they can start the economy again and so now the very same people who said that then engaged in the very act that they decry they came together and they joined together in communion massive massive communion you know tens of thousands of people meeting together in these protests and they understood even if secretly that they were doing what they said not to do but they were willing to accept it and you can see that in the in the letter that the medical these medical people signed in order to say that they they encourage the protest you know that they encourage the fact that people protest racism because racism is worse than the coronavirus and you can understand it so it's it is ends up being a hierarchy of values the highest value the transcendent value is the value of inclusion and you are allowed to sacrifice others for that value it is it is considered a noble act to sacrifice others now i'm not even saying whether or not it is actually sacrificing people that's not the point the point is to see within their very own religious narrative how within that narrative that is what they're doing within their own story they are sacrificing others in order to commune in the name of their highest principle so that really cinches it and it really cinches it in terms of a new religion now i want to call out i want to call out to all of the the new atheist all of the steven pinker types all of these these types of people who for the past generation has been have been decrying religion in terms of the belief in the supreme being the belief in the afterlife and all of these things now look around you the pattern is playing out no matter what it is playing out half hazzard lee because it is happening in a manner which is not which is not turned towards the highest highest thing right and because of that it's going to play out in all kinds of chaotic ways and i dare i say in dangerous ways but it is a religion nonetheless and what it shows is that we have these patterns in us we have these patterns probe we are made as religious beings if you try to remove religion it is going to come back it might not come back the way you want it to come back and it might come back in ways which are scary and dangerous and so we need to be we need to be very attentive to that and to remember why we have the stories we have why the story of christ is meant to is meant to do something similar than what we saw when we saw george florida being killed we are also supported support supposed to identify with christ supposed to identify with his killers but in that identification and in that coming together we are not left with a dead end we are not left in with a dead end of infinite contrition and infinite guilt that we pile upon our shoulders it is meant to bring us into a type of freedom and not a not a not an eternal recurrence of of contrition that you can never get out of and so hopefully that is going to help you understand a little bit of what is happening and in my net in my other videos i will also look at some of the the acts that we've seen the pulling down the statues the washing of feet and other similar things and so i hope this was helpful everybody and i'll talk to you very soon
