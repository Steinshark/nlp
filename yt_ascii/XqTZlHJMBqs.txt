so we we saw a nice lightning talk about having good code samples and slides and we saw a live demo of how to actually build those slides now it's time to have a live demo about live demos i like i like meta and so i figured this would be a fun way to do this so here we're gonna we're gonna kind of go through and do a little bit of a live demo so what are we actually talking about what are live demos even good for doing so the first thing that i think about with the live demo is it's really good for zooming in on some topic right this isn't this is a way to engage the audience and something you can show practical real tools that you want people to use it's really great for showing very specific code or specific details of something that's fairly complex it's good at focusing on how much more than why that means that there's also something that live demos are not really good at and this is kind of zooming out right you don't want to try and step back or really get to the bigger picture with the live demo kind of it doesn't make sense it doesn't engage the audience very well it's hard to get people to focus on what or or especially why you're saying something when you're doing a live demo they're reading the demo right and so if you want to kind of you know highlight your perspective or focus on an interpretation a live demo doesn't tend to be the best thing all right so let's also let's look at how we actually want to do a live demo first thing you have to do is you have to plan every single step this is this is hard to do but it's really really really important right how do you actually get into the live demo how do you move from one step to the next step how does everything work while you're doing this you want a good plan from the beginning another thing to think about is how do you wrap up the live demo and go back to your slides this is super super important if you know you have a live demo that you're mixing into the rest of the talk and and if you i'm curious everybody should think about how many pages of notes they think i prepared in order to be able to do you know a seven minute lightning talk on this i think i think this is going to be kind of interesting to see and we'll actually look at the notes i have later if you have your plan what are the kind of key components of making your live demo a success the first thing to think about is you've got to work within the projector and the audience view you you can't you can't be trying to to make the projector of the audience look at at your live demo the way you would while you're working at a desk with a big monitor you have to go the other direction right put yourself into the shoes of having a low resolution terrible projector with bad lighting right and so i've zoomed all the way in and this is actually the view that i'm looking at right i'm looking at the same thing you're seeing here and it's important that you kind of learn how to work in that environment and feel comfortable working in that environment you also have to learn the tools you're going to be presenting you're going to know them really really well much better than you need to actually just use them day to day you've got to know how to make them work for the demo if you're going to use visual studio code or an ide you need to be able to just jump right into it pull things up move around right if you want to show a preview you have to know where it's going to come up when it doesn't fit easily on the screen you've got to know how to fix that how to rearrange everything so that you get the view that you want to show the audience right i'm a big fan of virtual desktops for live demos it lets you kind of move between different tools in a way that's pretty smooth you always have the same layout the exact thing you're expecting each time you look at it you want to find this tooling workflow that's going to be effective when you're demoing it live next you have to make this feel real to the audience right you don't want to do something that's just going to oversimplify it right it's tempting to oversimplify you know in in slide code you don't have to make it uh compile but when you're actually doing a live demo you need stuff to compile you needed to work with the real tools and that's really hard and so you know actually use stuff here and so i'm actually using i have my editor set up it does automatic formatting of my markdown here you want to try and make it real so that people actually see how things work the next thing is you do want to make this live in the moment so you'll see me make mistakes here right that's fine it's good to actually have some mistakes that you have to correct life right and then people can kind of see that now this is this is actually real it's actually happening a lot and it keeps them engaged the other thing is to never ever stop talking and this is i think the hardest thing about a live demo it's especially hard when you're going to actually talk about something that you're not currently typing and when you're trying to do this it's very hard to keep it keep it in your head what you're trying to say and what you're trying to type and you'll notice a technique i'm using here which is on alternating and so i'll type a word and i'll say a word and i'll type a word and i'll say a word it's really hard for your brain to handle text in two different streams and so have a plan for how to do that and how to make it through it this is also one of the weird times when things like and hesitations that's actually fine when you're live demoing because what you want to do is keep the audience engaged while you have time to make it through your live demo next make it fast and comfortable one thing you'll notice is that i move fast in a live demo i move really really fast and that's because people can easily get get bogged down in the live demo and so you've got to rush just a little bit but of course you can't go too fast or it'll lose people it's a hard balance to strike and so i don't i don't have a perfect advice here but it's something you've just got to do all right next up okay i said i said to plan scratch all of that it's not actually about planning it's it's about practice i mean you need some plan so you know without a plan you can do a great live demo with a minimal plan but you have to practice right you have to make it comfortable and fast and you don't move this like a lot of people have talked to me after a live demo and they're like how do you type that fast by typing the same thing over and over and over again i don't normally type this fast but you gotta practice it until you're comfortable and you're fast and you can keep the audience moving and you have to practice things going wrong and so you don't get locked into this rigid script so let things go wrong mess up intentionally accents happen that's fine you want to kind of get that full experience when you're practicing all right the last thing is you've got to cheat sometimes you're going to be doing like i forgot what i'm supposed to type that's fine just have something prepared ahead of time right just pull out a prepared selection of things really fast this is not a big deal right people actually are fine with it they know things are going to go wrong the key for you as the presenter is to just roll with it right have those candids catch back up you can even use a pre-filled framework kind of like what i'm using here to move yourself through each step of what you want to present things to go wrong last but not least you should really be honest and provide your source this is actually one of my my big mistakes that i've made in a lot of tanks is that i don't always kind of upload the source provide people access to it this hurts two things both the credibility it's really hard for people to believe live demo if they can't reproduce it but it also hurts accessibility like it's it's nice that i have a decent contrast and a big font but even better is to actually have a git repository that people can go and check out and correct whatever they've misread i understand like uploading could be hard this is actually my problem is that you know if you work for a company you have to like sort out licenses or something but i really encourage everyone try to do this i'm actually going to try and get this uploaded on my github page just so that i actually have done this yet but i couldn't get it ready before before the talk but try and actually provide a link to things it's so helpful if you're doing a live demo to then kind of show all of the inputs so that people can see them and so with that i do want to just show you what kind of notes went into the planning for this right and so these are all of the notes that i was taking to myself in my initial run through trying to plan out every step of what i want to do okay hundreds of lines of notes went into a seven eight minute talk and so with that i've done a live demo and and i hope this helps you i'll do your next live demo because i think it's a really fun way to engage audiences thank you chandler that was awesome
