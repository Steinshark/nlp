ladies and gentlemen welcome back it's the champions chess tour finals and we are down to the last two magnus carlson versus wesley so will compete for $200,000 as a first place prize second place not so shabby either going to win 100 grand we are live here from toronto we're not live this is a recap video that i will be making for all of you this was day number one they will play multiple sets and then we will crown the winner of the champions chess tour 2023 it's been a really fun time here in toronto u i've been doing a handful of media there is a live fan zone for the finals as well not too far from the playing venue that's organized by the chess bras i was earlier i was there earlier today it's incredible stuff also yesterday i made my recap super late and my brain wasn't functioning and i called the cbc radio host who interviewed me matt turner for some reason his name is matt galloway turner and galloway i'm not even sure they have an overlapping letter matt turner is the soccer or football player for nottingham forest i don't know why i was thinking thinking of matt turner but that was really funny i i i i realized that like after i made my video anyway that's all to say that don't you know don't work 12 hours and then make a chess recap it's magnus carlson it's wesley so and i am so excited to be sharing this with all of you i have been i've been popping into the live chat during the streams and i do just have to say that i tremendously appreciate those of you that pop into the recap and even though the the the youtube videos recently have just been a bunch of comments like levy never fails to put chess in his videos and levy never fails to put levi in his videos and levy never fails to put gotham chess in his like i don't know where that came from but i am enjoying the comments on youtube videos live chat comments are brutal i mean my goodness you would think that people just hate everybody on screen it it is really wild stuff anyway they're going to play four rapid games and if the score is tied two to two they're going to play an armageddon or they're going to play three games cuz someone's going to win 3-0 wesley opens up with b3 that's a surprise our match gets started in a very spicy way you will notice wesley's lost 7 seconds on move one that's because when the clock was started wesley took off his glasses and then took off his ring and then played b3 which was very funny now magnus actually spent 40 seconds on the first move magnus spent 40 seconds on the first move of the game which is really interesting that is really interesting it's not that he it was shock i mean it was a little bit of shock value the thing is you can enter these really sharp and complicated lines like we saw yesterday with wesley playing against nck where there's this you know black puts the bishop in front of the d pawn white tries to put the knight there black plays knight a5 like magnus is deciding does he go for that does he play a reverse london reverse london is very very good opening with the black pieces but no he plays g6 and knight f6 he also could have started with knight f6 first but bishop b 2 is what he plays and now he goes here now there is a very sharp line here for white which is actually taking this knight damaging black structure and then trying to play without a bishop position actually kind of resembles a trusi because in the trusi attack you play bishop g5 and then you take on f6 but yeah that's not that's not what he plays instead he just plays c4 and magnus goes for a double fan ketto setup so magnus is actually playing for a position where he will put both his bishops on g7 and b7 whereas wesley is probably just going to play like not e4 but he's going to play like that it's a very non-confrontational position it's it's kind of now an english opening if you will because white played c4 so we kind of have a transposition and then in this position wesley makes a pretty big decision he he thinks for a little while here and rather than developing the knight here or the knight here or e3 bishop d3 which is basically what i would do and i mean just he he plays this he plays g3 so we are are actually going to have four bishops on g2 b2 b7 g7 so both guys developing their bishops to the little houses fano is what they're doing bishop here bishop here and castles a very tense position has arisen because white has a tiny bit more space in the center of the board but i'm not really sure it's exploitable and i mean in chz both sides are going to clash that's what's going to happen and what i mean by that is white is probably going to go for d5 or black is going to play d5 c5 black cannot spend the whole game playing on three out of the eight ranks right that black just can't play like that black's going to have to put something physically into the center like the way white has right now that is controlled and that is looking quite nice knight to a6 is a is a flank move you're trying to go knight b4 you're trying to play a5 a4 but at some point you're also going to have to move one of these pawns forward wesley still kind of playing quite tentatively e3 a normal move but wesley spending look how much time he's spending right wesley spent 3 minutes playing g3 like that's the sign of a hesitant chess player because you don't need to spend three you don't need to spend like what percent is three out of 13 i can't really do math that well but it's probably something like you know 177% how many threes go into 13 four and a little bit more than that it's actually quite sizable right so uh it's like 23% maybe i mean you don't need to spend 23% of your time let me you know what i'm i'm this is going to bother me hey siri what's 3 divided by 13 no 2 2307 look at that your favorite chess youtuber isn't completely brain dead i just did mental math on the fly you know how much pressure there is to not look like a complete bozo on camera and then doing mental math i had to like anyway so that's all to say that you really shouldn't spend 3 minutes developing on the sixth move of the game and so by the time magnus just plays a pawn to the center wesley's down 4 minutes this is a this is a very tentative wesley so you know if this was day one or two of the event he's playing a random guy in the event he's gonna he's going to be moving faster he's going to be moving a little bit more confidently but the position is still fine it's very balanced the both guys bring their rooks and now magnus there we go has occupied the center with those d andc pawns and it's it's a very very balanced position now what white should do here to play for an advantage is to take the pawn because then black has to make a big decision does he join his pawns together does he play with the isolated pawn white's best plan here often times is to then drive the knight out this way to put pressure or drive the knight out to f4 to put pressure there it's a very or or even knight b5 because now there's no c pawn you kind of stop knight c7 maybe you'll play a4 and bishop a3 to put some pressure on this pawn it's a complex game wesley plays here first and you know is is sort of he he allows the knight in a little bit kind of being annoying and the point is that the knight stops white's knight from retreating so now rook a1 and a6 and magnus sort of solves his problems you know wesley's going to get the knight on a2 we have a little bit of a trade here a tactical skirmish if you will wesley is poking right he's poking a little bit trying to win control of these squares if you take there is queen b2 check always which is what happens and we have a position like this now white you can argue is a touch better because when these pawns fall this is an isolated pawn it can't really move forward white controls that very well but black is defending everything black has very good activity and wesley you know it's a two-minute game magnus gives away the pawn to apply a little bit of pressure and wesley actually if you count the numbers he is a pawn up but his pawn up is right there and that pawn's not really intimidating anybody it's not intimidating anybody to the point that magnus can trade all the pieces and you know under traditional circumstances this is bad but magnus has this pawn under control that pawn's not moving anywhere you don't want to play rook d3 though you don't want to play rook d3 and do this because now white is winning white is just going to push the rook back with the ball you don't want to play like that if you're trying to win here you want a rook trade but if you're trying to draw you you do what magnus is doing which is only trade the rooks if the pawns are going to be split because now you can actually create weaknesses look at how active magnus is and white's rook is very passive and here wesley was was really you know was was really really hesitant moving the king back and forth like this physically and it's a draw they both play at 98.9% accuracy and nothing to choose between them in the first game but an interesting opening experiment there from wesley so now what is going to be magnus's first move magnus plays the english so magnus actually completely happy to enter a reverse sicilian okay this is very clever because c4 e5 is the i mean it's the reverse sicilian except basically white is playing the sicilian defense but with an extra move so we have a main line we have the four knights and now we have g g3 trying to put the bishop on the g2 square the most principled way to play here is to attack the center right away it's very forcing and it it immediately opens up the position the bishop goes to g2 to apply pressure when everything is going to open up and then magnus plays knight f6 excuse me wesley plays knight f6 knight f6 is an interesting move generally the knight has been going here and then bishop e7 f6 bishop e6 oh bishop e6 but bringing the knight back to that square is unique that is definitely not the most popular move magnus castles and wesley plays this move h6 so the black knight goes there and then there and then back and then black plays h6 i mean it just looks like black doesn't know how to play chess i it just looks like black never really learned opening principles or anything so that's weird but the point is that it's actually quite difficult for white to develop if white plays d3 here which looks very natural you're not ever putting the bishop on g5 or f4 so i'm not really sure how you're going to develop right but d3 is definitely an option magnus plays a3 very simple idea a3 my friends is he would like to go b4 and then he would like to play b5 and also this and also this so wesley says you're not playing b4 i'm making a committal pawn move but i see that you want to expand mag says all right if i can't play b4 i'll play b3 fine and then i'm going to play bishop b2 and wes plays bishop d6 and here magnus reconsiders and he plays d4 spends a little bit of time but he realizes magnus excuse me he realizes wesley blocked the queen had wesley gone let's say to e7 then magnus would have probably played bishop b2 you know wesley might have castled and then magnus would have played d3 and gotten this type of position but he decides in the face of bishop d6 with this blocked he no longer wants the slow play he actually wants to open up the position which is a move that he did not have available to him a moment ago now the interesting thing about bishop d6 is you would think white wants the bishop you would actually think white wants to go grab this that's a bad move because e4 you suddenly take your eyes off the center and you start realizing there are lots of tactics on your rook knight d6 queen d6 your knight has zero equity in the center of the board it's got to go here and before you know it yeah you got a bunch of bozos here that never woke up from their bunkers to go to battle so that's not going to work so instead of that instead of that we have d4 castles wesley plays e4 and he grabs the pawn in the center magnus takes the pawn on e4 and trades and we have the following position where magnus is down 6 minutes on the clock clearly something has not gone fully correct here now if he wants to play knight d5 it is possible to try to grab the bishop but he can't rush with the move knight d5 because after knight f3 check i completely give away my knight but i get your bishop and that's an issue there's all sorts of tactics here on the white position e3 and now a nice move but a move that gets a completely undeserved brilliant like chess.com the brilliant feature is very handy in certain situations this ain't one of them i wish somebody went in and overruled this as a brilliant move it's a very straightforward move it's the same kind of tactic where you try to give away the knight to win that bishop in this case you are giving away the knight to get the bishop and it would be it would be a big decision for white to take because you know giving away a bishop is a is a big deal white could play something like queen c2 here and just you know but after take take you know black black can just take and i mean i still like this position for white just visually but something like c6 and now you have no targets but okay i mean you still have to play chess right like if i put two 1400s in that position they would both lose they would both find a way to lose knight takes b5 bishop takes b2 magnus trads queens and then plays knight takes c7 after a long grinding series of moves wesley has a pawn down but he's trying to win the pawn back and if magnus tries to run away there's rook d3 not rook d4 i just can't draw arrows rook d3 and bishop b6 and that pawn is going to perish so we have knight b6 and opposite colored bishops but this one's ending in a draw opposite colored bishops but nothing to choose i mean white is a pawn up but if you just do the math what's going to happen is these four will simplify into one versus zero these two cancel out because there's literally no way for white to break through and then at the end black black would sacrifice for the last pawn and sadly you cannot checkmate with king and a bishop versus a king even if you tried to lose as hard as possible so wesley defends himself and this is just the position that you absolutely cannot lose magnus pokes a little bit but wesley's pawns are on dark squares there's absolutely nothing last game was 98.9 versus 98.9 this one is 99.2 versus 99.3 nothing to choose between these guys now the next game is interesting the next game is interesting i had predicted when this match started wesley would not play e4 and wesley would play d4 instead and wesley ultimately played b3 so he played neither of those moves but he avoided the main lin well this game he plays z4 and i thought wesley might want to ease his way into the match he didn't i mean he played d4 he played b3 but it was still very you know solid and the reason i thought that is i thought that magnus would play a sicilian defense against e4 i thought magnus would want to fight from game one because wesley is a is is kind of like slow methodical solid he kind of wants to ease into the match and i thought magnus would want to start a fight well lo and behold the second that wesley played e4 in game number three c5 knight to f3 and now not knight c6 which is magnus's most common sicilian not d6 which would go into a kn orph or a dragon or other main lines not e6 to play a con like he did against fabiano or a tonov none of that stuff magnus carlson played the o kelly variation of the sicilian defense you put this thing into a computer and it says plus. 6 off the bat like like stockfish thinks this is a huge waste of time actually the o kelli variation is something i would highly recommend for higher intermediate players especially those that play a lot of over theboard chess because the traditional main line for white in an open sicilian is to go here and against the o kelly it's just bad like black gets to play e5 and knight f6 and black gets a great position so the o kelli is a really nice opening tat to your toolbox but traditionally c3 d4 gives white an advantage or c4 right away and knight c3 and delay the move d4 for a little while that's traditional knowledge but of course if magnus plays something you can't just say hey that's not very good you can't play that so magnus looking for a fight off the bat and wesley plays bishop e2 so you'll notice wesley also spent a minute on that move a minute and like 20 seconds because he gets bonus time so obviously this is a surprise and he does not play the two main lines like you either play c3 or c4 here if you want an advantage you know what wesley does wesley waits for a committ move which is d6 and then plays d4 and this and bishop b2 is an interesting move i mean it's it's definitely a line it's definitely a very flexible move and and and it's a move that forces black to commit one of the pawns because black can't play d5 here this would just be a you know this would just be a really terrible scandinavian white would just have a tremendous amount of development so d6 well que not even queen d4 that's interesting look at that and he brings the queen back voluntarily and i guess he's going to develop and castle queen side now the computer really likes queen e3 i've played i've played this myself actually i' i've played variations where i put the queen on the e3 square instead of the d3 square but that's all to say wesley puts his queen on the d d3 square and here wesley surprised me again because rather than playing knight c3 and bishop g5 and potentially opposite side counseling he he just goes for just a very kind of solid standard okay queen slightly active you know queen is slightly out there sicilian and now he just he has to play chess but it's same side castling soda's unhealthy but sometimes you know you you you don't have the patience it's the only thing that's around and you need a little bit of a sugar boost but everything in moderation that is my that is my life philosophy knight to d5 the idea of this move is to put pressure on the black position and also to play c3 which would control this knight as well as block the bishop and then white would play bishop g5 there there actually is a variation of the sicilian defense that is very very similar magnus has a setup that's kind of kind of well that was weird i don't know why i went australian there for a second kind of speaking of australian alexander volkanovski is going to be in los vegas for that press conference for ufc 297 8 and n as well as a bunch of other fight fighters i'm very excited for ufc 296 as a side note but that colby covington line that he said to leon edwards i have never been more offended on behalf of another person at a press conference i mean i was just i could not believe he said that like there is i'm just gna say sorry if you're not a a fight fan i i could not believe that that man said that that that was crazy i shock be and and uncomfortable for me personally but that's why i'm not a fighter that's why i'm sitting in a hotel room talking about chess players so bishop g5 i just said this was the idea knight e5 and we have a horseless game it's it's two guys that definitely would not be equestrians or maybe or maybe even date equestrians i mean my goodness they they hate horses look at this no horses in this game but but but but but wesley plays h4 wesley a principled man plays pawn to h4 actually these types of positions demand little bit of a4 like a little bit of a4 business wesley clearly indicates to magnus that he wants to attack magnus says he he is not afraid he does not care that he has to put put pawns in front of his king forward he shuts wesley down and even still wesley should be instigating on the queen side that is what he should be doing because those pawns are advanced like magnus unquestionably would find a way to play a4 magnus might even play a4 in this position right off the bat i haven't spoken to him about this but maybe if i do we'll we'll put it in the next interview interviews coming out soon very excited for for all of you to see that now the bishops have tension here and you'll notice wesley has completely turned his attention away from the queen side plus he's being tentative right five six minutes for both here comes magnus arriving on the fourth rank basically saying to wesley look man if you don't want to attack me if you feel uncomfortable forcing the issue in our game allow me to do so because i'm not going to sit around here making draws with you all day i have $200,000 to win and a maple leafs game to go to where they're going to trail 5 nothing make a comeback and then lose he really did that he was at that game king g7 king g2 and look wesley's queen side which was his greatest asset in this game we go back to the moment that wesley played h4 the queen side is where white could have caused the most problems with a move like a4 throwing the black position into a little bit of a state of disarray and yet we fast forward to the 24th move of the game and it is wesley so expecting the arrival of the black position playing more defensively as magnus has now seized control of the game and both of them are tiing down to 3 minutes now the good news for wesley is the position is still very much in the balance magnus throws in a zichun zug an in between move before moving his bishop back and we have a queen and rook end game now it's very unclear with time ticking if these pawns are assets or liabilities i'm inclined to believe that the with the side that is actually able to create attacks against one of the pawns probably is looking at it being a liability nobody in white's position can attack that pawn i mean unless unless you suck a chess and play rook e6 and that is not a rook sacrifice you cannot say you are sacrificing pieces when you are losing them please stop doing that it is a coping mechanism for your inadequacies as a chess player rook to d4 defense and now black is going to try to poke over here or potentially over here but wesley doing a nice job there's really not a whole lot magnus can do we are looking at a rook end game magnus immediately takes control but of the file but just rook d2 and and then nice idea g5 here by the way very nice idea trying to sacrifice a pawn get the in the game wesley goes here and then plays this curious move now magnus actually has a terrible pawn structure double f pawns never really impressed anybody and the king can't really get out but the king's going that way and wesley just loses his f pawn i mean it was very difficult for him to defend the entire position but he's just going to lose a pawn and now desperate times call for desperate measures and apparently this was not correct and then and by marching his king up wesley has says i'm down a pawn but these pawns are so bad they don't even count for one you got two pawns and they literally count for nothing because you can't do anything to my position well the good news is magnus can't break through that magnus goes for the d2 pawn here comes wesley and now we're going to have a grand old exchange of pawns we're going to get rook f2 chck f5 rook c2 and all the pawns are going to fly off the board the king goes back for that pawn rook c3 king f5 and we're going to trade everything down rook b4 and first wesley plays this which i do i do really like monitoring that pawn magnus plays rook b1 and in this position wesley has to go king f6 wesley actually should not go for that pawn ironically but utilize his really strong king to get to the f7 pawn the idea here is that after the move b4 you have check here and then you take like this you actually should go for that pawn first cuz black's not going to be able to defend this pawn and cause you problems the second black goes here suddenly black is losing another pawn so that's the issue instead of that wesley grabs on h5 and in the scramble he just can't stop both pawns and with less than 5 seconds on this clock by the thinnest margin rook g1 check and if the king goes there it's a queen with check if king here it's a check and then here and magnus wins out of nowhere a scramble of a rook end game where a mistake was made 40 to 50 moves in the game just after a series of kind of pass hesitant moves and just sort of you know just sort of a little bit a little bit too a little bit too reserved you know this is not the wesley who we saw absolutely decapitate magnus carlson's king in the armageddon game you remember that a couple days ago mag he literally sacrific everything you're not going to get two games like that against magnus in like four days but it's still you know and and and now wesley has to win with black wesley's got to win with black that's what that's what he's got to do i mean there's no better opening to play if you're going to play for a win with black sicilian defense with c5 but magnus is taking all the all the air out of the room he just plays the move c3 the alipin sicilian which is a very forcing variation that could potentially you know cause very quick transformations in the position and and and and this is i mean this is really like if you want to make a sicilian defense player fall asleep you play the alipin you make them real real sleepy knight f3 d6 but wesley plays queen d4 which is actually i i believe we saw hikaro play this earlier in the event against maxim vagra instead of playing the the main line which i think is bishop c4 in some positions queen d4 and then bishop c4 is played so white keeps the queen side a certain way did i say wesley plays queen takes d4 i keep mixing up their names i think i just need more sleep called matt galloway matt turner like i don't even gallow they don't even have any of the same that was i don't know why i did that ed queen d6 and this is the position so this is what magnus has to work with he brings his knight into the game good principled now he brings the queen back he brings the queen back so that it's not a target for black's pieces notice that he spent only about 20 seconds on that move he wants to go here he's also kind of trying to induce wesley into knight f4 obviously he thought his queen was snug on the f1 square the computer hates it i mean stockfish is sitting here going i don't know why you would ever put your queen on the f1 square but he senses hesitancy you got to remember magnus now has three games of information of this match and and and wesley's been a bit hesitant so wesley backs up which makes sense he's opening up the rook and then he puts his bishop on the diagonal and wesley's a little bit better here but what does that even mean like right okay it's one thing if stford tells you minus point5 a6 is a nice move you know maybe black has to play knight d5 black is going to maybe slowly roll in here with this pawns maybe he has to trade a couple of important pieces rook d1 magnus just wants exchanges wesley apparently should be trading first and then playing bishop b7 because after takes takes and then bishop b 7 this rook is not yet committed anywhere and it's actually tough for white to make a move like let's say white plays h3 black just begins firing without even moving this rook because the a6 pawn is weak in the other line so for example you notice that black can't play rook d8 because of this diagonal so instead of the way it happened in this position wesley i guess should have taken on d1 then bishop b7 then knight e5 but he does it this way he's still up two and a half minutes but magnus is just trading off black's pieces like black is running out of firepower so b5 rook d8 a very nice position trust me this position looks really nice and on top of that white only has a minute and 48 seconds the only issue is white is magnus carlson so it's like are you going to get him into a into a better end game for black and grind him down i mean i think magnus would potentially enjoy that right knight knight d4 queen e2 bishop e2 and that's exactly where we're headed wesley could have tried to preserve the queens but the only real way to do that was like again if wesley plays something like queen g5 white is going to trade a whole lot more than just those pieces he's going to get all of this and if you wanted you could play h5 which is a very interesting move h5 is a very interesting move i almost feel like magnus would have played h5 himself actually feel like if this position was magnus was black he might play a move like h5 it's a very very annoying move for white cuz now if you want to trade queens one pawn dominates three and it leaves white with a very uncomfortable position over there you notice the computer really doesn't like it after the move h5 the computer actually like in in many cases wants to break the staring contest or even like weaken the king to kick the queen out so it really doesn't like to move h5 for white but instead we go to an end game and magnus basically just says the fists up elbows tucked head between like like and he just says let's go let's go it's two to one so i mean wesley has to win this end game with black he's got a minute and 19 seconds and magnus has a minute can magnus get it done can wesley get it done will magnus defend himself king f1 down to 39 seconds magnus says all right come and get me you want to double my you want to damage my structure come and get me wesley plays g6 preventing anything from going to f5 maybe he's going to walk his king maybe he's going to bring his pawns right that's what he's going to do magnus walks the king to the home square says what's up rook i'm here i'm defending anything else you got well the truth is it's very difficult to make progress here you can play bishop b6 you can play bishop d5 you can dance but at some point you can dance you can dance everybody e5 e5 and now we go to a minor pn game so wesley is really really trading everything magnus asap going for knight versus bishop what i mean i mean wesley i've been mixing up the names the whole recap but this is a very difficult position to win king f8 magnus controlling these pawns not letting them move and play c4 and apparently now even in the end game this this is the craziest part about this game magnus needs to literally sit there and do nothing he needs to just kind of wait but he's forcing the issue like despite being in a situation where he does not need to play for a win he's still the one calling the shots he's still the one trying to trade and target weakness is or you know take with the knight and target the bishop and the computer does not bless this move it wants bishop e6 where it thinks that after bishop takes and then king takes even though c5 is appearing on the board this pawn is actually closer to the black king than it was before black i mean i'm sure the game is still going to end in a draw but my point is that it's a lot of psychology like the move c4 is a pure psychological decision and he also might have thought it was the best move in and wesley blunders right away he blunders right away he blund blers and he blunders because now knight c4 and after bishop takes bishop takes ab b4 that's it it doesn't matter that you're a pawn down we just saw that opposite colored bishops it's a draw we just saw this exact same endgame and yeah i mean magnus pushes a bunch of pawns he knows he's not going to lose the white king is going to go to f3 the bishop targets the pawn these pawns cancel each other out completely and that's the end that is the end a very tense first day where it seemed like wesley was a bit tentative a bit tentative and magnus just pounced in game three in that one opportunity a rook endgame scramble with about 10 seconds remaining on the clock and that is how magnus leads the first set i mean magnus has had a couple of close matches like against fabiano but this one was close in a completely different way we need wesley tomorrow to show up ready feral ready to go attacking not physically because that's going to be the only way to make a comeback in the second set or else magnus is once again going to win another chess champ chionship so i'm going to go get some food i will see you all for the last round tomorrow get out of here
