this is the just announced huawei nova 9. this is the just announced honor 15. there's a good chance that you haven't heard of either of these phones but strange happening here that we need to talk about so here's the honor 50. it's a 529 euro mid-ranger and to be honest it's off to a really strong start you have the phone on top a clear squidgy tpu case usbc cable a pair of earphones and a 66 watt fast charger [music] what is that finish and here's the huawei wait a second of these are these the same box okay well the phone's on top and underneath there is an insert which contains a clear case a 66 watt charger and would you believe it a usbc cable wow very curious but before we can even talk about these phones we need to quickly understand the unusual relationship between huawei and honor so you might know this already honor was actually created by huawei in 2013. then for this entire time it's been sitting underneath them as a sub round while the main company was focused on high-ranking professionals and business people and those who would shop by going into physical stores they used honor as a second huawei a channel to sell basically the same devices slightly later on at a lower price point to a different market young millennials and students who tended to shop online i'm not exaggerating literally the same devices honor phones were powered by huawei's kirin chips they run a software called magic ui which was effectively a carbon copy of huawei's mui and they've often had such similar designs that i think a lot of people out there didn't even realize that these were in fact two separate companies however over the last two years the distinction between them has all of a sudden become very important because as you might know in 2019 huawei and therefore also its sub brands like honor were banned from using google services or getting any parts from u.s companies and this move single-handedly killed huawei's global ambitions that sudden inability to access the app store which is primarily what makes smartphones smart combined with not being able to have the latest technologies because you can't work with other companies plus the drop in trust that naturally comes when you are banned from something means that huawei smartphone sales have plummeted and as a company they've now had to pivot their entire strategy into focusing less on the phones and much more on the products and services that surround them but because of honor this us ban doesn't seem to have had the intended effect see all this havoc gets created left huawei in a dilemma they could either hold on to honor meaning that it would stay banned too and its global reach would sink alongside huawei's or they could sell them off to another company which would mean the owner would no longer be owned by huawei and thus it could spread its wings and fly again without restriction eventually at the end of last year they decided on the latter the huawei issued an almost touching statement that talked about all the pressures they've been under recently and how they finally publicly declaring that they are in fact selling their sub rent and the whole thing finishes with we hope this new honor company will embark on a new road of honor with its shareholders partners and employees we look forward to seeing honor continue to create value for consumers and build a new intelligent world for young people it was like a parent saying goodbye to their child for the last time but sure enough as planned it has freed honor and all new honor phones now come with full access to the play store except here's what i'm finding a little strange honor and huawei are now separate companies right they've been apart for a full year and yet look at these two phones this is the honor 50. it has a 6.57 inch oled screen and a snapdragon 778g chipset it's just 7.8 millimeters thick and manages to pack in a 4 300 milliamp hour battery okay what about the huawei 6.57 inch oled screen snapdragon 778g 7.8 millimeters 4 300 milliamp hour battery finish aside from every single angle these two phones look the same identical button layouts identical speaker positioning identical camera placements they are the same weight to the exact gram courage but there are other phones the honor 50 lite is basically a huawei nova 8i the honor magic x foldable looks like the huawei matex 2 foldable the list goes on and it's not just hardware these two phones right here are apparently running two completely different operating systems the honor is running android 11. the huawei is running the company's own in-house completely new harmony os but then why does everything look so familiar you can check this out every single icon on the honor literally looks like it's just taken a huawei icon and made one tiny tweak to it the only difference i can see in the camera is that the zoom toggle on honor has been pushed to the side it feels like the textbook definition of yes feel free to copy just make sure you change it up a bit so no one notices and also the core technologies are the same look at these two charging bricks one is apparently using honors supercharged technology one is apparently using qualities supercharged technology but i'd be willing to place quite a significant wager on the fact that these two bricks are identical that they're manufactured in the exact same location with the exact same components and the same technologies behind them the two companies they even share staff members at the point where honor was cut off from huawei they took 8 000 employees from that company so even though they may now have separated management teams they are largely functioning with the same people you're probably starting to get the idea if huawei has been banned honor has separated to allow themselves to be unbanned but even a year later you're still effectively just getting a reskinned version of the same phone from both companies i did reach out to a huawei executive to try and clear this up and she said the design process for a phone is lengthy and this one started before the companies went their separate ways so according to her these designs were finalized over a year ago and that's why they look so similar it seems like a long time but maybe this is true what makes this stranger though is that both of these phones were announced days apart from each other the only hardware difference is that the huawei has a slightly better main camera sensor and yet the huawei costs 499 euros the honor costs 529 euros so it's almost like these two companies have switched places instead of being the lower tier sub-brand honor has kind of become the premium brand effectively just flexing the fact that they now have google play services again this honor 50 came out before the huawei nova 9 which is the opposite of how they used to release later than their huawei count worlds honor is serving more countries globally and they're now branching out into not just budget phones but also top tier flagship phones like the honor magic 3 pro plus honor is trying to be the new huawei and milo wants to be the ceo out out out not a man of honor and if you are enjoying this video then a sub to the channel would be honorable however the unfortunate consequence of this whole situation is that actually they will struggle to follow through with this and that neither of these phones makes sense as a result they make a good first impression like before their mid-range prices i was pleasantly impressed by how they have the character and general feel of hiring devices but using both of them feels lacking for different reasons see before the us ban there is a reason that huawei was steamrolling the smartphone market this is a giant tech company who was not afraid to invest literally billions into r d every year making sure that every new generation of phones introduced at least two or three features that were significantly ahead of the others and they had the budget to make sure that these features were tested properly and were reliable huawei pushed the entire industry forward but literally the minute this ban came into effect huawei was completely cut off from its u.s suppliers and so that innovation instantly halted their latest p50 pro smartphone is actually the first time in years that they haven't been able to upgrade their main camera sensor they weren't able to implement 5g and at the same time this lack of google services like the play store and gmail and maps has made these phones all but redundant for a western audience so this nova phone it does feel quite smooth and polished but i just can't recommend it and then you've got honor who has a different problem that while cutting ties with huawei has unburdened them from regulation it's also meant that they've lost their biggest asset like think about it as an apparently independent brand now how an earth is ono going to do the job of a company that has a true 200 000 employees huge research and development centers and a literal city of their own with just a merry band of 10 000 people and use phones exact same hardware as the huawei the exact same cameras in this bottom ring here and yet the honor performs consistently worse check this out on the home screen super smooth scrolling but the second we enter the play store boom it just start slacking or here in the settings my scrolling is nice and buttery and then the second i open this menu there's a disconnect like what and this camera system it's a 108 megapixel quad camera but it's really not good and i wasn't expecting to say that the camera is on huawei phones and by implication also honor phones have tended to be historically some of the phone's highlights but something feels off here and i guess it becomes more clear when we compare the two phones ultrawide cameras they should be the same but i prefer huawei's image processing about 95 of the time the difference in selfies is enormous even though both are using the same 32 megapixel sensor and my best guess as to why is that huawei might have retained certain patents or certain image processing algorithms that because honor is now separated from them they can no longer access or maybe huawei just didn't share their recent software improvements with honor in the first place knowing that they were going to sell the company whatever it is something feels missing here this honor is not producing 2021 quality photos as a prospect it might initially appear just like a huawei phone as if nothing ever went wrong you have a google search bar on the home page a folder for google apps you swipe up from the left you get google assistant but behind the scenes it is not quite there the point i'm getting to is this in its current state this whole us ban no longer makes sense to me even as an independent company honor is still effectively acting like an extension of huawei like the gun right from the beginning with a lot of the same workforce the same manufacturing the same technologies except for some reason with the current rules one of these companies is banned the other isn't now i'm not saying that i think honor should be banned it's not really my place to say but what i am saying is that i can't see why huawei is banned if honor isn't banned and likewise it doesn't make sense to me that given that honor isn't banned why huawei is banned it's got to be both or neither right like if the entire premise of the us ban was that huawei was spying then as it is right now it's not preventing that the only thing it's done is made huawei have to jump through a weird loophole that's made the new huawei's products aka non-google huawei and independent honor worse for consumers because the team has been broken up and effectively forced to start from the beginning in a lot of ways you've got to remember that if honor is going to truly try and differentiate themselves which they might have to because of growing pressure then they're gonna need to find new offices they're going to need to build new research centers they're gonna need to find tens of thousands of new employees and then spend time coming up with their own new brand identity and their own unique software skin i have no idea how they're going to be able to do that and then find a way to make themselves priced competitive against bargain basement brands like poco and realme very curious to see what comes next though i think on his next move will be quite indicative as to how this is going to play out your location your operating system every hardware detail of the device you're on right now as well as all your past browsing history these are things that you'd want to keep to yourself right well this is how much information a website immediately knows about you the second you click on it and to be honest if it's a website you trust then it's fine but i'm willing to bet that there's a lot you visit that you probably don't and that's where surfsharkvpn comes in as far as i've seen it's the most affordable way to keep yourself anonymous it's just over two dollars a month for as many people and as many devices as you want but there's another perk because i can effectively pick the location that i want my device to be from i can for example pick the united states and watch us tv shows you can effectively have the exclusives for every single region without leaving your home like if i wanted to watch batman the dark knight i just switched to canada and i can do that so check the link in the description and if you use the code boss you get an 83 discount and an extra three months for free to find out if the new google pixel 6 camera is any good click here well to see on a slightly darker note why i'm worried about the future of humanity that video is here my name is aaron this is mr who's the boss catch you in the next one
