book because i'm very proud of it i think the book is awesome and in the us we're nearly at 20,000 pre-orders so get it before it sells out it won't sell out magnus carlson white pieces versus sari lr and by the way my initials lr this is an international master from india who's got to make a name for himself cuz chess.com doesn't even have a profile photo of sari this is kind of the the messed up world we live in this person hasn't gotten on the map yet but they're clearly a very good player chess lom can we get a actually a few people in today's recap don't don't have photo so we're going to you know magnus opens with c4 but it very quickly goes back to being a d4 opening very interesting i i wonder why magnus did not play d4 i maybe he wanted to avoid a queen's gambit accepted like maybe his opponent played d4 d5 c4 i don't know i i really there's no listen magnus is like the best player in the world i don't think he avoids the preparation of 2400 magnus plays an english but then turns it into a queen's pawn and this is the slav defense knight f3 knight f6 magnus already plays an interesting move which is g3 you will notice that magnus actually spent three minutes on that move so clearly you know d4 knight f3 knight f6 and normally in the slav defense white plays knight c3 but there are two slavs possible there is the open slav which is dc and then white either plays a4 preventing b5 or plays e4 allowing b5 or white black does not do that and black plays the semis slav magnus plays g3 so he plays this in catalan style basically he plays the catalan setup and he wants to play bishop g2 with long-term pressure he doesn't mind his opponent taking on c4 because he's probably just going to develop castle and then deal with this later this is very magnesian he has done this in a handful of games but his opponent plays bishop f5 his opponent's time doesn't even move he spends exactly 30 seconds bishop f5 is very simple just trying to get the pawn out to e6 but this move already gives ammunition to magnus because now black is basically saying i don't want to take the pawn i don't want to accept the challenge of taking the pawn on c4 so instead i'm going to bring my bishop out to f5 and so magnus plays knight c3 which simultaneously puts pressure on this and takes anyway this you know from going to e4 but there's a hidden idea magnus now completely switches the game plan so this bishop is an offering up to white so magnus goes here and now attacks the bishop why does he try to do this why does he try to put the knight on h4 to try to take the bishop on f5 you know what i can hear right now you can't hear this we have a neighbor with a small dog and that small dog will randomly throughout the day just start barking for like 10 minutes straight and that's what i can hear right now you can't because of the settings of this microphone small dogs are not real dogs i'm going to say say this right now on camera why did you buy a rat why why did you get a rat you could have just gotten a rat it would have had the exact same my dog is 55 lbs like 25 26 kilos that's a real dog that's not a real dog that just sits there yapping you might as well have gotten a little stuffed animal that makes noise just saying it right now you have a small dog we have beef on takes c4 knight takes f5 why did magnus go for that because you got to do something at the this level for magnus to defeat a player 400 points lower than them he needs just just a little bit of imbalance little pawn structure imbalance little piece imbalance and so now the plan could be to develop like this but magnus plays something very unique he plays e3 so the pawn on g3 was designed for the bishop to go to g2 that is why magnus played that move but he's changing the plan the plan is changing and he's not worried about the potential weaknesses over here this is a very big moment in this game black has multiple ways of setting up now he could play g6 he could play knight bd7 and then after bishop takes c4 he can move this b you know he could play b5 and knight b6 but you're not going to play these moves against magnus like you just you feel weird playing b5 you feel weird provoking the goat so you just kind of make solid moves you know you just play like bishop d6 you know now you notice black he he's played pretty quickly bishop d6 played pretty quickly bishop takes c4 clearly magnus's idea and now we're going to see the other idea when black castles which is a very easy move to play magnus is going to play queen to f3 so the bishop and the queen are out uncomfortable the bishop does not go on that square anymore magnus has a little pressure here he has two center pawns his opponent has no center pawns by the way he has cnf fighting for the center and he's going to try to use that open center and mag and his opponent plays g6 no notice by the way sari has not spent any time i don't know if this is prep i don't know what this is clearly black is well prepared he is unafraid of magnus up 10 minutes on the clock now it's actually maybe not so good for white to castle i mean he could he could but if you just leave the king here then how do you how you going to play you going to play in the middle going to go here and here maybe it's better to create an attack that's exactly what magnus does he plays h3 he's not going to castle magnus castle why well he's just going to play g4 black is going to go knight b d7 magnus is gonna go g4 he's going to get this big attack he doesn't need to castle and that's how he's going to win he's goingon to play bishop d he's gna he's about to make this look super easy all right queen e7 and now magnus plays g what yeah spent 10 minutes spent 10 minutes he clearly didn't like something he didn't like something and i think what he didn't like was this move c5 you see queen e7 defends the b7 pawn against this queen and puts pressure here now f4 looks nice but it's not it's not doing anything it this is not i can always go this way i think magnus didn't like c5 which is actually quite an annoying move because if you take then black just gets development or even goes bishop e5 and then takes back later with the knight but that would be weird just take back on c5 and d5 allows knight bd7 knight e5 so this is actually quite annoying and magnus spends 10 minutes and castles 20 minutes down but the position's very tense now black plays h5 he thinks for 12 minutes and he says you know what i don't like that magnus can play g4 of course he could have played knight b d7 but then magnus would have played g4 and king g2 and slow just slowly would have just slowly now what what would black do there maybe b5 counterattack right but instead of that you were just so nervous you're like i don't want magnus to even play g4 i'm going to move this pawn in front of my king because i'm safe magnus is never going to play g4 he can't so now black has total clamp on the move g4 nice move so magnus plays rook e1 he's preparing the move e4 in the future not right away like you know black will play knight b d7 maybe white will play bishop d2 maybe white will go e4 right away maybe he can you know take take take maybe rook e4 and magnus is going to have pressure and after queen f6 maybe he'll play like bishop h6 not right away that would hang the queen but but you know he'll go here and he he will do that he will win in the magnesian way so black plays knight e4 knight e4 stops white from playing e4 himself and you would think white can play g4 here but you you can't do that because you you because after takes there's queen h4 and you're under a lot of pressure so this is a tough spot for magnus because if he tries to kick out the knight black is going to play rook e8 maybe bishop b4 and he's going to not allow white to play that so magnus plays g4 am i living in like a weird alternate dimension i mean i just said he's trying to play g4 so he's not going to castle black plays h5 stopping g4 then black plays a move which allows g4 but g4 can't be any good why would he play g4 after takes there's takes the queen is coming to h4 yeah apparently it doesn't matter none of this matters the white king is completely safe doesn't matter g4 knight g5 the queen's just going to go back to g2 makes absolutely no difference magnus plays g4 that's real bad that's that's really bad if he's going to land that move sari notice spends 23 minutes on the move knight4 gets hit with this spends another 20 20 what did he think was going to happen this is how you know you've messed up in chess you spend 23 minutes on a move you probably calculated this probably calculated knight e4 a couple of other moves dude plays the move that you probably calculate you go oh my god what if done what was he thinking about right that's the effect of playing magnus now after take takes he realizes oh man i really messed this up i probably thought i had something he i got news he doesn't have anything maybe he thought about knight g5 and pawn to f4 he doesn't have anything there's nothing here e4 e5 it there's nothing and it gets from bad to worse my friends and now magnus starts styling on his opponent bishop b4 with pressure on this knight magnus says pawn takes f5 leaving this to die knight takes pawn takes bishop takes magnus has blundered into a rook fork the rooks are completely hanging you know magnus plays here magnus knew that he sacrificed both rooks queen to g4 look at that spend some time he has a lot of options f6 e4 queen g3 queen plays queen to g4 both rooks hanging gives them up doesn't need them calculating that these pieces are going to launch an attack on this king the threat is queen takes pawn with a check black's best defensive move is queen f6 at which point magnus would have probably taken but now black has the gangster king g7 and if you play discover check with the queen there is a trade and at the end of it the rooks are still hanging so you would probably have to move the bishop and give up one of the rooks but his opponent plays king g7 and in this position magnus has one and only one winning move it's time to bail out he's probably going to have to sacrifice the bishop and then play rook b1 no my friend's the best move in this position is to sacrifice the rooks with pawn to e4 what do you know what this does it does two things it gets you one step closer to playing f6 fork e5 f6 but most importantly this move opens the door for the bishop it doesn't matter which rook dies because the idea is to play e5 f6 and bishop to h6 and somehow magnus calculated his opponent cannot do anything bishop g5 pawn to f6 check the computer here finds some you know some better execution like pawn to e5 first first but bishop g5 f6 check and cool common collected just take back he sacrifices a bishop because if you take you cannot stop queen h6 and queen g7 look at this position black is up five points of material but he can't move and that is how magnus carlson got started in qatar by forcefully checkmating his opponent on the dark squares and by sacrificing his rooks walking directly into a fork to very quickly methodically one cut and it's just like execute like a little butcher's cut just that's it dead good start let's see if he wins the tournament speaking of other good players hikaru is the board two of his event his opponent is also from india vantika agrawal who's a a strong women's player i player overall but also i think she's like a top she's like an olympic member there of the women's team i mean she's she's i think she's like 16 17 i could be completely wrong because that country has you indians y'all got so many good players but i think she's like 16 17 i i could be completely underestimating but she's a very very good player and she also plays a catalan we just saw a catalan set up in that game now hikaru's got a much tougher task you know why because hikaru is playing black and playing for a win with black is very difficult especially at this level so hikaro plays this very provocative catalan system knight e4 what does does and we could even look at it from hikaru's perspective what this move does is it wastes a second move in the opening with the knight but then black wants to play c6 knight d7 and f5 and what karu is setting up is actually an opening many of you might know it is the stonewall dutch it's like a dutch defense it's like white played f d4 f5 and then c4 knight f6 g3 e6 bishop here d5 something like knight f3 right it's like we got here and then you know bishop b7 wherever white's knight is in the game i think the knight is on c3 and then knight d7 queen c2 and something like this this is the position that we are covering in the game in fact look how similar it looks i just got you to that position the only difference being black wasted an extra move playing here and here but the position looks very similar which is very interesting so vantika took she's already down 30 minutes on the clock and she goes for a position the best move is 91 and try to hammer at white's center but she goes for a trade i think she went for a trade to relief the tension a bit and the good thing about this opening for white very tough to crack and she plays f3 now hearu at this point knows he's playing for a win like he's got to win he's not trying to make make a draw against somebody 350 points lower rated than him just not trying to do that so how's he going to play for a win from this position he's got to do it in a way that keeps the tension right bishop to a6 puts some pressure on this pawn on c4 vana goes here takes takes how you going to win this position no knights if anybody enjoys an advantage it's white anybody right it's a very tense position but how you gonna win this karo goes queen g6 he tries to trade queens with his opponent which is crazy right like you would think white would go here but this is imbalance and then maybe she'll go here and he'll go king f7 and then he's going to try to advance right like if she plays f4 he might take he might open things up so maybe she does have to defend herself with rook here right then she's going to go here or maybe bishop c5 in the future and then he's going to try to push this like there's little way so she plays queen c1 and you'll notice she's spending a lot of time and now this is where hikaro now activates 27 an 80 mode h5 h5 is very provocative very provocative move and now h4 and in this position she now had to nip this attack before it turned into anything she had to play queen b1 trying to get a queen trade and now if hikaru stayed around over here he would lose this pawn if he went to h5 so queen to h6 g4 g5 and she turns the attack back around on him but instead vonka plays king f2 there's nothing really wrong with this move but now karu comes barreling down the other side of the board now she goes for a queen trade but now karu says no and her king moves so she can't really fight back karu takes on g3 the black king now the white king now has to defend the bishop and now just very cool com collected bishop to c8 the computer already wants like rook f7 here to try to play g5 i guess and try to double up and all of this he plays bishop c8 and let's not his opponent doesn't have enough time vanka has 2 minutes she trades the rooks and she continues to attack but she has 48 seconds it's just not enough hikaru infiltrates with his queen and he gets the queen trade and that's very important because despite having 40 seconds the pressure is really what's going to win the game here it's not even the time trouble it's the fact that it's really difficult to survive she lashes forward with f6 he goes here he takes with the bishop because after it takes takes he's just up a pawn and not only is he a pawn up he is up a pawn in an in a same color bishop endgame rook e five back she takes on f6 but he takes on c4 and he's just up two pawns and vantia has this h pawn she's going to try to use it and she gets her extra 30 minutes which is what they get on the 40th move but it's not enough and hikaru methodical like the terminator puts the rook on the second rank gets that pawn there e5 is a nice move to try to def reflect and to try to play bishop to f3 he goes here she goes to e3 he goes here he's just up two pawns and this is a completely winning end game he's just going to walk up the board he's going to push that pawn to e3 he's going to take and there's nothing to be done she defends as best as she can but she resigns because he's just going to walk his king in and this bishop is not getting to the corner so this is always winning it's going to be king g3 king f2 and you have to be a little careful here how you do this but bishop e4 and bishop 2 f3 is how he would win this game so actually this would be a draw because this would be a stalemate and bishop takes would end up a theoretical draw but we don't have to get into all that hikaro wins magnus wins and now let's some of you can leave now cuz you know you guys want to watch magnus and hiar you'll let the real chess fans stay you guys can go click on something in your sidebar i'll squeeze this little stress thing you know cuz i'm stressed out that you're leaving you know little grip strength thing nice little squeezing anyway those of you that want to stick around i'm going to share two absolutely epic games with you this is a game between rafael laguno from germany and jordan van forest who i actually uh am very excited to see play in this event and i hope he does very well because jordan plays a lot of exciting chess what is that light on my that's light what is that weird and then i have a game for you that that that that was just a knockout in like 10 minutes so that's going to be very fun and you're going to see a gangster checkmate e4 jordan plays my opening cuz i invented this opening caroan defense white plays the two knights and now bishop to g4 is one of the main lines where black trades the bishop and plays knight to f6 and hopes that you know e5 happens happens bishop b2 jordan plays this develops his dark squ bishop to g7 and here white is very clearly preparing d4 so black plays d4 himself and where did white lose his time 17 minutes on castling maybe he got locked in the toilet maybe had diarrhea rook d1 jordan plays here takes the center takes the center and now is ready to play knight c6 i love this i wish i could play the carocon like this white plays a4 to try to take space on the queen side jordan says you know what you castled h5 see this is how good players play for a win they're just like h5 i'm provoking i'm trying to get an attack over here you committed your king so i'm going to go that way and good luck now i don't really know you know white spent a lot of time here like probably being a little nervous i don't know why white did not play bishop g5 i'm not coaching anybody or back seing anybody but this seems like a very natural move as a response to h5 probably didn't like something i don't know probably thought queen i don't know i really i'm not sure cuz then knight a3 here i don't know but they played queen g3 and then they played knight a3 so they just did not put the bishop on g5 no problem jordan plays h4 white plays queen a that is so disrespectful to her majesty queen e7 now here and now jordan plays something really cool here he offers a trade of bishop which actually loses the pawn on h4 but it's a poisoned pawn because after bishop to f4 black goes g5 the king and the queen are hiding in an underground bunker together look at this the queen can't get out jordan mummifies the queen on h2 this is really tough knight c4 now jordan castles the other way and he is going to attack this is about to get really uncomfortable so something really hilarious here happen happens laguno runs his king the king is trying to escape the kingdom look at this i've never seen something like this before look at this king b8 that's not he's not trying to go with him the king just runs what is going on king to e1 now a6 jordan's like maybe i'm going to attack maybe i'm going to play king i don't know now black plays a5 look at this yordan consents that his opponent doesn't know what to do 10 minutes left on the clock to make 20 moves jordan plays king a7 he doesn't spend any time he just puts his king on a7 allowing white to think white takes jordan goes here securing an outpost on e5 the king runs to the middle of the board because the white queen can't do anything jordan plays knight e5 b3 98 he's rerouting and he's ready to fire with the pawn the biggest moment of tension right now in the game yordan is threatening f5 g4 all of these big attacks on the king in the center white apparently can just go here here and here and black has no attack black can play knight b5 according to the computer put the knight on see black doesn't have any attack because it's actually really difficult for black to add pawns so apparently white could have just played knight takes queen takes bishop g4 and it's a fortress like rook h6 would have been played then g3 rook h8 take take f3 it's insane but apparently this could be a fortress like of course jordan would play b6 and try to but this is what stockfish thinks on a low depth instead of that white goes here and jordan does not look back knight takes c4 now f3 pushing the bishop back once the i mean raphael hated his pieces i don't know what happened he really did listen i would have lost probably even faster i'm not criticizing raphael but my man hated his pieces this game look at the queen the queen and the bishop are just dead and you know what's going to happen when these two pieces are dead oh yeah jordan's coming rook d6 rook h6 and all it's going to take is by the way the king the k queen h1 oh my goodness now jordan's going to still have to break out somehow and white makes a run for it and you know he makes a run for it his queen does escape but unfortunately there's nowhere the queen can move jordan destroys the king and the queen does touch the other side of the board but rook d8 and white resigned because his queen is trapped his queen is just straight up trapped this is this is the saddest thing that has ever happened to a queen well no the second saddest thing that has happened to a queen that i've ever seen i mean i've really i i'm my goodness i good game by jordan that was fun and if and if you stayed around you but i i just thought this game was very fun nir yakobo a strong grand master from usbekistan olympic member of usbekistan played against the person who i thought had the same name first and last when i first read that listen g indians is g gars is that his first name g garf i thought that ch.com put two two names i i was about to yell at them but i think i've actually played garv on ch.com his name does i think he beat me so this was a nyso larson b3 and white played this gambit f3 e4 very provocative opening where you play like this and you try to get your opponent to take and play queen f3 it's very interesting opening gower was not having any of this he just gave the pawn right back which is normal but white got a very pleasant position i mean he kind of played this in a way where you know and taking is not good because rook c1 and then if bishop g6 knight d5 is winning for black for white because you just can't defend this now black needed to develop he needed to play fast here he needed to play knight c6 he spent a lot of time he played c6 white went here and here and as you can tell ner beck is just going for it now he plays this move knight e2 opening up pressure of the bishop he's trying to play knight f4 g4 and h5 he's just trying to trap the bishop very difficult position already for black who plays h6 and now look at this excellent play from noer very energetic g5 i mean nasty pressure e5 good counterattacking move knight d3 he pops the bishop out to h3 it's just a very nice position i mean white is just adding pressure now noer plays this really classy move rook h2 trying to double his rooks without touching his king look at that the position looking nice and juicy and now now the major moment in this game black was under pressure for a while he was defending himself he was worse but f6 f6 was a big mistake because now white can just crash through he has multiple ways of crashing through and a lot of them have to do with that king so noer beck here plays rook to g2 ready to take and go to g7 the computer wanted him to already play knight f4 and go for the bishop he plays rook to g2 and my friends after king to f7 gt g takes and this knight coming out ready to go to f5 and h5 his opponent in this position wanting to get his bishop off this front line played bishop to e7 and in this position nck yakubov decided i'm not going to slow play this i'm not going to crawl forward with my knight he played bishop to e6 oh my goodness i'm going to put an emote on this move i i just i don't know if it's a brilliant i mean that is do you know what the idea of that move is the idea of that move is to attract the black king like a magnet and now rook to g7 which simultaneously traps the bishop on h7 but also prevents the king's escape this pawn monitors the king's escape forward the king can now not go backwards and if black plays a move like knight to f8 knight f4 is checkmate pawn takes knight takes the king is embarrassed in the center of the board  and feathered so black decides to sacrifice the bishop and noer beck already has checkmate in seven moves he should have played knight f4 e takes knight and then takes and then checkmate on the next move but instead he plays f takes e4 and the game is over regardless bishop to d6 and nock plays knight f4 check knight to d4 king e5 knight f5 discovered check and he resigns because after king e4 check the king runs forward rook d3 mate oh my god this man played bishop to e6 what a move a full sacrifice of a bishop to seal the king's escape while simultaneously winning back your material with interest excellent game had to end it like this shout out to noer shout out to the indian delegation my friends this opponent of his was indian there was an indian who played hikaro and there was an indian c
