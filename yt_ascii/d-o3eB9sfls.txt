take 1 plus 1 fourth plus 1 ninth plus 1 sixteenth and so on  where you're adding the inverses of the next square number what  does this sum approach as you keep adding on more and more terms? now this is a challenge that remained unsolved for 90 years  after it was initially posed until finally it was euler who  found the answer super surprisingly to be pi squared divided by 6. i mean isn't that crazy? what is pi doing here? and why is it squared? we don't usually see it squared in honor of euler whose hometown was basil this infinite  sum is often referred to as the basil problem but the proof that i'd like to show you  is very different from the one that euler had i've said in a previous video that whenever  you see pi show up there will be some connection to circles and there are those who like  to say that pi is not fundamentally about circles and insisting on connecting equations  like these ones with a geometric intuition stems from a stubborn insistence on only  understanding pi in the context where we first discovered it and that's all well and  good but whatever your own perspective holds as fundamental the fact is pi is very much  tied to circles so if you see it show up there will be a path somewhere in the massive  interconnected web of mathematics leading you back to circles and geometry the question  is just how long and convoluted that path might be and in the case of the basil problem  it's a lot shorter than you might first think and it all starts with light here's the  basic idea imagine standing at the origin of a positive number line and putting a little  lighthouse on all of the positive integers one two three four and so on that first  lighthouse has some apparent brightness from your point of view some amount of energy  that your eye is receiving from the light per unit time and let's just call that a  brightness of one for reasons i'll explain shortly the apparent brightness of the second  lighthouse is 1 fourth as much as the first and the apparent brightness of the third is  1 9th as much as the first and then 1 16th and so on and you can probably see why this  is useful for the basil problem it gives us a physical representation of what's being  asked since the brightness received from the whole infinite line of lighthouses is going  to be 1 plus 1 4th plus 1 9th plus the 16th and so on so the result that we are aiming  to show is that this total brightness is equal to pi squared divided by 6 times the  brightness of that first lighthouse and at first that might seem useless i mean,  we're just re-asking the same original question but the progress comes from a new  question that this framing raises are there ways that we can rearrange these lighthouses  that don't change the total brightness for the observer and if so,  can you show this to be equivalent to a setup that's somehow easier to compute to start  let's be clear about what we mean when we reference apparent brightness to an observer  imagine a little screen which maybe represents the retina of your eye or a digital camera  sensor or something like that you could ask what proportion of the rays coming out of  the source hit that screen or phrase differently what is the angle between the ray  hitting the bottom of that screen and the ray hitting the top? or rather since we should be thinking of these lights as being in three dimensions. it might be more accurate to ask what is the angle the  light covers in both directions perpendicular to the source? in spherical geometry you sometimes talk about the solid angle of a shape which is the  proportion of a sphere it covers as viewed from a given point you see the first of two  places this story we're thinking of screens is going to be useful is in understanding  the inverse square law which is a distinctly three-dimensional phenomenon think of all  of the rays of light hitting a screen one unit away from the source as you double the  distance those rays will now cover an area with twice the width and twice the height so  it would take four copies of that original screen to receive the same rays at that  distance and so each individual one receives 1 fourth as much light this is the sense in  which i mean a light would appear 1 fourth as bright two times the distance away likewise  when you're three times farther away you would need nine copies of that original screen  to receive the same rays so each individual screen only receives 1 9th as much light and  this pattern continues because the area hit by a light increases by the square of the  distance the brightness of that light decreases by the inverse square of that distance  and as i'm sure many of you know this inverse square law is not at all special to light  it pops up whenever you have some kind of quantity that spreads out evenly from a point  source whether that's sound or heat or a radio signal things like that and remember it's  because of this inverse square law that an infinite array of evenly spaced lighthouses  physically implements the basel problem but again what we need if we're going to make  any progress here is to understand how we can manipulate setups with light sources like  this without changing the total brightness for the observer and the key building block  is an especially nice way to transform a single lighthouse into two think of an observer  at the origin of the xy plane and a single lighthouse sitting out somewhere on that plane  now draw a line from that lighthouse to the observer and then another line perpendicular  to that one at the lighthouse now place two lighthouses where this new line intersects  the coordinate axes which i'll go ahead and call lighthouse a over here on the left and  lighthouse b on the upper side it turns out and you'll see why this is true in just a  minute the brightness that the observer experiences from that first lighthouse is equal  to the combined brightness experienced from lighthouses a and b together and i should  say by the way that the standing assumption throughout this video is that all lighthouses  are equivalent they're using the same light bulb emanating the same power all of that so  in other words assigning variables to things here if we call the distance from the  observer to lighthouse a little a and the distance from the observer to lighthouse b  little b and the distance to the first lighthouse h we have the relation 1 over a squared  plus 1 over b squared equals 1 over h squared this is the much less well-known inverse  pythagorean theorem which some of you may recognize from math ologer's most recent and  i'll say most excellent video on the many cousins of the pythagorean theorem pretty cool  relation don't you think and if you're a mathematician at heart you might be asking right  now how you prove it and there are some straightforward ways where you express the  triangles area in two separate ways and apply the usual pythagorean theorem but there is  another quite pretty method that i'd like to briefly outline here that falls much more  nicely into our storyline because again it uses intuitions of light and screens imagine  scaling down the whole right triangle into a tinier version and think of this miniature  hypotenuse as a screen receiving light from the first lighthouse if you reshape that  screen to be the combination of the two legs of the miniature triangle like this well,  it still receives the same amount of light, right? i mean the rays of light hitting one of those two legs are precisely the same as the rays  that hit the hypotenuse then the key is that the amount of light from the first  lighthouse that hits this left side the limited angle of rays that end up hitting that  screen is exactly the same as the amount of light over here coming from lighthouse a  which hits that side it'll be the same angle of rays and symmetrically the amount of  light from the first house hitting the bottom portion of our screen is the same as the  amount of light hitting that portion from lighthouse b why you might ask well,  it's a matter of similar triangles this animation already gives you a strong hint for how  it works and we've also left a link in the description to a simple geogebra applet for  those of you who want to think this through in a slightly more interactive environment  and in playing with that one important fact here that you'll be able to see is that the  similar triangles only apply in the limiting case for a very tiny screen the inverse  pythagorean theorem alright buckle up now because here's where things get good we've got  this inverse pythagorean theorem, right? and that's going to let us transform a single lighthouse into two others without  changing the brightness experienced by the observer with that in hand and no small  amount of cleverness we can use this to build up the infinite array that we need  picture yourself at the edge of a circular lake directly opposite a lighthouse we're  going to want it to be the case that the distance between you and the lighthouse along  the border of the lake is one so we'll say the lake has a circumference of two now  the apparent brightness is one divided by the diameter squared and in this case the  diameter is that circumference 2 divided by pi so the apparent brightness works out  to be pi squared divided by 4 now for our first transformation draw a new circle twice  as big so circumference 4 and draw a tangent line to the top of the small circle then  replace the original lighthouse with two new ones where this tangent line intersects  the larger circle an important fact from geometry that we'll be using over and over  here is that if you take the diameter of a circle and form a triangle with any point  on the circle? the angle at that new point will always be 90 degrees the significance of that in our  diagram here is that it means the inverse pythagorean theorem applies and the brightness  from those two new lighthouses equals the brightness from the first one namely pi squared  divided by 4 as the next step draw a new circle twice as big as the last with a  circumference 8 now for each lighthouse take a line from that lighthouse through the  top of the smaller circle which is the center of the larger circle and consider the two  points where that intersects with the larger circle again,  since this line is a diameter of that large circle then the lines from those two new  points to the observer are going to form a right angle likewise by looking at this right  triangle here whose hypotenuse is the diameter of the smaller circle you can see that  the line from the observer to that original lighthouse is at a right angle with a new  long line that we drew good news, right? because that means we can apply the inverse pythagorean theorem and that means  that the apparent brightness from the original lighthouse is the same as the  combined brightness from the two newer ones and of course,  you can do that same thing over on the other side drawing a line through the  top of the smaller circle and getting two new lighthouses on the larger circle  and even nicer these four lighthouses are all going to be evenly spaced around  the lake why? well, the lines from those lighthouses to the center are at 90 degree angles with each  other so since things are symmetric left to right that means that the distances along  the circumference are 1, 2, 2, 2, and 1 alright, you might see where this is going,  but i want to walk through this for just one more step you draw a circle twice as big so  circumference of 16 now and for each lighthouse you draw a line from that lighthouse  through the top of the smaller circle which is the center of the bigger circle and then  create two new lighthouses where that line intersects with the larger circle just as  before because the long line is a diameter of the big circle those two new lighthouses  make a right angle with the observer, right and just as before the line from the observer  to the original lighthouse is perpendicular to the long line and those are the two facts  that justify us in using the inverse pythagorean theorem but what might not be as clear  is that when you do this for all of the lighthouses to get eight new ones on the big lake  those eight new lighthouses are going to be evenly spaced this is the final bit of  geometry proofiness before the final thrust to see this remember that if you draw lines  from two adjacent lighthouses on the small lake to the center they make a 90 degree angle  if instead you draw lines to a point anywhere on the circumference of the circle that's  not between them the very useful inscribed angle theorem from geometry tells us that this  will be exactly half of the angle that they make with the center in this case 45 degrees  but when we position that new point at the top of the lake these are the two lines which  define the position of the new lighthouses on the larger lake what that means then is  that when you draw lines from those eight new lighthouses into the center they divide  the circle evenly into 45 degree angle pieces and that means the eight lighthouses are  evenly spaced around the circumference with the distance of two between each one of them  and now just imagine this thing playing on at every step doubling the size of each circle  and transforming each lighthouse into two new ones along a line drawn through the center  of the larger circle at every step the apparent brightness to the observer remains the  same pi squared over 4 and at every step the lighthouse has remained evenly spaced with  a distance 2 between each one of them on the circumference and in the limit what we're  getting here is a flat horizontal line with an infinite number of lighthouses evenly  spaced in both directions and because the apparent brightness was pi squared over 4 the  entire way that will also be true in this limiting case and this gives us a pretty  awesome infinite series the sum of the inverse squares 1 over n squared where n covers  all of the odd integers 1 3 5 and so on but also negative 1 negative 3 negative 5 off in  the leftward direction adding all of those up is going to give us pi squared over 4  that's amazing and it's the core of what i want to show you and just take a step back  and think about how unreal this seems the sum of simple fractions that at first sight  have nothing to do with geometry nothing to do with circles at all apparently gives us  this result that's related to pi except now you can actually see what it has to do with  geometry the number line is kind of like a limit of ever-growing circles and as you sum  across that number line making sure to sum all the way to infinity on either side it's  sort of like you're adding up along the boundary of an infinitely large circle and a very  loose but very fun way of speaking but wait, you might say this is not the sum that you  promised us at the start of the video and well, you're right. we do have a little bit of thinking left first things first,  let's just restrict the sum to only being the positive odd numbers which gets us pi  squared divided by 8 now the only difference between this and the sum that we're looking  for that goes over all the positive integers odd and even is that it's missing the sum  of the reciprocals of even numbers what i'm coloring in red up here now you can think of  that missing series as a scaled copy of the total series that we want where each  lighthouse moves to being twice as far away from the origin one gets shifted to two two  gets shifted to four three gets shifted to six and so on and because that involves  doubling the distance for every lighthouse. it means that the apparent brightness would be decreased by a factor of four and that's  also relatively straightforward algebra going from the sum over all the integers to the  sum over the even integers involves multiplying by 1 4th and what that means is that  going from all the integers to the odd ones would be multiplying by 3 4ths since the  evens plus the odds have to give us the whole thing so if we just flip that around that  means going from the sum over the odd numbers to the sum over all positive integers  requires multiplying by 4 thirds so taking that pi squared over 8 multiplying by 4 thirds  badda boom badda bing we've got ourselves a solution to the basil problem now this video  that you just watched was primarily written and animated by one of the new three blue
