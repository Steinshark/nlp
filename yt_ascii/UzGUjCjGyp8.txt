this is a brand new way to write html with millennial clappy by the way this is the most millennial ass thing you can possibly do is add clappy in between every word you say this is this is millennial code right here there is no more millennial thing to do than than clappy all right let's check this out lal lang number one new programming language in the world award 2024 revolution in html lalo is a unique programming language okay again i've said this before and people didn't like it but i'll say it again if emojis are part of your culture you have an objectively bad culture lal lang is a unique programming language that uses emojis to represent html elements it's design it's designed for those who love to mix creativity and coding okay i hope everyone's excited about this we got a trailer video so politeness you have added so much to the world of programming but do you believe in the next generation what are some of the interesting projects that you might have seen recently that gave you hope in the future i believe laau lang is the single most innovative and most genius project to have been released in the past decade and people thought ai was a mistake okay it's clearly not this was so good let's go let's go that was so good lonus approved lonus approved all right all right all right lineus torval on lal lang nice acing dev dependencies macbook with touchpad keyboard i think everyone lo everyone loves touchpad keys right cuz i mean why would you put a touchpad on something just to make the touchpad keys right how great is that that they literally put a touch bar there just for them to be more keys let's see if you use windows or linux you can try this keyboard oh that's a good keyboard that's a good looking one official lang playlist i'm not going to listen to that quick start all right make sure you have node installed run npmi in the terminal to type npm run star in a console that's it lal file wait documentation okay okay whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa let's try this okay whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa let's try this out i did just do that let's clone it in npm wait hold on how the hell how the hell do i do this or is is this is he trying to get me to okay npmi npmi and then i have to do npm run heart that's the one i need where's 's the heart okay i i don't have i don't know how to type emojis yeah let's install it why not why not install a global dependency or whatever is just happening here here is your html code huge slay article list of responses it's a good start it's a good start all right let let me try it again could not read configuration file from dist index serve dist yeah that's because index is like that's not a folder dog index.html ain't no folder hate to tell you this but that ain't no folder bro okay well we got i got skill issued maybe try those ones i could try them command copied your command copied something else all right i don't think my command copied that much of something different okay wamp w linux issues i've been linux maybe i don't even know all right well let's see some stuff okay so api reference html body o good choice with the double thumb there dude that is such an h1 if i've ever seen an h1 in my lifetime this is it look at that that is that is h1 material if we've ever seen it in our lifetime every time i see an h1 that's the exact same face i make oh so sexy a div it's actually fair span this is also somehow fair okay okay has does do i know anyone that's ever used an ordered list how come can someone explain to me for just a quick second how come we have ordered list and unordered list but we use ordered we don't use ordered list but we used unordered list to display our ordered lists can someone answer me that second off why does an unordered list always order itself according to its initial ordering huh these are questions i need answered because like an unordered map you can't rely on the ordering but all of a sudden unordered list you can rely on its ordering and you thought html was going to save you where's your god now programmers go back to react all right article okay these are pretty good that's it testing philosophy run that to test let's see at emoji lang we believe that the test should be quick to write that's why we opted for a simple yet powerful testing approach we've minimized boiler play cod code to the purely necessary write the input and write the expected output write a title for the tag you testing done all tests live in a single file tests separated by comments why all right well let's check out let's hey let's check out that code tests it must be this one because that's the one that's certainly not showing up in my editor correctly i can't i literally can't i can't even open it all right let me try again all right all right all right there we go oh we got it we got it we're so in i just can't use telescope all right the m code look at that these are see this is true wait what's the skull skull is a universal closing tag clos by let's see close any tag by adding a skull modifier to it oh nice okay okay that's pretty good i can see that yeah you can see it right there you got a lot of skull you got a lot of skull closes okay okay okay clever i'm not a div and you can escape escapes oh what's the parachute easy to use emojis for escape emojis let's see okay escape emojis can escape itself too you can it can also escape the skull modifier too i am not a div okay nice okay oh nice oh they thought of everything the language is complete i cannot believe how complete this language is i'm sold i'm ready to i'm ready to build i'm ready to build a server with emoji language all right oh oh nice nice nice nice okay good this is good anytime you can use theos lady elizabeth holmes this is good first they think you're crazy then they fight you and then all of a sudden you change the world theos lady elizabeth holmes honestly this is it's a great quote it's a great quote boom times cover true it's true it's absolutely true sure did she happen to accidentally ruin some people's lives yeah but what she said was correct her hair's not blue don't trust her aged great she did she changed the world she changed the world so quick it'll make her time in prison easier it will originally posted by gandhi facts all right i think i might no i'm not going to but find myself wanting to not going to do it i'm not i'm not i'm not going to build something with emoji lang okay we're already building something with charm next okay charm i can't wait we're going to build something with wish and it's going to be fantastic i'm not going to get bamboozled and get distracted we're going so good right now i'm not doing it not doing it i'm not changing the world we're not changing the world people we are not changing the world the name is i actually kind of think emoji lang's pretty sweet i'm not going to lie to you emoji lang is pretty dang sweet and honestly their intro video with with lonus lonus like specifically calling them out it's pretty incredible it's pretty incredible a jen
