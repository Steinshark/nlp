so we actually wore fireproof overalls during the event i mean that's not so appropriate now but everyone within the boundary was supposed to wear these and to stop being on fire and fortunately they were not necessary so they're actually oil rig workers boiler suits other a work of genius clearly crazy insane genius where did it start where did the idea come from and how'd you get going with it some years ago i was fortunate to get to go to burning man and i saw lots of fire out there i thought that sounds like something i kind of want to do so i've had this thought in my head for a while to do that two years ago the previous emf camp we did a big collaborative project many members of the space contributed and we made barbot which is a cocktail making robot and when it came around to this time i thought maybe do something with fire i was down london and having a drink with john t when the emf organizes and i want to ask him if it was okay to do fire emf because it's kind of potentially risky and his response was yes yes it is in fact he'd already been sort of experimenting with these sorts of little flamers and he suggested pong as a game and so we just sort of took it and ran with it and sort of came to fruition that way there was lots of experimentation lots of broken things mainly arduino pro mini x' went through a food four eight five drivers as well is something not quite right with their dad to start with yeah blend out a few bits of electronics one of the things we had to work out how to do was how to light the gas so we experimented with things like barbeque lighters but they weren't really that effective but i came across these things one pound 64 from ebay he put five volts in you get a few thousand volts out and then another challenge we had was how to design a spark gap when you did we need some insulators but ceramic tubes were really expensive to buy so got a couple of ceramic tubes from fuses here with the screws in the ends and a machined aluminium block would just mount through the right position we initially just had round-headed screws in here that we found that we didn't get as a good spark between them and the actual high voltage generator is wearing out so we did a bit of research found this at sparks forum better off sharp points so we at least little strands of wire here which just encourage it to generate a spark and it also means that the spark is over the end of the weather where the gas comes out it was it difficult to make the game work as a game rather than the engineering side of it was that very straightforward yeah we didn't know if it would actually be fun to play when made it i mean i just wanted things to be on fire so didn't really care too much about the sort of actual gameplay until quite late in the process and it turned out it kind of worked pretty well and it was more or less my first sort of implementation of a game of pong which was really a placeholder for something a bit more sophisticated but it sort of worked so we just built around that it was a bit of description about what would happen when you one wasn't there you know we didn't want to encourage people to lose we didn't want to encourage people to win so that was when the victory swipe came was ensue to faster to encourage people to want to want to win and to have that extra go and make more fire when you win people really enjoyed the victory swipe i think it's a successful strategy well i want to say about expert plumbers but we certainly learned an awful lot about different gas fittings on this project if some of the nuts some of the joints the left hand in some of they were right-handed and a lot of its imperial quite a lot all of this section that's all on what's called quarter-inch bsp vowels but nothing is actually a quarter-inch quarter-inch was what used to be the inside diameter when they have very thick walled pipes but now and lighting bike a quarter-inch bsp pipe and quadrants bsp fittings and there's no measurement on there that is actually a quarter inch which is really really weird it's very satisfying to put together because it's really heavy and chunky you know i'm a software guy by trade so one of the challenges we had was all the gas hose are left-handed threads but a lot the other fittings are right-handed threads one of challenge was trying to find the missing components which allows to convert from left-handed to right-handed and that took quite a while trying to get that we found a source them weren't cheap but we did find the source of those we did actually have a few parts custom cnc made as well the adapters for the butane tanks into the rest of the pipe work the thread on a butane tank is not something which is generally you can't buy parts which go into it basically there's the kind of valve that comes with the cylinder and that's the only thing that goes in so we ended up having a part cnc made by another hacks based person and that worked out pretty good so the distribution board is actually split into two so we have 2 separate pressures and the main supply comes in here and we run this up to 4 bar and so we have a full bar gauge here and then there's a second regulator here and for the small purpose to come off and that has a separate pressure we actually want them to run as low as possible and because we get a nicer quality of flaming more like a sort of torus of flame and then you get the smoke ring coming off it if it's at low pressure if you've run at a higher pressure you tend to have a sort of turbulent flow and it doesn't look as sort of visually appealing and so we can set the pressure of the large buffers and the small puffers completely separately just by adjusting this and the other regulator which is actually on the tank so small puffers of the yes exactly they're the the puck is how i think of it sort of going back and forth the fire pixel pixel voxel there's room for a spoonerism there this is the source of the propane so this is running everything it all comes in through this distribution board to the other parts of the system the other two canisters are actually butane cylinders which were discarded and they act kind of like a gas capacitor they're called accumulators and they store gas close to where it comes out so that it can come out quickly from the top of the accumulator we come through this solenoid valve and from there it's just 22 mil pipe straight up to the end of the barrel and the idea is to get a fast flow of gas up to where it's burning so you get a nice big puff if we didn't have the accumulators what would happen is the rate of flow would be constricted by the width of these pipes and these are only 5 mil propane tubes so you can't get much gas through them and in fact after we've discharged the accumulator you can hear it recharging for probably about a minute or something until it's back up to full pressure and so that just bait it enables us to have sort of a sudden big flow of gas and make a good big flame we've got a separate regulator on the side which powers the pilot lights we've got the constant flame there it's quite nice we took is the emf camp festival so it gives us put a bit of ambient light around the whole area the game is really intended to be played at night and so that the obviously all the fire looks a lot better when it's dark but the pilot lights give a kind of a really good base level of illumination with everything sort of flickering and it adds quite a lot to the atmosphere while people are queuing up and then when you get the big puffs the sudden change in brightness is kind of visually appealing the scoreboard kind of gives us an option to actually display something so we can get an idea of what the state of the game is this is helpful when we're selecting mode so right now it's saying this is sparks mode there various buttons on the control box let us select mode so setup it's kind of a nested menu yeah this is the gas distribution board we try to build in accordance with burning man for our guidelines and one of the things that they say you have to do is to have a single master cutoff valve which is a coarse term valve so you can quickly shut off everything which kind of works except they're still gassing the accumulators but it works to prevent any more gas getting into the system and then we can also isolate individual segments so each large puffer has its own valve and similarly each of the three small puffer segments also has one of these and then it's all as brightly indicators as possible so that we can see it at night and under the flickering lights of the pilots and which worked fine we didn't have to mess with it at all the serve 60 amp hour spire in here so when everything's ruining it could tend to take 50 54 amps or a bit concerned about that consume that how much chromed it's using so looking around hack space look if your meter came across a box of all sorts of meters we found this one which is got it's got feet per minute on it but it's actually calibrated with a shunt in here so it actually reads nought to 60 amps but he never goes more than about 20 amps at the most when it when it's running 600 feet for a minute that's actually means 60 and yeah yeah i guess so yes yeah guess so so a quick look inside here say so inside we've got that's the 60 m power supply that creates 12 volts and these teas can were just stepping down to 5 here which powers the raspberry pi which is running running everything and then we've got a hours for it 5 converter here virus for it fires a differential network so it's more immune to noise that's right well we got it we've got a high voltage out there on the sparkers and we also got very high current as well so because we've got high code froze cables we will get a voltage drop and we're concerned about the ground level shifting so using 4 8 5 which is a differential signal which goes between norton 5 then 5 and naught as the data set down the line that's more immune to noise than rs to the 2 which is a single-ended system it's under raspbian and then the actual applications written in and python yep it's all python on the raspberry pi and the actual communications is done like i said over a and sort of custom serial protocol which just describes events it's only one directional so it just sends events there's no acknowledgment that an event has been processed in one of the various nodes but we've set it up so that there's not an event to say turn the gas off now so it may be the event doesn't trigger some gas coming out but it should never just leave our valve open and pouring gas everywhere in that protocol we have a checksum so in case there's noise from the sparkers or from the high current we can detect that the packets being corrupted and not trigger an event so in this way we try to be as kind of robust and safe as we can yeah that's the found that's inside the palace planets creating all that noise it was off from ebay and probably from china ogura guess but in quite reliable that ip65 were integrated connectors so make sure everything out there was water people just use the same connectors on on on the control box and the pins in here 8 to 30 amps would potentially gots like 20 amps in each segment and then we've got these 4 control buttons that just wind into the gpio pins on the raspberry pi for controlling it yes yeah arcade buttons that's it yeah most the time it's just the yellow button is to restart the game isn't it yeah that's for the most part once it's in pong match mode we require a manual interaction to start the game going and then the game will proceed until it's finished and then it sort of weights again for other interactions so the operators have a time to describe to the players what they're supposed to do and so we have a little should be all that we give people about have a practice raft of the baton the the bats have a haptic feedback from the wheeler they vibrate slightly when you want them to sort of indicate that you've actually done it right because you have to give it a little bit of give it a little bit of welly to sort of make the wiimote detect and it was a bit much for some of the smaller kids back to come nearly as big as then yeah well what's the name of that rule zero is a hax based thing so rule 0 for hax base is do not be on fire and it basically means look after your own safety and look after the safety of other people around you you're responsible for your safety that's the sort of gist of the rule rule 0 the game has an asterisk next to it which basically says what the guideline yeah so yeah i was a bit of a bit of a play on the hex based rule that's a good call in the game area we haven't got anything definitely lined up but i've had some interest but nothing come yet i'm sure we'll run it again it's too much for a single event oh remember in any ours i think we started working on it in earnest about two or three months before emf and we've been planning for a long time and some little bits of prototyping yes quite what was it wasn't there does it cost you artists a fair bit i mean we got some money from emf emf has grants for projects yeah and so many plotting pacs fans buzzing back space also yeah and give us some funding but didn't quite cover all the costs literally burning money yeah the cylinders 28-pound i think to refill of sillman and that lasted about four hours at the emf capsule of half eight to one half midnight yeah so every night these are actually pieces of metal studs which you just got from a diy shop yeah this kind of box-section thing and that's just to keep the pipe work from twisting in terms of sort of make it as stable as possible so that we don't end up getting sort of leaky pipe work so we want to keep it all rigid and it also lacks is a nice conduit for the various pieces wiring stuff first they do actually stand up on their own but we put the legs on just to sort of make it much less stable you don't know if the ground is going to be level where we're running it so there's just some butterfly volts on the top there which you can loosen and then the feet will sort of twist in so that it's easier to put in the car the setup process to get everything sort of in place and connected to the gas cylinder totally about half an hour but then we have a process that we need to go through to flush the connectors there's no air in there and that process protects another 1529 so i'll be an hour from sort of putting everything on the floor to actually having a fire happening obviously if you're doing it in public we also need to set up fencing so emf camp we had a whole bunch of pedestrian barriers which we sort of laid out in a perimeter around the flames and we try to have a five meter distance between any of the anything that can make fire and members of the public so that was quite a big perimeter so take a little while set those up but yeah it doesn't take too long to put together its they ain't gonna wait for dark if you're indoors it's horrifying when we were testing those in the hack space it was actually unsettling to be anywhere near them people would visually back away i think thousand volts per meter of gap if you're gonna get arcing so probably five six thousand volts which is amazing we put five volts in and thousand times that comes out it takes quite a few amps at 5 volts to actually empower them but one of the challenges was getting enough power to be each individual segment so we have quite beefy cables to be able to deliver that much power there are many ways in which fire phone can hurt you i think the sparklers are the bit that i'm the most frightened on i like the fire this was made by another nothing hack guy called jelly and he participates in the project by making these yeah the first one that we made has twice as big and you could barely lift it but these these are pretty great this is where participants were smacking it on the fencing that was in front of them got a bit enthusiastic when alcohol is involved yeah so it took a bit of a beating but they've they've held up pretty well it surprised you when you've been making this done everything yeah one of the challenges that we have was cooling of the lpg so inside of the tank the propane is a liquid and then as you let the gas out it boils inside the tank so you get a phase change and the liquid cools down really rapidly and you can actually see that on the tank that it starts to frost pretty quickly so here you can see that's kind of the level of the propane in the tank so we've got through about you know a third of a tank so far it's a problem because if the temperature drops too much then you get a drop in the amount of pressure you can produce so when it gets down to about numbers if it's minus 20 celsius then you get down to about one and a half bar which isn't enough to really drive the big perfective lee so when we were running at emf camp we actually had this submerged in a big vat of water and that just helped to keep it warm enough to keep the pressure up oh but it's amazing how quick this effect happens i mean like we have been running for a little while and you can see the frost on there but if you're running it hard this happens really rapidly and you get a drop in pressure so you know i think you're missing a trick this is that combined with barbara's we the drinks cold we did actually cool areas at emf camp in the big vat of water anything in the pipeline for next time we have some ideas but we don't know what yet depend depends on the site maybe more fire yeah fire is good you want to contact you about its project thanks base yep yeah we've got lots of details on the noshing hack wiki including pretty much a comprehensive list of all the parts that we used and how much it cost and where all the things from obviously don't encourage people to set themselves on fire remember rule zero and but yeah if people are interested you can find lots of information there and if you post a notting hack mailing list then you can you can get in contact with us that way we get is an incredibly weird picture of sort of weird hybrid baby things that kind of gives me nightmares you could argue in some ways we're getting an intuition about what the lower levels do and what the high levels do predominantly it's just for fun
