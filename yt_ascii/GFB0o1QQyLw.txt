amy asks what's your strategy to navigate openness the comments and criticism also handling negative and destructive feedback appropriately there's so much to say about this and my opinion thinking about it i think will change throughout my life as as it does for a lot of people as we learn how to navigate the internet and how to have as cheesy it is to say but healthy conversation civil discourse on the internet because there are several models of this there's a joe rogan model again i look up to joe in many ways in openness and genuineness and the purity of the way he does communication conversation with people the way just he is no matter how much money makes but his idea is that you shouldn't read any of the comments and for the most part he actually sticks to that here really does not read many comments except to get a certain large aggregate sense of where the community is for me i tend to still first of all not famous so i i it's not like i have a huge amount of inflow of comments but there's still so much to learn from the conversations and i've been fortunate and blessed for the most part to be surrounded by people who are kind and thoughtful and just you know everything the compassionate empathetic brilliant in ways i'm not even in disagreement especially in this agreement i love this agreement i mean that's one of the tragic things to me about the internet about certain types of discourse especially political discourse is how how little artful agreement there is i believe disagreement is an art it requires care it requires skill it requires compassion and respect that that one of the key underlying things to me behind passionate disagreement is a respect even a love for the other person and to me there's a line between disagreement with intent that doesn't deeply respect the other person with an intent that almost it's it's somewhere between apathy and derision and not even hatred because it's it's it's like a it's a it's a jealousy it's a dismissal it says the motivation that does not respect the other person in some way and almost dismisses the value of their significance in this universe and that kind of disagreement is something i dislike very much and i'm not open to and i would like to move on the internet move away from but at the same time disagreement and criticism and comments that are tense that create turmoil but have underlying deep respect and love those are beautiful not those aren't as often seen in on the internet unfortunately there are there more often seen in person and i think that's what i love as sort of the most heated again i say this over and over but i think it comes from the russian culture there's this heated debates heated conversations where sometimes you take in a viewpoint in person that you don't even believe like i play devil's advocate all the time especially in political discussions somebody says they're bernie sanders fan i will immediately become an anti-democratic socialist or if you're an andrew yang fan i will immediately become an anti ebi person in that conversation just to see just to bounce ideas you know to sort of take a certain on viewpoint to try it on for size and see and when there's underlying respect you get to play there's humor wit there's ultimately you arrive at something profound as a result now that's a dream for me and i've been trying to cultivate a community of that kind of discourse of underlying respect and love whether you're agree or disagree and that's my openness is grounded in the optimism that that's possible and the few criticisms or negativity that doesn't have that that's really grounded in mockery and a complete lack of respect that's it's that's just part of it that's sometimes you walk on a sidewalk and and i each step in dog poop this better be there's got to be a better example than that but anyway that's that's just life this like forrest gump says shit happens or hit the smiley whatever other forms like i don't know what's the what's the right term for it but busting each other's chops i mean that could be just a guy thing it could be an everybody thing but i love it you know you sort of make fun of each other you tease each other so my closest friends make fun of me all the time some of the closest people i know that that's that's how we show love i don't know is is you make fun of each other but you know a lot of people get confused you know you have to go you have to earn that you have to again this that love and respect if you just busting chops without having respect or a friendship or love then it turns into mockery and one of the fundamental problems of the internet is the mechanisms of social media rewards you for mockery whether you have the respect or not it's interesting because there's a humor to it that everybody can as an observer can appreciate well the people in the arena don't appreciate it when there's not an underlying respect and so that i very much see that line if respect is missing then you busting my chops are you disagreeing it's something that i have no patience for if there is an underlying respect and love and appreciation for each other as human beings then disagreement and busting chops is a beautiful thing so in general when i take criticism whether it's the harsh kind the disrespectful kind or the one that is grounded in respect i i kind of take it as a as any kind of pain in this in this world so i can give us stupid analogy i guess of just touching a hot stove i've recently did that that's why that's why it pops to mind and you kind of what i do is i observe it i've observed the criticism observed the moment of me touching the hot stove and i take a step outside myself it's like a third-person observer just sort of breathe and and take it in and really just kind of taking the full richness of that experience and the then once sort of the the pain of it settles the sort of the shock of it and it could be shocking when somebody criticizes you is you you see what is the lesson i can learn from this that's fundamentally the what you know strip away the meanness the mockery whatever that might be there or if it's respectful disagreement the the the biting fact that somebody disagrees and just see what's the insight here that i can take away what's the lesson i can learn that i can grow from so i'm touching the hot stove the reason i got burnt is i was checking if it's hot if it's working because it what didn't look like it was working and so i guess the lesson i can learn from that is that you don't have to actually touch the stove to figure out that it's working you can just hover your hand above it and you can sense the heat right that okay perhaps a stupid analogy but it's a it's a lesson i can learn moving forward i can do better next time a girl from criticism the same thing i mean there's a lot of people that criticize little things about the way i communicate i really put myself out there i make myself fragile i make myself vulnerable to criticism and you know you say things like i'm too philosophical or i get to in the weeds about something without covering some other fundamental part if we're having a conversation or i have a monotone voice not enough emotion not enough personality all those kinds of things that have an inkling of truth to them some some things i can't really help some things that can work on it might be a long-term thing as people say i mumble i need to articulate better that's something i'm cognizant of and i try to work on some people say i don't make enough eye contact all those kinds of things i mean there's truth in them even if they come with meanness some people say i ask too many stupid questions you know and like you take personally you think about that is there some deep insight there there is useful and like the stupid question one i can i can now the the processes i empathize where did that person's criticism come from what is the worldview from which they come to that criticism because for me when in conversation for example when somebody says that it came off i asked a stupid question i came off a stupider or i got outclassed in conversation to me that means that was a success because my role in these conversations my goal is to be staff no ego to let the other person shine and asking the simplest possible question almost naive kinds of questions get to the fundamental core of ideas that i think could could potentially be beautiful if the other if the other person comes there and is willing to accept the dance of the sort of the the silly russian asking the silly question accept the chance to answer that silly question was something beautiful and profound i think that's the goal and yeah from your perspective that might come off if not done well or if the other person doesn't accept the dance it can come off as as i'm asking really dumb questions that have no useful no no use in conversation if it's really successful and done beautifully and you know some of that is luck and then it works out and nobody notices it and then it's it's nobody notices how dumb the question was and in terms of being outclassed i got so many comments that like jim keller really for example somebody i deeply admire and a brilliant guy totally outclassed me in conversation to me that's the success i this isn't a competition to me to me it's it's a way to let jim's ideas shine i did want to push back enough but that's the beauty of it i want to push back and disagree so that at least does something productive and ultimately they can shine or something profound i don't want to articulate my disagreement to a point where it becomes awkward and and too tense and so on you know just like in dancing i love for example i get so much shit for saying sent a woman is a good movie but i do like at the tango i do like certain types of dances tango is probably my favorite and you know there's a lead and there's a follow and that's in in that's true and dance that's i think during conversation those can switch of course in conversation but there's an art to it and the people to criticize certain aspects of that have a lot of kernels of truth that i pick on and i pick pick from and learn from and so it's a gift i see it as a beautiful gift but it burns so especially if it lacks the respect if it has those elements of mockery and derision like i mentioned one of the things i do sort of next after i think about the lesson is i kind of imagining imagine them in my head and i send sort of love to them i forgive them it sounds silly not that they asked for my forgiveness but in my mind i kind of i forgive the roughness of their message and i also kinda also like to imagine meeting them in person and shaking their hand and sort of having a laugh about something silly you know as i think i kind of imagine or i have an optimistic view of it that a lot of is just miscommunication or perhaps my misinterpretation of where they were coming from but in person a lot of those things fade away and you just focus you know you don't sweat the small stuff and and it's all small stuff right you just kind of laugh at the you become quick friends i think that's the optimist that i have about most interactions on the internet is that if you actually met in person you get along just great and on social media if there is disrespect i do at least at this time if i see that there's not an underlying respect and love and appreciation for each other i reach my hand out i try to patch it up but if that doesn't work i usually sort of whatever the mechanism social media provides of blocking of muting of limiting some how i do it and it's again not because of some kind of anger and any kind of negative ill feeling it's just about that i don't see the mecca that medium doesn't seem to be one where we would be able to find a mutual respect or one of us wouldn't be able to find a respect so i'll reach out my hand but if you get slapped down i'll you know block mute whatever the mechanism allows and then just wait until a meet in person and maybe then instead of a handshake i'll go straight in for the hug so i think i think even with the roughest interactions if we met a person it would go along great and i just then don't see social media is a great place for it but again i first taken whatever the commentary they make and try to find the the insight in it and after that you know it you can burn it can burn and i just forget it put it behind me and to go on with a smile again forgive them send love them their way and then move on after the lesson has been learned that's my approach to critic that's my general approach to criticism and and overall i've been so fortunate to have so much positive feedback and interesting profound conversations i was challenged in a lot of interesting ways i've been shown to be wrong and a lot of interesting ways from people that you know sandwich that all in in a lot of respect and admiration and mutual admiration so i've been really fortunate so for the most part it's been a lot of positive energy and i appreciate that and i think i mean i sometimes i feel like i'm the luckiest guy in the world so all i can do is read comments and read a little bit of criticism there is learned from a girl from it and continued being part of this community so this is kind of a new ama a thing i tried to do a longer response i'm trying to see if the five minutes is better one minute is better 20 minutes is better if it's better than i just shut up and don't do these so i don't know but again amy thank you so much that's a great question i think like all of us i will continue to evolve in the way i take in feedback it's possible eventually i'll commercial was the joe rogan model but for now my heart my mind my eyes are open to criticism on the internet my justin in person thanks for the great question you
