- i'm sensing something,
it's coming quickly. there's an item on the
way from "mystery tech". i can feel it, it's gonna
come out of the table. i caught it. levitating bluetooth speaker. you got me a ufo speaker? - [matt] yes. - all right, i'm down. - [matt] woo. - so we've got the actual speaker itself, which looks very unidentifiable. - [ken] (laughs) it does
actually look like a ufo. - whoa, oh.
- [matt] oh. - that's kind of cool.
- okay. i don't think i did that right. - [matt] that's not how you do... - all right, maybe i should
read the instructions. so i need to hold it slightly above, move it vertically and
then release it, okay. so i'm gonna carefully position this. well, it's leveling, it's
almost like zero gravity. oh no, no, no, stay in the middle, stay in the middle. stay, stay. stay. stay! - i guarantee you i will get it first try. - go ahead. - just gotta find the point. (speaker clunks)
(austin and ken laughing) never mind, i lied. - all right, watch, matt's actually gonna do it first try. i believe in matt. - [ken] how many overclock
employees does it take to put? - we don't have enough. (speaker clunks) - okay.
- we're already overheated. - hold, hold, hold, hold on, okay, okay. plan b, plan b, plan b, plan b. - [matt] okay, it's floating. - yeah, we did it. - edit team, you can composite
this in after effects? (speaker whirring) that was not a fun. - did you make that noise? - no, that was not a fun sound. - it's overheating. okay.
- woo, woo. oh, oh, oh, wait, wait. oh, that was it. here, here, here, here, ready, you ready? - yeah. oh. - let's go. oh, it's vibrating. (spooky music) - is this video sponsored by the aliens? - [ken] how that's what you went to, the only thing that goes
through austin's mind is, "what's the sponsor for this video?" and after meeting austin
they immediately said, "there's no intelligent
life on this planet." (austin laughing) - [ken] dibs. i didn't even get it out the box yet, you can't call dibs. the ficihp k2, multifunctional touch keyboard. what the ficihp is this? - [matt] oh, that's a chunky.
- okay. this feels nice. you know what this reminds me of? are the asus laptops that have the screen.
- [ken] oh, you're right. - with a ergo lift and whatnot. - [ken] yeah, but this
has a real keyboard on it. - it does, yeah, obviously that's a full
mechanical keyboard. although that feels like a
$30.00 mechanical keyboard. theoretically, if i plug
this single usb-c cable into a device that has full
usb-c with power delivery, and displayport, and everything it will power my display and
my keyboard all over one cable. - [matt] oh. - [austin] immediately
the ficihp shows up. - [ken] i just kind of wish that the screen would tilt up more. - it doesn't, yeah, yeah, yeah. and it's also not a touchscreen. oh, it is a touchscreen. - [ken] it is a touchscreen.
- oh. - [ken] yeah, that i remember seeing. (keyboard clicking) - [ken] yep, those are blues. - for $400.00 i would
expect a nicer keyboard. the keyboard itself very
much feels like a $50, generic blue special that
you can get on amazon. - [ken] one last thing
that i want to check. - yeah? to make sure they're actually blues? - well, no, not so much that. - [matt] if they're hot swappable. - if they're hot swappable. - oh, interesting. - [matt] you can hot swap. - oh, it's still expensive. the fact that it's hot swappable though actually kind of interesting. i'm not gonna pitch another denki video but ken, you should make
a denki video on this. - i will, i'm gonna make a video. - make the ultimate version of this. - the weirdest keyboards i could find. - all right. don't subscribe to denki,
subscribe to this is. is c cam focused? - [ken and matt] yes. - are you sure?
- [ken] yes. - can people see me in 4k? - [jared] i wish they couldn't. - okay. i just double check. what the? hover pen, hover pen 2.0:
interstellar edition, meteorite embedded version,' karat gold plated ball
point pen, starlight silver. those were some expensive words. ooh. oh my goodness, wow. ken knows me, ken knows
that this is the kind of that appeals to me. i'm assuming this little thing in the end is a chunk of meteorite. (austin sniffing) - [ken] what does it smell like? - it doesn't smell like space. - [ken] how do you know
what space smells like? - and then i've got a little stand for it. so do i? okay, this is... this is a complicated
three-dimensional shape. all right. so... oh my gosh, okay. - [ken] no, no.
- [matt] you people have too much money. (mellow music) there you go. oh, yo, okay that's cool. that's pretty cool. if i were a hovering meteorite
pen how much would i cost? $169.95. - [ken] you know what the funny thing is? is that it's actually cheaper than that. - okay. - it's a $100.00 for the base model. (glass shattering) - is this the point where you tell me that this is not the base model? - [ken] yes, the meteorite version costs $400.00. - you know i'm all for mystery tech, this is not the way i usually start an episode of "mystery tech". but you know what? i'm out here for it. - [jared] it's only 11 o'clock a.m. - it's five o'clock somewhere jared jared.
- [jared] whoa. - you almost hit the heineken. my friends, this is a momentous
occasion on "mystery tech", because we have a very special sponsor. heineken have created a brand new product, they have given me early
exclusive access to. this my friends is the closer. now, it might look to an ordinary civilian like a bottle opener. but oh no, it is so much more. i'm gonna start working
on my monthly report, (sighs) look at all this nonsense. ken you've spent so much
money on "mystery tech", do you see these numbers? they're going up not down, that's bad. it's five o'clock it's time to unwind, and experience what the
closer has to offer. (laughs) it actually worked. my computer's asleep. the way the closer works is
actually really interesting. there's no actual physical
thing that's happening here, instead when you actually have it connect with the bottle cap, it completes the circuit which
therefore sends the signal. yeah, see, it's asking if you
wanna shut your computer off, obviously i don't wanna do that 'cause i'm not gonna touch it again. well, cheers to not
working past five o'clock, 'cause that's unhealthy and you should work on
your work-life balance. enjoy the beer every once in a while. yo, did you see that? did you see that? did everyone see that? can we get a slow motion
replay of that one? this is the shadowcast
console laptop link. is this like reverse hdmi? a capture card to get your game console to show up on your laptop display. - [matt] yes. - wow, that is very small. it's literally hdmi on one
side, usb-c on the other. - [ken] who needs xcloud
when you have xwired. (austin laughing) - okay, you got me on that one. i'll say when you have
it in favor performance the quality looks like 480p, favoring resolution looks a lot nicer. (computer chiming) got it. all right, let's see. oh wow, that immediately feels bad. (car whirring) there's definitely
several frames of latency. obviously we're watching this at 24 frames on the preview, but no, i'm getting like 20 fps right now. - [ken] ooh. - yeah, i'll switched to
favor performance, all right? and i'll see how that goes. oh, there's still latency. you're using obs, really? - [ken] mm-hmm. - [austin] is obs gonna be better. - [ken] so what i'm gonna do
is i'm gonna add the genki as a video capture source. just try that out. latency seems a little bit better, performance seems to be about the same where i do feel like i'm dropping frames. this is actually not even as performant as a lot of cloud gaming. all of those feel better than this. it's a cool idea, but i think the premise
is a little bit flawed. for some games if you don't care about that really quick response
time, this is probably fine. but the fundamental
limits of the technology mean that even in the best case scenario you're only gonna have
so much performance. it's certainly not gonna be as good as plugging an hdmi cable into a display. - [ken] so that's a... - that's an l you could say. - [ken] that's an l. - what do we got from
"mystery tech" today? a playdate. ooh, okay. so if you're not familiar
the playdate is a tiny, little, i would almost
say game boy-like console, but it doesn't play emulated
games or anything like that. it actually plays its own specific titles. now this is made by panic
who have traditionally been more of a game developer, but this is the first time i believe they've actually gotten into hardware. - [ken] my favorite band. - panic at the disco?
- [ken] yes. [music] i chime in with a haven't
you people ever heard of [music] [music] closing the goddam door, oh [music] - [jared] well, at least we
don't worry about copyright. (austin laughing) ooh. okay, all right. what lovely packaging. have fun, i think i will. first thoughts, this
hardware feels incredible. so it's plastic, right? but it's like that sort of higher quality, almost grippy kind of plastic. and you've got the little
spinney dial thing, which is not the way to charge it. but it's actually the
way that you can actually interact in some games. - [ken] if that was the only
way to charge it i'd be... - hang on, i gotta play mom. i gotta charge it for one more minute. compared to an original dmg, it is obviously a lot smaller, but it's a much sort
of wider aspect ratio. - [ken] 16:9. - (sniffs) it smells very
slightly like plastic if i really get you get in
there and just (sniffs). - [ken] okay, well... - [matt] okay, it's not a pile of (beep). oh, here we go. oh, that's sweet. that's so cool. (console playing music) - i love the haptic sounds. (console playing music) the thing that jumps out
to me most about the screen is the fact that it's not backlit. we're in a studio environment right now, so we have a lot of lights,
which makes it really easy. i think this could get annoying if you are not in a well lit environment. i have two games built in right now, although it will download
more every seven days. all right, crank to turn, okay. gnarly bro. woo. oh, unawesome. all right, i'm start
to get the idea though. it was really just the crank, and i just move left and right. - [ken] yeah buddy.
- yeah boy, let's go. let's go, rad bro, let's go. let's go. the playdate is super weird, right? it's one of these things
that is incredibly quirky, you might play it for a few
hours never touch it again, it's totally possible. but this is fun, these
games are totally unique, and while you're probably
not gonna waste 10 hours and play through a campaign on something, it's not that kind of game. but the fact that you're getting games constantly updated to this. it also is apparently easy
for you to actually develop, i'm assuming that third
parties are gonna be making playdate stuff. while i love something
like the analogue pocket, that's just a better way to play games that i've played for decades. this is something which is all new, not only with the actual input method, but the kinds of games
and the actual hardware. it's like nothing like
you've ever played before. - [ken] it's a shame that austin's never gonna touch it again
'cause there's no pokemon on it. - no, you know what i'm gonna do? - [ken] what? - i'm gonna take it all
the way over to this is, and make an entire video. check it out, subscribe to this is. - [ken] what's better than a good life? - a great life. - [ken] a serene life. - ken looks really excited right now, that's never a good sign. - [matt] 'cause you know he's
gonna take this immediately. - no, i have no room for this.
- look at ken's face. look how excited he is
right now about this. - [matt] i have no room for
the thing i'm about to steal. - what is this? so i've got a nice foam mat. - [matt] i'm matt. - [ken] yeah, matt's over there. - am i building a tent, is a warming tent, an incubation pod? do i grow (censored) in this? this is a deluxe personal
therapy detox heated home sauna. how much was this? there better not be four digits in what you're about to say. - there's five digits. - including the cents? - [ken] yes.
- $342.53. - okay. - [matt] so just go ahead and sit down, sit right in. - i feel like i have a lot
of clothes on for a sauna, i'm gonna get really sweaty. - [matt] we don't want you
to take your clothes off. we're gonna go ahead and zip you in here. - okay. - you feeling good? - i feel like i'm in a quarantine unit. - [matt] all right, turn on the oven. - oh my god, why is it red? why is it red? i don't know like the
fact that it's wiggling. - [ken] it's wiggling? what? - matt is over here wiggling it right now. - [ken] matt's literally
right over here dude. - it is now up to 82 degrees. i don't believe that, i think it's a lot warmer
than 82 degrees in here. - [ken] celsius. - then i'm dead. (group laughing) - [ken] you can just
flat out see the sauna compared to everything else. the ambient room temperature
is 27 degrees celsius, how hot is this thing right now? - [matt] 86 degrees celsius,
by the way, on the panels. - these panels are not
something i want to touch, even having my hands in front of it, it feels like my hands are in
front of the oven right now. this is proper toasty. i gotta say, this is one of
the few "mystery tech" items that has legitimately surprised me in a really, really positive way. it looks dumb, it's such a weird idea, but for a pretty reasonable
price this is a real sauna. i am proper, i don't know if you can tell, but i'm proper sweating,
which makes sense. i am super happy with this right now. this is great. - [ken] so if you're super happy with it we can keep you in there, right? - no. - so you guys wanna go? - let's go, let's go. - [jared] have a good one austin. - don't leave me. - oh, camera are you gonna come too? joanna, come on. yeah, yeah. - [ken] bye austin, bye, goodbye. - i'm all alone, they've left me.
