- we're gonna give her 15
seconds on a stopwatch, every time she blinks
is a thousand dollars. starting now. - easy rock.
- all right, let's see this. oh, she she's looking down. we can't see if she blinks
if she's looking down. - oh, no.
- no, no. - if. - that's one. - i didn't see one. - thought i saw one. she closed her eyes.
- yeah, right there. two. she got two. all right, it's been 15 seconds. i saw two blinks, what'd you see? - i'd say two blinks is fair. - yeah, honestly, i feel bad. i thought she was gonna blink more. all right, two blinks it is. you blinked twice. hey, wow, that was fast. [music] so i can stand on mountains [music] i this, my.
- oh my god! no, no, no. no.
- look at her. now she's not blinking.
- no. - dude, she's crying now. look at her eyes, you're
watering her eyes. you're keeping them. - good, this is why we do this. tears are good for the eyes. i'm glad she's happy, i guess. - that's happy tears. - i know, right? that's good, happy tears
are good for the eyes, boys. i'm not good with emotion like this. see what we're doing
right now is very healthy for our eyes, guys. - god, are you serious? - yeah, you just, we just had to take care of your eyes, you know, normal thing. dude, look at her eyes,
they look so much better. - very well hydrated. - i'm glad we did this. - [electronic voice] i'm off
to help more twitch streamers, remember to keep blinking. - we're gonna do it a
little different this time, this time we're gonna do
a hundred dollars a blink, but we're gonna do it for a full minute. right here, as you can see, boom. starting now. - one. two.
- yeah, i was watching. i was watching how brian. - three. - was playing at honor. - four.
- and i'm still watching. - five. - i didn't see one. - i did. - six.
- game play and his game. - seven. - that is so cool, it's okay. - eight. - i'll just mute his. - nine. - 10.
- 10. - 11. - 11. she's in the zone right now.
- 12. - 12. time is up, one minute. so she did 12 blinks in a minute at a hundred dollars a
blink, that's $1,200. congratulations, sky. congrats on blinking 12 times. keep your eyes hydrated. - what was this donation? mr. beast? what? - oh, i saw your eyes
were a little dehydrated, so i was like, i gotta remind
her to blink, you know. - guys is this for real? wait, mr. beast, congrats
on blinking 12 times, keep your eyes hydrated, what? no way. what is this eye blinking thing? what? - it's quite simple. american. well, actually she's not american. humans don't blink as much when they're staring at a screen and i just wanna raise awareness and so i thought i'd give you some money to help alert the world
that they need to blink. we're basically wannabe
pewdiepies at this point. - yeah, pretty much. that's why we gave her money. - yeah, i know right? - no, way, i don't buy it. i don't buy it. - oh, she said she didn't buy it. - bull. believe i'm real. don't make me throw more money. - i actually started to feel that, yeah, my eyes are like dry. i feel like i need to blink more. - boom. - that's what we're talking about. she acknowledged her eyes were dry, like my conclusion was and
she's going to blink more. that is a success. i think we move on. so my camera died, not
quite sure what she said, we were fixing that, but i do remember she
didn't think i was real when we left off. and normally i wouldn't care, but this is the queen
of the pewdiepie army. so we gotta make sure she
knows who we are, right, chris? - exactly.
- my 10 year old army might go to war with her
nine year old army one day. should i just be like, blink. - pewdiepie army. - that's sounded really demanding, why'd i just say blink? - what?
- all right, let's, i'll just do another one. - who is faking this, hmm? - hmm. - hmm. - hmm. - it's not the real mr. beast, he never stops at 1k, really? - oh, okay. no, no, that's bait. doesn't stop at 1k my. you'd be damn straight i don't. damn straight. i'm falling for the bait. hey, she see.
- what the. - she said like. - what?
- he doesn't stop at 1k, i was. you know, i was like,
damn straight we don't. - damn straight. - i was backed into a corner,
what do i do, ignore that? - what are you supposed
to not be mr. beast? - dude, if that's real.
- i know. - my night.
- she doesn't believe you, at all. - all right, i'm about
to tweet out her stream so now she should know it's real and then she won't be sad and then we can move on. geez, i think this is the most time we've ever spent on one streamer. - yep.
- i just don't want her to be sad. - oh, look at her. - okay, now she's happy. that was way too stressful. why is giving away money so hard? this guy's got a really nice edit going- - i'm impressed.
- with him in the battle bus. i really like what he's got
going on with his effects, let's reward him. there's a couple days
left in that giveaway i mentioned in the video earlier, where i'm giving five people
who follow my instagram a hundred dollar amazon gift card, so you should go follow
it if you want a chance to win some free money. just mr. beast and, i post
some funny stuff over there, but regardless, he has one minute, every blink's a hundred
bucks starting now. we'll do one. we'll do two, even though i
haven't seen him blink really. - what's that reason?
- three. - four. i counted four blinks, i don't know, i couldn't really tell sometimes, but. you blinked four times. take care of your eyes, mate. - what the hell? - just, you know. eye care, very important,
man, make sure you do it. - did you just drop $400? - yeah, man. you blinked four times. - who is mrbeast6000? i just got chills through my whole body and i got tears in my eyes, my friend. - good, we're doing this
to keep the eyes hydrated. - oh my gosh, thank you. - hey, i like him. - thank you, man. i don't know what else to say, i'm getting a little emotional,
but thank you for that. - no prob, dude.
- it means a lot. - got ya, fam squad. i know you're gonna watch this video, just make sure you blink
lots and stay hydrated. when you're 70 years old, you don't wanna lose your eyesight. and i really hope you take
care of your eyes, fan. - [music] hallelujah [music] - chris, you can sing like this, right? - oh yeah, definitely.

that when she was singing. - she sounds like a disney character. - i know, right? - mrbeast6000, 1001. wait, is that. is that. is that for real? - we want another song. - hell yeah.
- another song, another song. - oh, my goodness gracious me. - we want another song, please. - i don't even know
what to say, mr. beast. all the, all the. all the blood feels
like it's left my head. mr. beast, i will play you
another song, absolutely. oh, god.
- see, all it takes is $1,500 and you get an encore.
- that is just so kind of you. - [music] for you go [music] - beautiful, amazing, exquisite. - [music] for you go [music]
- all right, all right. - boom, just started the stopwatch. - one. two. three. - oh.
- four. five.
- the guy don't blink enough. - how my name.
- six. - seven. - eight. nine. - 10. 11. - 12. 13, we'll count it. 14. 15. - all right, that's time. it's been a minute. you actually did a good job blinking, but i want to make sure your
30 viewers know to blink. - just say your viewers,
don't say 30 viewers. if you put a number in it-
- yes. - it makes it mean. - that's not mean, he has 30 viewers. i'm not saying it in condescending. - no way. - we need to recognize that he could have been beat
banned for cheating or kicked for cheating. - oh, as we donated, yeah. no one gets donation from
beast while cheating. - yo, how do you check? how do you check if that was. - it is real. it's been a month since
we did one of these, because i don't like
to redo the same thing. like, gotta keep it fresh, boys. - oh yeah.
- even though i see like 10,000 comments a day, like donate to more twitch streamers. - dude, thank you. thank you, man. - oh, she's listening to witt lowry. i love witt lowry, all right. she gets $150 a blink because i like witt lowry. timer starts now. - is it back down.
- one. - can you get up there?
- two. - three. four. five. six. - seven, that was a blink. - eight. - three, two, one. time. that is one minute, exactly. so that's $1,200. - freaking.
- what the dude? is that the real mr. beast, dude? - hey. - is that the real mr. beast? does anyone know? - see here comes the tears. - hell yeah. - good for the eyes, yes. dude, you're hydrating her
eyes, hella hard right now. look at that. - you know, mr. beast, i
don't have a fucking pc dude, and you just.
- you don't want people to play on ps4, that's
really bad for their eyes. - dude, that's a good point,
they're horrible for eyes. we're doing god's work here. - oh yeah, definitely. - we should do, what if
we did donating $10,000 to random people on tinder. and i matched with them and i'm like, thanks for matching with me, here's a thousand dollar gift card. - you blinked eight times,
which is less than 10, which means you need to blink
more, it's good for your eyes. exactly. - well, he has 15,000 twitch followers. - it's almost like his presence is on youtube or something. - i know, right? you guys should all go follow my twitch 'cause they always don't think i'm real because i don't have a
lot of twitch followers. my twitch will be linked in description, go follow it so people think i'm real. - that is wild. - do they think i don't
stay after i donate, like. - yeah.
- she's like that was wild, i can't believe he did that. i'm still here. next to step in the arena
is this woman right here, it is time for us to harass her eyeballs. and the second she looks up. all right, we're starting now. one. - two. - three, four. five. six, chill out. she's good at staring at us. - this feels weird.
- seven. eight. nine, jesus woman, calm down. 10, 11, 12, 13. what the fuck? - 14, 15. - 16, 17. - what's wrong with her eyes,'. why is she blinking so much? - 19, 20. - i don't know. - 21.
- 21. - 22, time's up. 23? - 23. - wow, she really takes
care of her eyeballs. does she have like stuff in here? did she know we were doing that? - she instantly started blinking a lot- - i know.
- like she knew we were recording.
- it's almost like she could hear us or something, i don't know. she did like two times
more than everyone else, that's actually pretty crazy. long story short, i only
have $1,885 and 17 cents left in my paypal. i didn't realize how much i've given away. and for some reason, this
woman just went nuts blinking, so only'.85 of her blinks
will be accounted for, everyone say sorry to
her other five blinks she's not getting paid for. sorry for not paying for all the blinks, i ran out of money and
hope you understand. - wait, what? - oh, hey, she saw it. - i got an insane donation, but it's not gonna pop up here. no, like i got an insane donation. like it must be fake. okay, i'm maybe so wrong, but i saw like way too many numbers there. - way too many. - did someone donate, if you write the amount
in chat, i will see if it. - write in chat. - it's not gonna pop up. - here, i'll write it in chat. - no, it was. - why is she lagging, no. what happened to her stream? - you broke it. - what happened to her stream? - you gave her so much
money, she broke it. - you can't make this up. we literally donated to her, her stream disappeared. - this is a nice black screen, though. - i know, right? honestly, this is kind
of the content i wanted. - you can put anything right there. look, there's a dinosaur running across the screen right now. - now it's pewdiepie. - i will fight you, bring it on. - am i back?
- oh, she's back. - i got a donation on $1,800. - i don't think that's the
face you're supposed to make. - i don't know, someone's pranking me. - nah, nah, fam. - maybe it's mr. beast,
he donates all the time. - hey, shout out to that guy. - that guy knows. - no, but i can't see the nickname because of, i'm streaming on my phone, so i only saw the paypal notification. - that's funny. they didn't even know it was my name, and he was like, maybe it's mr. beast. shout out to that dude. - okay, stream, we're
doing youtube content now. - oh my god, what are you doing? - hey content. - yeah.
- youtube content. - what the.
- what the fu. - i love that, i love that guy. - okay, he knows how to make content for my blog, for sure.
- yes, contenting. - no, it's for our video. - yeah, i want her to point the camera back at that guy. he's an og, he's just dumped
a monster on his head. - he's in chat. - yeah he's in.
- really? - yeah, look. - was it mr. beast?
- he talked in chat. - i am right.
- what, no. - mr. beast, did i call it? - so, is it legit?
- he talked in chat. i called it. i called it. - hello, youtube.
- was it mr. beast? - that guy knew it was me and he dumped a monster on his head. shout out to that guy. - called it.
- thank you. - you did call it, i love you. - he's gonna donate more, i promise. - no, more? - yeah, you want me to donate more? here, let me refresh my paypal for you. it's literally zero. there's nothing more to donate. - have you seen his
youtube channel, mr. beast? - no, i haven't seen. - you should watch it sometime 'cause he's a fucking, he's a beast. which sponsor is today, is it quidd today as well? - do you watch every video or something? - yeah, his videos are really funny, man. - his videos get like 10 million views. - yeah.
- what? - yeah.
- yeah. - no.
- yes. - they used to, yeah. give me content, please. - give me content, please. - i like the blonde guy.
- boring. - more monster dumping. - i like the blonde guy,
more monster dumping. he likes you. yeah, look at him though. he looks like. - ninja.
- soda and ninja got a baby.
- yes. - yeah, he does. - all i know is i ship
it, do you ship it, chris? - i ship i. - i ship it. - they should probably get married. - yeah, i ship it. boys watching this video, go to her stream and make
sure she knows you ship it. he's good content, he's good
for your stream, we ship it. and now that we're done matchmaking, if you're not already, make sure you subscribe because if you don't subscribe, you might miss out on the
black screens in the future. and that's like the peak
of content on youtube. i don't know if pewdiepie's done this, but hopefully he hasn't. - oh, i am so shocked and sad. i can't believe someone would do this. leave a like if you are depressed. [music] mister beast, oh [music] [music] mister beast, oh [music] [music] mister beast, oh [music]
