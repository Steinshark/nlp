hello and welcome to some gaming tech tips that linus won't tell you do you have a dual shock for have you baby been playing some playstation lately well if you've had any issues there's a secret way to reset your controller there so there are a few reasons why you may need to reset your dualshock for if you are having any latency issues you're having any stick drift if your light bar isn't reacting correctly or simply if you've just connected your dual shock board of several devices sometimes the controller can get a little bit confused however there's a very simple way to fix it which is to factory reset the controller so if you look on the back of the controller right beside this little screw there's a tiny little button now if you have a little sim tool obviously you can use pre much anything here tends maybe not quite so much but if you have a little simple like this all you do is press and hold this button and it will factory to reset the dualshock for before resetting your controller however make sure to go over to your playstation and turn it off don't put it in to rest move it actually legitimately turn it off and then you will also want just for a safe measure to fully unplug the playstation once that is ready so with a playstation powered off and unplugged we're going to now press this little button for 10 seconds okay and now you just grab a usb cable plug it into the playstation and plug it all back in and theoretically we will then be reset alright so i'm gonna hit the playstation button and it immediately syncs up what a helpful tech tip i just didn't even know that button existed so i thought this one was cool i'm gonna be real i actually really liked kinect when it first came out on the xbox because i could use my voice to tell it to turn on and play and open different apps while sadly kinect is no longer with us you actually can replicate almost this exact same thing using either the google assistant or amazon echo so it just so happens that there actually is a little button to do this from my dashboard let me show you if you don't have that one so just jump over into your settings and then inside the devices and streaming you'll see a digital assistance all you do is enable this and then you need to go over to the app either using amazon or google so for this i'm taking advantage of google home although if you are using the amazon echo you can do the same thing using the alexa app so here i have google home connected and it doesn't see my device okay so my problem was that i was controlling the xbox at my house therefore making it turn on and off while i was here the office so hmm let's try this again okay open youtube on the office xbox hey look at that it's almost like i have connect our good buddy back from the day let's watch fortnight videos yes let's watch a fortnight video hey pause the office xbox okay thanks a second it's not so bad hey turn off the office xbox the nice thing here is that you can very easily use whatever visual assistant you already have to give you some decent level of voice commands i played a fortnight video that's not hip with the kids i don't know what else is you know it's also hip with the kids keeping yourself protected online with private internet access to sponsor today's video now obviously with the world being as it is right now we're all spending a lot more time at home and i feel like it really does make sense to make sure that your online browsing is safe and secure and that is exactly what private internet access provides this is a vpn service which will protect all aspects of your online life so if you are web browsing if you are using video calls whatever the case is you can feel safe and secure that is being encrypted and it is not being snooped on by your isp not only has it been recommended by the illustrious linus from - tech tips which is really the recommendation i need but personally i find vpns to be incredibly helpful so if you guys want to know more about piaa specifically you can get even a discount code check out the link in the description in qgx pih for now and sponsoring this video we're keeping our internet safe and secure but for this next one also net me out here because i actually dabble in a lot of japanese stuff and so i have japanese accounts on my phone and whatnot but whenever i want to play japanese games the switch is actually really handy because it is region free now of course i'm not always going to get physical' carts in japanese but you can actually have a japanese each shop account now the first step for this is to use an email that you haven't used already for a nintendo account and then what you're gonna want to do is set up a new user on your switch so i'm going to add a user we're gonna call it in this case since i'm gonna add a japanese account i'm gonna call it just ken jp and then it will ask you to link a nintendo account now a key step for this is when you're making the nintendo account on your smartphone or pc you're gonna want to set your country / region to the country that you want your store to be in so in this case i want it to be japan and of course it'll set your time zone and whatnot i'm just going to have not send me random emails but i will agree to the terms of service and just like that we are good to go oh look at this so we just restarted our switch and we're actually getting all of our headlines in japanese now so we know that that actually worked oh it's doing some weird things that's not happy oh there we go young goa cardema sense so i don't know well we'll just oh okay this is actually my personal password zone all right and look japanese eshop everything's in yen that's oh and it shuts off we're having some monetary issues but i can show you here on the switch that all of the prices are in japanese yen so we know that it works i don't know what's happening with our monitor but the upside is now i have the japanese key shop on the switch and i can go buy joysound and do karaoke in the comfort of my own home now because i've never done this before i actually had to look up wither you can buy stuff from the japanese shop using an american credit card it can be tricky it's hit or miss paypal i'd be a little bit better but odds are you might have to rely on third-party outlets to get a shop codes that will work with the japanese shop though the cool thing about joysound is that you pay by day it is actually like a karaoke booth in the comfort of your own home yeah it's like three dollars a day or something like that it's nothing crazy it's actually cheaper than doing karaoke in person so everyone's probably familiar with find my phone or finds my ear pods or find my computer or what have you but do you know that there's also a fine to my joy khan feature so say you're like canon you lose your very expensive limited-edition animal crossing' joy khan if you be so kind well while my assistant matt is going to go hide it there's a little function inside the switch where you can try to find it so i open up the can you just press something you realize wait how do i back out now that it helped that they're wireless so on your switch you can actually open up the controller menu you have to tap it twice and you can tap on find controllers so you can see that this the right one is not connected so if i tap on the l or r button i don't you can hear that but it is vibrating so now ah excellent i found it that is the sound of our lost joy kaan so it's a really simple feature it's built right into the switch but if you ever lose a joy kaan which you shouldn't because what are you doing it's a very handy way to find it although if you actually what happens if you lose both joy kahn's do this can i sorry for throwing your joy constant i just do it straight from the console oh i can yeah it's funny because the joy calls don't have speakers the only thing they can do is vibrate but especially if you have it like kind of stuck in like some corner of the couch whatever it actually surprisingly loud of course i have a microphone on right now so you might not be able to hear it too well but if you're in the same room as the joy cons you'll probably be able to spot them or hear them this next one is simple but super useful so if you're playing the switch you might have a nintendo online you might be trying to add someone i like animal crossing or something you're probably familiar with the friend codes they work but they're also super old-school so actually a couple of ways to do it a little bit faster so you go to your little page menu there are a couple of ways that you can add friends now where the really easy ones is to link your facebook or your twitter account now it's up to you if you want to add all of your facebook friends to your switch i particularly do not want to do that but there's also one other way if you are nearby so you go down to the add friend menu there's a search for local user now this one i will admit can be a little bit finicky but you can see if you tap the same symbol as someone else and you are in the same area as them you will instantly be able to add them as a friend now if you regularly use the switch you're probably familiar with my nintendo rewards which is a helpful little program that will allow you to earn little bits of credit which you can put toward buying games or even getting something like say switch online for free or at a discount now if you ever buy a digital game you automatically get these go over if you have a physical game you can also earn those rewards so this is super super simple so go ahead just press the plus button on a physical game card that you have plugged in and on the bottom you'll see my nintendo reward all you do is hit earn points that's pretty much it you should got yourself some free like three days of nintendo online or music wait that's it extra c yeah so i just got sixty nintendo points that super simple if you have a bunch of physical switch games you should absolutely do this the only real caveat is that you can only earn these points for a year after the initial release so you'd have older games this may not work but if you have any games that have come out in the last year in physical cart form get yourself some points why not these are types of the card it i feel like i've never tried it i think it is actually tied to the card so you can't just go like rent a game and like put a bunch of the men so you just use my car this next tip is actually really cool until this video actually didn't even know it existed so if you have like maybe a little sibling or someone who likes to play xbox but maybe you can't quite hang with the game there's an option called copilot to enable this just open up the settings go down to ease of access controller and then copilot settings now from here you can enable copilot and what this will do if i grab the second controller is we can allow each controller to override each other so say little timmy can be playing fortnight and he knows how to like press the trigger but you're the one who's actually moving it around a little timmy here's your controller are we going online timmy stop pressing buttons on the controller i'm trying to show everyone how to do this [music] so obviously use copilot responsibly and maybe don't give little timmy the controller unless you're actually ready to play so now wait are you walking wait no i'm walking now i will go right i'm going right i'm going straight ha ha wait no no okay i'm running no this other way left no timmy stop no what are you doing to me ah you broke the law okay so copilot needs to be used responsibly however it if little timmy is a responsible six-year-old then he'll not kill everyone in red death so that my friends if some of the tech tips linus won't teach you if you enjoyed definitely be sure to subscribe to the channel check out some of our other videos here until next time little timmy signing out i know i was waiting for you to say something off-camera but you ruined the joke
