just to take one example now we have this chat gpt and already students are using it to write their papers and professors are using it to write their lectures right so it's like two machines talking to each other you know or for example you know there are these programs you can speak into it and then it'll translate it into spanish or something like this so but every step that we take in that direction our human capacities like reading writing and so forth begin to sort of rust and disuse yeah not only do they rough and disuse but at some point there'll be a kind of cannibal element once they reode to open chat gpt and it starts to now continue to analyze what's coming in terms of writing and in terms of it'll start to eat its own children yeah and it'll create a cannibalistic monster that will start to devolve because it's going to be it's basically cycling back its own its own output [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] so hello everyone i am very excited to be back with jacob holland he has been on the podcast before he is the provost of the university of austin and he is an expert both on ancient thinking in terms of the ancient greeks and but also biblical thinking as well and rabbinical thinking so this is going to be a great conversation we want to talk about the question of technology and all the way leading up to the the issues of ai and all that so jacob this is you're the you're exactly the person i want to have this conversation with well thanks i feel the same way so my big question my first question for you is have you thought a bit about the different narratives about technology that we find both in ancient thinking whether mythological or philosophical and the the way that the bible portrays the the the question of technology let's say yeah i mean you know i think that a lot of the issues that we're confronting today were already identified by both of those traditions and maybe one way to put it is if we go back to the platonic text plato makes a distinction between acquisition and production as sort of kinds of sciences or arts and philosophy is categorized under acquisition what does that mean the acquisition of knowledge which is a kind of openness or receptivity to the world right so there's a kind of anthropology behind this human beings are these souls that relate fundamentally to reality and our job if you will is to register those realities and to take them in now production is i mean the greek word is poiasis which is could also be translated poetry but it just means production making and the thing is that there's no pure receptivity i guess i would say if if you're doing philosophy for example you and this is really the ancient circle epistemology you register right what is there and then you articulate it there's no philosophy without articulation but that's that always has a productive dimension you're using the tools that you have generated for example language you're selecting which of those tools you're going to employ i mean you could you could represent reality mathematically or poetically or whatever and so there's always this kind of productive element you're adding to to what it is that you've taken in technology from the greek perspective and i think this applies to the bible as well is a kind that is obviously productive because we're making stuff we're transforming nature we're building and the danger there is that it can interpose itself between us and reality and that ultimately if we sort of follow the line of technological development far enough and here i would sort of flag ai we might create a kind of virtual reality that is to say a humanly produced reality that substitutes for the world to which this philosophical and i would say biblical anthropology suggests that we are fundamentally meant to be open and to order ourselves mind yeah i think that that so i you know one of the the things that i read even in college also because of postmodernists really is the plato's feedra where socrates talks about writing itself as having that problem which is something that a lot of modern people would be surprised because we we we're actually like beyond writing it's like whatever effects writing had on the civilization we're way beyond it but in some ways it was exactly that problem which is that we as humans are living spirits right we we are breathing living spirits that that that manifest meaning that take in meaning and but there's a kind of organic dance to that right whereas as soon as you fix something then it on the one hand it makes it more powerful because right you can send your texts out you can send emails out but on the other hand it does in fact it can in fact interpose itself the way you said it's a supplement it's an it's an adding to language and then it can become a kind of opacity to what it is that you're that you're saying you know if we're talking you know you and i face to face and you don't understand what i'm saying you know you can ask me and i can answer and then we can have this kind of back and forth where we're tuning in and we're tuning closer to what we want but if you read a text that's what it is that's it like that's what you have and so you it'd be it can so on the one hand it makes it possible for me to access the thoughts of people that i that i can't meet but it also at the same time creates that difficulty which is that you know it's like this these fixed words are my vision of what what what it is that's coming down to me you know it's a means let's say but it can it can become something of an idol like because if we lose its connection to what it originally is then it then it somehow has a life of its own you could say and it's interesting because a lot of the postmoderns that's actually what they want to do they want to like liberate the text from the author in some weird way like make it have a kind of life of its own where there is no there's no there's no like thread that goes back to the to the person but rather it becomes almost something that you play with you know just that on it's at its own level yeah i think that's right you know the features is really interesting because i mean there are these interesting kind of contradictions so this is a written platonic dialogue yeah thank goodness it's written because we have access to the thinking of plato but the little story there is two egyptians one is the pharaoh and one's a god writer talking and uh one of them is displaying the arts that he's produced and finally gets to writing and the objection that the other registers is that this will not be a tool of memory that is to say when writing is introduced the idea is we're not going to forget stuff because we've written it down increase memory is the is the argument of the of the god and the god is like he's almost like a hephaestus figure he's like a kind of dark god of technology yes right right conversion yeah exactly yeah oh and and i mean as a side note it's interesting that this takes place in egypt because i would suggest that egypt with its man god it's pharaoh it's magicians who exercise some kind of techni right and causing little miracle little you know strange like unnatural events to occur and so forth it's enormously impressive technological achievements by which i mean for example the pyramids or i mean i was in egypt a number of years ago and i have to say i've never seen more exquisite jewelry i mean just the you know when you take sort of the sarcophagi and all these things but what's interesting is so egypt devoted tremendous social resources to the production of these kinds of items and obelisks and huge things like this what were they for primarily they were to honor and be stuffed in the tombs of dead man gods okay i should say incidentally that egypt was also a kind of symbol in the ancient world i mean plato associates that it with with death with a kind of desiccation a lack of life okay and i would want to connect that as a long discourse perhaps but with technology as a kind of substitute okay so anyway the god points out this will actually be a tool of forgetfulness and the suggestion is and what he means by there is is or let me put another way it will be it will suppress recollection in a philosophical sense which i would take to mean something like a living openness to the fundamental things that need metaphysically religiously and so forth to be remembered by us to be taken into our souls so you're absolutely right writing that search is a kind of mediation right and obviously today um where young people and maybe not even that young people have have sort of learned to not to answer the phone but to use text and so forth there are all kinds of further layers of mediation between human beings so socrates favored this face-to-face discussion like we're having now and i do think that you know if we look at again artificial intelligence just just consider the levels of mediation that are involved in when i sort of look at my smartphone or something like that or when i'm relating to you know a glowing electronic screen what's happening there human beings are observing the world they are representing it in language or mathematics or something they're then encoding it into data zeros and ones and then that is being presented to us right so there's a kind of i mean we've taken writing and kind of amplify put it on steroids if you will so i think this is a really important issue definitely and the all the the imagery that happens in fedris is related to this and it's actually very similar to the one that you find in the bible that the way that egypt is represented also in in this text with all of the other symbolisms that br that are brought about in fidris it's similar to the way egypt is represented in scripture because fidros and socrates leave the city they cross they leave their city and they cross a river you know it's like when you cross a river you know what that means like you're either going out into the wilderness or you're coming into the into into your home you could say so they cross a river and then there are all these weird things that socrates does i was like sometimes he talks he covers his face and talks through a veil and there's all these these kind of weird symbolic things that socrates is doing and it seems to manifest what what i've talked about quite a bit in scripture which is the garments of skin i think that the imagery of the garments of skin in scripture is very much akin to what is happening in this idea of the supplement that plato is trying to to help us see which is the garments of skin on the one hand what they do is that they increase your capacity to live in a world that's hostile to you right but that's what they do but at the same time they are made out of death first of all and they are also a weakening of you at the same time because you're always putting yourself in more danger as you're moving out so that's what and that seems to be what technology does in general and has to do with recollection as well so think about think about the example i love to use all the time is is fire making so my ancestors could spend a lot of energy they knew how to make fire but it would take forever and they would use a string and a bow or whatever they would use and they could just kind of and even that they needed the string in the bow but they could they could make fire it's like i don't have to think about that i just have to flick a lighter and i have fire so i'm i'm a million times more powerful than my ancestors but if i don't have that lighter i'm going to die of cold in the forest pretty much and so it's like think of technology if you think of technology that way which is that even we've increased our power to the extent that we can move out and go into space and you know i can live here in quebec where there's like eight months of winter but it so it makes me more powerful but it also makes me closer it brings me closer to death and makes me more fragile at the same time and that seems to be what technology itself does especially writing and especially what we could call now information technology which is that i know i have access to more information that all my ancestors together but i don't have to hold it inside me in any way so i can pretend to be smart and be a complete idiot or not a total idiot but i'm i'm far less integrated than you know the ancients would have been but i also have all this access so i can it can it's like it's that duality of of of power and weakness or or like using death against death maybe it's the best way to describe it yeah it strikes me that there there's some sort of optimal relationship between man nature and technology i mean you know you're absolutely right so adam and eve sin god prepares them clothes out of animal skins obviously this then is a fundamental divorce between human beings and these animals with whom they communed in the garden yeah and also from god because they use it it it when they first put on coverings it's to hide themselves from god right so they hide themselves from god and then they buffer themselves from the animal and they create this like buffer between them and between god and the animal they're like isolated in the world or alienated is the best way to word to use maybe so one of the things i that flashed into my mind when you were speaking was yuval harari's book sapiens in the beginning of that book he makes a rather strong case i think that the hunter-gathering age of our existence was in some ways maybe the most intellectually stimulating and kind of rich compared to for example you know i'm an accountant and i'm looking at a computer screen all day why is that because individuals had to possess a range of technical skills right you've got to be able to kill animals you got to be able to skin them you have to be able to sew these garments you have to be able to make fire you've got you know you have to be able to identify plants to figure to pick things and just sort of respond to the occlusive nature now they obviously live much closer to nature the thing about nature is that it's hostile i mean we know this from the bible we know this from the greeks it's not simply hostile right it's also beautiful and splendid and nurturing and so forth but we have to deal with the hostility element in fact i would i would actually if you sort of ask me like what's work i would categorize work as sorting chaos right just kind of getting sort of figuring things out so you can so you can survive yeah work is a good though in scripture too it's weird because it's like it's a consequence of the fall but it ends up being a way to be safe from the fall both personally in terms of your own soul but then also just because now you do have to work the earth to make things grow but right that's that's also how you survive yeah so so obviously we're not hunter-gatherers we've we've advanced it you know it's interesting because people still talk about progress yeah and so what is progress well progress is also a regress right yeah and and now we rely on all sorts of things that we have no idea how they work i mean this is something ortega said writes about in the revolt of the masses it's something freud writes about in civilization and it's discontents as well he speaks about a technological man as a kind of prosthetic god we put out all our stuff and we're you might think of like a you know in the anime like more enhanced with exoskeletons exactly by it and stuff like this and technology obviously you know brings discontents but what's interesting then is that we are unable to reproduce the conditions of our own existence in other words no single person can do that thinker named rosenstakusi once said that a citizen is a person who if need be can refound civilization in the modern world there aren't any citizens by that definition if you see what you mean i mean well there might be citizens in the sense that there could be people with enough practical wisdom and so forth to sort of refund political life but if we're talking about civilization as we now depend on it and we're utterly dependent you're right that that becomes very difficult one last thing i would say here is that every technological advance subtracts and this is obviously implicit in what you were saying from our own capabilities i'm gonna wave at artificial intelligence again because just to take one example okay now we have this chat gpt and already students are using it to write their papers and professors are using it to write their lectures right so it's like two machines talking to each other you know okay so why do i need or or for example you know there are these programs you can speak into it and then it'll translate it into spanish or something like this so but every step that we take in that direction our human capacities like reading writing and so forth begin to sort of rust and disuse yeah not only do they rust and disuse but at some point there'll be a kind of cannibal element to the technology because you know chad gpt once once they reode to open chat gpt and it starts to now continue to analyze what's coming in terms of writing and in terms of they'll it'll start to eat its own children yeah and it'll create a cannibalistic cannibalistic monster that will start to devolve because it's going to be it's basically cycling back its own its own output and so it's like i don't see how they're going to solve that problem in the in the long term because right and but even the fact that we know that it'll do that is an image of what it's also doing to us which is ultimately a kind of diminishing of the human spirit as it is as it increases in power yes look this is this is already happening i mean weirdly jonathan i took some solace from the fact that chat gpt is cannibalizing itself in a way so just to be clear right what does chatgpt do well it goes out there in it and it kind of looks at all this data right goes to the internet right and which is not a particularly intelligent pool on the average i mean you just you know which is incidentally why chat gbt makes stuff up that because it obviously it sort of can't sort out what's true or what's false and so it kind of looks at things and makes these what it thinks are logical connections but so that if you can just calculate semantic distance right i mean there was there was a a professor told me about a paper he'd gotten on romeo and juliet you know and it was like romeo you know the calculates and the montages are worth and then julia catches a cab and she goes you know and so i mean because this is right so so you kind of take this low pool and you scoop it all up and you connect these things and you spit something out and then that becomes part of the larger pool which the next chapter you know looks at and and so so it's sort of like consuming your own waste now actually they cut they cut jtpd off from they stopped training it a few years ago oh they've actually cut it it's only within itself but they can't do that forever like i know they probably did it because they know the problem that they're setting up in the world but at some point they're gonna have to reopen it because they can't if they want chad gbt to keep up with what's happening they'll have to reopen it so that it goes back and starts to to recount to re calculate so so i think they're maybe they're looking for a solution for it but they'd have at least for now they have cut it off which is which is something being hadn't done for a while and that's why being was like a psycho like bing would would just go into cycle mode and just become like you're you're like you're you're you're stalking ex-girlfriend or you know turned into you know like the the like passive aggressive or whatever like they were all it had all these personality defaults because it was literally training on the internet so that's that's really interesting but let's go back to your cannibalization thing it it certainly reminds me of you know a pagan god i mean i think maybe in an earlier discussion we we i observed that the biblical god feeds us right man in the wilderness or christ you know the communion and so forth but the pagan gods really one could argue and i won't do it right now they they sort of dined on human beings i mean you know think of like the the athena and these various gods you know at troy sort of sitting like vultures they're compared to vultures and they're just so hungry to consume the bad the blood and so forth now what that means is that again human beings are relating only to themselves but now through the mediation of this artificial intelligence which is why incidentally i i read somewhere that like thousands of writers were suing openai because it was training its language on proprietarial works by these authors which you've got to do because the movement like if you just keep training on you know the internet you're going to get you start at a low point and and you're just kind of going to decline it's going to be sort of mediocrity but what that means is it needs to cannibalize sort of living thinking right it needs to like it needs these human beings generating new stuff and this is the large problem with our society i mean even before these these kinds of artificial intelligence advances hollywood was cannibalizing itself right you know i don't know such and such of iteration seven right you know exactly just rambo 19 or something but think here think let me throw something out for you and see what you think about this so one of the so if you look at the matrix movie so you have a situation where the matrix is this artificial intelligence and it's feeding off of our energy right so basically we're batteries but what they mean by batteries is something like the electricity we produce there's something a little naive about that the the way that the ai actually works now is it's it's actually farming intelligent from humans so ai isn't intelligent but what it does is that we provide qualia we provide quality we provide judgment to the ai so the way they actually train the ai right is that the eye generates a bunch of junk and then there are people actual people who have to look at that junk and say yes no yes no good bad good bad they'll use like the captions for example you know like when you're when you're answering a caption you're you're you're like telling it where the the lights are you're lit you're training ai when you're doing that because ai doesn't know the difference between a traffic light and something else but if you've got a million people telling telling the ai oh that's a traffic light that's a traffic light that's a traffic light then you're then the humans you're literally farming intelligence from humans and so this weird thing where in humans become like so now you have these low paid you know farms of people that are like living in horrible like offices and all they do all day is tell the ai like what's even in terms of social media and stuff like what's good what's bad so you know that's all you do even for like the social media companies too like you have people all day all they do is watch horrible content you know like and then all they do is is rated and say this is bad this is bad this is bad so that facebook can now catch it automatically right so you actually have the idea of this like monster right this like this monster that is eating our attention our intelligence and like subjugating us to it but really like how can i say this swallowing our soul like actually swallowing our soul and it's like it's happening in front of us that's that's quite amazing and this brings up another thing which is how does a child learn what a cat is okay it encounters a cat and then someone says that's a cat and it takes a couple of iterations of this all right why can't ai do it because human beings have what the ancients call intuition what's intuition intuition is direct unmediated access to reality now let me stop i can imagine the skeptic listening and saying oh wait a second of course it's mediated right your brain optical nerves this whole thing is extremely complicated we can start but let us say okay fine it's all relative on the scale of relativity this is the most direct unmediated thing which is why frankly the we have a critique of writing in plato's fedris because again writing is this mediation and what needs to be preserved is this capability of immediate intuition aristotle develops this and talks about noises which is an intellectual intuition right yeah we in the orthodox tradition the news and the idea of noetic capacity is is the highest form of of of knowledge right it's more than knowledge in the sense of the way that we think of thinking or whatever it is is direct grasping and in in the orthodox kind of mystical theology the noose is the capacity we have to also be united with god because it's the capacity we have to have first of all direct grasping of the things around us but then ultimately it's that which also makes us possible to like you know enter into the embrace of god because it's a it's a type of knowledge that isn't just intellectual it's it really is like the fullness of your being you know joining with something yes and look it's not simply knowledge of god but knowledge of human beings i mean we don't do this in english but you know we've got say in german someone might say kennedy jonathan which means are you familiar with jonathan no one would say visenzi jonathan which means do i have epistemic knowledge do i have a scientific comprehension of jonathan now i would argue that uh anything that poses as a scientific comprehension of jonathan is not the best kind of knowledge of jonathan yeah so if i say oh he's a good guy or he's smart or something like this this is a response that is that that i have that has been elicited from me by my immediate face-to-face presence with you and human beings have a kind of inner infinity like god and that's something that we cognized sort of directly so but going back to ai and this cannibalistic stuff one needs to raise the question of what do we mean by intelligence ai has intelligence in a very specific sense it's a kind of discursive intelligence it goes across data and it arranges it and moves it around it lacks this intuition so when we relate to ai generated products we are relating to something that has lost its connection in some basic or never had a connection never had a derivative it's derivative information necessary which is why you know there's a kind of fundamental stupidity you're you're a rather harrowing picture of people sitting in a i imagine a kind of you know windowless room typing in like cat cat cat or whatever suggests that you know like this this it's like what does it mean that that is the foundation of artificial intelligence i had a professor who very cleverly said i i don't know why everyone's interested in artificial intelligence i'm looking for the real thing right that's right real intelligence that's hard enough to find in the world already yeah exactly so there's a kind of unmooring yeah and again if we go back to what i said at the beginning of our discussion that this kind of biblical and greek anthropology is the soul is open to reality both both the chaos of reality and the and the kind of moral and intellectual measures the you know transcendent eternal things if that's the case then relating to ai is is kind of shutting down of that because we don't even have like ai simply lacks any fundamental connection or a direct connection with reality yeah and i think that this is this is a good place to to talk about how there's a really a good a good way to understand ai today is to understand the manner in which idolatry was kind of understood also in in scripture for example so if you want to take the idea of technification because you talk about like what's the right balance of technology like how can technology serve as proper purpose so you have two images in the bible they're close to each other because you know they're in the same story which is on the one hand you have the golden calf which aaron builds instead of the revelation and people end up worshiping the the calf itself you know it's in worshiping the work of their hands you could say and then the other one is the revelation of the tabernacle which is a technical thing like the the tabernacle is like a little city it is civilization it is like a microcosm of civilization it's a microcosm of of technicality there are the use of metals of gold or silver and a bronze you know in a in a in a in a hierarchy there's this there's a whole cosmic image in the the tabernacle later in the temple and that that seems to be the highest image of what technology can be is an ordered ordered supplementarity but directed towards the transcendence directed toward the transcendent and not captured within its the fascination with itself you know and a kind of cannibalistic move where you the the fascination of the technical itself becomes the the or the capacity for power itself becomes the the the the motor which makes us engage with it yeah this is so a bunch of ideas popped into my head as as you were just speaking so the gold that made the golden calf as you know was was jewelry earrings and things like this taken from egypt now it was intended for the adornment of the tabernacle what's really interesting there and this just occurred to me is that that story could be interpreted as an answer to the question how do we reorient technology how do we take it in its really monstrous kind of exemplification in egypt and reorient it toward i mean this is obviously something that probably has occurred to you but so let's talk about the golden calf for a minute so moses is up there on the mountain communing with god he doesn't come back the israelites say to aaron you know the guy's not coming back make us this god and there's this weird ventriloquism that goes on because once aaron makes the calf which is definitely a technical thing right he has to shape it and all this kind of stuff the israelites say this is the lord your god who took you out of the land of egypt so they plagiarized god there's there's another act of cannibalism by the way like in some sense or i don't know if that's exactly right but and what is the what is the calf well there's a weird connection between the calf and what's going on today all right what are like what why do say americans love you know digital stuff right well i mean if you ask anybody you know what's the highest traffic on the internet porn right technology by the way will generate better and better sex robots and things like this the golden calf was i mean after they made the calf this kind of well somehow it stimulated this bacchanalian celebration the next day so like the cap is connected with the unleashing of these desires which no doubt were suppressed and egypt these people were slaves but here they are in the desert and they're like the master's gone we compelled this guy to make the calf now we're gonna do our thing right because now we're going to enjoy all those things that that we were never able to enjoy in our enslaved condition and so so we've got that the tabernacle i think it's really interesting because what's happening there is to try to present in an architectural space the possibility for the encounter with the infinite right so you've got this finite construction and this is obviously how icons work and so forth how do you solve this problem you know but it's a very interesting contrast because there is a proper place for gold and silver and adornments and these technical products yeah so yeah no yeah i think your insight is is very is very strong you know there is a so you could say so think about like even in the garments of skin situation and it's very interesting because you know god gives adam and eve these garments of skin which by the way many at least in the orthodox tradition and i'm pretty sure in some rabbitical traditions as well it's kind of like it's basically your biological body it's like it's it's your biological body of death right not that adam and eve didn't have bodies before the fall but that their bodies were more subtle you could say and that these bodies of death that we're in you know that you eat and that you excrete and all of this and and all the the desires that come with it they're they're related to the garments of skin and so there's a relationship and what it does it's an increase in power right body is an increase in power just like a guy who is buff and has big muscles has more power more you have body more you have power and so it's it's an extension of that logic which is that if i add more body i add more power if i have a if i'm strong and or if i if i have a mecca suit on top like we said then that mecca suit makes me more powerful but there's a connection between that and the animality itself right the fall into animality you could say which is also an abandonment to our desires and to to the to the more you know appetite aspect of who we are and so like if you think about it it all kind of comes together so we tend to oppose for example the world of technology in the world of animality because one is artificial one is natural but if you understand it as this idea of increase in body then the idea of a metallic calf right a metallic animal which is you know god told adam to name the animals and all of a sudden they take the animal and they put it up as a god they're basically doing the opposite of what god told adam to be which is to to be on top of the animals and name them and now they become subject to it subject to the body subject to the this these kind of licentious desires and so all of this stuff kind of goes together you know in the book of revelation there's this image of the [ __ ] and the beast right so there's a [ __ ] sitting on the on a beast and the beast is civilization you know there are different ways to understand that in the text because the beasts are related to the book of daniel and the perception of the different civilizations that like you know the different animals and so it's like these two things go together right the technification and increase in power leads to licentiousness and leads to us being having more e and you can think about it just like just very practically which is that if you let's say you you have a little let's say you have a little fault in yourself right you i don't know you have you you look at women or whatever you have a little thing then now i'm gonna get and and that's kind of there you're you're trying to manage it but you're struggling and i'm and i'll give you a million dollars right it's like all of a sudden your increase in power becomes a door for whatever that little thing in you was to increase and so technology does that does that on steroids especially something like information technology right which is intelligent technology so the relationship between internet and porn or internet and and all these things this isn't something which is completely unavoidable like you couldn't have it any way else or at least not easily you know it's not accidental that these things developed the way they did just as it's not accidental that they develop towards porn and the military it's like increase in power increase in desire increase in desire to dominate to consume all these things are related to what technology is and technology does yeah yeah that's very interesting you know one way to think about these things or at least one way that i think about them is in terms of the categories of work and leisure so human beings relate to reality work is a kind of sorting of chaos what's the point of work well let's go back to the greeks so aristotle says he's critiquing the spartans war is for the sake of peace and in peace we have business and we have leisure and business is for the sake of leisure right now we need a sort of thick conception of leisure so i think here are productive conceptions of leisure for aristotle what's leisure for he critiques the greek so they sit around they drink and they tell miss and stuff although i think he's underestimating the importance of this jonathan and the symbolic richness and so forth but what's leisure for from the biblical perspective let's take the jews sabbath sabbath and what is that it's that's an opening again to the highest things this is connected right with someone like joseph peeper who incidentally you know i mean he has got this wonderful book on a leisure of the basis of culture and he sees leisure as a kind of plugging into the life-giving forces of the divine of nature and so forth what's happened so why do i mention leisure now i'm thinking of ai again two things work and leisure have become confused so you were talking about the capture stuff right you're actually working for ai when you're doing capture but why are you entering captcha because you want to get to the the good stuff because you want entertainment or every time i you know log into this or i'm like i'm gonna have fun i'm gonna watch this tick tock or something they're getting information about you so you're actually working but you're you're working for somebody else you don't even know it but you're enjoying leisure what happens with leisure well this is a very serious problem i mentioned joseph bieber he's writing he gives us talk on leisure the basis of culture and another one called the philosophical act it's 1947-48 after world war ii europe is being rebuilt the emphasis in education is on you've got to have useful knowledge right it's all for work and people is worried about a world of total work where we don't have exposure to leisure another person who worried about leisure is john maynard keynes who wrote an article in the early 30s called economic possibilities for our grandchildren and keynes this is a very important keynes said this is the beginning of the depression and he says basically obviously paraphrasing look readers you're not going to believe this but here's the good news in a hundred years we won't need to work okay because our productive capacities will increase and so forth and then we're going to confront the greatest problem in human history what do we do with our leisure and the reason that's a great problem is we don't educate people for leisure go back to aristotle he was critiquing the spartans they don't know how to be a leisure all they knew is how to win wars yeah so so what happens with our leisure well in leisure you you know i have a statement around here somewhere but the some the world development organization says something like ai is going to be awesome it's going to liberate all these human capacities we're going to be at leisure because it's going to put all these people up we won't have to work right and you know we're going to develop ourselves we've got paint we're going to have you know learn languages and all this stuff well much more likely you know you're gonna have sex that's right most likely so so there's this kind of you know we this is why i think i mean one reason why this is just profoundly destabilizing but just to go back to your point okay so we we our our bodies are bigger we have more control it's a disordering because the the point of technology was to do the work part and now the technology is like oh we're going to give you the leisure stuff but you haven't ordered like you you've lost the order in some way yeah so then oh man that image is per like i think your inside is perfect it helps me understand even more like the idea of the [ __ ] and the beast that these two radicals right it's like this this kind of this work and this leisure that is that is licentious licentious and and loss in terms of purpose right it's just kind of wasteful and that there is something about the days of the week and sabbath that the structure of creation itself which are the proper relationship of all these things to to all these things so it's like in some ways you could say the whole purpose of the week is to lead to this moment of rest like rest in in god and so it properly aligns things where it's like the work is there towards so you can imagine like a ritual like a ritual in the in the tabernacle or or liturgy in church right so it's like we we're we're doing all these things so that finally we come to the point where you know we receive the blood the the blood and and wine and we kind of enter into this moment this tense ended moment and so it's like that would that's and then we sit together and we eat and we have we feast it's like that's the leisure like the leisure is right it's it's rightly ordered right so then the leisure instead of being the lowest thing which it is in our society it becomes the highest thing actually becomes like a kind of it transcends work in that way like in in the the right way of thinking about that yeah and i it's so important you said we sit together and we feast human beings are social and political animals we re we crave even if we don't know it the meaning that comes through through rich connections with other human beings technology today is sort of driving us apart i mean again and leisure today and technology and leisure today is actually fragmenting us yeah that's right all these forces of atomization even simply you know so i have a colleague and he said well let me tell you my daughter she's like 17. she had her iphone and it was ringing and it was her best friend and she said to her dad what do i do like why does she want to call me and he says well you actually have to answer the phone to figure that out right i'm just telling the story because you know now it's like text right so so but you're right entertainment i mean what is entertainment there used to be these things called movie theaters where kind of cool things would happen sometimes you know with audiences and the way people reacting and just the buzz and all this stuff and workplaces are emptying out people are going to be put out of work by the way many people will think this is some kind of amazing blessing so you were talking about money i gave you the million bucks my son had a teacher when he was in eighth grade who was doing a documentary on what happens to lottery winners yeah they all go sour they go nuts and this is actually another problem that you know we can discuss so that's a great image of what's coming like if it's true that ai is going to make us not work then look at what happens to lottery winners oh exactly and and it and it also comes down to sort of fundamental questions sort of moral questions because if you pull americans uh 60 70 don't like their jobs okay here's the thing though you go to work you get a paycheck you come home you put food on the table you can buy your kid a bike you can you know there's dignity your life has some meaning now i just took that away from you right and i took away from you so the guy who wins the lottery first thing he does he quits his job and he moves great all that structure your friends who used to have the the kind of basic architecture of your life is gone yeah now what are you gonna do yeah so i mean these are really really fundamental problems yeah and it's interesting i was i actually it's so funny because we're talking about this i just came back from greece i went on this this trip with ralston college and we kind of visited all the ancient sites and we we also went to mount athos together and you know you look at the life of the monks and the they probably have more leisure than any of us you know it's a it's bounded with a lot of work so they have like a certain amount of hours of work and then they also have all this this you know they kind of have this this leisurely life but their leisure is really directed in that direction like it's directed towards you know self-transcendence really like you know worshiping god and moving moving towards that which is which is the good the true and the beautiful you know and so yeah so so the so there's an image you know i i in in the book of revelation i talked about the the [ __ ] and beast right there's another image in the book of revelation which is the heavenly city right the heavenly jerusalem and heavenly jerusalem is also a technical image just like the tabernacle or the temple it's a city now it's it's but it also has that order you could say where it's like everything is directed towards god and so it says the all the nations bring their glory into the the the city right all the kings give up their crowns basically to that which is high and so it's like civilization technology but directed towards that which is good serving in basically serving it and therefore making what they have meaningful right and so there's a sense in which you know i wanna i wanna be careful with people like i'm not anti-technology myself and i'm sure you're not as well that technology could be amazing like of course if if we were oriented properly it could be it could be an amazing thing full of glory but the difficulty we have is that we approach technology like the the ancient israelites approach the golden calf or you know like something to or even how adam and eve approached the app was like something to take it's like it's mine i'm gonna i'm gonna make myself more powerful i'm gonna make myself more and in doing that already like you said the problem is that the very that very mechanism makes it impossible for us to approach the rest properly because like it's like we're we're trained to make more money now right it's like our whole education systems have become more powerful make more money develop technology everything is focused on that but nobody asks what it's for like nobody really is asking the question like what could this really be for yeah look of course i agree with you i mean i i'm not anti-technology i whether i wear anti-technology or not would be completely irrelevant because it's here to stay we have to live with it it does make many wonderful things possible this conversation right here wherever we're talking to each other in real time and and others can listen to us i think it's it's really wonderful but here so maybe one way to to put this is in terms of the thought of henry adams so i within the last year or two i read henry adams um the education of henry adams and it was quite it's really an amazing book so henry adams is born in'38 and he he's the son he's the grandson and great grandson of two american presidents right and so he's like high up there and they live in boston and he says and and he has this kind of moral and religious education and and as a boy he says boston has solved the universe right like look at these unitarian clergymen the wonderful civic everything is wonderful fast forward to 1900 right you've got you've got like eventual electric lights telegraphs telephones right steam engines railways finally airplanes you know you've got darwinism marxism freudianism you have a radioactive decay of the atomic nuclei had been discovered and so forth and science is saying oh border is an accidental product like it doesn't it's not natural and human beings are like or vibrating balls of motion and stuff like this and what henry adams says is in this period what he symbolizes as the virgin had been eclipsed by what he symbolizes as the dynamo okay and he ran into they had these big dynamos at like chicago world's fair and stuff and he saw these things amazing so he has this theory of history which is human beings and this is really relates to the ancient anthropology we sort of are what we pay attention to and direct our energies to and for millennia it was christianity right it was biblical religion and it it produced you know crusades and cathedrals and music and all these wonderful things now it's the dynamo so the virgin appeals works through the heart and the mind through love and appeals to this higher element the dynamo is something completely different it promises material salvation in this life not salvation the afterlife and it's dynamic it keeps changing and i guess i would say the problem is that we relate to this moving thing right and then adams has what's famously known as the atoms curve which is he calculates he's doing coal production from'00 on every decade the power available to human beings technologically doubles yeah now so the rate of acceleration is the same but the curve at some point becomes super steep yeah like it's like yeah and so the problem is we don't really know how to how to deal with it because it's too fast yeah and it kind of just explodes our life yeah so i i i i don't know it seemed like that can't go on forever i don't know because also just for the for human capacity to to deal with it because it will at some point we'll also we also go insane because the right the the also because we don't it seems like that curve there also seems to be a trade-off that humans make which is that like you said we are what we care about and so we also can't care about this dynamo at the same level as we care about and care about wisdom at the same time like it's either the the hierarchy as soon as it's inverted it's real so as this technological stuff improves our capacity for wisdom our capacity to discern you know becomes less and less because the technological process makes it so right a chip that increases the power of a computer doesn't care where it's used right it doesn't it can be used to to power any video games or it can be used to power a missile or you know a weapon doesn't matter well and look you know you you mentioned the computer chip so doubling every decade well since 1970 the the capacities and you know memory storage and stuff like this and speed of processors has doubled every year or two and now we add artificial intelligence who's curve or progression is literally unmeasurable by human beings because we don't actually understand how it works i don't even know what's going on it's like a black box right so henry adams actually says look you know at some point the human mind might just crack up like a meteor bouncing into the earth's atmosphere right now when you add in i'm just going to throw this out when you add in how technology is used today social media and all these other things well you know a rapid increase in mental illness like the crack up is already happening and and because you also have you know you know cyber bullying and all these other phenomena and so forth and incidentally ai is is also being used you know department of defense and the national science foundation are developing increased tools and manipulation and surveillance and propaganda and all these things so yeah whatever's happening in public you know there's 10 times more things happening right outside of our perception let's say so if we added like the ideological component of it too which is you you have your own thinking and you get shot down so you put your head down i think it actually encourages the development of two kinds of human beings and let's use the image of hitting the the like the atmosphere the hard dense aerodynamic soul that's like gonna just you know like you know and some of my examples like you know homo sovieticus you know the tremendous pressures of communism and these are the the commissars you know yeah but much more common today is hey i don't want to crack up on the atmosphere i am going to be weightless i'm going to be empty i'm going to throw over all my convictions i'm just gonna you know because wherever the wind is blowing that's cool right and and so we see these kind of psychological reactions with this incredibly steep curve of technology with all the pressures that come with it yeah it's it's definitely going to it it's definitely going to be interesting you know one of the images again sorry to keep coming back to the book of revelation yeah sure it's just because it's one of the best images because one of the the images that that comes about there's two actually one is of course the beast the beast that speaks right the image of the beast that speaks and that's what seduces everybody it's very fascinating but the other one is that at some point the beast kills the [ __ ] right in the story so the idea is that this horror in these this [ __ ] is riding this beast and it's like everybody is putting all their seed into the [ __ ] like everybody's just like just just chaos and mixture and you know whatever all the possibilities but at some point the beast kills the [ __ ] and it's like because like you said at some point the the the the the the the the control aspect of the technology and the the surveillance aspect all of this stuff is going to ramp up to a point where the very mechanisms that brought about like the like the licentiousness are going to turn into hard steel right and they're just gonna gonna control everything because as things fray and i think break apart and that's people's mental health breaks apart there's no other solution except to create top-down structures that will hold things together because obviously you know whoever holds the reins of these technologies has no has no there's no advantage for them for like anarchy to break out and things to kind of to become chaotic and so it seems like the the vision of ai is becoming more and more just a use of of tranical control seems like it is an inevitable and this is like you think if you game theory it out you see that it it plays out there's almost there's almost no way around it which is because i i i've been talking to a lot of ai developers i think as i'm thinking about this and and there are these like cowboy ai developers right some of them that are saying like kind of elon musk attitude where it's like well this is inevitable what's going to happen so let's make us as powerful as possible let's put the ai in your pocket right let's make your phone powerful enough that you can have open ai like independently in your phone and you are like as powerful as any other other ai and it's like i get it but that's not gonna work right because so so so either the either the powers that be that hold the reins of our societies are going to use ai to control us or either we're going to be cowboy ai people and it means that the terrorist is going to be is going to have it in his pocket too and it means that the punk rocker gonna have in his pocket too which means that the reaction will be the same right there's no other way there's no like there's just no other way that it could play out it has to transform into into surveillance and control i don't see an if you if you have another way to see it playing out i don't see it it doesn't seem possible no i don't i mean i hate to say it but i i think you're absolutely right and there are so many forces that that exacerbate this you know there's a there's this kind of feedback loop because the the less we or the more atomized we become the less we even remember what it's like to be in a kind of local community the more we look at others through this lens of abstraction you know it's like it's like it's like the plato's cave image you know he's got this image of people sitting around prisoners in the cave looking at shadows the difference between my being able to turn my neck which apparently you can't do in the cave image and look at the other prisoner versus getting all my information about the guy who's sitting next to me a shadow on the wall like we're not doing that face-to-face stuff this is a wonderful moment right somebody comes down and unchains the prisoner and he makes him stand up and turn around and it's like the first contact with a human being you know what what's going on right we have to somehow be able to do that but i don't see how that's going to work so top down solutions well actually even let me let me go back i said top-down solutions the word solution i almost want to excise it from the political vocabulary because politics is a living ongoing thing it's a constant renegotiation it's a constant putting new and fresh energy in to the system like you're like you got to paint your house you know you got to take care of things yeah it's a living organism really right it has a kind of opponent processing aspect to it where it's like you push it a little harder this way this way like right yeah so who talks about solutions well it's a technical notion right it's almost like a mathematical thing and i i you know i kind of repeat this phrase it seems to me that all political solutions like real solutions are final solutions right that is to say i mean it's it it it's death it in some way incidentally jonathan i've been thinking about the 34th kanto and the inferno where which actually begins with the line it's quoted in latin you know uh the royal the banners of the king of of hell advance right so it kind of identifies satan as the king and and we have this image of satan and remember that he's he's like stuck in the ice it's all frozen it's all you know none of the none of the condemned can speak to dante they're frozen in these things right and then you have satan and one of the translators has calculated that he's sticking up a thousand feet from the ice like like tower of babel or something like this right and and in his mouth are you know judas and cassius and brutus and as this same translator john sinclair mentions these are the guys who guys who serve satan best you know they're the guys who's there but the revolution needs its own in a way right i mean this rebellious angel falls down and crashes into the earth and so i don't know it's just it's it's a it's a very rich image but it's rich it's rich in relation to what we're saying which is that you know the the image of aaron making the golden calf yes you know there's a there is a relationship between that and the the basic promethean image of revolution you know and you see that you know the idea of taking that we think that we're used to actually think of the promethean story as something positive you know it's like for me prometheus goes up there you know those horrible gods he takes the fire takes the technology takes civilization brings it down to to the human to the humans and then interestingly enough prometheus is punishment is that his liver is eaten every day and and for the in my understanding that for the ancients the liver was a an image of emotion or desire the desiring part of the human right and so it's actually an image of this horror and this beast again it's like if you he brings technology to the service of man and then falls into a cycle of desire that of his like being eaten his own desire being eaten and returning and being eaten and returning you know it's like you the hunger of of insatiability you could say is it's a weird image of that and so that there is a relationship between so it's like if so once again it's like it's not that the fire is is evil right even in the story the fire is at first given by zeus if i remember and then take it away because because people don't aren't offering proper sacrifice then the fire is kind of taken away and then prometheus takes the the fire and so think about that like that's what the story of cain is the cane the sort of cain is so similar it's like because of an improper sacrifice cain has to steal that they make civilization you know he he's alienated from god then he creates the first city out of this like i'm gonna do this for myself to protect myself from others to protect myself uh and then in the story of the bible what happens that god saves that you could say it's like god redeems that through stories like he takes what cain develops and then transforms it into the tabernacle transforms it into to the temple basically but this idea of the the this this kind of and the frozenness is perfect for that right it's like because that's what technology is it's a fixing right it's like let's fix these walls around our city let's make these limits let's make these artificial limits around things and so yes your intuition is absolutely right that there's a relationship between all of these things yeah and and actually it's a small detail but in dante he compares lucifer or satan too so he's got these bat wings basically which are blowing and the wings are you know freezing you know freezing the ice and we all this water so it's like frozen chaos he compares them to the wings to sales on a windmill okay and then when he talks about lucifer's teeth eating these guys because he's constantly eating these eating nothing on them which is also by the way an image of insatiability yeah yeah he compares it to what he called well it's a hackle which is some kind of agricultural tool okay so this is kind of mechanistic thing prometheus is it's actually very interesting god zeus finally gets back at the human beings with by creating pandora okay and pandora it's very interesting so this is where we get a mixture of erotic desire with technology why because what happens is athena makes this beautiful garment for her okay it's this lovely thing and hephaestus gives her a crown intricately worked and of course the fastest is the craftsman god intricately worked crown on which all the animals are represented so it's like a whole cosmo song microcosm yeah right and so here's man looking at pandora who's going to be a source of of ill and you know trouble and and what's the attitude the attitude is beautiful attractive woman sexually attractive and check out her crown you know the ability to create at your own cosmos like there's a technological desire there too right hephaestus is interesting by the way because well in the iliad there's a scene where achilles mother goes to him to make armor for achilles and he makes this incredible shield but hephaestus has these robots the first robots in history the little maidens life-like maidens running around helping him and stuff so he's already associated fundamentally with the kind of technology we're developing today but he is the most humane and decent of the gods he has been thrown out of heaven he's crippled he's all this kind of stuff but you know when fatis who's achilles mother shows up he's like so welcoming to her because she saved him when he was thrown out of heaven by her mother or maybe her father because they both attacked him you know i think it was her mother his his mother and and she and another nymph for something saved him and nurtured him and he made beautiful jewelry for them and so forth so there's a suggestion there of what it would look like to maintain one's i know he's a god right but like maintain his humanity yeah and use technology yeah and i think we can it's really important for people to always understand like when we talk about these stories that to be careful of absolute moral judgment because all of these stories all have a flip side to them it's like you know you you always have to be able to see both sides at the same time you know which is exactly what you said you know it's like the for example medicine is a good example which is that medicine is technology it really is but there's a sense in which medicine can be the type of technology which is this the proper supplement right the the type of supplementarity and ethnicity which is there to to to help humans and i think that like the idea that you could represent hephaestus as this incestuous you know like freak that gets thrown out and now because of that he kind of he's the one who makes all the all the toys he's kind of like the guy in his basement you know the tech freak in his basement because he can't fit in into society like if that's a proper image of of him for sure but there's another image like the one you said which is rather this this desire to help right you know if you make a crutch for someone you make it because you want to help them you know and so there's a there's a powerful image like we have to always remember that jesus was a tecton you know jesus was the son of a tecton jesus was the son of a technical person and it's not a carpenter per se it really is a a craftsman you know so so when i was on vacation this summer i read paradise lost which i hadn't read before and it's quite amazing in the very first book of paradise lost we were looking at satan he's down in hell and milton says something like you know you guys you human beings you take pride in things like babel he actually mentions babel and you know mining and all this construct he says you should see what they built in hell like that is you know there's no comparison between the technological capability of these fallen angels and spirits and human beings and it's really quite remarkable right like they excel at that yeah in this hell where there's heat but no light you know it's like this so that's a really interesting warning and yeah i mean look the what what has to happen today is that the dynamo has got to be informed like we have to relate to the virgin as well as the dynamo just to put it very broadly and i'm not making a religious statement here i'm just saying there's got to be transcendence in some way and and only then can we control it and the reason i want to say that is you mentioned medicine well you know if you come in and you've got blood poisoning or something and i can give you antibiotics or whatever it is right and i fix you great but now medicine is being used for you know anything sex change augmentation whatever it's because we've got the dynamo but we don't have the version so to speak that is we don't have we're not guided by some kind of moral or spiritual measures that we could attune ourselves to it yeah no i think that's the right i think that's the right i mean we have we saw during the time during covet as well we saw medicine become a political tool and you know become a strange a strange tool for control and so all of these all of these supplements always have this duality to it and and you're right that in some ways i mean the only thing we can do and this is you know because it's like we're just painting this this monstrous portrait of what of where we are in the future but i think that the thing we can do which is actually the way to anchor the dynamo is to you know is to go to church is to go to participate with your family is to re-engage at the human scale because that will reverberate it's the only thing that can really reverberate you know it's like become a better person become a loving father become you know become a a friend like i know it sounds catchy to say that but i don't see what else is possible no look what you're saying is we have to engage in the practices and you know like set the thinking aside engage in the practices and the practice is a source of understanding and that's what we've gotten away from it but here's the thing we have to be very deliberate about yeah that's right we have to say look you know in some ways that which was the most natural for humans you know a thousand years ago is now has to be the most deliberate behavior that we can that we can muster that's exactly right and that means that with regard to all of our institutions say schools they should be in person they should be in a classroom they should be with a living breathing human being they should be you know and as great as zoom is the difficulty is that you know you and i came of age before yeah the smartphone and and all this stuff so we actually have this anchor that we can remember you know what happens when when that that's not there right then we actually and and i'm just thinking of the future here because you you know you you painted this unfortunately rather plausible scenario about kind of totalitarianism and so forth so how do we prevent that right well we have to educate for the future and we have to but so it's look i mean we each have to do what we can do you know i mean i know it's a sort of cliche but it's not for us to finish the work we all have to do what we can and and set an example for others and devote ourselves to trying to resist i mean i you know i don't know i mean you can also run away and try to get off the grid and so forth and i think that's fine some will do that and i think we all have also our our place you know you could say i think it i think that there are people that are going to break off and form communities off the grid and they're going to create little you know rodrere inspired you know communities that's for sure i think that is that is almost inevitable and it probably should happen but it's i think some people still have to stay in the fray and and and continue to right you know and and it's hard to know who who will do who should do what it's a in some ways that's between you know that that's yours are on each of our of our own story but but but of course we also need to to have at least i feel like i still need to have one foot in the matrix and and i often ask myself the question when when does it go too far like when should you just step out i'm not sure i have that answer yet at least for now i feel like it's it's it's important to stay connected to the machine to some extent absolutely i would be very unhappy if if you or people like you decided you know i'm not gonna do the symbolic world i'm not gonna do anything i'm not going to lecture i'm gonna go to alaska and you know make my own you know your or something i mean and that god bless you right but that that's that would be a withdrawal of your best energies and intelligence from from the public space and what we need to do is enter back into the public space as living thoughtful creative active individuals and and give what we can yeah so jacob thanks for thanks for this wonderful conversations and thanks for your time and also all the work that you're doing to to yeah to to build some to read sow the seed you know to kind of gather together the the right minds to towards the future thanks for your work as well on that front thank you very much jonathan it's been a pleasure
