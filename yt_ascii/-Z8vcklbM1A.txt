well they finally did it guys we talked about them possibly removing the dislike button but it looks like youtube has officially decided that starting today the dislike count is completely removed you no longer have the ability to see how disliked a video is this has to be one of the most unpopular moves youtube has made in a while but ironically we don't know exactly how unpopular it is now let's bring down the board and show you exactly what they said to know exactly what their plan is team youtube to reduce targeted dislike attacks and their impact on creators especially on smaller creators like youtube cares about smaller creators you'll no longer see a public dislike count on youtube starting today the dislike button is staying guys you can smash it it just doesn't do anything this comes after lots of research testing and consideration now we're going to watch this video together but let me say up front i think this is a pretty calculated way to kind of just maximize views listen guys there's no longer such a thing as a a bad take or a bad person we're letting the entire world upload but there's nobody bad on this platform it's all positivity all the time and you know what you get when you get more positivity more ads more purchases more sales guys give it up for the advertising side of youtube they're about to see a little bump i think that's where the research team did the most homework but we're also going to take them seriously on this idea of it's all to help smaller creators gonna give that a shot too so let's pull up this video this is hosted by matt koval don't harass him he's a nice guy i think he just sort of a shoot the messenger kind of situation they they shove the nicest guy they have out there to give us the bad news let's watch together hey folks you may have seen a while back that youtube announced it was experimenting with making dislike counts private to only the creator of the video now if you're like me you were surprised by that i mean i've always thought seeing the number of dislikes on a video helps us know as viewers if it's a good video or not if it's a helpful tutorial or not or if what a creator is is saying in their video is generally agreed with or not that is what the dislike button is for okay to be clear remember what he just said actually i'm glad he brought this up the dislike button is so at a glance because this is a social network where anybody can upload you know at a glance should i be watching this video is it good is it agreed with what does the community think that's what the dislike button is great at doing so he says that right up front and he says look this is i thought this is what it was for and then get ready for the gaslight guys here we go but unfortunately research teams at youtube have found there's this whole other use for disliking a video that i had never experienced as a creator and you may not have either apparently groups of viewers are targeting a video's dislike button to drive up the count turning it into something like a a game with a visible scoreboard and it's usually just because they don't like the creator or what they stand for okay so now we're told there's this other side to dislike buttons and this is definitely true right this is we all know this is true but sometimes this is to do what he said at the beginning which is to show that people don't agree with what that person is saying and i think they should have the ability to do that or they say look it's a way of saying this creator has done terrible things in the past we don't like them now youtube's gonna say look we need to protect creators and that's fair enough that's why you have the ability to turn off the like to dislike ratio ladies and gentlemen this is a problem that has already been solved but youtube says they've looked into this and there's a big problem here team youtube says this was already an option for creators but we've seen that when creators choose to turn off likes dislikes they can be bullied and harassed for their decision ultimately it's youtube's responsibility to protect its community so we've made this change across all videos so if we just make everyone not have dislikes no one will know the people who are choosing to hide the descent now this is really stupid and i'm going to explain why you could make the exact same argument for comments right comments are another common way people express that they do not like what is being said or they do not like the video creators have the ability to turn off their comments and when they turn off their comments they are frequently harassed or made fun of for hiding descent again so is youtube's response to that going to be to remove all comments because of the fact that a few creators who are trying to remove the comment section are getting harassed for doing so is that their response to all problems is that if anyone ever gets harassed or bullied or there are negative comments we must remove it totally from the platform because if that's the case comments are next boys comments are next because again creators you could just replace likes to dislikes with comments here creators choose to turn off comments they can be bullied and harassed for their decision ultimately we've made the decision to remove this completely right this is the exact same thing for comments so it makes no sense you've already built a way for creators to remove likes and dislikes and comments you're now just saying well the audience can't know whether the creator is trying to hide anything now we've got to give them the ability to hide that they're hiding and that comes per the crack team of researchers at youtube their research we're going to get into that because this is where i absolutely lost my mind so earlier in 2021 youtube experimented with making the public dislike count private to see if it would help reduce these coordinated dislike attacks across the platform and after analysis they did see a reduction wow the crack team of researchers at youtube found that when they removed the dislike count people didn't bother to dislike the video incredible stuff let's see what else the research team found so the update from youtube is that the dislike button is staying but the dislike counts will now be private you can still dislike videos and that action will be used to tune your own recommendations but you won't be able to see the dislike count only the creator can find it on the back end if they want now a few common questions we saw from the initial experiment first without a public dislike count how can viewers tell if a video is worth watching again i kind of have this question too but it turns out that while viewers might use the dislike count to give them a sense of a video's worth when the teams looked at the data across millions of viewers and videos in the experiment they didn't see a noticeable difference in viewership cap okay i'm gonna call cap on that one i was all with your team of genius researchers up until this moment what this think about what this manager said this is such garbage okay what they're saying is that if you see a ton of dislikes everyone just watches the video again still okay that's because people react to dislikes differently given the video here's the thing that drives me the most crazy is the best use of the dislike button is for things like tutorials and things like where you're not sure of a video's quality if i see that it's like a very high dislike ratio i just click off because i just know it's oh it's not useful right to the mass amount of people i have like a windows bug right because windows is complete trash and i go try to find a solution if i click on it and there's a huge dislike ratio i know i don't have to waste my time now i don't even know that anymore what their researchers are seeing i could have told you which is that for popular creators for big creators if there's a high dislike ratio people end up usually watching because they want to know what the controversy was but that's not the only reason people use dislikes as a measure of like whether a video should be watched or not this is so frustrating because i know what happened in their big experiment the biggest creators with the most dislikes carried the data right whereas the tutorial watching stuff like that where people use dislikes as a measure of should i watch the video or not is this going to be useful or not just got i guess discounted by this whole team of researchers this is absolutely wrong and the fact that youtube is trying to pretend well our researchers looked into it and there's there's nothing in the data shows me they aren't looking they maybe had a pre-existing you know decision that that's what they were going to do and they decided they're going to find the data and torture the data until they prove it right there's no way you can tell me that a highly disliked video if it's a tutorial or something of that nature is going to be watched the same as something with like 100 likes it's absolutely not true and it pisses me off that we're just supposed to believe the internal research of youtube ah guys just believe it did you publish it believe it hey we we did the research we know what's best it's such a weird gas light for you to be like well look we looked into it i know this is unpopular with like all our creators but we're gonna remove the dislike so so you can't even tell how unpopular it is this is where they really lost me with this research team regardless of whether they could see the dislike count or not in other words it didn't really matter if a video had a lot of dislikes or not they still watched next common question if creators can still see the dislike count on the back end how's that any different they can see it if they look for it inside studio analytics under the engagement tab but overall it's much less likely to cause stress and embarrassment if the count isn't visible to the public again to react to this real quick sometimes stress and embarrassment is okay listen i'm not saying that creator harassment is fine or whatever but if you do something genuinely bad you should have to face some sight kind of consequence for that from your audience right otherwise this isn't a social platform it it's a backpacking platform right because basically what they're saying is your feedback is only wanted if it's positive we have no room anymore on youtube for negative things and what always kills me about this stuff is platforms like this they they understand that positivity sells better than negativity so they want to they have an incentive to encourage only positivity but the funny thing is is encouraging positivity doesn't end bad things discouraging calling out bad things doesn't breed more good things in fact it just gives people cover to do the bad things and not face any kind of accountability you know it's funny youtube wants to be able to decide who and who cannot post on their platform right they have their own guides guidelines etc but the second that a community itself says hey we don't like this thing youtube has to come and step in and go whoa whoa whoa guys we gotta make this a safe space for everybody while also deciding who can and cannot post on their platform this seems to me to be the opposite of like a hey broadcast yourself mentality if it truly is a social platform you should have the platform let people post and then the audience react to the postings but they seem to want to control everything which they're doing a terrible job of because this is the thing that really set me off because obviously i didn't want to make this all about what i do but obviously one of the big things this is going to affect is how many people scam and get away with it right because there's going to be no way for an audience to signal hey this this is bad this is a bad video this is a scam this is whatever as this person says it robux scam streams fortnite scam streams life scam streams lol hiding dislikes is a nightmare youtube comes in says big sigh scams are not allowed on youtube so this isn't the experience we want you or anyone to have well guys that's it for scams say goodbye all the scammers don't worry youtube doesn't want you other platform that's clearly gonna do something guys there's never been more crypto scams influencer scams out there than now i literally don't have time for it but youtube's coming in here and saying don't worry guys we'll find the scams like no you won't continuously people find new scams getting through and clearly they let scams through because some of the biggest influencers on their platform did it just a few months ago so this idea is so condescending big sigh scams are not allowed on youtube well i don't know what to say scams are thriving more than ever that's hate to tell you that youtube and again not to make this all about like scams or what i do i think it's bad sort of across the board but scams are an example of like legit bad behavior that you want creators to face account accountability for and clearly youtube is trying to make it so that no one ever has to face any accountability or any dislikes already creators have the ability to like not only turn off comments but now they can and this has sort of been the case for a while they can hide certain comments they like they just remove them and youtube has made the comment algorithm more and more hiding and suppressing negative comments and bringing bringing up all the positive ones so more and more the comment section is a giant circle jerk anyway the dislike button was like the last bastion of like well if you had it on there's no way to fake it it just is what it is you can't hide it you can't remove dislikes the way you can comments and so i think you're gonna see more and more creators just sort of getting away with bad behavior and there's nothing anyone could do to stop them but don't worry guys it's all for your safety your protection youtube is here to help you out i can't imagine something less popular that youtube is more sure about with their crack team of researchers i think it's completely insane i hope they reverse this decision and realize that creators who are suffering from this a may have done something bad right that's one but b if it's just because they have an unpopular opinion or whatever and you want to include that on your platform i think that's totally legitimate just let them hide the dislike button themselves this was not a problem that needed a solution we already had a solution and youtube's answer is well they got shamed for it if that's the case we're removing things that people get shamed for you also have to remove comments because comments also have a thing where if someone disables comments they also get hate for that so the way i see this this was a solution for no one and just sort of makes the community less social less interesting less informative frankly now it's more like watching a netflix video but i'm sure that's what youtube wants because it brings in more advertisers more bucks for the big guys upstairs hopefully they changed their mind but given youtube's sort of history with this and the fact they told us a long time ago everyone hated it and they still did it i don't think that's going to change all right well pump the stock guys because you can't do anything else thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next one try your best [music] but things will be different if i was balling
