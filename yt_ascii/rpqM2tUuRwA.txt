what i'm holding right now is the most powerful android phone in the world it is powered by the brand-new snapdragon 805 which might just be the brain of your next device the 855 is a sock or a system on a chip which means it contains the cpu the gpu and much more so i'm gonna split this video into eight mini sections this is what you need to know the cpu here is the cryo four eight five and unlike a lot of chips which have for performance cause this one that switches one of them out what they call a prime core which is even faster than a performance call this combined with a whole number of other changes means that the 855 is up to 45% faster than last generation that's the equivalent of taking the snapdragon 845 which is powering most 2018 flagships and then adding a whole nother snapdragon 800 on top of that in terms of performance for the gpu or graphics processing unit the 855 uses the adreno 640 which is a more conservative upgrade with improvements pegged at around 20 percent not mind-blowing but even the last generation 630 can still play every current game well and there's more to it so qualcomm is now focusing on what they call the snapdragon elite gaming experience which is basically a combination of features that this chip supports like cinematic hdr color grading for games and technologies to reduce dropped frames by 90% so a lot smoother gameplay okay camera and the 855 comes with a massively upgraded computer vision signal processor which is exciting you'll be able to record 4k hdr video at 60 frames per second encode clips into the new hei f file format which would reduce file sizes by 50% and something i'm really curious about is hardware based depth mapping in video this would mean real time object replacement and even portrait mode video at 60 frames per second 5g which to be honest is an even bigger deal than 3g and 4g ever where the a 55 uses snapdragons x 55 g modem which qualcomm have been working on seriously since 2015 shrinking the physical hardware footprint until we now have something that you could hold with one finger and in theory this could mean downloading 4k movies in seconds and streaming pc quality games on the go through the cloud but i say in theory because as with a lot of these things we'll have to wait and see if third-party services can take advantage of it also though wi-fi speeds are getting a push this is the industry's first 802 11 a why platform and what this means is speeds up to 10 gigabits per second which compared to money and current phones on 802 11 ac is almost three times faster the snapdragon 855 actually has the company's fourth iteration of the ai engine but it's only just starting to get serious when it comes to ai tasks on phones with this chip performance is 300% higher which has some more obvious implications like new camera shooting options but also some subtler benefits like noise reduction when talking to your friend all your phones will voice assistant from what i've seen today the ai here is very powerful powerful enough to upgrade the resolution of photos or remove grain or add depth and bokeh effects to images downloaded from the internet ok this is a seven nanometer chip which in of itself means better battery life versus its 10 nanometer counterparts but there's more qualcomm's got what it calls cru wireless tech they're not just reduces bluetooth latency but targets power consumption witnessing to music watching movies and videos will look better than ever as the chip supports hdr 10 plus but also consume less power than before with more efficient video file formats then we've got xr or extended reality which describes virtual reality so powerful it claims to blur the lines between physical and virtual worlds we're talking 8k vr experiences that can run at 120 frames per second and we can't not mention the 3d sonic sensor qualcomm has been working for the last five years on the world's first ultrasonic in-display fingerprint scanner which can take a 3d image of finger ridges and pause and work through grimy sweat and oil and their new chip works with it so throughout the presentation qualcomm has been dropping hints about working with samsung and i'm pretty sure they're talking about the s10 we're gonna see early next year but also completely out of the blue oneplus ceo confirmed that the first phone to be powered by the 855 was going to be a one plus device so that kind of throws a spanner in the works anyway i know this video is a lot to take in but let me know if you have any questions in the comments down below i will be hanging there for a while and as always thank you so much for watching and i'll catch you in the next one [music]
