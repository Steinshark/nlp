so hello everybody i am here with benedict sheehan and talia maria sheahan they are a couple that i've been kind of in my circles for the last several years they're good friends altar with andrew gould that you've seen on this channel they benedict is also participates in the orthodox arsenal but mostly benedict is a composer of sacred music he is also a conductor and he is the director of music at st. econ's seminary and monastery and his wife talia maria is a vocalist and she also teaches music as well but mostly they really work as a team in all kinds of projects and in this discussion we're going to look at a particular project which really i find very fascinating and which is the artifact institute [music] this is jonathan pezzo welcome to the symbolic world oh benedict and charlie maria i will give you a chance to maybe introduce a little bit introduce yourselves a little bit i know that that you are very involved in the community there at santa cons involved just in music in the orthodoxy in general so maybe you can tell us a little bit about the things that you're working on that you've accomplished and we can move into move into the artifact institute as well yeah sure do you want to start oh i'll start okay yeah and be and whenever i speak to anybody i haven't seen before i do i like to explain that i do speak with a step with us when a sister it's not your imagination and i and i also explain to people that i do it deliberately to get attention it's it's been it's been a long-standing tactic of mine and it works beautifully so i'll continue to do it know so yeah so as you said i'm a composer and a conductor and i've i started in in church as a teenager i just started i just began to get interested in the music of the orthodox church my parents were converts to dorothy oxi when i was 9 you wouldn't never have guessed that i would become a church musician i had no interest in satan sake of music at all i really didn't have a lot of interest in church until i was probably 14 when i when i when i when my when my grandmother who was not where they just sent me a recording of a russian male choir singing singing orthodox music and that recording basically kind of changed the whole trajectory about my life and and from that point on i just became interested in music and music of the church but also just music in general and that's kind of set me on the path that i've remained on ever since so i do all kinds of things it's not it's not easy to make a croupier in america as an orthodox church musician that's the understatement yeah so i've done all kinds of things but for the last 10 years i've been as teens antique guns and been really trying to create a job and and and so 10 years later it's really it's kind of the only job of its kind in the country and i'm still trying to bandit but we have we now have a music staff i've got we've we've started up a professional and zombo under the auspices the monastery called the st. egon choir which is the first pro choir in under the auspices of an orthodox institution that's ever been been created here in america and we've made some recordings we just recorded or just in 2019 we recorded my divine liturgy which was a new piece that was commissioned by the petrm institute and that'll be out this coming fall i've started to work with a group on the west coast called couldn't called cappella romana i've been out there and number of times to conduct them and they're gonna be performing my new energy in november with me conducting at least that's so the plan well see if there's still there's still such a thing as alive as live arts come football but let's let's pray that it continues i don't know i i recently finally broke through into the world of choral publishing and got published by oxford this year and and they recorded a piece of mine and there hopefully there's more to come on that front too so i can't even keep track of it all but that's okay one did it one day at a time good problem yeah and one of the things i forgot to mention is that you both of you have seven daughters which is amazing yeah right we have well it was diapers to dating so now it's it's college to preschool so like that's the monolith forward you know it goes on it so no tenors unfortunately well one of our daughters that's the same time she's great not me well i've seen some of the things you've been putting on social media some of the family choir stuff it's really touching to see it's very beautiful you know you're doing different styles as well different traditions and it's it's it's very beautiful and touch it for those of us like for myself who's not very musical you know i like music i'm just not very musical i i have that dream and and i have this vision of you know the family singing together it's very beautiful [music] [applause] [music] [music] yes usually not alone yes it's a really powerful design i mean that's honestly that's one of the things that we found in our work which is you know you can work you can work in in in this sort of like you know the technically kind of high you know high proficiency levels in an art and and that's one kind of way to be and then you can work with beginners and that's another kind of way to be and what we found in in our being here at santino is that partly because of what the vision of the abbot for the sergius on the end of the monastery is and then the mission of the seminary to you know their there's their kind of foam to two sides two cents to different there's exactly they're separate but but they there's such a strong there's such a strong value for liturgy here that partly just because it gets done every day which is almost incomprehensible it's just such a huge job it's an insanely huge job so all the resources that get put into this high-frequency reiteration of liturgy mean that problems get they come up more frequently and they have to be addressed and solved more quickly so if i like to use the metaphor that this is kind of the fruit flies of the liturgical world so we see the evolution of the species as it were at a faster rate and you know so so problems will the community that only serves once a week even literally take them seven times longer to to come up with the problem that comes kinds of problems that come up here right so you know my end of this is that i'm a vocalist and a music teacher and so we kind of tag-team really nicely because i help prepare the individual musicians to be able to work with him and and as he works with them then he brings them to higher and higher levels so we kind of have this cyclical process and they have to go back to you yeah so it's really interesting to see how that combination of work you know just me working with the singers in some abstracted way of trying to get them to sing better be better have better musicianship skills wouldn't have an application and just him working with him on repertoire and trying to get the services done it was kind of you probably hit a plateau and i think a lot of a lot of people who are trying to trying to make beauty in the arts they only have one or another of those things and have to search for the other one on their own and we just i guess providentially just came like ready bundled so another surgeon yes it's definitely responsible for that support i mean it takes a it takes somebody with a vision to support artists in a way that he supports us and the seminary too so we're really lucky in that i mean all great did not maybe not all but a lot of great art statistical work in the of the past has depended really on patronage and on and and to a certain extent that we we get to benefit from that like we're providing a context you know we have to we have to work for our daily bread obviously but but there there's a sense and i think that's one of the things really remarkable about the leadership here is in at any cons is there's a sense that that the work we're trying to do is valuable that we are we're given a context in which to basically figure it out enter to enjoy try to solve problems on trauma on our own and to and to offer what we can draw for new ideas to offer new creative work in that context and i mean we're really as you know as the years go by we really really believe in in this idea of context but you can't just produce art or produce you know do you do anything creative in an in a kind of vacuum or best for yourself i mean you mean there's a certain element that you do it for yourself because that's what you need to do so if you're alone and you're an artist that's what you that's what you do because you need to make art to survive but it's still important like really believe that art is it's about communicating communicating breaking the other and so you do the art because you need to but how much better is it if there's a context in which you can communicate and and in a context where what you wear a will twice your community k is both valued and and and understood yeah yeah that's one of the things that i've let's say even let's say there's this aspect of communication but one of the aspects that i've been trying to emphasize a lot is the idea of participation you know where we have a sense in our culture that art is is a it's something that you look at or something you listen to that it really is a passive it passive act whereas what i'm seeing with what you're doing in terms of choir music in terms of also this artifact institute that we'll talk about is trying to create a laboratory that is not just a laboratory for artists we're making things but the community which is also going to be receiving the fruits of this art right so it's this symbiotic relationship between what's not really a public and the kind of you know modern way of understanding public but is really those who are benefiting who are participating and for kind of collaborating with you to create this this the symbiotic art you know that's in the community like you said that's in a that's being communicated through people but also with them as well oh yeah oh yeah i mean i couldn't i couldn't agree more we i mean the the the the the thing about singing and singing to get to take it together is i mean is that it's it's really it's a really old idea dear people doing this for a very long time like since the beginning of humanity like like some of the oldest some of the the oldest prehistoric artifacts there's the word see we did that see what we did there yeah are are actually musical instruments there's a forty one thousand year old bone flute i can't the name of it escapes me but it will come back at some point but it's actually one of the oldest artifacts that exists and it's a flute like so if if we have that it's not like some guy just had this idea i'm going to make a bone into a flute i mean it's it's got a wasted it's got one place to change the pitch so if we got that it means that it was an older idea than man by far i mean it's a thing that had to be yeah it had to be generated over time over a long period of time you know but but if we've got nobody think about singing is that of course to make music with your voice or to make musical sound to make rhythmic sounds is a thing that's a lot more intuitive than it is then it would be to like to carve an animal bone into a flute so yeah that can't be the only preservation is like isn't our biology so everybody seems to love this so much it's like in contexts where there's no explicit instruction to say we sang like it i don't know like it's soccer games you know or in when people are drinking or wooden people are fighting like what is it about singing that makes it so that that seems to be a reasonable thing to do in such an intensely you know like not terribly celebratory context maybe necessarily but somehow deeply deeply so a so we really believe that is something that's really really deeply rooted in mankind and and it's in that sense it's a part of you just part of what it means to be be to be a person yeah you know that's what people do people think so so to speak about about your idea of art that's participative sorry there's no there's no more kind of fundamental pretty part it's just a stereo art and then when we sing together where does where is the song i mean the song doesn't exist on the on the sheet of music you know it doesn't exist even in the recording it only exists either in the experience of hearing the song or in the act of actually producing this you so in and of itself it's already assumed that there's two people there you know just super inches i think one of the things that really defined i i mean this is to my understanding this is my own speculation is that the real one of the reasons why music is what defines human beings one of the aspects which define us is because it does have to do with patterns it has to do with our capacity to to see but also engage in patterns and so the idea of music it's it's it really is a pure pattern it's one of the purest forms of patterns that you can find you know it's almost mathematical in its purity but then as you said singing together it brings the pattern not only as this kind of mathematical or you know participation in opposites and in variation and all of this but it's also doing it in a way that's creating a social pattern at the same time right so it's it's absolutely together yeah right yeah well i mean it's because it's a pattern but but art like visual arts are patterns kind of in space what's so interesting about music is that it's a pattern in time it turns time into a pattern and that way the liturgical year the cycle of east's and fasts the you know the the width of them of the days of the week you know all of that is in some sense it's a musical phenomenon it's turning time into something rhythmic yeah it is something is something into something ordered something patterned and therefore easy infinitely it's both infinitely various but also but also familiar and it kind of roots itself in the memory and in the experience so in that way i mean it's music my dad used to say that that mike mike my dad was not a musician my dad was very kind of kind of figure and but my dad used to point out that the only arts that we that we know from scripture that that exists in the age to come is music singing right because we know the angels sing and then the song at the end of time and you know all this all the images in revelation we don't know that there's going to be a i can nog rafi we don't know that there's going to be architects is that city there is that whole city you know well there's that it's truly it's an architectural i don't need you i'll give me that yes well it's a but but i do think that there's some like this idea of turning time into a pattern yeah is really important now i think you're right and i think it's interesting because when you read the ancients and they talk about things like the music of the spheres or they talk about music itself and you see this own idea that music was part of the you know the core curriculum of the of the ancients there really is a sense that music is bigger than just even what we understand his music today it really is this this idea of the of the world as being patterned a time being patterned as the whole idea of participating in the patterns you know was you the word music was used to manifest that you know and so but it is in a way the purest form because also because it is spiritual right it's it's non-physical it's not like architecture or like i cannot like images or like objects making a share it is a it is a pure pattern it's a pure pattern that you can pick up you know like you were saying where does it where is the song if i can sing a song in the morning and then i sing the same song at night you know it's like i'm it's the same song but i manifest you know i'm i'm resonating it but the song is this really in this spiritual pattern and so it is a way to it is a way for us to connect to the patterns of the world and to understand also what it is that we mean when we talk about spiritual things no and to your point benedict the idea that we see the angels singing that we have this image of the heavenly choir is also to help us understand that there is a relationship even with principality with angels and with this idea of singing that there that they are manifesting the the pattern back up to god they're kind of you know they're glorifying god by using these patterns and they're also manifesting it to us as we kind of hear this glorious singing of that that is going up to god that's that's beautiful one of the most spectacular things that i enjoy intensely is is the although i don't ever feel really entirely capable of dealing with it is the the closeness of of the soul in the singer and i think i tell until our students but here there's no mistake that the church says that we are to sing in our worship if that is not accidental it's not because we didn't have the resources to have instruments or something like that that's huh so the singing not because it's not because it's so the the the experience of trying to you know expressing the ideal of a certain kind of sounds in singing it's entirely individualized the ideal of a singer's voice is totally peculiar to that individual because what makes up that voice is totally you know the unique shapes and sizes of the various pieces of tissue and so yeah well let alone there's their psychology so it's just the act of trying to find the ideal voice for every individual is it a personal dream and when you then try and actually use those tools to their most efficient and most effective and most beautiful end what you invariably come up against are are are the you know basically your rooms and so i joke that i'm so sorry all my students but your voice lesson is a therapy session and it's even worse than therapy because in therapy you can be like yeah the next time i come up against this difficulty i am going to behave this way that's how i want to be that's the ideal i'm gonna shoot for well in a voice lesson there is no the next time is right that second and if you don't do it you'll be able to tell that you didn't do it and you will be disappointed and you will have to try the immediate second actors dude yet to do it again it's like the most real time were self like you know soulcraft hmm that i have found in in frankly any of my teaching and then when you get a bunch of people trying to do that and then frankly that process sounds a heck of a lot like repentance like active repent you get a bunch of people individuals trying to do that who come together to then try and do that at the same time towards the same end that's why seeing it together with people it's transcendent hmm that's that's exceptional and so you know part of our work here has been to say and and to be completely honest a lot of people who feel feel drawn to the church don't sara lee feel that way because they feel like they're good you know i'm fine uncomfortable with who i am this is great they they want more for themselves and sometimes that wanting more is it is a once is a desire to share with other people and then you get a pastoral impulse well a lot of those folks don't tend to have the let's just be blunt the requisite ego to be able to actually use their bodies confidently and and that's why kind of you know the performer is is this almost a psychological type you have to have a huge amount of actual psychological and physical confidence to be able to make a good sound and so the process of trying to get people who are already somewhat inclined towards self criticism or somewhat inclined towards putting themselves definitely second in you know it in order to care for others or feel like what they're being told by by the two churches they have too bad too or they have to basically like that the idea that there for us to repent and have humility it means that we have to tell ourselves that were bad mm-hmm that is we i just this is this is like these are actual impediments to doing the job and you know it's stuff like this that you wind up coming up against when you have to sing together every day four hours a day and you have to sing better so what we found in our work here and you know i think it's possible that educational institutions and even you know educational institutions that are founded in a church community which there ought to be more they they could come up against these these issues and try and figure out how to solve them just as we have but we have this advantage of the frequency so the other thing is like when you sing you you you know why you can't pretend that you're all together there's no i mean like there's a certain tact sorry there's a certain way in which you do have to pretend when you because he and if you don't feel like the you know the the thing that that you're singing about you still have to act like you do but but in terms of the active actually singing well there's no way to pretend that you're single so it's it's like so but but like we have this thing in like in the church i think we're we're like like when we can eat certain extent we can pretend to be really spiritual and and and and we can can do all kinds of other things that aren't really spiritual at all but we think that they are it looks like they are and so we can get by and like we can all be really religious wow but then when we try to sing it's like a note not it's not happening pretending they're yeah right so that's a great thing too it's like if we all if we all worked a little bit more to keep together i'm trying to single see well then then we might find that we can solve some of our other problems too interesting so we we kind of got artifact from this process of continually coming how do people come to us and say please help me please please help me and maybe tell us what tell us what artifact we don't give us a sense of what it is because cuz i i know what it is but i want people to get a sense of what it is because it's a it's a very fascinating mission it's one which just makes so much sense when i saw it so so please tell us what it is and then and then we can put in there the story a little bit of how it came about absolutely yeah well okay so the artifact institute is a collective what we're connie is is a collective of a culture appropriators in in in very basic terms it's a company that we found it in in the past six months no time yeah i don't know especially now who knows what dated oh gosh what's every day is this the same you talk about them rhythmic the rhythmic ordering of time but there is no written so so we we kind of started with the idea and this is evolved out of our discussions with our friend and colleague nick guitar and also to some extent but better on with with with with bishop alexis who is he lives it's in 2d guns he's an elected bishop and yeah to kind of figure out a way to solve what we think of as the problem let's say the problem of context we're religious yes but we we all kind of understand that nobody can be religious all the time or you know or there has to be you know they're there as an evan full blow to life there's an ebb and flow to the week there's an evan flow to your own lifetime and we go to church but but it's like what do you do with the rest of your time or you know so it doesn't mean oh should my should the rest of my week start to look like church is it not the idea is like well people have tried that we've read that it's not it's not really the answer and i don't think it's just animal for most people or maybe for anybody interestingly that's not what the life of the monastics here necessarily i don't think that's what even a wife in a monastery maybe some people can sustain that but so it's like well what do you do with the rest of your time and we're also starting with this question if like we have a church but where is the church what's around it where where did what's the context of the church and so one of the things we came to realize is that a church exists in a culture it's not just a thing that stands on its own it's it's a you know it's in the churches in a town that the town is in a region the region is in a country but but it's like so what is it that sustains the life of the church well it's it's a culture and and in the past that the whole idea of culture kind of evolved and a lot of what we think of as culture is just the way either people have grown and adapted and evolved to live to get together to work together to eat each other in great part just so they don't die it's not some lofty ideal right so we so we form a town we form a tribe we form a village so we so we can eat so we can be safe so we can raise our children in our tribe our species if you know i don't anybody then it's a thing like that but but you know so that it can continue to continue we now in our time have this really interesting problem problem yeah and i get again aids it's all precarious a certain extent but but we've we have we've managed to solve a lot of the kind of practical problems of humanity and we are continuing to solve them i mean that's what we're doing right now i mean infectious disease was just a part which is too part of life for all of our for all the time you know and the idea that it would just wipe out a quarter of the third or half the population was just understood like that could occur what what sweatsuit really interesting is that we have a lot of tools and a lot of systems and mechanisms to actually like for us if they like that's not the norm that's not what is going to occur or a little at least we're trying to make it be that and i think to a great extent where we're we're being able to just accept you see but what's interesting is that's a new thing like humanity's never really cool cool pull this off before and and so and i just i use that as an example of the ways in which like most of us know most of humanity most of the time has enough to eat most of us have a place to live most of us have you know in cents a week we're we've managed to create a remarkably secure danville society all over the world and we're you know it's still a work in progress obviously but but compared to basically every other time it's pretty it's pretty miraculous so we know since like we don't have to have a village or a tribe in order to survive i from day to day that's a remarkable thing but that's introduced a new problem which is that we now because so many of our needs are provided for we don't know what we're doing with our lives we don't know where we belong we don't know we don't have to connect with other people in order to eat in order to not be destroyed by a by a band of marauders so you know but yeah so but yet were then we don't have to connect with you people so we don't connect with you people we don't do things with other people we don't eat to get together we don't sing to get it's okay it's okay together we don't celebrate together we don't really work to keep take you take you can take gather and right now in the midst of warranting that's more true than it ever has been but so but we find that as a result of that we're like really missing some key things what kind of dying inside and so what we think of is that the patent past the phenomenon of culture kind of created itself out of necessity but now we actually have to create culture still out of necessity but but a different a different kind we needed to do it in order to know who we are in order to know where we in order to know what the purpose of our life is in order to you know to connect with others just you know if it's different for our stoles to survive so that's part that's kind of the big picture idea of like well so if we're going to create these things we're gonna like deliberately create culture rather than it just being able to a curb on its own how would that be done well you know to a certain extent initiative scale too right so what we also have in this time of rather extraordinary you know practical resources is insanely high quality entertainment and i don't mean that like just you know really really produce stuff is amazing i mean that the actual technical level of your average piano students is considerably higher even just in this past i don't know 40 50 years yeah then then it previously was and you know recordings we have of really you know exceptional ensembles from the early 20th century they're kind of like okay it's it's powerful its emotive it's really beautiful now we but technically it's like a little black yeah i mean i think musicians are better now on the average so they were right so but the funny thing is that we have this sense of all of this culture creating being the responsibility of a specialized class and and that being a responsibility of a specialized class has given the success this exceptional entertainment but we didn't realize what we were trading for that sort of exceptional resource we didn't realize that it was actually sort of psychologically and spiritually necessary for us to be working at this ourselves not in order to kind of like take down the ideal but we all were supposed to be working choices not to be on them no yeah but it's so it's so we can know how to spend our time yeah but it's it's it's shocking because in quebec you know we had a very traditional culture not very long ago and you know my grandparents you know in their generation there they would still you know take the table out of the living room get the local fiddle guy to come in and you know call the dance and it was just a normal part of of life you know that you would do during the holidays you to do for special occasions and that is gone right so now you get a dj to come and play recorded music you know you you dance but you don't dance together you everybody dances individually so all the manifestations of culture are showing us that the problem that you talked about which is in our in our moment of self-sufficiency also in our moment of our desire to move away from meaning and move towards you know just this kind of material wealth we've lost something we've lost this togetherness yeah so so in that circumstance you were going to admitting that that is an ideal that you like like it pulls at your heart somehow if you are gonna try and reproduce that that what what is the first question that would come to you if i was gonna try to reproduce that i would have i would be completely lost in every manner like i would be lost in exactly like how to do exactly how can i do that you know and i mean like i don't just mean technically i mean like how to do it in terms of even one getting people to want it like even that is already the first beginning and then getting myself to want it deeply i can want it intellectually but to put the effort into like diet whoa that's a whole other world so so sorry yeah to me it's like it feels like that world is completely lost so the easiest way to navigate those treacherous waters is with a guide and that is what our collective is we because a we're pedagogues so not only are we working in a specialized sort of like you know we work in the professional world and that really that we could devote all our time and energy to that and we would still be struggling and there's no question about that there's no end how good you can get see but then it's kind of like you know the the which is not to say i think we're prophets but there's a certain job that a prophet has in a community it's like go find some go have some revelation go have some exalted experience and then you better go back to your community and be able to communicate that experience right because how the heck else is everybody gonna know what they're supposed to be working towards and you need to demonstrate it you need to model it you need to explain it with language and so we're trying to assemble a desert extends we have to do task analysis on ourselves we have to simplify how do we do that and then we're trying to assemble the technique that's required in the team that it exactly well the team to communicate that to be able to guide people in this process of being able to just work just have one experience just have one experience of this stuff you're lacking and you don't have to change your life just do it once and then maybe do it again right and so what we've worked towards creating our arc it's kind of a couple tiers of activity one there's the educational tier where we really assembly kind of break down what what is is necessary for the taking the first steps in any of these we call them elements and then being able to impart that now whether that's one-on-one instruction or or creative in a social context in which the technique can have life and you know what you said about how to get yourself to want to do it and how to get other people to want to do it we all know the awkwardness of a party where you're really not sure why you're there so it's like well i guess let's just drink because that will know me the question of what were you can do right [laughter] you know it's like we think like people drink too much at a party but i mean that can be fun too but you know people drink too much of parties because they're partying too much but actually we contend that they do it because they're not partying not because they're using alcohol to do all kinds of other things that like but actually like like thinking that there were listening to a story or doing doing a contra dance or playing an instrument or playing game or you know even sitting on the edge the party is important in a room that's well decorated you know carefully fire and you know again like so we were using like a single thing to do the job of all those other things so i saw oranges is the first big event that we hosted was in louisville and it was in in january and it was over the feast of of kemalists of entry of the lord into the temple and we mean meaning i the one of the really extraordinary insights that our our friend fish of alexis brought to the process of coming up with with this was his experience of being on mount athos and he was a monk on lonely mountain for a little over a decade and he explained you know how do you get people who come from different different cultures different countries speak different languages to suddenly live in an immersive way together and have that kind of cohesion that you really need in order to survive that environment and he said there were three aspects of life there and that was the common worship and that was what everything was founded on and then out of that flowed the common work and then from that and not least of the three was the common feast and so we took that formula and bishop alexis said his experience was that was present at every level of his monastic life and we took that formula and we we thought okay could we do this over a limited period of time in a pedagogical way but also a way that feels complete in you know a remote location and so partly because of the extraordinary sort of resources of that community st. michael's st. michael the archangel into jochen church in louisville and partly because of the assembly of people instructors and students that came together there be almost 200 people that you know we're part of the the weekends program first yeah really it surprised almost all of us with both its intensity and its advocacy really so so the good news is that yeah we can practice this we can get better which is really encouraging you know yeah i mean we do a number of things under the artifact brand we as a team go and do to do church music workshops in various parishes we've also started to publish we created a song book of 12 essential folk songs that we think are good for kind of a home gathering for a party or songs you can sing with you or with your friends or your cute kids and we're gonna do more with that we're probably gonna make a recording to promote that i think you know people would like to learn from from recordings and that's really for as those of us who really can't read music when i say to you okay i feel like i can actually engage with this now because the prints i was like okay this is not for me that's that's an entry point into the song but there's a lot of other place to go and by far the more the more common way to learn a song for all of human history was advised by ear so so yeah so we're gonna help we're gonna try to work on that we're gonna do consulting work where we go into a community we speak with them i work with them and we talk about some things they can do and we will even put on put on some kind of an event or else except coach them in that but we also want to they're there they're there to be some really like some magnet events where a lot of people can come from from all over and that's what we started louisville and the plan is to do it again in 2021 where we can bring a bottle upp together we and at that event we well you should talk about the kind of the today i think that's a good way yeah yeah that common common worship come and work come and feast thing you know that can happen over a long on multiple scales so the we structured it so that every day began with worship of me we sang in small chunks the karthus glory got for all things which is kind of an exceptional piece especially for the board what's going on right now and you know remarkable that it was composed by someone who was it really is a very it's very powerful for the modern it's a masterpiece i think yeah and it's actually i actually believe it's in a three-act structure that mirrors the cathartic journey of the heat yeah i actually contend that the compass is alright write it up benedict said on our symbolic girl ugh there go ahead yes we started with that in the morning and part of the community is what's wrong about it to a certain sense is architecture so they have some really amazing spaces that do what spaces are supposed to do they tell you what you are supposed to do in that who you are and where you belong and i've heard you say that before jonathan like it's like this the most significant art be in a sort of sleeper way because we don't know what to do with we're in a space that's telling us to do one thing but you know do a different thing so so we were in a beautiful space that really showed us that what we were supposed to do you know be be still and pray and that's why we started our day and then the rest of the honorees the work hours then we went to even went to breakfast and then we did a group a group singing a group alright so we did the morning the morning singing and that had yeah it was awesome partly because what our goal i mean i've heard only good things about that event i've heard just amazing people just really excited about it and i myself feeling very lonely and like you know peace and sanity we need to do so don't worry don't worry yeah no that but the the morning sing was interesting because one of the one of the weird things is that if you want to have a celebration where something is some corporate activity happens that celebration can't be a new thing there has to be some memory that that that celebration is founded on that's the kind of like oh we do this so we had to teach the people there that these were songs they sang so that when it came time for the party they could be like oh we should sing our songs but it took several days of right of imparting that and and holding their hands through that process for them to then think okay these are our songs and then that's singing of them at the party which was the final kind of you know capstone experience not not remotely the high point it was just another of the many high points kind of it felt natural and that was that was kind of an interesting process pedagogical process for us because because just like you said you wouldn't know how to do a thing that you didn't do hmm if you don't do a thing then how do you start doing a thing that's a barrier that i think so many people come up against when they try to make they want to make their lives more beautiful but that analogous memory thing like oh it's gotta be like another my grimm my grandparents knew how to do this but i don't and none of my friends do and none of my family does so what do we do so in a sense it has to be taught again or anew i don't know about again as we taught a new things for us and for our time and it seems like the way you're doing it in the sense that you're building up and you're actually creating the experience of of learning and then rejoicing in the thing you've learned it seems like it's a nice little microcosm of of how it can work on a bigger scale you know because like i said because it's lost we can't it's harder for us to access the bigger scale one so building these small scale ones you know can can let's say layer up and hopefully create bigger ones i think it's a great it was super super exciting to see it work so well it worked better than we actually thought it was gonna work which and so then after the morning saying we would all dispersed to the various disciplines that we were working and so there was there was true painting fir for confer conductors there was a there was there was a program for singers there was a program for writers and storytellers and that's about as far as we were able to do but to go with this first one but we'd like to do more and then we would come back together at some point in the day direction of the choir rehearsals and we were preparing for a concert and then for four versus service on sunday morning for the feast of the meeting of the lord and then the concert was actually a narrative program or nibble winning because our thought he worked together with with date with the other writers in the workshop to prepare a narrative of the life of st. simeon mm-hmm more or less made up based on some of the things we have from older documents and then and then we interspersed it with music sung by fire which was made up of a bunch of different piece of people the big car was actually about to have an ep with people and then there was a smaller chamber group which was about 30 and then there were 13 pros who were kind of the core and then that each of them sang a different thing and and the whole thing had a narrative and the argument what nikki do nikolas noticed was that there was a symbol yeah there was symbolic structure of the hero's journey in the sequence of vespers okay and so the actual service of vespers could be melded with the story that he wrote about st. simeon and had the the sequence of hymnography in it actually followed the arc of his life and that was an exceptional experience because real are our feeling was like okay yeah we're gonna do a thing it's best for is there's all these words but we wanted to try and reawaken and choose uri enchant vespers and we had to find the symbolic language in the service in order to really do that and bring it into a narrative and it was really powerful it was really amazing it began with the procession where people rolling candles and singing and there was incense and dance and the whole church was dark and then we persist up to the front and we lit everybody candles and the narrator begins and then all the lights come on when the fire began to sing - sing rachmaninoff and it was it was pretty awesome i mean it's for the epic so we did that i think that when venom and then on the next day we had we we had the liturgy and the whole choir sang for the liturgy and the student conductors who they also helped to conduct in the liturgy and then and the end of it all we had the big feast and we we worked all through the day to prepare the sort of base to go in full formal forage for reader ii we brought in we were ironing the tablecloths and putting out the candles and setting up plates all under the expert instruction of an hour conviviality instructor amanda jacobs who is a designer interior decorator and designer and who liked that task analysis thing well you know these fancy things this china have in my cabinet that's not for me to use i wouldn't even know how to use it so part of her job and everybody participated in this partly because we're trying time to tell people is that this is this is you know this is amazing i approach it's such a great idea to have people prepare the feast at the themselves you know and like iron the the tablecloth put out the you know put out the the decorate the tables do all that so that it feels like this is our fee this is not stop something's gonna go into a hotel lobby like a hotel greeting room and we just sit at the table and that's it it's like this is something intense you have to have all three elements common worship so we all can get to get the key together in some way express what what is our ideal what do we believe in what are we aiming at and then then go port city became continue drinking together and we all sweat and you know so we know we do so disappointing but but but but also the bonds that you create when you work to get together are very strong you know people when we will work to keep it together we meet a people in a much deeper way than if we're just having a chat or you know so we we work together we know somebody has to also hold the ladder while the other person that puts up the candles that we hung from the ceiling and you get your hands dirty and you you know like there's a there's a lot of bonds that you form as a community when you when you do it when you do tasks to get to get together and really you know we're in a specific and clear way and then we do all that and then we all go back and we and we get and and we put our nice party clothes on and we come back to get together and the room is lit with candles and there's the bay playing and there's champagne and everybody's just like you know just like just you know the the kind of the reaction when people walked into the room was just the kind of gasp like this is so beautiful it's like it's like i didn't realize that i deserved to be treated like this or to treat myself like that's a powerful that's a powerful thing and then so we all sit down do we know so we print print pray people gave toasts people told stories people read palms we sang songs we actually did contra dancing they did arabic bogdan dancing it was pretty spectacular and so we were there for like four hours and native-like like he didn't want ya you didn't know how much time and time time passed differently yeah but it would have been it wouldn't have had that transcendent values we hadn't all been working towards an ideal that we shared that we articulated together and and that you know we all agreed upon sort of implicitly and then shared and and that's the context that a church comes from i mean that that's what creates a church and and so we we see left over in society we see the churches with the foundation's underneath them eroding out from them so what we're trying to say to people is that okay so maybe you don't live in a village anymore but those things that people did in that were expressions of how their interaction on a sort of micro level on we're it important we can still do that we have to modify our technique and we have to have conversations with experts and with artists and the culture creators and with you know thinkers about how we modify it because the each new age the the technique changes because the tools change in the context stage but there are these sort of fundamental needs that we need to address and at working together we'll come up with a way more you know authentic expression and it's just we let some elite class do this for us what do they know about us but how can they act we meet our peculiar needs you know hollywood can't produce all the stories we have to tell some of our own right exactly yeah yeah exactly and then and i like i always say the story that hollywood they they tell us the stories they're not our stories we don't participate in them we don't feel like they are that they connect to us in the way that my story you know or hearing the story of a friend you know all of these stories are stories that you engage with that you that you can pray for the other person that you you have this real interact and it's a it's a real interlocking of stories you know and there's nothing wrong with entertainment versions or the you know i love this story we need to not be fighting with the other that's yeah yeah greed right because like you need like it's like in this whole debate or now about like how do we do because a lot of us couldn't go to church for easter and you know we had the option to sit and watch a whole 5 stream of church but in my mind it's like it's like church you know i like even being in church it's already in some sense it's a virtual reality because because of the whole the whole like all the liturgical stuff we do is always encoded symbols and these and these stylized representations of things which are all incense to create this this this idea of the kingdom of god and so that's already in my mind it's already vr you know and and and when it's really well done it's really powerful when it's not well done it's not as great but but but like if i was like i couldn't wrap my mind around then watching a virtual version of that it's it was too far removed news to me from reality and so so we were more so our idea was to to actually to create an order that revolves around a meal and and and and and prayers at the me all around we kind of made a ritual of putting on the clothes that you would have prayed over easter we visualize decorating at the table and and and the bringing out of the food and certain prayers to go with certain parts of them you know and then you know it's to make basically that's what we can do on our own we can make these to deal a bigger and more meaningful experience and so that's what we did we actually created an order of that together with visuals of lexus and one of the priests monks at st. akon's and when we put in and we and then we and then we and then we made that available to to to people everywhere and it actually got approved by the by this by the synod a bishops actually since they actually that's amazing i'm angry and and they were thing confused in australia and in south africa and in germany and in the uk and all over canada so this is the sense of like we we can because already was like let's see why wouldn't worship and easter look like if it grew out of our own experience yeah so so that's what was so really it i think it work so we did that because i feel like it's really important that we not just do church because that's what we because that's what we do and i it's like like church the worship of the church is a wonderful and beautiful thing but it didn't just come from nowhere it didn't just it didn't just get dropped out of the sky even if somebody able to believe that it really didn't you know it's it involves out of culture elves out people of people being together and having relationships and then trying to find god and to know god and to love god that's where worship football from you know but but if we don't take part in that if we don't have a sense of of that evolution if we don't have a sense of where it fits into the into the rest of our lives i really worry it becomes just something that's totally imaginary song is totally totally artificial or at least just totally detached yeah though our sense is so you know we have to kind of reconnect those things well i think it's a i'm really excited to see we're going to this i really i all the things i've seen have been beautiful i think that that you've thought out the method and also to kind of take people by the hand and just kind of guide them through and so and i think it's a it's really a testimony to your to your own family to your own community that you have the strength at this time and kind of the the resources to bring this together and so i want to encourage everybody to to go i'll be posting the links in the description artifact you'll see also the the downloads that they have and the different resources that that they're putting together hopefully when all of this chaos of virus it goes away they'll also be event and i will definitely be going at at the next event because i'm really excited also i this project well you well it's i mean it needs you we need you well thank you because i feel like i need exactly what you're doing so i i just i it's just it's also really exciting for for for me to see because we kind of started having small collaborations who orthodox art journal and you know different people work on different things and it's just exciting to see us like with nicholas kotar and yourselves and myself and andrew and all these different people that we're on the same track we all have our different little version of it we all have different vision but we you kind of understand the problem in similar ways and so it's great to feel like we're even if we're not together physically that we're we're a team in a certain way that we're kind of working in the same in the same direction so it's that's exciting exactly well i think that's i think at least my my i i'm optimistic that that's a sign that it's from is something from god mmm that that that were we're all being coordinated it that we're all being coordinated in some ways like in ways that we can't see or even understand but it's like oh wow we're all doing the same thing how did that how did that come about you know i think that's pretty neat and hop on the same train alright guys so i'm gonna we're gonna keep an eye on all of this and hopefully in in a year or whatever we can have another discussion and track how everything has been going so i'm looking forward to that as well awesome look forward to it thanks so much thank you talking to me i really liked it thanks
