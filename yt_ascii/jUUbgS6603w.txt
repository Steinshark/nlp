many people see samsung as the titanic and confusing business conglomerate in south korea known to be so dominant that some called the country the republic of samsung but for many years the country's economic development was not led by samsung but rather its competitor hyundai you might have heard the hyundai motor group a massive company making about 96 billion dollars in 2020 and you might even have one of their cars in your parking lot it is the main cash cow of the hyundai family of businesses but there are others as well hyundai heavy industries is the largest shipbuilding company in the world just ahead of rival mitsubishi heavy industries its shipyard and ulsan is one of the biggest in the world hyundai engineering construction is one of the oldest businesses in the family having pulled off a wide range of ambitious construction projects across its history and is currently owned by the automotive group other large but unrelated businesses include a marine and fire insurance company an elevator company and a department stores company all in all there are over 50 individual hyundai businesses and it's all quite confusing and i hope you guys can keep up the interesting thing about these businesses is that most of them are not legally connected to each other in a group structure quote-unquote the same way it is with samsung the hyundai group broke up in 2000 but most of the remnants are still run by relatives of the original founder chengju yong let's talk about them founder chung joo young started hyundai in 1946 with a single little business hyundai motors they did not make any cars but instead did repair and maintenance for u.s soldiers stationed in south korea at the time the next year he founded hyundai engineering construction and magically received government contracts to build port facilities roads and military camps all across south korea they learned quickly while on the job within a decade building ambitious construction projects like the han river footbridge construction project in 1957 the gyeongbu express highway one of korea's most important in 1968 and the seoul subway in 1974. by 1965 hyundai determined that they had enough experience to go abroad they gained a reputation for taking on ambitious projects with risk few other businesses would take this included the patani narath award highway in thailand in 1966 the arab shipbuilding yard in bahrain in 1975 and the immense jubal industrial port in saudi arabia in 1976 at the time the biggest port construction project in the 20th century other businesses were founded to serve the needs of the court construction business including hyundai elevator and shipbuilding chung figured that if they were building ports and facilities for the middle easterners then they might as well also build the ships that served them from there the hyundai family grew to dozens of companies hyundai automotive made great strides starting with putting together car kits from ford but eventually learning enough to create the first independently designed and built korean car the pony in 1976. they entered the u.s market in 1986 with the xl to build these cars hyundai worked with mitsubishi and other companies across the world first licensing their technologies before replacing them with their own designs by 1991 the company's cars were made with one hundred percent domestic technologies chong young won contracts by setting ambitious goals that seemed almost impossible at first glance artificial crisis to him was not a crisis but a motivational tactic that forced the company to adopt novel technologies and techniques to learn while doing and to work like dogs for example the government budget for the aforementioned gumbu express highway was 68 million dollars but hyundai declared that they could do it for 38. the project was delivered 5 million under budget but when things fell short of expectations chengu young serviced his customers well by keeping to his work they lost money on the thailand project being over a hundred thousand dollars over budget but the company ate the costs themselves in return received more projects over time but there are plenty of companies who learned quickly and made big promises the foundation to hyundai's success was allying closely with the park chung administration as the government embarked on its heavy and chemical industrialization drive in the 1970s together with samsung and lg hyundai consulted closely with the government and receive financial subsidies and loan guarantees for growth has the industrial drive shifted from shipbuilding to electronics to other industries hyundai or other big cheby were there to take advantage they rode this wave to become one of the biggest companies in the world the break up the hyundai group during the asian financial crisis in 1997 is the classic tale of overreach simply put the company over leveraged itself and was forced by investors and creditors to break up the trouble started when the founder chongju hyung ran for the presidency in 1992. hyundai backed it with everything they got with much of the membership and chung's party coming from the company he lost and when you come at the king you best not miss world's biggest surprise that hyundai's contracts and subsidies mysteriously vanished during the next administration no new projects no raising funds via government guaranteed bonds and no starting new companies this lets samsung catch up and so they did there should have been an opportunity for hyundai to prune and get profitable but instead they chose to wait it out they developed a super close relationship with the next kim daejeong administration and its sunshine policy with hyundai starting economic partnerships with north korea to support hyundai borrowed and spent wildly to catch up to samsung they grew immensely even coming out ahead of samsung revenue wise but profit wise lost trillions of won the north korean businesses lost immense amounts of money the conglomerate craved outside capital to keep going and when the markets cut them off in 2000 the company was forced by its creditors to break apart beyond all of this debt was a succession crisis the founder chongju young had five brothers and 11 children including eight sons has the debt crisis mounted they fought amongst each other for the most profitable businesses by mid-2000 hyundai had shrunken from 89 businesses down to 53. the creditor banks forced the family to give up controlling rights to a number of businesses including hyundai construction did the hyundai group really break up as i mentioned earlier much of the individual companies are still being run by the relatives of the founder and with hyundai motors being the second biggest single company in south korea after samsung electronics hyundai heavy industries company being the biggest ship builder in the whole world you can probably argue that the group is still alive and well today but one thing that is for sure true is that hyundai's major stumbles in 2000 ended his rivalry between it and samsung samsung retrenched to the crisis and came out stronger than ever before while hyundai lost a lead and fell behind hyundai electronics could not compete and samsung electronics went on to dominate the world all right everyone thanks for watching that's it for tonight if you want
