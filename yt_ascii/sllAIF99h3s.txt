[music] ever since it first came out in 1988 super mario bros 3 has been regarded as one of the finest games for the nes and one of the most well-polished platformers in video game history it took everything the first two mario games had and improved upon it more levels more power-ups better graphics and deep feeling of exploration and adventure that was difficult to come by on the original nes popularized in the movie the wizard warp whistles are scattered across the early worlds that will help you progress to later worlds and levels more quickly by getting them using them and breathing through the rest of the game it's possible to beat the game in just a few minutes given the game's short length when exploited in this way the record for the fastest completion has gotten quite a bit lower over the years and today we're going to look at the progression for a game that has seen incredible execution from some unbelievable runners with a little bit of controversy mixed in this is the world record progression for super mario bros 3. [music] the player starts off a being dropped into world one where the first challenge of the run is seen the p meter this part fills up when the player runs on the ground any instance they are not running on the ground will begin to decrease it until it gets to zero once it fills up you gain piece speed the fastest method of running in the game techniques used to get p-speed faster can be incredibly challenging and are a crucial part of running the game while in world 1 the player will pick up two warp whistles one behind the screen here are level 1-3 and one in the castle level by flying up above the screen and going into a hidden door using both of these warp whistles at the same time allows the player to warp all the way ahead to world 8. once arriving there the first two levels are long auto scrollers in the second one it's crucial to pick up a fire flower which will come in handy later the next map screen you go to is by far the most notorious in the game there are five squares on the ground two of them you pass over but the other have hands that can randomly pull you down each of the three squares has a 50 chance of pulling you down when you pass over it and if it pulls you down you're forced to play through a bonus stage wasting 15 to 20 seconds for a world record run you need to have none of these hands pull you down which has gotten nicknamed no hands unfortunately there's only a one in eight chance of passing over all of these hands without any of them pulling you down that means that close to ninety percent of the time no matter what you do your run will end at this screen it's garnered the reputation as one of the biggest run killers in all of speed running after that are a couple more really tricky stages 8-1 and 8-2 and another couple of auto scrollers and finally bowser's castle when you face bowser at the end you'd normally have to just wait for him to break the floor when he jumps but if you have the fire flower you picked up in the second auto scroller then you could just beat him by pouring fireballs into him it's been known for years now that this was the fastest way to get through the game but it wasn't until more than 15 years after the game's release until it was really brought to everyone's attention on the internet in the early ages of speedruns hardly anything was known about them all anybody ever saw of them were grainy vhs quality runs that were passed around online giving people a kick seeing their favorite games beaten in unfathomable times around the time this was happening 2003 speedruns were far less optimized than they are today although some difficult tricks were done it's nothing like what you see now but then a video started floating around that changed everything [music] so [music] the total time of this run ended up being about 10 minutes and 57 seconds how could somebody play this well the person was flying through every level completely destroying the game they even bounced off of dozens of items in a row in the auto scrollers to collect a bunch of one ups for no reason at all how is that possible somebody even uploaded the video to youtube a couple of years later under the title some guy beats super mario bros 3 in 11 minutes all around the internet people discuss the throne was a real thing or not nobody could be that good at a video game right some thought it was real others claimed that somebody had edited every single frame of video together to make it look legitimate nobody could figure it out as it turns out the run was not a human playthrough it was a tool assisted speedrun by tasser morimoto completed in november of 2003 on a japanese realm of the game for anybody who doesn't know what a tool assisted run is it's basically when somebody goes in an emulator and manually inputs which buttons they want to be pressed on every frame of the run this is done to both manipulate luck such as the hands in world 8 and of course to make the execution look beautiful but the bottom line was this run was not played by a human the creator of the task was open about it being a task even posting about it on their own web page explaining what it was but for thousands of people they felt that they were cheated they believed that somebody had actually done a run that looked that impressive so finding out that it was not a legitimate playthrough felt like a stab in the heart while it's clear now which runs our tool assisted and which are human playthroughs and the two communities collaborate with each other all the time this run led the tensions between the speed running and task community that lasted for several years in terms of real-time playthroughs the first run of that kind that we'll be looking at was done in 2004 by a guy named richard ureta yoretta was known for running a few nes games back then namely mega man 2 but from his description it sounds like he may have been inspired by the tool assisted run to run mario 3 as well his run done on july 23 2004 ended up being at 11 14. since it was done on an ntsc card instead of a japanese one the run didn't have to wait for the slow fade into each level that's present in the japanese version so it gained a few seconds from morimoto's tool-assisted run the run appeared to be pretty solid throughout ureta's only major mistake was getting hit in 8-2 and losing his fire flower this run would end up standing for close to three years it wasn't until june of 2007 until a man named freddie anderson would be able to beat it anderson using the nickname frezzy man took the time down to an 1107. although still saying that was a good run frezzie admitted that the run was far from perfect there were sections that he could improve such as not getting p-speed in 8-1 and in the final castle but one thing that he did have over uretta was that he never got hit anywhere in another he did a clip in bowser's castle here to save a few seconds but little did anybody know this would not be the loss that we would see of the frezzy man the next person to get the record is a legend in the mario community who has been given the nickname the king of mario on numerous occasions that's right i'm talking about andrew g 1990 in 2009 two years after frasier's 1107 androgyny beat him by just one second getting 1106. his was very similar to frezzy's run he too missed getting p-speed in 8-1 but thanks to precise movement in other areas he was able to take the record from him a few months later though in october of 2009 frezzy did something absolutely insane he beat andrew g's run by 13 seconds he beat morimoto's original task time in real time how did he do it although to the untrained eye his run looks very similar to andrews there are little things he did everywhere to save small amounts of time for example in 1-2 he got p-speed earlier by running on the ground for as long as possible before this long pipe in 1-3 he did a small jump over this koopa to once again get p-speed faster andrew wasn't able to get p-speed at all in 8-1 while frezzie did so part way through the level in the first sport which was of world viii frezzy gets into the door protected by the blocks much quicker than andrew and in the last level of the game frezzy cleaned up a couple of places that andrew did not do perfectly this run by frezzy really looked to be a perfect run there really just seemed to be no mistakes anywhere and everybody wondered if it would ever be beaten including the man who freshly took the record from andrew g four years passed and nobody was able to get close to it but in 2013 one man thought he would be up to the task of taking fressy's run down well known today he was just one of many small speedrunners back then his name is mitch flower power mitch got really really good at mario 3. after putting thousands of attempts in he was able to get real close to frezzie's time he got at 10 53.87 while the world record was 1053.2 [ __ ] i beat it by a millisecond [ __ ] i got a 1053.87 god damn it but there was something strange going on he was doing better strategies than frezzy he was jumping over the orb in the world 1 4 to maintain p-speed maintaining p-speed in the world 8-4 better and flipping through this wall in bowser's castle to further progress into the level these tricks combined should have saved a few seconds over frezzy and mitch's execution of the rest of the game was just as good as well but his times were all slower why was that for a while though that was put aside as mitch did finally end up beating frezzie's time on july 4th 2013. he had beaten a run that has been called practically impossible to beat and he was the new champion of mario 3. and not long after he lowered it by another second down to 10 50. man like i don't get it but like but shortly after this the answer that mitch was looking for was revealed you see he had been playing his runs on the wii virtual console version of super mario bros 3. the wii runs at a slower frame rate than the nes about 59.8 frames per second versus the nes is 60.1 frames per second while this doesn't sound like much it adds up over the course of an 11 minute run and ends up losing the runner close to 2 seconds so what that meant was that had mitch been playing on a real nes he would have broken the record much earlier his 1053.87 would have beaten it by a second and a half and his most recent record of the time 10 50.97 was close to a 10 48. naturally mitch decided a couple of things one he needed to buy an nes to play on and two the time needed to go lower after taking time to get the records in some longer categories of smb3 that i might cover in a future video mitch got back to any percent in late 2013. in december he got the first sub 1050 but he cut it close the time was 1049.99 by this point such minor things like how much the hammer bro in the overworld map and world one move were becoming really important this guy cannot move either once or twice depending on where he is after every level every extra movement that he does costs about half a second in this particular run mitch was really lucky the hammer bro did four movements of one the only big issue with this run was the fact that he lost his fire flower in 8-2 so he had to really quickly recover and grab another one in the fort right after just six days later he beat that run with a 1049.13 [music] it had slightly worse luck with the hammer growth three movements of one and one move in the two but he kept his fire flower throughout the run the only real mistake was his lack of peace speed in the world eight four of course then that doesn't work what a [ __ ] man after that run mitch felt that any percent was in a pretty good place so once again he moved on to other categories getting world record after world record a year and a half later he finally decided to try taking the 90 record down a little bit more in may of 2015 he found success but i got a new world record [music] although his world one had three movements of two and just one movement of one one place where he saved time was at the end of the first waldo scroller in world viii this boomerang guy can either move backwards or forwards before throwing his boomerang if he moves backwards this means his boomerang will leave the screen quicker which then triggers the treasure chest to spawn faster in this run the boomerang guide did indeed move backwards it was a really crazy run because the execution was spot on everywhere and it was the first 1048 ever it was another one of those runs that seemed to be close to unbeatable but then he came back a year later got four movements of one in world one executed everything perfectly and got a low 1047. i cannot believe i missed the fireball ugh so that's where the record is for the standard any percent today but there's another category that players have been playing as well any percent wrong warp [music] similarly to super mario world rat 926 discovered a glitch in 2014 that lets you skip all the way to the ending credits just minutes after starting the game if you want to see an in-depth analysis on how it works i recommend you look at this video by the channel retro game mechanics explained that goes over it in great detail but what you essentially have to do is collect two warp whistles in world 1 then warp into world 7 and enter 7-1 there you'll have to do various things with koopa shells to put them into perfect positions usually pixel perfect i'll explain this a little more in a minute then you clip into the side of a pipe and get warped down below the level if everything is set up correctly you'll then work into the game's ending credits the problem was that this glitch was always super inconsistent it wasn't until recently that more consistent setups were found every koopa placement had to be perfect to get the world record and usually the glitch would only work one in every several dozen tries it was just about impossible to get the stars to align for you to get every koopa shell in the exact right position where they would need to be from 2014 to the present day the world record for this separate category has gone down quite a bit runners like pro ducks mitch flower power and the current wrong warp world record holder garua have each taken their turn with the record to get it down to where it is today three minutes and six seconds mitch even executed the trick live on tv on the stephen colbert show i'm not going to show it here for copyright reasons but i strongly recommend that you watch it if you get the chance because it was amazing but there's one thing that happened with the wrong warp that really stands out in my mind january 6 2015 awesome games done quick 2015 was going full force and mitch flower power had just completed a 53 minute warpless run at the end of it he said that just for fun he was gonna try to do an any percent wrong work to quote him directly i'm only gonna try once it's like one in a billion chances of working but i'll give it a try to give you guys an idea of how rarely this trick worked i remember watching mitch's stream when he was going to get this record and he would sometimes never get the glitch to work a single time all stream the chances of him getting all of the extremely precise inputs needed for the setup were very very slim to say the least the mitch had no fear he plowed into world 7-1 and got to work on the setup [music] yeah that's hard god [music] what what [music] that looks [music] wow i don't i don't think it's it i don't think the bottom shell yeah it's also yeah i don't think it was it but we'll see oh you're going to see some fun stuff i can't believe i got that because 10 seconds he got in the red pipe really quickly though i did i did and luckily the show was on the ground don't worry everything is okay [music] [applause] [music] [applause] [music] you
