so if you want to get rich with coding do not go to college you might have been told this lie that oh you need a computer science degree to succeed in tech order oh big companies only hire computer science graduates but that is complete bs in this day and age you see even google don't even require degrees anymore yes this is even relevant to you if you're from a country that technically has free university which yeah we'll get back to that concept in a moment okay so this video is going to be a bit controversial so before i go into absolutely on college let's recognize that of course for some people for certain situations college is going to be the right option of course there still benefits you do get the stamp of approval of the university there are still many companies who all other things being equal will prefer someone with a degree i'm absolutely not denying that the main argument that i'm going to make is basically just going to revol around whether it's worth the time and money investment versus the other opportunities you have i did go to university myself not for computer science but for economics and why i did that is a poly another story but it did help me build my social circle in london which was also a new city for me it would have taken me much longer without it now of course here the counterargument is that okay is it really worth going to university and paying all the prices just to make friends probably not right but it's still a benefit and in certain fields like law medicine you absolutely need a degree because you simply legally cannot operate in those fields without it but of course that's not really what we're talking about here and of course in many places around the world like in europe university is free of cost so you might be tempted to think that you sort of might as well go and in many cases that can be the case many people when they graduate high school they don't even know what they want to do so going to university to sort of give you still more time to think about it can be an okay option because in those countries leaving the degree and dropping out has a much smaller cost associated with it than somewhere like america or the uk and in those cases you could even enroll in the degree and on the side of doing your degree because usually you have a lot of free time at least i did you can have a side hustle you can have a bit of time to be allowed to be broke and not making money essentially and it can allow you to start learning the code on your own perhaps and like trying these other paths which are much quicker paths to getting into the industry while you sort of have the backup option of doing university so there are cases where university can make sense but now let's talk about why i have such a big problem with university so in the big picture at any given point of time in history there are certain opportunities that are the best opportunities to make it in life for that given period of time for a parents generation that was getting a degree in certain fields like economics finance computer science but the thing about the economy is that it always go in cycles what worked for your parents generation is highly likely to no longer be the best opportunity for you because when people realize that something is the best opportunity everyone is going to flock to that opportunity and then it's going to become oversaturated and that is exactly what has happened with university in the past it used to be the case that having a degree was something special it really stood you apart because most people didn't have degrees today literally everyone has a degree because universities and colleges have a financial interest to get as many people as possible to take their degrees but if you're smart you should be able to see past that see that yes again like i said it can be the right option for some people it is not the most effective option when you consider not only the financial cost but all the other cost as well which we're about to talk about and the thing about college is that their curriculums are completely outdated you're being taught by professors that probably never done the thing that you actually want to do one of the most helpful things in getting to where you want to go in life is talking to people and getting mentoring from people who have actually done the thing you want to do sure if you want to be a computer science academic university is probably the the best place for that because those are the people that are teaching you you're not being taught by software engineers that have worked for the companies that you want to work at you're not being taught by successful startup founders or entrepreneurs if that's what you want to do you're not really getting mentoring from the right kinds of people so you're really learning the wrong mindset and talking about careers it doesn't help you land your dream job at all besides the piece of paper that you get which again surely helps you you're not getting any help with building a resume no one tells you how to apply for jobs because what you really want are not the lectures about d algorithm or something like that what you want is to learn the skills that the companies actually want and to get a job and that is simply not what the university curriculum is made for it is made to build you into an academic that is what it is but it gets worse because the real cost of university is even more than just the price that you pay but before we get into that let's talk about what you could do instead so college is like the worst of both worlds it's super expensive yet it offers the least help with the thing that you actually want which is a high paying tech job so how can we get the best of both worlds instead there's a company called course careers that is helping normal average people just like you lear 70k jobs in as little as 4 months because what they have developed is first of all a comprehensive online software engineering curriculum that actually gives the skills that you actually need in the real world but what really makes it special is that they also help you land a job directly through the program after the fact which means that there are people like max who managed to land a job in as little as 4 months with no previous experience and no degree whatsoever and some of the top students are literally landing jobs without even applying for jobs at all because of something that i'm about to talk to you about so the way this process works is that you start off with a completely free introductory course on software development then you're going to learn the fundamentals of software development after that you can choose a specialization anything from front end backend devops and you remember i talked about mentoring before and how important it is for success well course careers gives you access to a whole network of industry professionals who offer unlimited one-on-one and group support and because i believe in cor care so much i have become the official partner which means that when you choose your coach after enrolling in the program you'll be able to choose me as your coach to provide further support throughout your journey and at the end of all that you're added to the course careers employer platform where employers and hiring managers can request interviews with candidates directly which means that you might be able to secure a job without even applying for them yourself so thank you to course careers for partnering with me on this video if you want to check out their free introductory course on software development you can check that out from my affiliate link down below in the description and if you use that link you will also get a $50 special discount from the full program if you choose to enroll so going back to college you might still not be convinced you might think like oh it's okay i can get government loans for it it gives me job security and like a backup path and sure fine but let me tell you something different let me just give you a scenario of two different people we have person number one who goes to university for 4 years paying the average tuition of $30,000 a year or whatever after those four years they're able to land an 80k job as a software engineer pretty good right now consider another person who doesn't go to university but because they choose a much faster path to like be line them for the first job sure the first job might not be quite as high as the university graduate but they're going to be able to land it after 6 months or a year so even if the job pays only 60k a year that person is already making that 60k a year while the other person is still paying $30,000 a year so let's say after 10 years who's going to be on top so the first guy who went in the university has paid off $120,000 in debt and earned $480 in salary to a net of $360,000 and of course we're massively simplifying we're assuming that there's no taxes which is obviously not the case in most countries we're assuming there's no interest etc etc but just to oversimplify the other person however has made a total of $600,000 which we got from multiplying 60k a year by 10 and of course this is assuming that the salary doesn't even increase which is obviously not the case what would happen in reality is that perhaps the starting salary of the graduate is going to be slightly higher but after a couple of years no one really cares about your degree anyway all they really care about is your experience and if you have the experience the non-degree person is going to have just the same opportunities as the degree person so really the additional salary for the graduate is probably going to be slightly higher only the first couple of years into your career but the thing is again that person is going to start the career much later than the person that didn't go to university and perhaps yes they had to work slightly harder or even much harder to land their first job but because they have four extra years to do that almost always the math will come out to that person getting on top so going to college literally makes you poorer because the real cost of university is not just the financial cost but also the time cost the extra time that you have to spend to do it when you could be doing something different so with all that being said if university is not the path to get rich with coding what is then what do you need to focus on instead so really here we need to look at what do the companies actually want what do the tech companies want to see in their employees all they want are competent employees that can do the job and when it comes to landing your first job your difficulty is simply convincing that company that you are a competent employee and this is where the degree obviously helps because all other things being equal passing a difficult computer science curriculum does showcase to them that you're at least somewhat of a like normal and smart person that's able to go through and get into universities like that so if there's a different way that you can prove your skills to the companies that is really going to serve the exact same purpose and that is exactly what course careers for example are building there they understand it and they have created this system that essentially proves the employers that you have the skills except you have to spend a lot less money and a lot less time to do it there's only really one thing that matters in the big picture and that is your offer so for example if you're selling a product whether that product is going to make you money or not really at the end of the day like sure it depends on like how well you sell it your marketing etc but really what matters is is that product good does it actually solve the problem that is supposed to solve so how does this relate to us like trying to get rich with coding well when you're trying to get rich with coding your product is your skills and if you're doing it via working for companies your product is going to be how well can you do the job for the companies how well can you essentially make money for the company so really at the end of the day the thing to focus on is not which degree you have and things like this is are you a good software engineer or no do you know how to think like a programmer do you know how to solve problems with code do you understand software arch are you a good software engineer is your offer strong and in the big picture it doesn't matter where you build those skills as long as you build it and i know that that might sound like scary to you because if you're a beginner you probably don't feel like you are good at coding you don't probably feel like you have the skills here so i just want to leave you with this message at the end of this video in the beginning it's going to be a struggle in the beginning it's going to be a lot of time of you looking at code looking at projects looking at courses and you're having no idea what to do like heck i still i mean i still code projects every single week and a lot of the time when i start a project i have no idea what i'm doing that is a completely normal feeling in tech but the thing that you want to think about is that every time you build something just try to think of like a couple of things to take away from that a couple of things that you can think like okay like now i understand how like this framework works or now i learned this new concept about python for example as long as you're building out a couple of new skills every single day every single week like overall your skills are are improving over time if you just keep doing that and if you just don't stop if you just keep doing the work and you keep trying it would be completely unreasonable that at some point eventually you won't get a chance so that is really what matters i hope you like this video i hope you make the right choice for you whatever you choose coding is one of the most potent skills in this day and age to make money and know i'm not necessarily just talking about getting a job with coding there's so many more paths and so many more ways to make money with coding so if you're looking for a more stepbystep path to make money with coding you can watch this video right here where i go through a step-by-step process of exactly what i would do today in this market if i was starting over and i wanted to make $10,000 a month or more with coding go watch that video next and i'll see you in the next one
