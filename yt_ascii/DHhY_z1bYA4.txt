hello everyone and welcome in this video we're going to be talking about whether or not you can make your car faster with gearing and so what i've done with my s2000 is change the final drive ratio from 4.1 which was the stock final drive ratio for the rear differential to 4.44 and so we're going to be determining and i've actually done some acceleration tests to prove it with my actual car whether or not this gear change can actually make your car faster without actually you know changing how much torque or horsepower your engines making so the engine's remaining untouched all we're doing is changing the gearing can the car accelerate quicker and so a general way to look at this before we get into the test results is looking at the top speed of each gear versus the 4.11 or the 4.1 versus the 4.44 versus the 4.77 which is another option for the s2000 out there there's a lot of options but these are three of the more common ratios the 4.1 4.44 and 477 that you may see in the aftermarket and so those the ones we're comparing and i ended up putting the 444 in my car so looking at speed in miles hour you're first we're looking at first gear and what's the top speed we can hit in first gear with that engine being at 9,000 rpm so the stock car will go to about 45 mph these are all estimates these miles hour it's based on good math but the thing is your tire diameter can change and as that tire diameter changes if you have different wheels etc you will change what these speeds are so a good estimate based on the stock tire size 45 in first gear down to 41 once i've changed it to the 4.44 so the tradeoff here is that we have more aggressive gearing so that should mean more wheel torque but at a lower top speed and so you can see you know it it goes down as you get to the 477 38 mph in first gear only up to 59 mph in second gear whereas the stock car can hit 68 milph in second gear now as far as determining you know which car will be quicker if you pick a certain speed a general rule of thumb and there will of course always be exceptions but a general rule of thumb is that the most aggressive gearing with the least number of shifts will give you the best zero to whatever time so in this case if we analyze 60 m hour you can see that all of the three cars will have to shift into second gear now the 4.7 7 will have to actually shift into third to hit 60 mph whereas both of these won't now the 4.44 has more aggressive gearing which means more wheel torque and so ultimately because this has the shortest gearing but only shifts once to get to 60 mph it will likely be the quickest from 0 to 60 now if we were to do 0 to 50 on the other hand because the 477 has more aggressive gear ratio it will be likely the one to reach that 50 mph the quickest so the only reason reason it's not hitting 60 the quickest is because you have that additional shift now analyzing speed based on hitting a target mile per hour doesn't always make sense because of this discrepancy in when you change gears so what you actually feel what's fun to humans is g-forces so it's a better idea as far as analyzing how fun the car is to look at g forces and so that's what we're doing in our test results so for my test what i did was i took the car put it in second gear below 10 mph and then floored it and measured the time from 10 to 60 mph so a full rpm pull in second gear now there was a minor difference in temperature outside for the 4.10 it was 60degrees fahrenheit so a little bit cooler a little bit more oxygen in the air versus 67degrees fenhe for the 4.44 there was also a thicker gear oil used in the 4.44 and of course the 4.44 was brand new not too many miles on it yet so you know it could still be breaking in and as a result have a bit more of a parasitic loss on it that said so the reason why i just did 10 to 60 in a single gear was to eliminate as many variables as possible that could alter this time so you may think okay why didn't you just do a 0 to 60 well you know your launch can be different for each time and your gear shift can be different for each time so i want to eliminate that and just purely look at acceleration from 10 to 60 mph in second gear with both final drive ratios so we'll just go ahead and plug those numbers in all right now these data points are an average of three runs so i did three acceleration runs with each car took the average for these different speed intervals from 10 to 60 mph from 30 to 40 from 40 to 50 and from 50 to 60 and then here are the averages of those time intervals those three runs and then here on the right we have the percent difference so you can see overall the run from 10 to 60 took 8.1 14 seconds you know not that quick obviously keep in mind this is coming from a very low rpm it's also at 2700 ft elevation so a little bit less oxygen at the air than sea level but regardless a lot of it comes from the fact that you're you know you take a lot of time and those lower rpms to speed up 4.44 is able to do the 10 to 60 in 7.81 seconds with a overall difference of 4.18% so the the new differential is 4.18% quicker over that you know effective entire rpm range from 10 to 60 mph now from 30 to 40 mph it's 6.36% faster from 40 to 50 mph a significant difference 7.51% faster than the other gear and then from 50 to 60 it's actually a little bit slower and so there's a couple reasons why you see this negtive 1.12% here first of all you do have a torque drop off at the highend of the s2000 torque curve so after you hit about 8,300 rpm and you go all the way to 9,000 rpm that torque curve does start to drop so this is more of an advantage when it's between you know 50 to 60 in the 4.1 gear where it's at a lower rpm than the 4.44 where it's at a higher rpm the other thing is i was running into the speed limiter the rev limiter at about 61 mph so right when i'm hitting 60 it's running into that rev limit and i think that may have played a role in slowing it down because it was backing off the throttle once it got near that and so i think that's the overall case of why this is a little bit slower overall it is quicker and then again like i was mentioning when you're analyzing acceleration the thing that you feel is g forces and so if we look here we can see that from 40 to 50 was or from 50 to 60 was our quickest interval so we went we accelerated 10 miles per hour in 1.48 and then if we look here we accelerated from 40 to 50 10 m per hour and 1 41 so that was our quickest 10 mph acceleration 1.41 so that'll give us our peak average g so the maximum average g force with the 4.10 gear ratio was 307 g's the maximum average gforce with a 4.4 is 323 g's so not a huge difference but it is a 5% boost in the maximum geforce that's the force pressing you against the seat that's what makes you smile and so this is doing it 5% greater than the 4.10 now what are the tradeoffs of you know getting into this higher gear ratio for the final drive well you are going to be limiting your top speed so here we have the top speed in sixth gear as you can see the 444 at 159 mph the 41 at 173 and if you were to go with something more aggressive like the 477 you're only hitting 148 not that you know the car has enough power stock to hit that maybe it can get pretty close to that but you know 173 it's probably not going to be hitting with stock power the revs at 80 mph so if you're cruising down the highway you know what are your revs going to be sitting at another important thing to kind of keep in mind especially if this is your daily driver the 4.10 80 mph you're sitting under 4200 rpm with the 444 what i've got right now about 4500 rpm and then 48 50 if you were to go to the 477 so pretty high rpm to be cruising down the highway with you know honestly had i known the exact percentage difference that would have occurred from this and because this is not my daily driver i probably would have gone with the 477 if i were to do it again just to get a little bit more aggressive gearing out of it i don't mind that it's going to be floating up this high because i don't drive the car all that much on the highway and it would have a bit more aggressive gearing be a bit more fun but 5% improvement is cool and you know it it's not going to be screaming too high on the highway and it does have a higher top speed down the line if i do you know work on the power and get it up there where it won't be limited like it would be if it was with the 477 so thank you guys for watching and if you have
