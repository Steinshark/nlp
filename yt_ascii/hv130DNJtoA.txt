a year ago i posted a video about business cycles in the semiconductor industry i titled it the coming semiconductor bust and people seemed to have enjoyed it and by enjoyed it i mean that they screamed at me in the comments that i had no idea what i was talking about which is par for the course here now that a year has progressed i thought some of the topics might be worth revisiting i've been thinking about a few things recently so i want to run some numbers talk some recent news items and make a few predictions about what might happen in the coming years but first the asian armature newsletter check out this one about how taiwan helps make your shoes it was one of my big favorites yet the video did so badly broke my heart the sign up link is in the video description below i try to put one out every week maybe two alright back to the show now asian nomentry is not a semiconductor industry analysis channel there is no better way to look stupid than to try to predict the future so i am admittedly out of my element here just wanted to do this follow-up if you want true up-to-date industry analysis from people who spend more time on this than myself i highly recommend the semi-analysis and fabricated knowledge newsletters both are great resources in his interview with ben thompson intel ceo pat gelsinger spoke his thoughts with regards to a coming semiconductor shortage when was the last time we had a logic surplus not a memory surplus the last memory surplus was about three and a half years ago the last logic surplus was over a decade ago pat made an interesting point in my first video i didn't delve into the differing natures of these two markets ben probably should have dug into that a little more than he did broadly speaking the industry has these two very large categories of product memory and logic memory chips door information the two major types of memory chips are dram and nand these are more of a commodity each generation of memory has a very short life cycle and suppliers compete ferociously with one another often on price logic on the other hand involves things like microcontrollers ai accelerators cpus mobile desktop otherwise and gpus they process information to handle a task a logic chip requires more customization and handles more complexity this specialization implies that the product experiences less of a commodity market pat's point is that memory might frequently suffer massive drops in sales and they do but since logic chips are so fundamentally different and are not commodities their business cycles are far more resilient so let's check in on this pat mentions the last memory glut was in 2019 that year had been described as a difficult year for the semiconductor industry just fyi 2019 was three years ago time moved so fast man anyway it was reported then that global semiconductor sales declined by 12 percent from 2018 growth went negative the first time it had happened since 2015. but this headline number was largely driven by a 30 percent revenue decline in memory representing a quarter of the market all the major memory makers samsung sk hynix and micron saw revenue declines in the thirty percent range definitely a memory bust the rest of the industry however saw much more moderate declines sales of all non-memory products declined by just 1.7 percent in 2019. so gelsinger might be on to something here i mean a negative 1.7 growth rate is still negative growth but far from a glut or a bust so one might think of logic as being more changed to secular macro trends than individual industry dynamics thus making that corner of the industry less cyclical than we might assume on the surface the worldwide semiconductor fab build out has continued on based on announcements we have heard by 2025 we can expect to see new online logic fab capacity from intel tsmc samsung umc texas instruments tower st micro electronics toshiba infineon and maybe smic depending on what's going on in shanghai in total i eyeball about 33 logic projects fab expansions or construction starts announced to be coming online within the next two to three years this excludes packaging and r d center announcements by the way i want to thank friend of the channel redfire for helping to collate and present this information he keeps a tracker that's as good as anything i have ever seen go check it out on the memory side we can expect to see new dram and nand fab capacity coming from micron sk hynix winbond nanya and kyogsia maybe samsung too depending on how they split between the two again within the same two to three year time frame i eyeball about 10 memory projects expansions and new fab starts announcements rarely translate into actual shipments wafers have different sizes and i have to estimate a few capacity numbers based on the projected capital expenditures rather than actual reported values so this is a super dirty disgusting back of the envelope calculation but if we are to take all of this at face value then by 2025 we can expect to see 1.2 million new logic wafers and at least 513 000 new memory wafers hitting the market three quarters of that logic number comes from intel tsmc and smic alone in 2021 the semiconductor industry reported shipments of about 14.8 billion square inches of chips assuming that half of that number are logic chips then very roughly translated this means we're adding about 20 additional total logic capacity into 2024 2025 and that's if all of these projects turn out as expected definitely not a given twenty percent additional total capacity over the next three years does not feel widely out of control especially if industry estimates are reporting that global semiconductor shipments memory and logic will rise by 10 in 2022 alone at the same time the industry as a whole hasn't experienced a 20 plus percent three-year shipment growth period since 2018 and that led into 2019 which we talked about earlier the question for me then is whether or not there's enough leading-edge logic demand for that much leading edge logic capacity coming up soon in the first semiconductor bus video i asked the rhetorical question where is all this demand coming from what's going on a year later i feel like i have a decent grasp on what the answer might be and it is rather dull the cloud it is a reversal from what drove logic chip growth over the past 10 years which was mobile after the launch of the iphone 3g the app store and android smartphone revenues drove the logic industry out of the global financial crisis smartphones rapidly climbed the performance ladder faster than almost any previous consumer electronics product demanding better cameras faster apps and higher resolution screens as recently as q1 2020 tsmc was essentially a smartphone chip making company smartphone chip revenues made up nearly 50 percent of their revenue mix by that time however that segment was experiencing a bit of a stall with revenue growth negative nine percent quarter over quarter according to gartner worldwide smartphone sales volumes hit a steady state in 2016. nearly 80 percent of people now own a phone and people don't have to upgrade so often at this time tsmc and the rest of the semiconductor industry saw 5g as driving the next big wave of smartphone semiconductor revenues they have been talking this investment thesis even as cove has started to take hold in late 2019 and early 2020. here is a quote from the call in january 2020. we continue to see stronger deployment of 5g networks and smartphones in several major markets around the world we reiterate mid teens penetration rate for 5g smartphones we also forecast a faster penetration of 5g smartphone as compared to 4g over the next several years while silicon content of 5g smartphone will be substantially higher than that of a 4g smartphone the pandemic caught them and the rest of the industry unawares because the demand it generated came from the data center rather than the smartphone the exploding video game industry the direct to consumer streaming revolution the work from home miracle and the unprecedented surge in ai machine learning adoption and its use cases these all require computation in the cloud the biggest players in this cloud computing ecosystem are the hyperscalers amazon google and microsoft these cloud computing companies suddenly find themselves growing 30 year over year despite massive revenue bases in the fourth quarter of 2021 aws revenues grew to nearly' billion dollars a year 40 percent year-over-year growth the company has a 71 billion dollar revenue run rate in the first quarter of 2022 microsoft reported that their azure cloud services grew 50 year-over-year revenue sizes weren't reported the hyperscalers are some of the only companies projected to spend more on capital expenditure than the chip foundries are an estimated 150 billion dollars in 2022 and that titanic spending filters through the entire supply chain in tsmc's recent q1 2022 earnings 41 percent of their revenues came from high performance computing or hpc where they put their cloud revenues just two years ago it used to be 30 percent they also noted that hpc grew 26 quarter over quarter far faster than almost every other category other than automotive which is a far smaller part of the overall business the big question of course is how long this cloud gravy train is going to last as the world emerges from the pandemic and the macro economy experiences some speed bumps over the past few months we have been seeing a number of pandemic plays like zoom netflix peloton and others experience reversals recently netflix lost 35 percent of their market cap when they announced their first subscriber loss in 10 years and projected further declines in 2022 zoo mentioned in their recent q1 2022 earnings call that their sales productivity i.e conversion rates is returning to levels more like the pre-pandemic era and commerce is swinging away from e-commerce back towards brick and mortar the wall street journal recently noted that e-commerce has a percentage of retail sales led to titanic highs in 2020 but have since returned to the secular trend a snapback that's taken a toll on many e-commerce companies that scaled up during the pandemic i do think some things have changed many companies will stick to some form of work from home not all of the 55 million subscribers netflix added in 2020 and 2021 are going away e-commerce will still grow faster than the rest of the retail industry companies will continue migrating old on-premise installations to the cloud and ai and electric vehicles are still a thing so the secular trend is still good but i don't know if the cloud gravy train in the coming years will be as good as it was in 2020 and 2021. even if the cloud doesn't grow another 30 40 50 year over year however things will be alright for the big foundries of the world and their new fabs they can readjust their capacity pricing and find some other fabulous customers with a cool idea to fill those capacity slots and like i mentioned in the first video tsmc and samsung prioritize market share over profitability if things cool down they will get more aggressive but i do wonder what it means for everyone else however the second tier fabs the equipment suppliers and the rest of the ecosystem in conclusion here are some things that i think one cloud computing revenue growth will decelerate either because of the law of big numbers or a return to a form of pre-pandemic normal this will cause some issues throughout the ecosystem two there's still a semiconductor bust coming but it is more likely coming in memory than in logic hyperscaler data centers have big demand for memory chips and memory makers will feel they're slowed down more because their products are still commodities three the massive build out in logic semiconductor capacity projected over the next three years probably won't cause a market screeching crash like in 2009 but it may result in slightly lower prices and some broken promises four just because we see a slowdown in the leading edge does not mean we will see the current shortages and trailing edge slash legacy nodes meaning 65 nanometers or older going away those dynamics are way different same with specialty technologies like mems analog etc i did a video about the trailing edge shortage earlier that may or may not be out right now sign up for the patreon if you don't see it on this channel right now and last i have no idea what this will do to any of the big chip companies or their stocks don't ask me about that alright then a bunch of new things to make me look like an idiot you can go yell at me now in the comments subscribe to the channel sign up to the newsletter and i'll see you guys next time
