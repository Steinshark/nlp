nobody likes wasting money so intel's pitch is a little confusing with our state-of-the-art core i9 13900k you'll get 90 of the performance at 100 of the price wait what it's true though this thing runs so hot that it is literally impossible to cool through conventional means which is why today is going to be a little unconventional this used to be the domain of only the boldest modders and tinkerers but now anyone can just pick up a kit from ek's web shop and go beyond the red line this is a direct dye cooler and with it you can drop your cpu temperatures by up to 20 degrees or so they say all it takes is potentially killing your 600 cpu and definitely voiding your warranty will r core i9 3900k finally see its full potential will it even see tomorrow or will it direct die without passing go or collecting two hundred dollars from our sponsor build redux build redux builds fully customizable gaming pcs suitable for any budget pick your favorite games and see how they perform using their online pc builder head to build redux.com linus and create your new rig today ek clearly knows me far too well number 69 of 100 and a hand signed note you always do the craziest we have no doubt you will put it to good use absolutely man this thing is gorgeous and it's more than just a pretty face designed in collaboration with der bauer the quantum velocity squared direct die takes the guesswork out of removing the protective heat spreader from your cpu and cooling the silicon die directly before we can do that i need to take our cpu out of our system just tested so we know how much of improvement the direct dye cooler actually made that's going to take a minute so why don't we have a look at the accessory package that comes with the quantum velocity squared direct eye first up is a durbauer branded cpu removal tool this isn't the only way to remove the ihs from your cpu but it is by far the easiest we've also got some thermal grizzly conduct a knot liquid oil compound i'm not a hundred percent sold on going liquid metal on this project but i guess we'll cross that bridge when we get to it a little spreading tool some allen wrenches and we've got a little foam pad this is critical because it's right in the name liquid metal if it drips or leaks onto something that it's not supposed to it can easily short and even kill your system we've personally experienced that hey there it is look at that 3900k it's time for your surgery buddy the directions remove the cpu from the socket install the dilated cpu in the socket genius the cpu goes into the deleting tool here all right then i'm pretty sure it's going to be in the 13th gen orientation out of the box so we'll just go ahead and put that in there start tightening this boy wait a second no no don't worry oh i'm a little bit worried because there's a triangle right there and there's a triangle in there and if you push it the wrong way you remove capacitors we can just very simply check it we don't hit those caps we're fine now all we need to do is this always makes me extremely uncomfortable yeah i don't love this step you don't eat it up or anything oh yeah do you no i am potentially one of the people in the world that's delighted the most cpus oh that sounded good did it yeah that did not sound that good i don't like this alex i think this is wrong okay what about you don't do that what about you don't do that as i was saying before i'm pretty sure that i'm one of the people in the world that has deleted the most cpus because that ltx i did hundreds oh yeah speaking of which we are going to have a cpu deleting booth at ltx again this year so if you want to try it on a dummy cpu before doing it on your own it's the perfect place to do it see you there or just do it on your cpu there like that's what a lot of people did percussive maintenance it's fine we're bringing out the big guns the heat guns nah come on what the heck it does not want to come off fetch me a hammer wait what are you okay yeah debatable i don't love this oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah okay wait well that seems pretty bad wow haha freaking finally it totally was the silicone adhesive roman if you're watching you might want to give her a little more pull distance on this one just a touch more now i know what you're thinking that looked awful oh and hey linus you said protective heat spreader why would i remove that okay that's a good question and there are a couple of reasons first is that even for something with high thermal conductivity like copper adding thickness adding distance that the heat needs to travel is going to add thermal resistance second for every material change okay like as we move from one into the next there are additional losses in the heat transfer since it can actually reflect off the surfaces of those materials so the closer we can get our cooling to the heat source the better which raises another question really and that's why do intel and amd include these things then if they make cooling worse and in some cases darn near impossible well to a certain point they actually help especially with air coolers it can be better to spread the heat out a little bit from that small heat generating dye to this large larger heat spreader so you can fit more heat pipes across the hot part of the chip and speaking of heat pipes the dye itself can get so hot that any heat pipe touching it can end up boiling which is supposed to happen but over boiling to the point where it dries out and stops being effective it also is protective the dye is extremely fragile and back before ihs's were common it was pretty common place to see users accidentally crack them and then post dead dye porn on the forums do you want to explain that we're removing the stock mounting mechanism because obviously this is you know what mounts it i think you just did and aside from it being impossible to mount this thing with the stock hardware if we were to try to put our original cooler back in here it wouldn't be able to reach it because it's fine now let's chill it's a good thing that there's no ihs on there to protect it this will go on here see and it didn't touch it see can't touch it it can't reach there's the other problem of if it did touch it it would also touch all of these capacitors in the past they'd get around the problem of your cooler hitting all the capacitors and stuff by just making it super duper small problem is though this right here is just not as good at cooling as this and also you put a lot of different types of fittings in here and they hit each other we're installing the die guard which involves putting the dye back into the socket yet again but not having it fall out this time with these parts machined out to make sure it doesn't bump any of the caps or anything this little boy sits pop right on there look at that that's how we're gonna hold the cpu in place now have i mentioned that we make the perfect tool for these kinds of delicate operations the ltt screwdriver has a strong magnet so you won't lose those little proprietary mounting hardware pieces and the perfect knurling for putting these things in nice and delicately now this is another thing that is special about this block instead of having a large contact patch on the bottom it has a small raised one so that's going to help us avoid interfering with any kind of hold down or die guard product and ek says that the fins on the inside are actually cut closer to the die to help with heat transfer we also know that the density of those fins is extremely high here and relatively low out here where they are really going to be doing that much now under normal circumstances we just put a glob of thermal paste in the middle of a chip and then we count on the contact pressure from the cooler to spread it out not so here we absolutely need to spread this out to cover all parts of the dye because even a tiny little air pocket could cause a hot spot in a place where maybe there is no thermal sensor and it could just fry itself into oblivion going back to the whole ihs is a heat spreader thing that only solves that problem seems pretty good to me did we put this on now yeah oh this is so bad doing things such that the camera can see it is so much harder than doing things such that i know right all right well before before you go before you go oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah just to fill in any little micro gaps okay is it lined up i don't know well can you look you're the one on the front well yeah that's exactly what i can't see you can't see much over here too it feels like they're threading did you guys drain the loop i mean a little you're just gonna ah yeah hey there we go all right success yeah yeah all right so this goes on here i'm sure you can make that work okay i'm kind of feeling this length short now no dog do you think this is my first rodeo oh my god okay hey are we ready [applause] pu installed f1 to run setup let's go okay it's at 85 degrees which is oh 64. huh that's not good this should be working very very well right now and it is not the odds of immediate catastrophic failure are much higher when you don't have an integrated heat spreader on oh well hold on second core temperatures here we go it's an average of 29 maybe that isn't that far off okay fine roman suggested that we start by doing like a single threaded cinebench or maybe like a quad threaded benchmark of some sort rather than hit the whole cpu at once but we're just gonna do the whole thing i thought you're actually going to take his advice for a second there okay so we've got a hot core i'm gonna stop this yeah yeah we might need to remount it yeah this top p core p core zero went to 99 degrees immediately and actually p chord two is looking pretty bad too here we go let's put on some more oh god that's a lot i sucked up too much crap okay that's pretty good let's go multi-core and hello okay there we go that's more like it this is quite consistent that's what we want to see also that's really chilly 69 degrees on the core maximum nice so that's 11 degrees lower than stock but we also hit a much higher score so stock was 36.60 or 36 600. wow really yeah we got 700 points just from running a little bit cooler okay well this is great what next well we can just hit it with prime95 do an actual like testes okay and cheese 89 degrees was the max before after 30 minutes i know it's only been a few minutes but this is really good yeah so it's been what five minutes now it hit its max temperature last time after 11. i just looked it up oh i power is only'0 watts well it's stock just pure stock oh well that's boring let's make it turbo more so our max there was 61 degrees it would have gotten hotter but at the same time not much yeah that was pretty good this is dual triple radiators that water wasn't going to heat up much with only a cpu dumping heat into it remove all limits boom oh my god it's not hot at all hottest core maximum 69 degrees again nice so we just need to overclock it yeah amazing it's tamed wow she's ripping harder than prime9 5 72. how many waddy watts is it drawing oh i'll check max 2 3 is already still huh and 37 320 same score overclocking time then but did we overclock with this this is getting cold [applause] yes okay are we going for a live swap here all right you ready alex with no oh we need to plug it in yeah oh we need to move fast because we need to move very fast no water movement this cpu is going to be getting yeah especially since just air in there pretty toasty we need our sketchy 240 volt cable it's been in zero videos okay plugged in working on it hold on hold on i'm going to start i'm going to start a load oh it's all at 100. oh it started oh i'm working on it start it start it it's not turning on alex why is it not the switch wasn't on hello no i don't want to fry the cpu there we go those fittings are not made for that oh my god there's water everywhere david okay we did hold on i'm gonna turn it off we need to do a bit of a fitting swap the good news is that so much of the water drained out of the block that it's empty we don't have much time we're at 56 degrees on that cpu all right try again yeah oh there we go there it goes she dropped this chills fast we're down to 11 degrees right now we want to just run us in a bench and see how hot it gets sure so 49 degrees wow 38 000 points without doing anything to it we've done nothing yet i have xtu open yet but i haven't touched it i bet with how loud i talk my levels are probably about the same as alex's on his mic here we go this is a little bit safer i believe okay it works 350 watts and 76 degrees nowhere near the limit this is working very well 41. so that actually took the six years that time i believe okay why don't you give the other two core six then the p chores i mean let's try five nine and six one yeah yeah we probably even give it more voltage oh god it was it was happy there okay one two five sure six two do you think we can do it you don't have to three steps in one wow that's a lot of voltage she's not going to do more than 350 watts for power limited for the first time how'd we do well the bad news is i still managed to hit 100 degrees on the cpu good news it was drawing 510 watts at the time this board will just give you power it can draw like 700 watts if you want what does that look like in terms of cinebench then very fast extremely fast it also is worth noting that that was with the voltages pretty high you don't get any more performance after about 480 watts this block is dangerously close to condensation territory here oh yeah that's a rock solid six gigahertz on all performance cores that is wild and like the temps are getting high some of them are getting into the 90s but still reasonable 480 watts yep it's doing it now for funsies there's also a gpu overclock it's just a little one you can't do too much because like you know voltage limits yeah yeah if we were able to put like a voltage controller onto that we could get a lot more highest temp i've seen 37 degrees so far wow fun fact pretty much all gpus have no ihs so they are direct dye cooled right out of the box that's for a couple of reasons one is that an ihs adds z height which would make your graphics card thicker which is undesirable or at least it was until recently and number two they're not meant to be user serviceable so there's very little risk of anyone accidentally cracking their die oh and right three because again of size and space constraints they want to get the best possible cooling out of these things so going directly to the die is going to give them the best shot at that they also tend to be larger so having just two heat pipes on it and drying out is less of a concern they're a little less power dense this is stupid you hit 6.3 on a single core yeah it'll do two cores 6.3 6.4 dead in that case i think it's fair to say that we are not thermally limited no we are at the limits of this silicon right now to be clear we're not talking about going deep deep sub-zero with liquid nitrogen or liquid helium or anything like that the the physics of the silicon changes significantly at those kinds of temperatures we're talking within reason at the limits of the silicon but we might have also just got a package from elmer labs oh are you really doing that get subscribed what makes this a cpu test is it just that it's really simulation heavy or is that it's actually rendered on the cpu it's rendered on the cpu yeah this is normally like 10 fps we can't set any records because that's held by like 64 core thread rippers but that was like 4550 fps yeah wow wow that's actually a pretty bad run for this system we normally get more around 19 but we also normally get this message from our sponsor bitdefender bitdefender is committed to protecting and improving the online experience of their users
