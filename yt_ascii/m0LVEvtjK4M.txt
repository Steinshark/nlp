so we have a visitor over at the house talking about elliptic integrals and p-adic functions and things like this and it's all derived from conic sections. and my wife pat and i are listening, we could make some conic sections. we could not only make some conic sections we could bake some. we could make a cone and slice it, let's make a conic loaf of bread. let's bring it in the kitchen.
- (brady: kitchen?) the timing on this is a little delicate so i got up at six in the morning to make the dough but then we had to keep it from rising too much until you got here brady so so now i'm hoping that it's going to be okay. this is what it looks like right now before it's baked. this is a funnel with the bottom chopped off made of borosilicate glass. because it won't balance on one end pat had the idea we'll put it in- 
- it's a stock pot, a stock pot. 
- a stock pot, and- why don't you grab that end.
- i'm gonna go ahead and put it in the oven and hope that it's risen enough to be okay. that's good, i think it's still alive and kicking. curiously her first idea was to make scones in a cone. to have scone-ic, sconic sections. we'll see about this in an hour. (how's it going pat?)
- i think it's alive, i think it's growing! i'm afraid it'll go all the way up and stick to the roof of the oven and then we'll have a problem. yeah that's pretty good.
- sorry i almost stabbed you. we now have a conical loaf of bread. perfect time to do conics! right? 
here's a- first thing, let's draw an axes. here's the axes of the cone, if i cut perpendicular to this i should get a circle. hot damn! basic conic. a circle, or really in this case a disc because it's a filled in circle. so if i want a sandwich, a circular sandwich, i could start here and make another one. another disc! now, if memory serves me right, i ought to be able to make an ellipse by slicing the bread at an angle, so let's try an ellipse. oh yeah i've got an ellipse right here! i can make a steeper ellipse, a more elliptical ellipse, by cutting this way yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. i now have an ellipse! i have an elliptical slice of bread! looks a little circular but if you look here it's elliptical. so now, let's start pushing things. now a parabola is a conic section where it's cut parallel to one of the sides. let's start here. here's a section of a parabola with a bite taken out. if i rebuild this, had i cut along here this would have been a parabola. a slice that's parallel to this axis is a hyperbola. to get a hyperbola let's slice right along here. and there, along here, is a hyperbola. cut here - without slicing my hand - a hyperbola along here, pretty poor hyperbola, with a little bit of homemade plum jam. a hyperbolic jam sandwich, can't ask for more. oh it's beyond elliptical! it's beyond parabolic! it tastes hyperbolic. it tastes like the orbit of a comet that's coming in from an infinite distance. this is a sandwich that's made in conic sections. (is that a circle?) yeah sort of. this is homemade plum jam. off that tree. brady is right now having a circular disc plum jam sandwich.
- (it's pretty good.) (it's very good.) come on, does it taste conical? does it taste extra good because it's a homemade conic section? i think-
- can you taste? is it possible for you to determine that every little yeast body and every little grain of of organic flour that's used in that has- you know is a conic section? yeah i think i think 
i think i can taste that. ...means you're going to figure this out and do the experiment, you're going to find your own equipment. if you don't have a turkey around, measure the temperature of lasagna! or measure the temperature of chow mein.
