so this right here is the galaxy s 10-5 g the phone i've been using every single day for the last of four months and this is the note 10 plus 5 g in theory a universally better phone but i just couldn't get myself to switch to it and the weird part of it is part of me really wants to i enjoy trying new turf the note 10 plus has an almost record breaking screen to body ratio and the square design actually makes it feel completely different but with this phone in particular i've never had this before i've had four to five situations where i've told myself okay today this evening you're gonna finally take your sim and put it in the phone but then when i actually get to it when i pick up the phone i'm ready to transfer i realized yet another reason why i don't actually want to also massive shout out to surf shark vpn for sponsoring this video it's a beautiful device literally the first thing everyone says when they see it is while that display it's got an upgraded vibration motor it has more ram and an even faster chipset versus my s10 5g and on top of all that it's right here it's not like i'm debating whether or not to go out and buy the phone it is sitting on my table and i still don't want to make the change so having spent a bit of time thinking about it i've boiled down my thought process into five reasons why i'm not switching to the note 10 plus the first one is corner radius compared to the s 10 phones the note has drastically sharper corners which helps to differentiate it when it's sitting on a store shelf it gives it that note identity but i just straight-up makes it less intuitive to hold the phone inherits the same great build quality and the lightness of the s10 but these corners mean you're getting mildly jabbed every time you hold the phone and also that your hands can't reach as far up as they cooked on more rounded devices just remember i'm not saying it's bad i'm not saying it's a living disaster but it's not as comfortable as what i'd be switching from okay my initial reaction to the camera specs was oh dear they've made it worse from the spec sheet the camera hardware on the back seemed almost identical and on the front you're actually missing the second time of flight camera and the wide aperture you get on the s 10 5g thankfully though when you're actually using it this doesn't cause a problem at all the edge detection when taking portrait mode shots is great on the note and even without the 3d depth camera it can still take live focus video with indistinguishable level of quality that said this makes it effectively the same camera experience not a better one and definitely not a reason to upgrade the note 10 doesn't have a headphone jack and as a tech youtuber as someone who spends a long time looking at tech related comments i would guess i see 60 to 80 people complaining about this every single day and i completely get it it's not a deal breaker for me i could live without the headphone jack but it's a preference the way i usually use earphones is i have a primary wireless pair i always keep with me which right now is this set from one more and then i usually carry a second cheap pair of wired if owns the backup it's just reassuring to know that if you do forget to charge your wireless earphones or you're in for a really really long journey then you're always at least going to have something to use if you've got a wide pair but yeah i'd be willing to live without the jack if it weren't for the next two things the note 10 plus has a sizable four thousand three hundred million power battery it's tough to complain about something like that but a it is smaller than the four thousand five hundred million power one on this phone and more importantly be the note drains battery faster you might have already seen the battery test i made and one of the most interesting findings was that the note ran out even before the standard galaxy s 10 plus which has a four thousand one hundred million per cell the combination of this massive display with an s pen if you're going to use it means that the note 10 plus has the capacity to eat through battery and so whilst 4300 million powers is a great capacity your end battery life is only gonna be good now there are two reasons why the battery in this phone isn't as big as it could have been 5g and the s pen and i've got to say 5g is exciting the more i use it the more i understand it the more i feel like it's capable off but right now in almost every part of the world it's more of an idea than a selling point i was in london testing 5g a couple of weeks ago and when it works you're downloading applications so quickly you can't even see a progress bar but if you so much as turn around you getting 4g speeds and that applies to this phone too just generally speaking for at least the next year or so i would side with having a larger battery and a lower price tag over 5g capability also with these samsung phones the 5g you are get is powered by the snapdragon x50 chip at least for now which consumes a little bit more power than huawei's balan 5000 it is smaller than huawei's which is a good thing but huawei's is a multimode chip it combines 2g 3g 4g and 5g into one unit which means when you're switching between them which you're going to be doing a lot off in the current state of 5g you save power qualcomm's solution has one chip for 5g only and then each time you enter and leave a 5g area it effectively shifts gear between the 5g component and then the chip that handles 4g 3g and 2g and as far as the other reason for a smaller battery the s-pen it's really really good the air gestures they've added on this particular iteration i could live without but that doesn't change the fact that this is a product of many rounds of refinement it is beautifully smooth and tactile and the fact that you can convert written text into editable text is amazing the only gripe i have at all with it is that i just don't feel compelled to take it out and use it i just feel like the typing experience on phones has gotten better faster than the writing experience and it's also easier to correct as you go along that way so what i'm saying is great tool but i personally don't have a whole lot of use for it anyways all of this leads to the biggest reason without which i almost definitely would have put my sim from this phone into this phone it's the fact that in my opinion better more exciting stuff is coming and coming so soon that it just doesn't feel like the right time to change unpopular opinion but i'm really excited for the next iphones i want to see what google's working on with the pixel 4 as well as one plus with the 7t plus the one i've been eyeing up for a long time the huawei mate 30 pro which looks like a big redesign with all sorts of substantial changes even from the company's p30 pro earlier this year and yeah on one hand it's almost unfair to expect samsung to make too big small phone redesigns for the two big launches in the year but at the same time that is what their competition is doing the one thing that's got me a little nervous about the huawei is potential lack of google's services that's not been answered yet at the time of filming so we'll just have to wait and see but obviously if there's no google services i'm probably not going to use it so to conclude samsung is making fantastic phones right now if i didn't think so i wouldn't be using one but being this similar to the galaxy s 2 five g kind of got me thinking whether we actually need a note phone let alone the three samsung actually launched i could see a situation where the note line disappears and samsung introduces a standalone s pen that could work with the galaxy s phones and you just get a case to be able to hold them together sir shark vpn is the most affordable vpn service alpern so you pay 199 dollars a month and that gives you unlimited simultaneous
