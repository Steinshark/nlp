i am in india and we're about to buy the wackiest indian tech that i can get my hands on and then we're going to test it we're going to find out just how cheap we can get tech but also how great indian tech can be if you have the money to spend with this guy we are right now in asia's biggest computer market it's a hub for all the gadget lovers now one thing i didn't anticipate is the sheer number of indian fans who were just as keen to see what we'd find but look at this crowd this is crazy and with this army it was time to shop one let's say how cheap we can get a speaker boat was the one you were telling me about isn't it the speaker we're trying to establish if this is a real or a fake so this is $16 basically this actually seems like a very high quality speaker for that price part speaker part speaker we have airpods pro 2 here yeah that's upside down so that's not real go on so look at this ch cast over here that's not a real chomecast yeah you can absolutely tell i have a doubt you have a radar for this kind of stuff no idea that's perfect this place is absolutely mindblowing it's an apple watch ultra apple watch ultra look at the authenticity of the fake it's even got real apple style screws so the fakes have got better yeah right now at this moment there are about 100 people outside the store this is the one apple won't give you more than a single strap for free and that two is a very basic one right here you're getting seven straps seven straps meanwhile in india as of now it's $25 let's see how low we can go so i think we should try that power bank over there it looks like a like a knockoff version of one we have another thing you notice they do a lot here is they unbox everything live right in front of you so you can tell that it actually is what you think it is it has a built-in torch as well if i'm not wrong it's pretty interesting this one store has every single gadget also also the repairing at the back and the repairing at the back within like an 8 m length have some very authentic looking apple cases in the corner so a normal apple case would cost you $50 so500 worth of stash oh my god look at this look at that it's got all the hall marks of apple it's got the apple font it's got almost like a fake peel sticker but it is an apple be very curious how cheap we can get this $150 that's how cheap they've got a dual wireless microne system when i shop back home a price is a price when a company tells you it's not the case here no so sometimes it is to be honest but not everywhere $99 for everything we bought in this shop soar is saying it's twice the price it should be he's trying to get it hard it's a good haul we're just getting started mission complished part one part two is here street market time so this is where we get the real bargains $3 for ah gu interesting vitton adidas north face so now it's on different phones but sometimes you would have a single case with all the logos on one case i've seen that as well that's how it's called profit maximization yeah that's how you pay yeah that's how you pay everyone's using a smartphone everyone has good speeds of data everyone has a digital bank account and that's how the real life is so india right now does the most amounts of digital transactions globally that's crazy back home you don't see cases for anything but the iphone and samsungs you see a vivo i assume that's like a real me there's an oppo real me everything everything you can actually buy in india fake case toy cases like a ripoff of a ripoff we want to see like how good a speaker can sound that costs like a couple of dollars i just realized look they've got a series 9 watch with their gesture the gestures barely work on the re these two 2,000 yeah that's pretty good we'll do that so this one qr code allows anyone to pay anytime with their phone it has a speaker it will confirm the payment so that he knows that i have paid that is such a good system ind the a i want to see what else we can get at this market a lot of clothing so how much would something like this be k we50 nike shoes $3 so at this point we've got a handful of very inexpensive gadgets and one suspiciously affordable pair of trainers but i also want to make sure that while we're here here we pick up some of the higher ticket items okay so yeah that's two and then maybe also the projected spy cameras are a big thing here yeah where this is a apparently handheld gaming console but it's $10 so this seems even better the m8 pro a smart box that are attached to a dumb tv and it's 10k ultra hd 10k ultra hd 10k never heard of it you guarantee 10k yeah turns out the 10k is actually referring to the number of games but they knew what they were doing here aron surprise for you yeah something that very rare to see now come i'll show you straight away this like gor's favorite phone shop ever will become yours favorite as well have a look at this oh my goodness me engage no way what is this what am i looking at a call recorder for the iphone this is very interesting that is absolutely brilliant yeah yeah just like a small max power bank no software any call here oh my goodness me what what what is that so what are they do are they like indicators it can show you like these alien eyes or whatever and then the app you have all the combinations here just need a motor bike now roy maker made with pride in india that's brilliant make the dough put a small amount in between press it up we're going to spread it cook it and the right temperatures and give you this as an output i just need to learn how to make the dough my mom will be so proud this is what we came here for that was cool but we can't forget about the indian high street stores so we found the official s store of so it's a smart cafe it's like a mini store for the experience what would be really cool to get is india exclusive phones what's the most impressive m34 is the hot selling right now so this is an india exclusive phone samsung m34 we'll get an m34 this is a multi-brand outlet from let's say samsung to xiaomi to oppo to oneplus to real me what would be the most iconic like indian phone lava lava that's a good idea turns out not a single shop seems to sell this indian-made lava phone it's exclusively online to be able to make it as affordable as it can be there must be some string we can pull so i'll get you a lava because it's actually like super amoled curved screen let me pull that string and a sub to the channel would be mazar ma that was absolutely crazy bro time to raise the bar how about we use an app to shop we can actually shop smartphones not delivered to you like in a week's time but in facted under 10 minutes it's called blink it before you blink it you have it oh my goodness me that basically sounds like a superpower an app that allows you to order basically anything you want to wherever you are in minutes i think we have to test it let's get some tech earphones coming to you in 8 minutes minutes we don't even have an address right now they're called the air dopes of course they are you can get a foot massager you can get an actual massage delivered to you for services we have urban company so like let's say you want a haircut in the next 2 hours so as well as the blinket app which is all about getting products you quickly this urban company app covers your services you know this is one of the coolest things about india because development has happened later here than many other countries most of the population's first computer was actually a smartphone which means that everything here can run based on apps that factor in that the entire population is using a single platform it's incredibly streamlined so they can yeah repair your house they can even repair your car let's just do it then i'll book myself a shoulder massage for when we unboxing these products definitely need that i cannot believe it food massage this is the most insane merger of past and future your food massage honestly what on earth all thanks to this beautiful little bit of kit here i think the best shopping experience you know yeah because you don't even need to do anything yeah it's testing time so let's go roughly from least expensive to most expensive oh and also technical gori gifted me this he said it's a folding iphone so we'll get to that when we test the rest of the phones but let's start with the accessories so our $150 official iphone case and the $350 official nike shoes so case and shoe and i got to say pretty impressive case you can see the seam a little bit more than on an official apple case but it feels really soft it has that same rigidity that the real apple silicon cases do it has the felt interior and even the engraving i mean yeah it might get a little roughed up over time but then again this is what our official apple case looks like after a couple of months so i'm going to say straight 9 out of 10 the shoes are well definitely too small i think in really wanting to make a sale they just told me that the shoes will work for me which i've come to realize does not mean they are your size but apart from that the quality and the finish is well beyond what i was expecting like even if you took off the fake nike logo you still can't get shoes that look like this in the uk or us for less than $4 why are they comfortable this should not be comfortable but they are honestly i feel like you could just get a decent pair of insoles slap them in tell your friends you spent 20 times as much on your shoes as you actually did and they would believe you and while we're on the accessorizing train i did find this call recorder thing absolutely fascinating so you might know that iphones have no inbuilt ability to record a phone call i guess apple sees it as a privacy risk india does not seem as concerned so let's say i'm having a private phone call now or at least what d thinks is a private phone call hello what is your deepest darkest secret you didn't so obviously this thing records my voice cuz i'm speaking directly into it but for it to record the other person's voice even if your phone is not on loudspeaker it takes in the vibrations that their voice create in your phone and uses a level of processing that reconverts those vibrations back into a voice that you can play out loud see if it worked says the file was recorded on the 1st of january 19 1970 what is your deepest darkest secret question but since it's just us think i prefer sim you had no idea i was recording wow that's pretty impressive like it's not the clearest sound i've ever heard but given that it's converting audio that you wouldn't otherwise even be able to hear that's actually alarmingly good especially since it was done through this $150 iphone case which no doubt did not help the connection that's an eight let's just hope milo doesn't catch wi with that conversation ind really impressing me so far but audio is probably where we're going to get the clearest idea of just how the value for money stacks up cuz we have a lot of reference points so this is basically the absolute cheapest bluetooth speaker i've ever laid my hands on welcome to mv music world bluetooth mode no volume's not going to be an issue okay that's a lot better than i was expecting it to be it's a little bit muffled but very loud and very functional you know like when a friend says to you can you bring a bluetooth speaker with you to the park so we can have a big big barbecue or a dance this very much does that and because it's $7 you can have that without the possessiveness that comes with a product you might have spent $100 on so i am in ban it's even got rubber feet at the bottom and it's well connected you've got orcs input you've got usb you've got sd card and of course bluetooth i would go as far as to say that for what it is this is a 9.5 now onto what should be an even more impressive audio experience at $10 the a dopes yeah definitely losing yourself at least half a point for calling yourself the air does but more importantly this doesn't feel good like the colors look already muted the logo is off center the hinge is a little loose the actual construction too pretty rough around the edges and then to finish it off and i have noticed this on a few products out here is that it comes out the box with scuffs maybe the factories here they aren't as careful as they should be or maybe the packaging wasn't secure enough so during transit it's constantly getting scraped by the cable that also comes in the box whatever the reason is it just feels like i bought a pre-owned product now of course making packing and shipping a pair of true wireless earphones for $10 in total that is a really tall order and you feel that stretch here but if they work well and they sound good i'll still be impressed okay so opening them up does auto pair to your phone good start what the sound is in complete contrast to the rest of the construction it's crisp it's clear it's no dvla but i've also used plenty of $30 $50 earphones that don't sound as good as this which is enough i would say to give them a s at the same time though for every person who buys a pair of air does there's also going to be someone who really wants to feel like they have the real thing and that is what this is for i mean the packaging is not the most convincing it's very much giving off and we have apple at home kind of vi but the hardware is shockingly realistic for the price why does it sound like i just walked into a convenience store oh okay it pairs up in the exact same way as real airpods it actually comes up as airpods pro too and so far i am blown away by this cuz remember it's much harder to make a good pair of fake earphones than it is to just make the best pair of earphones you can for the money cuz you're building around an existing set of constraints those fit i want to say better than my real ones they don't have any active noise cancellation so we have been li to but you know the passive noise cancellation because of how well they fit lot better than you would expect for $15 they even have the official apple connection sounds i see where the compromise is so do you remember when beats by dre first became really popular and actual audio files were very upset because while they claimed to be the real way to listen to music they were actually just smacking people around the face with bass yeah so this is kind of like that but times five and at the complete cost of the rest of the sound there is definitely a type of person for whom that would be considered good sound but universally speaking that does kind of kill it for me so instead of giving these something like a 9 out of 10 i'm going to settle on a seven what's kind of crazy to me though is that because the baseline products here in india are so cheap it creates the space for actually good quality mid-range products for still less than $20 like this one from boat and i say good quality with almost no catch this feels really weighty high-end not actually dissimilar from those jawbone speakers that used to be really popular and you know $100 plus i think this is massage hi yo thank you oh my goodness this actually the perfect time to get some relaxing music on power on youve plugged into nirvana o that sounds good like a definite step up from the soundbar speaker we tested earlier and also it's got to a level where it's a very comfortable bas level audio experience where nothing feels particularly missing but also no one part of the music is overpowering the other the only two catches i would say are that one while it does look like a 360degrees speaker the sound does in fact only come out of one way and also i can see a tiny bit of paint having been scraped off and i wouldn't be surprised if this is just because the shopkeepers are so liberal with taking it out the box and demoing it to every single person they show it to it's getting places that no massage i've had back home has gotten overall you just don't get value like this in a typical british or american store 8 out of 10 one trend i have noticed while out shopping in india more so than anywhere else in the world is people love their all one products they want to buy a speaker for example but they also want that speaker to be their one-stop shop for all their tech needs and this karaoke mic is a pretty good example of that so for starters it's a wireless karaoke mic that you can sing into but it's also a voice recorder a voice changer and nightlight and it's all topped off with a 10 wat speaker that's not just how your voice is projected out but also how you hear the music that you're karaoke too oh and you can also choose whether you want to use the headphone jack or bluetooth or even the radio as an input that's interesting just jamming along to whatever tunes are on the radio that's quite a lot of stuff for what we negotiated down to $30 so the only copyright free song i can actually sing along to is happy birthday happy birthday to you happy birthday to this right here is one of the weirdest videos we have ever happy birthday to you over also this supposedly has the option to in real time be able to use artificial intelligence to strip the actual vocals from the song you're listening to so that you can just have the instrumental in the background let's try it happy birthday to so this is the original song voice cancelling oh my god that is an actually insane feature to have on a karaoke mic i'm going to go as far as to say 10 out of 10 diy as well thank you so much the final audio product then and the one i would actually say i'm most intrigued by is this set of digitech wireless microphones now i do realize that a microphone review doesn't sound like a party to most people but as a creator i use something exactly like this all the time you see this thing this is the dji mic 2 it comes in a charging case like these digitech it has two microphones like the digitech so you can stick one in a friend you're collabing with or interview doing except this is $350 it is 10 times the price of the digitech so you've been hearing this whole video what the audio sounds like on the dji mic this is what it sounds like on the digitech there's a difference there is definitely a difference but it's probably not as big as you'd expect it to be now of course yeah the dji does also have bigger batteries and some nice quality of life improvements like a vibration motor to let you know that it's recording but then again with this kind of price gap it is really cool to see how this company has still made it work how they've managed to cram all of those essential features into a package that does still do the same job and even though i'm sure dji could make something like this a simpler version of their existing microphones for like $70 that retain the same audio quality but lose a lot of the additional extra features of course they choose not to because when something like this exists it's of course going to cannibalize a lot of sales from something like this that kind of dilemma does not really exist in india which is quite freeing 8 out of 10 this one fun i want to make this a tradition to be honest where wherever we go to a different country to make one of these buying tech videos we get one piece of tech that helps us make a local food in japan we did rice cookers in india we're doing roties now i just need to get the stuff to make the dough blink it i can't describe to you how awesome the service is it makes the uk look backwards so while that stuff arrives in 7 minutes by the way let's test some watches it's literally got the hand doing the gesture on the box which is one of the headline features of the real series 9 but i'm just thinking the sophistication required for a watch to be able to pick up your hand gestures surely this $15 fake isn't going to do that impressively realistic presentation though holy cow i mean yeah the box was impressive but i thought the second i turn this thing on i'm just going to burst into a laugh but i'm kind of in shock right now so bearing in mind that this is a $15 watch by the way it comes with not one but two sets of straps and these straps are i'm not even exaggerating when i say indistinguishable i cannot tell the difference in quality between this and the real apple strap it feels exactly the same the same plush feel the same stitching quality it's embarrassing for apple to be honest you know what just for the lols let's swap out apple's real one for this one this is going to be my new strap so that one slides out and the new one slips in it's even locked in place using the exact same mechanism and titan that is actually such a joke but it's not just that this body is actually made of metal and glass and you see this crown it cycles through all the iconic official apple watch faces some do look a bit rough admittedly but what's shocking me the most is the quality of the screen i don't know how but it genuinely looks like an oled display with this level of contrast and because of it it achieves the exact same screen melting over the sides look as the real one oh yeah and it even charges wirelessly and magnetically and comes with the charger to be able to do that you know there's a saying when you're out here in india a saying that means to make existing things work at all costs or to make new things but with limited resources it's called jugad and i just feel like we're seeing it through and through with so many of these products we're testing just a a real scrappiness and a desire to make the best thing that you can and then also to sell it at whatever price you have to oh and then to top the whole thing off fake apple rings to track your fake steps oh i got an idea so here's a plan real apple watch fake apple watch i'm going to do 100 steps and we'll see which one step counter is more accurate let's go 100 okay so the real watch has calculated that as 112 which is surprisingly not accurate the fake has calculated it as 35 right so don't use it as a fitness tracker but as a surprisingly realistic lookalike to a real apple watch that does tell the right time 9 out of 10 oh and then if the $15 apple watch series 9 wasn't already ridiculous how about the $18 apple watch ultra which forget one band or two bands comes with seven seven bands if you were to shop on the official apple store that would cost you like $350 we have effectively paid less than five it looks like the watch is running the same software as a series 9 but completely new set of watch faces and i'm still taking in how they've basically recreated every single app that comes with an apple watch down to their own versions of the workout regimens and breathing exercises wait no no it's even got a blood oxygen app you know the whole blood oxygen thing that apple themselves were blocked from using cuz of that lawsuit from the company who said they copied their tech this has the blood oxygen app so if we enter the app it's actually flashing at the bottom surely not i know how we can know for sure let's try running the test while it's on a table so running running oh never mind it is still a very good value product for someone who just wants a watch oh and a strap for every single outfit they own in a slightly different vein then we got that spy watch it became pretty clear to me when out shopping that spy cameras in general are a big thing in india and it's super interesting how they work cuz look at this watch if you didn't know what it was then unless you were inspector cluso in another life there's no way you would just assume it was anything but a watch it tells the time like normal it's got chunky metal construction but i've been using it to secretly record this entire conversation and for me hly the most surprising card of it is how decent the quality is like the 108p video the audio considering how tiny the video camera and the microphone are very usable there's actually one more thing to this if you look closely you'll be able to see three leds in a triangle around this watch face those are infrared lights which means that this watch camera can see in all lighting conditions even in pitch black let me try and show you right let's see how that turned out oh and you know how they've hidden the usb port so if you keep rotating the crown on one side it comes out to reveal it it's such a tight fit it's almost like a feet of engineering slightly weir bringing you gr to the bath with me but this is a particularly dark room right now i can barely see anything team in credit wow that is cool i can see this being a part of a proper surveillance arsenal okay so roty ingredients are all here so a traditional indian roty you can actually make with just two ingredients flour and water so you just form a mound of flour pour a little bit of water on get your hands dirty bash them together with your hands and you get your dough and as soon as you have your little dough ball if you want to you can put a little bit of oil on there this is what my mom does i asked her moment of truth open it let me just close my problems yay it's a dark looking ry it's a one classic thing that happens when you cook rodes is they puff up as air starts to enter on the inside pretty impressively non-stick surface then what takes this from practical to treat is ghee which is essentially heated and clarified butter god look at this may have put a little too much on there let's load you up good looking bit of roti it's a little bit crispy on the outside soft chewy on the inside but very buttery all around i'm can actually eat a lot of that give me like like 5 minutes it's scir now just before we get to the phones which is definitely the thing i'm most curious about given that india has its own entire mobile sub climate i think it's time to make an india style tv setup okay let's do the next few together in wongo so the chomecast is not super convincing based on how it's packaged it feels cheap and light and well knockoff cuz it is but like a streaming device at $8 i can kind of see how that's possible but a handheld gaming console at the $10 we bought it for is almost confusing to me like $10 for a screen a chipset controls battery speakers who's making money from this we've got the foot massager which while my eyes are gaming is what my feet get to experience and that poor guy who manually cycled this thing to us i mean the thing is enormous he could have probably done with it the most then we got the home console the m8 pro which is significantly more expensive than the handheld although unlike the foot massager looks pretty modest in terms of what it's going to be able to run run and then what i'm banking on really being able to take all of this to the next level is the beam 440 projector which we paid $78 for i'm kind of blown away right now this projector for example is not just a projector it's an android tv box so netflix amazon prime youtube all of that not a problem it's got a 3w speaker built inside of it but also look at this stand you can rotate to any angle i thought it was'0degrees it's not it's actually 270 cuz you can even shoot down but the most impressive part of it is look how quickly the image corrects itself it doesn't matter what angle i'm shooting at the wall from it's basically 100% distortion free it kind of reminds me of samsung's freestyle projector and yeah that thing had a 1080p image this is 720p but that was $900 this is less than 80 it's a product that really embodies that whole jagard mentality like wherever you have space stick it down make it work so to me it feels like a strong nine the chomecast is not as good news sadly see like a real chomecast which would be $30 or so it can turn your non-smart tv into a smart tv by allowing you to at any point in time stream directly from your phone but unlike a real chomecast there is constant flicker and by flicker i don't mean something that's mildly annoying it's dysfunctional it just keeps turning on and off and no matter how many hours we pour into trying to fix it it is wasted it's starting to become pretty clear that this is a fundamental hardware issue so i guess this is the lottery you play when you buy things that are a lot cheaper than you expect them to be 1 out of 10 what about the console though well it's got this absolutely awesome intro featuring the likes of fake mario fake luigi and fake donkey kong i think so when you get in you got a fairly janky looking home interace but go to the game section and this is kind of game of paradise to be honest this tiny little box is effectively promising you the ability to play games from any console up until the playstation 2 including really difficult ones to emulate like the nintendo 64 and the playstation portable now that is a very exciting prospect to me it's just it seems like they forgot to you know actually put the games on here from what i can see online of other people with the same console theirs just works and i don't think i'm going crazy i mean the packaging even says builtin 10,000 plus games so unless the very definition of builtin is something different around here we have been lied to so i can't really give this one a rating it does make me think though we went to the full-on tech district in the middle of dilly and i didn't see a single playstation 5 or xbox series x i don't think gaming consoles here are nearly as much of a thing as they are in the west i guess in the west many people just take it for granted that yeah me and my entire group of friends can all afford to pay $500 for a console and $70 for a game you can do a lot with that kind of money here and a lot of people need to do a lot with that kind of money here so i assume that's why it's not picked up in the same way and so it does feel like the vast majority of gamers in india are mobile gamers jard using the hardware that you've already paid for instead of buying a completely separate set of hardware oh but there is good news too like my feet feel flipping fantastic i was a little scared when i saw the 45 or so dollar price tag of this thing but having used it now i can completely see why the thing's got proper pressure it really gets in there it's not the most plush or comfortable massager money can buy like you can absolutely tell that this isn't the royal foot service or 10,000 but it absolutely does put the work in i'll probably leave this one with the people who work here but we should definitely think about getting one of these back home and also look at this removable covers which makes a lot of sense because you're probably going to want to wash them every now and again and then for this handheld console everything is quite light and cheap but that's fine i completely expected that so at the start menu you can either click chinese or english interestingly not hindi it's basically 520 old school retro games wherever you go so if i click street fighter 20 2010 for example it's actually really good like yeah the thing's plasticky but it's comfortable the controls are really responsive the speakers are pretty good and the screen is everything you need to get an authentic retro experience wait angry bird it's like someone's completely reprogrammed what was originally designed to be a smartphone game into something that was made for a console 40 years ago i mean it kind of works but it's really bad this is definitely angry birds at home everything's so rigid and basic but i'm kind of impressed someone's done this and to top the whole thing off they are also promising 6 to 7 hours of battery life which is plausible i've already run it for three the other day and it was smooth sailing that's got to be an 8.5 just because of how bonkers it is that you can have 520 video games plus the console designed to play them on for less than the price of two cups of coffee back home ramping up now to some of the most expensive items we got from here with the $100 smart backpack oh wow this makes an impression i do always love the look of these hard shell backpacks they feel so precise and meticulous but i'm not sold on the practicality i just feel like the fact that they're so rigid and shape means they're naturally going to be less flexible to whatever you want to carry in the moment but alas this is no ordinary backpack it needs power so let's get our transparent power bank out by the way does feel like a massive bargain cuz this is the main power bank i use 25,600 mahs but it's $200 this $20,00 mah hours which is less but we paid $27 so there's a micro dot display which shows you battery percentage leds too oh and there's levels of brightness that's quite a bit brighter actually than a phone flashlight the only catch is it's not the fastest charging this is not going to be able to charge a laptop like this can but it can charge a phone or in our case a backpack so power bank goes in here oh yes we have power why am i so excited about a backpack this is is an unexpectedly slick app ooh that is interesting so if i tap on one of these sets of eyes and my bag looks like it's trying to kill me it's actually not a bad way of keeping people away from your property i'm actually quite impressed with the quality of animation like some of these actually seem to be running at a full 60 frames per second you've got eyes that animate you can change the shape of the eye oh you've got eyes that indicate that's actually useful i mean i don't imagine most people that are buying a bag like this are doing it for safety but just the nature of having leds on your back is going to increase your visibility on the road ooh i've just found a new menu that's got hundreds oh and it's even got ones that pass through from one side of the screen to the other as if it's one continuous uninterrupted display ah you can make your own okay give me a minute oh yes the perfect backpack does not exist jos is just shaking his head disapprovingly behind the cameras he split the image in two but now both his eyes are like a mile apart from each other we have fun okay this was a lot better than i was expecting it to be but fundamentally any backpack that requires a constant power bank inside to keep it going it's not really going to get past the novelty stage for me onto the phones now starting with this apparent folding ice own made by the company snexian which hey to beir is actually a bit of a looker okay this is not what i was expecting it to be i mean i don't know what i was expecting but i was not expecting this it's actually a feature phone with some pretty inconsistent backlighting behind the keypad a screen that doesn't seem properly aligned so if i click this button for example radio when notifications come in it lights up your social media logos which is quite amusing since there is absolutely no way this thing is running twitter it's got a headphone jack a usbc port oh that's interesting looks like a massive torch wow that is exceptionally bright i guess with most modern smartphones it doesn't make any sense to put a torch on top cuz it's also going to double as your flash for your camera but given that this phone doesn't really have to worry about that it's actually quite practical having a flash up here and it gives it space to make it extremely powerful i still can't see properly i wonder if you have any games on this thing i feel like a bit of classic snake right now would really hit the spot okay it's got one game and that game is f1 yeah guys this is actually the new portable playstation 5 oh wow i mean it's kind of adorable in its own unique way i'm not about to start shouting snacky from the rooftops but this actually isn't terrible value for someone who wants a decent feature phone with a form factor that's going to attract a lot of attention but thankfully we do have two proper smartphones the first is an india only variant from the global company samsung the second by an actual india founded and run company so let's start with the samsung this is the galaxy m34 and i actually really like the core fundamentals like it's well-rounded it's comfortable to hold it's inoffensive for the most part i wouldn't call it much of a looker from the front with its beefy bezel and notch but i would go as far as to say that the back is pretty here's my beef with it though the bloat wear situation here is perect like the moment i first connected to internet it just started freely downloading banking apps and games that i no doubt samsung india is getting a kickback from there's an entire page widget that's literally just a rotating advert i mean it's not hard to get rid of but the concept is pretty scary there's actually so much advertising here that it makes me angry like every single time you just lock and unlock it there's a new lock screen and each lock screen is a link to a different article with each one having a new advert literally every 8 cm of pid you scroll now if you look past that then performance and cameras do seem pretty strong for the price and one thing that i do really like about indian geared phones is they seem to go hard on battery like this thing has a 6,000 mah capacity i wonder if that's because india is such a spec focus market and battery is one of the easiest cheapest specs to upgrade either way 6 out of 10 here's what i would call the hero product though this is the lava ugy 2 and it's an indian phone through and through and this is what i was hoping to see we paid $200 for this phone $200 you would expect to get you a pretty noticeably cut back from flagship experience but look at this this is a 120 hz hdr 10 plus amoled display it is easily the best screen i've ever seen for this money the back of the phone very much feels like the high quality frosted glass that you get on flagships and the software is very close to stock android 13 this thing's giving me major google pixel energy and almost no bloatware which after the last phone is a nice change of bcee as for the camera let's test it so while we've been here in india obviously videos can't stop we still got to post on youtu youtube instagram twitter and importantly in this case tik tok tik tok's banned in india it'll just say you have no internet connection if you try and use it and so this is yet another one of those cases where by using surf shark vpn which redirects your internet traffic to trick sites into thinking you're someone and somewhere else saves the day i already use sur shark all the time whether it's to watch tv shows that i wouldn't have been able to watch or reduce the anxiety from joining what appears to be a pretty dodgy wi-fi connection but the craziest part of it is that it's barely cost me anything see with the code boss surf sharkk is less than $3 a month for an unlimited number of accounts with 6 months extra for free and a 30-day moneyback guarantee and given that you can actually use surf shar to save you money when buying expensive things like the tickets to get here that alone has been worth more to me than the subscription cost in totality oh yeah and this phone overall feels like a n to me
