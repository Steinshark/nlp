good morning friends we are going to do 
a day in the life of a software developer   today i'm going to take you along with me to 
my co-working space i'm also going to be what else   are we doing today i'm going to share with you 
some different technologies i use at work right   now as well as different projects i'm on what 
else are we talking about today oh also as you   may know i recently posted by the time this video 
is up a new video about building nfc and going   through a tutorial building an nft together and 
i'm just really continuing on with my journey for   blockchain and just finding different resources 
about it and actually you know what let's   continue this conversation sitting down i want 
to share with you something i recently discovered okay that's much better do you want to know crazy 
fact over 50 of the world's laptops pcs mobile   phones are idle at this very moment yes let that 
sink in but what exactly does that mean well for   one it means that there are billions of dollars 
of hardware that could be utilized for good i   recently shared with you about cudos which is a 
blockchain-based distributed computing network   and i wanted to share more about them with you 
and how they are helping the environment cudo's   decentralized cloud solution helps the environment 
by utilizing spare computing resources the network   is carbon neutral and soon to be carbon negative 
they are calculating electricity that is being   used and balancing this with carbon credits which 
is funding projects to protect the environment   many people aren't even aware of the carbon 
footprint of data centers and i really wanted   to bring this to your attention if you are like 
me and are interested in learning more about this   and cudos i have linked their website telegram and 
discord all down in the description so make sure   to go check them out okay let's get into my day 
in the life i'm really excited to take you with me   today and walk you through what a day is like for 
me every day is completely different to be honest   well yeah it kind of is especially what i'm 
working on which is exciting some days though   i might be working on a ticket for a few days or 
uh different defects or different things like that   but one of my favorite parts about my job is that 
i'm constantly working on different parts of code   and it makes every day kind of fun and 
exciting because you're solving problems   that are new and that you haven't faced yet 
okay so today i'm just looking at my calendar   i'm going to go to the co-working space 
paul is also going to come along with   me he also as you know is my boyfriend and 
is a full-time entrepreneur he has a bunch of   different businesses on the go but usually we 
don't go to the co-working space together but   because i'm filming i'm dragging him along with 
me so let's go check out the co-working space okay we are on our way to our co-working space 
paul is coming with me so he is the one filming so as you know i go to a co-working space 
about two times a week and it really helps   me i feel like just get out of the house have 
a different change of scenery and yeah it's   because ever since i started working i've been 
working from home and i just feel like getting   out of the house and having a reason to dress up 
and get ready is just essential and it gives me   time to myself oh here we go yeah it's true 
even though you're coming with me today i know   i have my own work to do yeah it's true anyways 
first things first though before we do anything   as always the most important thing the most 
important thing in the world is coffee coffee   we're on our way to take off don't do anything 
without coffee highly unadvisable it is it's true hey yo we basically just went in and stole a free 
coffee exactly that's what it looks like   ritual ritual ordering ahead honestly i love it we're on our way to our co-working space   i feel like i have a lot of work i need to get 
done today and i know it's typically easier to   work with monitors especially when you're coding 
but honestly some days you just need to get out   of the house i feel like otherwise i just i 
stare at my screen stare at my monitors so   it's worth the sacrifice of removing two 
monitors just to be in a different environment okay so i'm sitting here i have my little 
setup and it's really quiet today sorry   i'm like jiggling you it's really quiet today here 
because i think we're here pretty early and it's   just still quiet which is nice so today 
i'm working on a new feature as for those of   you who don't know i'm currently working on 
an angular project so as a software developer   and technical consultant it really means that 
i am always working on different projects and i   really like that because i feel like it pushes me 
out of my comfort zone a lot of times to do both   front end back end or really whatever is required 
of me so i've been working on an angular project   for a while now and i really like it i thought i 
would not like angular i'm like a react girl at   heart for the front end side of things but i'm 
actually really enjoying it so it's been good   but i really want to get on a project for 
like blockchain or something like that but   i know i feel like i still need to improve my 
skills before i even kind of request to get on a   project of blockchain so hopefully though in 
the next six months that will come but for now   sticking with the angular and doing that so 
yeah i'm working on a feature basically how it   works is different parts of the project are 
broken down into different features that are   coming up and assigned to developers based on 
difficulty based on the amount of time it would   take and all that so this ticket i am working on 
i'm hoping it will take me like three days three   days one thing i've learned though as a developer 
is never give an estimate of timeline i used to   always be like oh to my project manager i'd be 
like oh it's done in you know two or three days   and then three days comes and it's still not done 
and they're like you said it would be done now so   biggest tip for anyone who is a developer is do 
not give a timeline if it's possible you can see   paul in the back taking emails or two cheers 
okay i'm gonna give you a little tour here   so you kind of saw already the main 
floor so we're gonna go upstairs now it's kind of like the are just 
like or another kind of hangout   area with like a meeting room which 
i take a lot of my meetings in yeah this is my favorite wall this is another area i really like to 
work at i usually fit one of these kind   of three little pods here i just think 
that's a nice works up space nice size show you the view outside i just think 
it's really nice i'm not gonna go out   there cause it's freezing but you 
can see the cn tower right there   and yeah it's not really the 
patio yeah let me show you the patio in the summer time this is so nice to sit outside 
and just i sat there to catch up with like friends   that work here as well but never to actually 
do work so okay i feel like what you didn't   see on camera is we spent hours here doing a 
lot of work and it's time to get back to home okay so we are on our way back home the dogs as 
some of you may know go out with their dog uncle   as we call him every day so they should be 
home now because it's getting close to five so i'm   hoping they are home and gonna feed them gonna 
feed ourselves and then get in a workout okay   so we got home and i'm here with the boys can't 
see mexi i decided for my workout i'm like you   know what i just need to get outside it's actually 
pretty nice out here today despite it being winter   and freezing but i was like you know what let's 
get outside and get another walk-in although   they were out all day so now they're essentially 
walking me i feel like okay we are on the beach i   feel like i look like rudolph again because my red 
nose okay i feel like it's way too many to talk to   so i don't even know this is gonna work but i'm 
hoping to do like a 30 minute walk right now with   the dogs and go back and make dinner honestly 
on the couch and relax today's been really busy   mentally i feel like like just a lot 
going on and a lot of emails a lot of code okay i hope you enjoyed that day in the life with 
me walking through going through the co-working   space some of the technologies i use what else 
do we do today coffee which is essential   and just kind of talk to you a little bit 
about where i'm at you know as many of you   know i'm balancing my busy career which i 
love also with my business tiff and tech and   i also too was trying to learn new technologies 
and sometimes it can feel overwhelming but   i think the secret to it i don't even know the 
secret but one of my favorite things about it is   i love what i do i love technology and continuing 
to learn more about technology and sharing that   with you which makes it really fun and i feel 
like both worlds go hand in hand and it doesn't   make it feel like it's crazy amounts of work or 
working overtime or anything like that it just   it just works which is really fun so anyways leave
