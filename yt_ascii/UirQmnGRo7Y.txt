we scream in the west all the time about the environmental cost of wealth but the environmental cost of poverty is way higher way higher and so and this is something i can't figure out i cannot figure out why the greens don't get this because in principle they're on the left and the leftists in principle are on the side of the poor but when it comes but like the thing is like i take germany as example like the green lobby got into essentially a position of power within that country and they're effectively left with yeah and they were very they heavily campaigned against nuclear to push for other renewable solutions so they pushed heavily into wind and solar but the result of that was that the country no longer could power itself it had to buy power from from poland which was manufactured by coal and it had to b by and liite liite coal right not not just coal but the worst kind of coal yeah i know brilliant brilliant which is which is incredibly polluting and and and they also had to buy ironically energy from france which was generated by nuclear power so right right the costs the costs of the german went up for their power and they became their carbon footprint went up right right so we we want to we want to dwell on that for a minute so the consequence of the green movement in germany was that power let's let's lay it out power was five times more expensive than it should have been the germans became reliant on fossil fuels to a degree that they weren't before including reliant on putin which turned out to be a very bad idea let's point out plus now and germany is now in the throws of de-industrialization so the poor are going to get a hell of a lot poor and you might say well that's all worthwhile because we're so much greener but the truth of the matter is is that germany now has among the world's dirtiest energy per unit because of their idiotic policy so they didn't just fail on the economic front entirely and make the poor poorer they failed by their own standards because the bloody was to decrease pollution and what they did instead was increase it per unit of energy and not just a little bit a lot and so this just bedevils me because i cannot i cannot put my finger on why it it is that the leftists are simultaneously pro- environment pro poor people and anti-nuclear it's like sorry guys you don't get to have all three of them you can have two yeah i imagine there's a lot of posturing here and and it's yeah yeah not just say that all right yes but like as an example like i was working in utah once and there was this i was working in this small little town and there was a massive coal power plant there and i was like oh so this this power is utah and they're like oh no we we send all of this power straight to california i was like why and they're like well they shut down a lot of their power plants so so they can claim that they've greened essentially but really they're still they're still powering their tesla of coal that's being generated in utah and so it's it's the same kind of optics well you know californians in utah and and the inhabitants what are ut utonium i have no idea what you call utah ut what i have no idea anyways you know that california and people from utah they don't breathe the same atmosphere it's like china and the united states completely different air supply as everyone knows so yeah one of the reasons i like to talk to engineers is cu they don't get to posture like the thing that's cool about engineers is their stupid stuff either works or it doesn't and it's very unforgiving and so you know and and yeah it's okay the dei people and this and the the the politically correct types they're going to take all you engineers out too so you better get prepared well as a as a my days might be numbered so well plus you're an engineer man you've got a lot of things you know a lot of strikes against you so okay okay so so we we've we've made a case for for for these small these micro reactors now i'd like to know and you you alluded to something quite interesting you know you said that when you first started to contemplate doing this in the american environment you realized that there was a lot of a lot of industrial and infrastructure pieces that needed to be in place that had been allowed to decay because the americans had had a reliable supply of file material from the soviet union as a consequence of its collapse and so a lot of things were left to dec integrate let's say but now you've realized that that's also another economic opportunity so it sounds to me like you guys are planning to build a what would you say from the ground up enterprise that will allow for these micro reactors to exist so then i i want to know where you are how how you came to that cl conclusion where you are in that process and then again because i have a particular interest in western canada i'm curious about you know how how these ideas have been received in places like scu one so i would say there there's like three questions there y yep y so how how these things have been received like let's start with that one so yeah i think certain territories like alberta become very friendly to the idea of powering a lot of their remote industries even the oil sands operations with nuclear power right right right right and that's incredibly energy intensive industry and so there has been support voiced for the and there's like an invest alberta program which is looking actually to bring in smrs but that's not ubiquitous across the whole country like you don't you wouldn't see the same receptiveness from say british columbia where i am currently it's it's again certain more industry-friendly provinces would would drift in that sort of area and i i think honestly toronto well the ontario the greater tontario area came to the conclusion that nuclear had already provided a substantial portion of the energy for the province and they didn't want to substitute that for more more fossil fuels so they they've gone back and invested in it canada actually has a pretty decent i quite like the reactors they put together that can do reactors and they also they almost generated their entire independent industry because they opted for designs that weren't being widely used across the world so canada is actually in a very strong position to build out their own smr industry if they invest properly now in doing that otherwise they're they're going to suffer in the same way that the united states is suffering from getting going now and another thing you you mentioned is why we why we saw these problems that we saw big companies like say terra power it's it's a big smr company and it's backed by bill gates so there's there's no shortage of money for this thing to get going but they effectively did could not find enough fuel to put into their reactors to complete the test work and we thought that's very interesting so what happened there well they effectively had to shut down for two years and that's the worst thing that can possibly happen because you just burn cash and so they probably they're probably going to burn through hundreds of millions ions of dollars and so the advantage you know a wise man can learn from the mistakes of others so hopefully we just saw that and we thought well if we can't we're not backed by bill gates so we can't afford to make aund million dollar mistake like that or or a billion dollar mistake like that and so really before we saw the us government realized that there was a significant problem which which very closely mirrored the ukraine war when relationships began to become very strange and they began pushing a lot of funding opportunities out there to build back their infrastructure and they're doing that now but it's it's still come a bit late and so the advantage we had is we started doing that before these funding opportunities from the us government came out to build conversion facilities deconversion facilities fuel fabrication enrichment facilities because otherwise if if russia cut off the states now and they're still they are still through back channel dealing in the supply of rich uranium because the us can't aff to go without it they don't but they don't want to have those channels open anymore and they they they want to cut ties but they can't do it and you mentioned earlier that germany lost sovereignty over it so for over itself partially because it it couldn't power itself it was riant on russian gas right that's a situation no country really wants to be it you want to be have sovereign energy you know absolutely otherwise you your diplomatic strength is completely gone and yeah well you'd think that no country would want that but when you watch the policies that they're pursuing a sensible person would conclude that that's exactly what they want and i i i do believe that posturing has a very a very large amount to do with that because almost all of the green idiocy is is narcissistic posturing it's the pretense of doing good without doing any of the actual work [music]
