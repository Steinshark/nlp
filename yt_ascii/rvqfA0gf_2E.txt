subscribed yet you can hit the subscribe button if you'd like no pressure at all to celebrate i'm gonna show you the most vile disgusting checkmate i have ever seen in my life this video is actually going to be educational because this checkmate has never ever happened in a full game it's gotten close but people play differently so you can be the first person to try this out in a game i've also put all the moves in the description because this comes out of an opening and in april of 2023 this will be in my i'm making a course on the chessable website because chess.com acquired play magnus in chessable but that's you know it's a different story so there will be a link in the description to that let's begin and i will show you the bong cloud checkmate now first of all what's a bond cloud well bong cloud is an opening in chess where you move your king out on the second move now you could do it like this you can play e3 and like this you can play f3 and king f2 bond cloud is a nice little way to completely remove your right to castle and basically disrespect your opponent king to e2 on the second move is the bomb cloud okay why would you play the bomb cloud well it's like i said it's it's a method of disrespect nerfing yourself if you will not showing your opponent any sign of competitive you know respect i i can't think of another word for respect so e4 is what we will be starting with but how can you checkmate with the bomb cloud buckle up black needs to respond with the sicilian defense now you will play knight c3 there's a lot of ways to play against the sicilian defense the sicilian defense one of the most popular openings in chess and if you play the kingspawn you need to have a good weapon against this i recommend knight c3 and now d6 that is basically the most popular second move tied with knight c6 d6 black is trying to play a dragon sicilian maybe a knight or sicilian and now you play pawn to d4 and bring your queen out now that might look a little bit counter-intuitive right because why would you bring your queen out if it can be attacked well we're just gonna drop back we're dropping back and blocking our bishop because we want to put our bishop here here here some of you might have seen this before i i've called this the magnus carlson sicilian i've made a separate video as to the origins of this the lore of this if you will but the point is we're going to go here here and castle queenside right and the position that we are searching for that you will probably get in your games goes like this g6 b3 black develops the knight and tries to play the dragon setup something like this now both sides are castled on opposite sides all right so long castle short castle and we play f3 and when the kings are castled on opposite sides what you would like to do is you would like to start an attack very quickly now black can attack us here in a variety of different ways like a6 b5 queen a5 bishop e6 rook c8 night before etc now here is a way that some of your games might go a6 g4 b5 h4 right like we're both just throwing cannons at one another many people here get scared of h5 okay they do not want the move h5 to happen because if we get here it's a little bit too close now and we basically are are forcefully opening up the h file or if we're not going to open up the h file we're gonna smother the bishop to death in the corner of the board right so that's kind of what people try to avoid and they try to play moves like h5 but the problem with a move like h5 is that the knight needs to anchor the pawn because it wants to do this we're not going to let that happen we're going to immediately go here now a couple of things are happening we're targeting the knight like this and by the way all these moves are in the description so if you forget copy paste the moves in the description into any analysis support chess.com forward slash analysis boom so these nights are interacting right that night needs to guard that so that can't work and when this knight takes we'll take the bishop so black is about to lose both defenders of the king and the pawn and in a worse nightmare situation for black black will go here and we don't stop we keep pushing forward and the idea of this is that when we gambit both pawns our queen gets in our rook gets in and one of the most violent and vicious ways to completely destroy black hair game over as you can see plus seven according to the engine here we go we chop down the bush we go rook takes h5 bishop takes g7 queen g5 check we take with check and now you must check again and the idea is it's not a draw you aren't repeating moves but in the middle of the game you get a ladder checkmate queen and rook on side by side files g and h rook d2 absolutely brutal conclusion to this game rook d2 and you can't stop it you can go here i take rook h2 is completely unstoppable alright black can only delay it by a move or two so that is what you are going for when you play this queen d4 thing you want them to do all of this and you want them to do the dragons and this is what you're gonna face the most g4 h4 on the way after that you just need to learn how to deal with various you know counter-attacking measures that that the opponent can play against you but this is what you want okay you want an opposite side castling kind of game f3 g4 and etc etc etc now that would be nice if you could absolutely pulverize everybody like that but not everybody is going to play like that right some people are going to play in a different way so what i have named the professional variation in my course is the following black does not play knight f6 ever black plays g6 here and now bishop h6 which looks like black is stupid all right it looks like you know it's like when you first learned about moving your bishop out here and you you would move it out that way because you're out like here he's like oh it's more active ah i'm so smart no but in this case it's actually not so bad the bishop comes here and the knight stays home for now and you need to block the attack on your queen with f4 now many people here see this and go okay e5 all right and we we will look at that last i will show you and that leads to the bomb cloud checkmate that will lead us to the promised land but you also want to learn how they play the right way so one of the most critical moves here for black is to mirror this and f5 f5 is very sharp if you're below the level of 2000 you will never and i quote never face f5 ever because nobody nobody's nobody studies just to this extent f5 is what all the grand masters play and it's in it's a very complicated game in my course i'm recommending bishop b2 bishop d3 supporting the center long castle and the position is complicated as you can see i mean it's very very tense position if both sides play well in chess that's what happens you get a good fight volkanovsky islamakuchov right tense fight back and forth now the right way for black to play here is to go here first and then play e5 to put pressure on this and pressure on this and now you need to defend yourself with g3 both sides castle and it's a very complicated game once again now here i've had some games go rookie eight i slide my king out of the way of the bishop and life is good bishop g4 bishop e2 we take it easy trade pieces now black will try to create an attack here we try to create an attack on this side of the board all right rook f1 h3 g4 knight d5 at some moment and it's a get once again a very tense fight after black plays knight f6 and bishop h6 and then e5 black has to play this first why why can't black just play e5 right away because now you do not play g3 pay attention to the difference i will do it one more time bip h6 attacks the queen you block black has to go here first because they keep an eye on your pawn if they don't if they don't keep an eye on this right because your knight has to stay at home it cannot move or else it will be taken if they do this first now you play knight p5 and now pandemonium on the chessboard pandemonium because there's no way for black to deal with this no way i mean they can play king e7 but then you play bishop a3 and slaughter the king they can play bishop back to f8 but that is a miserable move you can take on e5 knight f3 bishop b2 long castle etc so the best move there is for blacks to play bishop takes f4 alright and now you must remember this this is not easy to remember you do not take with check but you take with the queen and now folks we are headed straight for the most epic checkmate i have ever seen in my life alright if you had the patience to watch 10 minutes you don't have a bad attention span pay attention queen d6 threatens something very nasty knight c7 so if this knight c7 check and black is mated they have to sacrifice the queen to avoid it and you're completely winning so most people after queen takes d6 take your queen and do this and now it's checked now black can go here or here the best move is not to move into your night because bishop a3 is coming all right bishop a3 is very very bad news for black so most people will play king f8 you still play bishop a3 now the best move is to block like this if they block the attack you develop okay and you pressure you're not taking anything your knight is just a menace that's what it's doing and then something like this might happen develop your bishop kick this bishop out and can and come back and hunt down these pawns are oh that's a terrible arrow oh my god that's an even worse arrow so if they play 97 knight f3 bishop c4 castles very very very good position because this knight is so powerful and you're going to hunt the f7 pawn and these pawns as well like this pawn if it if it if if you're able to take it like if the bishop comes out but the most popular move here by far played online like 50 60 times is making a run for it and look at the evaluation bar shoot up to the moon like amc in 2021 folks it's over fitness disgusting king hunt you've ever seen because it looks like you're out of the way but you're not 98 check the king cannot go to these two squares so the king runs bishop evades have you ever seen something like this your pieces are on the opponent's back rank and the king is evicted the king is evicted now you need to remember the right move here because bishop e2 looks really appetizing but it's not the right move because black blocks you need to follow the king to g7 knight g7 check and now no matter where the king goes it's mate but one of them is far more egregious than the other this position in online games has been reached about 15 times no one has ever gone backwards and tried to repeat moves nobody has ever done that most people in this position go forward okay they play king h4 if they do that you give a check and now you must remember that since the king cannot go backwards king f2 and h3 is mate pawn to h3 is unstoppable checkmate there are ways for black to sacrifice the bishop and delay h3 is game over mate in one move the same if black goes to g4 if black does this then it's very simple check check and the king can run backwards because we already know if the king comes forward king f2 h3 mate but if the king runs backwards to f6 check you ain't getting anywhere because rook to d1 now yeah you can also win the rook you can also win the rook but this is brutal because that's mate this leads to like everything leads to mate the king is completely cut off and if you forget this i've put the moves in the description for you to memorize them so if we give this check and the king goes forward the king is done for but what if the king goes backwards if the king goes backwards you're welcome because you're about to win the game like you've never won a game of chess in your life you must remember you're not trying to repeat moves that is not what we are going for but rather you need to block the bishop with knight e6 not double check because that allows this knight e6 cutting off the escape king up to eat to h5 now the only place to give check here that makes any sense is with the bishop and now the bishop cannot block so the king's only legal move is to come forward now you play pawn to g3 check the only legal move for black in this position from this point forward black has no option but to play only moves and it leads to mate are you ready take a deep breath take a sip of water [music] you're about to witness greatness and i hope you pull this off in your games king walks forward pawn to g three check it would be mate but the bishop takes we take back it's mate unless the king takes now here it looks a little bit tricky because you want to play something like this and then rook h3 but don't do that because suddenly you lose your knight and you got no mate every move has to be checked the only check literally the only check in this position that you have is rook h3 and now you see the importance of blocking the bishop the king now walks forward we play bishop to f3 check the king makes it to our side of the board with king takes g1 and now ladies and gentlemen i present to you king to e two check from the rook and the corner and incidentally bong cloud checkmate thank you so much for three million subscribers we might have more in the future i appreciate you all very very much now get out of here
