this is my favorite lens bag and this is a giant ugly hole that goes all the way through it this isn't a gear review though i do love this bag thank you think tank it's actually the spot where a bullet almost killed me in 2019. there's also bullet marks on my tripod a couple of my batteries and a bunch of other stuff in my kit i work with this stuff all the time and i don't normally think too much about it but for some reason today it caught my eye and really got me thinking about this last year and what it's meant to me to find a balance between filmmaking and living my life [music] sometimes we get so caught up in our careers that we think there's always going to be time for living life later but it's only in terrible moments do we realize that that's not a guarantee i was taking huge risks on my jobs and it became strangely routine to the point where i didn't really think it was possible to get hurt i knew that on paper mexico was the second most dangerous country on earth for journalists but i always managed to convince myself these were things that happened to other people and never to me i was somehow above it all and i never seriously considered that i could be wrong that all changed in a second i won't get into all the details but the short version is that we were filming an interview with cartel members when the location we were shooting in got ambushed in total there were eight people in the room and three of them got shot one of them fatally my camera and tripod took three rounds from an assault rifle and i was standing six inches away from it ready to hit record it's a miracle that i didn't get shot but in that moment as the room exploded all around me all i could think of was this isn't worth it obviously i made it out of there okay i went home to canada but just after a few weeks off i went on two international shoots i was burnt out and my nerves were completely fried but i was scheduled for more and i had no plans to slow down at all my response to trauma wasn't to take a break and slow down it was to work even more then the outbreak happened and everything was canceled one after the other in a domino effect until i had no jobs left at the time i thought it was the worst thing possible i couldn't see that i actually really needed a break and maybe the pandemic was a blessing in disguise before all this happened i had basically just become an image-making machine and i really wasn't enjoying it anymore i was just doing it mechanically getting the shots i needed and doing a pretty good job of it but a lot of the time my mind was elsewhere it got to the point where on one shoot as we were filming people packing heroin into cars as they prepared to smuggle it across the border i realized it was the fifth time i'd filmed the exact same scene i wasn't growing as a storyteller or learning new things about the world and that's the whole reason i got into documentaries in the first place now don't get me wrong shooting docs is fun even when it's familiar subject matter but i felt like i was just churning out the same thing over and over again working for money and the prestige of big name clients rather than because i felt connected to the stories i said yes to every job at one point i remember i was only home for 12 days in a three month period and when i did get home between shoots i was just waiting for the next job to come i had a great life in mexico and i loved my friends but i was ruthless i was basically just living to work only when cove would hit and the world went into lockdown and i was forced to take a break that i didn't really want to take that i start to change slowly it wasn't an easy transition i was jumpy and short-tempered and i felt trapped by having to stay home after years of being constantly on the move i kept thinking that normal people were out to hurt me and i was really nervous in a lot of very ordinary situations i remember being surprised by someone coming out of a doorway late at night and my first thought was that they were there to kill me but as i settled into the inevitability of the situation i started to slow down i started to write about my experiences and through that i began to see how my hobby had turned into an obsession and nearly cost me my life the first few months were rough i struggled with impatience and i really wanted to get going again i think a lot of people must have felt the same way eventually though i got used to the new reality gradually i started to find happiness in things that weren't about my career as a dp i set down roots i got some house plants and i hung pictures on the wall for the first time in 10 years i made a real home for myself i started to shoot again images of the city and lockdown the first personal project i'd started in years then amazingly things started to happen the personal project was bought by a large telecommunications company i went hiking and bike touring and reconnected with nature after a decade of living in huge cities i was healing slowly but still healing now the pandemic seems to be winding down it's definitely not over but i think the worst of it is behind us and while i would never in a million years want to go through it again looking back it's been an amazing year my desire to shoot and document the world around me is back and i can't wait to start working again i wrote a 400 page first draft of a book i started this youtube channel to give me a creative outlet that isn't dependent on airports being open so in a lot of ways it's been a terrible year probably one of the worst of my generation but in many other ways it's been amazing i fell in love with my work again and remembered how to live for things other than my career and if kovit hadn't come along none of that would have happened [music] the point isn't that we shouldn't care about our careers it's that we need to make time to remember what we care about in life and we aren't always very good at setting that time aside i'm so ready for this to be over but at the same time i'm grateful it happened i know that i'm lucky in many ways and it could have been way way worse people have died the economy fell apart friends lost their houses and jobs and i barely made it through financially this last year has been super weird for me like it has been for everybody but in a lot of ways it's been one of the most important years of my career i don't mean that i got a lot of jobs or bigger clients or anything like that actually quite the opposite it was a financial disaster but this job almost killed me a couple years ago and it was only because of the pandemic that i was forced to slow down and think about what's really important to me in my life in filmmaking don't get me wrong i can't wait for kova to be over but if the pandemic hadn't happened and i hadn't been forced to slow down i don't know that i would have taken the time to think about what's really important to me in life so kovid good riddance but from the bottom of my heart thank you
