moore's law sounds like a comforting or perhaps disturbing promise that computer processing power will double about every two years but despite the fact we call it a law there have been plenty of folks in the tech center opining that moore's law is in fact dead and we're hitting some kind of wall when it comes to just how powerful we can make our technology but how much truth is there to the rumor and who the heck is more anyway what turns out gordon moore wasn't just some guy that made an observation about cpus he was one of the founders of intel his story begins back in 1957 a few years after he finished his phd at caltech at the time he was working for nobel prize winner william shockley on semiconductor development but shockley wasn't exactly the best boss with his management style characterized by paranoia aggressiveness and intrusiveness the trinity of bad boss qualities so maybe it's not surprising that he was later disgraced for espousing views that could only be described as alarmingly racist moore and seven of his colleagues left shockley's company and started a new firm called fairchild semiconductor this walkout became so famous that moore's group became known in tech circles as the traitors eight ravaging towns across silicon valley fairchild went on to develop the first commercially viable integrated circuit and although the company is no longer around its employees went on to found other influential tech firms including both amd and intel it was also at fairchild that moore thought up the first formulation of his famous law in 1965 that the number of components in an integrated circuit would double yearly along with fellow traitorous aidster robert noise more left fairchild in 1968 to found a new company they originally thought about naming more noise but since that sounded too much like more noise they decided that wasn't the best brand for an electronics firm and i wish i could go back in time to tell them they're making a huge mistake instead they went with nm electronics but quickly changed the name to intel less than a month after the company was founded sounded a little more noise so now you know why more was important but is his law still as important as the man himself we'll tell you right after we think grammarly for sponsoring this video grammarly is throwing their hat into the ai ring with grammarly go which offers

moore's law prophesies exponential growth in transistor density moore himself later predicted that the rate of increase would eventually slow down in 2005 moore pointed out that we'd eventually hit some pretty hard physical limits such as the size of an atom and indeed while we've seen experimental transistors that work by changing the position of only a single atom there's still a debate raging as to whether this is the right way to look at moore's law one consideration is that there isn't a standardized way to determine how big transistors are they're already isn't much consistency between intel and amd and with newer transistor types that involve three-dimensional designs and alternative materials focusing on transistors per unit area might actually be missing the point instead current discussions on moore's law tend to be more about whether we're going to continue to see a certain amount of processing power gradually become cheaper jensen wong ceo of nvidia famously said last year that he believes moore's law to be truly dead as silicon wafer costs had risen to the point where consumers could no longer count on getting significantly more performance at a lower price if they waited a year or two jensen was simply making an observation there's nothing he can do about it but of course that doesn't mean the price of a wafer is the only variable to think about we've already seen chiplet-based processors that save money over monolithic chips that get lower yields new transistor designs like gate all around that can push through more electrons at once and the rise of artificial and intelligence which aims to provide more performance through machine learning than we'd otherwise see just from doubling the number of transistors alone so while we might not be able to keep making our chips impossibly chock full of transistors the tech industry still has plenty of tricks up its sleeve to make a future full of self-driving cars hyper realistic games and disturbing deep fakes a reality somehow i don't think computers will ever be powerful enough to make twitter a more civil place but you were powerful enough to make it to the end of this video hey thanks for
