[music] first up is the smartphone triggers a product oh is pretty skeptical about but turns out they're not just effective but also very inexpensive there is zero setup you take them out the box and slide them onto your phone and with a lot of top-tier games like pub g there is an option to configure controls and all you do is drag the response you want underneath where the trigger will lie and then motivated ly the trigger will activate that response and as i said i was sceptical i wasn't even planning to include these in the video but it turns out they are a really satisfying tactility to games like pop g take a listen to this this is the magnesia and we've had a look at a few products like this that magnify your phone's display before but this is the best one i've ever used and to start with considering it's not exactly an expensive product the packaging is incredible even the instruction manual is this glossy little silver pamphlet i just really like the way it's presented the whole thing is made of plastic it feels a little unremarkable but nonetheless solid and what you do is you open it up and there is a little tray inside which you place your smartphone on and then slip it into the back of the device and that's it all of a sudden your phone screen is 2 times larger and what i particularly like about this one is that you can even tilt it a little bit and it doesn't become to distort it there's also a flap that opens at the side which lets you plug in earphones or any wired speakers you might want to welcome to the marshall kilburn to a portable speaker that falls back on six key pillars over 20 hours of battery life on a single charge with the ability to check your current level at any time powerful 36 watt multi directional sound with back firing tweeters as well as what's on the front you've got bluetooth 5.0 apdex and multi host functionality so two people at once can be connected and control the music it's got marshalls traditional roadworthy aesthetic and is encased in vinyl weird ipx to water resistance there is sound customization with these control knobs on top if you want accuracy you can do that if you want bass well that can be arranged too and the last thing is the charging speed twenty minutes of charging equals three hours of playtime this is a fun one and easy to dismiss as a bit of a novelty but there are definitely cases where it could be very handy it's a membrane keyboard that rolls into a shape barely a fraction of its original size which means it doesn't really have any problem fitting into a backpack or even a pocket and it's a wireless keyboard so you have this little usb connection that you can take off plug in to a usb type-c adapter and then into your smartphone and that will mean you can wirelessly use this keyboard on the go to type documents up and whilst obviously it's not as good as a mechanical keyboard there's a decent amount of tactility here so as long as you have a flat surface it's pretty quick to type on you've all seen these mini projectors floating around the place and they are very mixed in terms of quality but here we have one that isn't just inexpensive but also works with your smartphone and produces a serviceable output visually obviously for this kind of price it's pretty simple you just got a white body with this yellow stripe down the side and it is tiny it really is it fits into most jacket or jean or jogging bottom pockets and of course compared to higher-end projectors there are compromises the room needs to be pretty dark the display size only goes up to 50 inches and the resolution is stuck at 480p but for a non discerning consumer who just wants to expand the screen of their phone this is one of the best cheap ways of doing it not too long ago on one of these episodes i showed you guys a pretty neat little waterproof bag that you could place your smartphone in and it would be fully sealed against water up to ten meters deep well this one by mpow has a similar functionality but also adds bluetooth connectivity so you download the application pair it up with this bag and all of a sudden you've got a remote shutter button so even when your device is submerged underwater you can take a photo or start and stop recording if you've been watching this series for a while you might know i'm not a massive fan of smart phone lenses to me they're one of those things that's kind of really cool and concept but something i never end up using well if you were going to take one small phone lens with you this might just be the one it has not one and not two but four lenses in a single product this little gadget has an or point six five times wide-angle lens or if you wanted to go super wide 160 degree fisheye in a similar capacity then got a pretty okay 1.5 times telephoto lens but then if you want to get a lot closer a 10 times macro lens like most products on this list the next one is a little weird the best way of describing it would be a time lapse stabilizer it is a compact solid metal gadget and what you do is rig it up to a smartphone holder and then attach it to a tripod the bottom of the device is a rotating element and all you do is rotate it to set a timer and whatever time you set that's how long your device will spend slowly panning around while it's on your tripod capturing a moving time-lapse that you only really see in films this next product is for the real gadget enthusiasts if you're someone who owns multiple recent smartphones or tablets or other devices that support wireless charging well this is a very slick alternative charging station i got to admit when i picked it up for the first time i thought it looked a little bit like something you might throw and it would come back to you but even that i think it looks pretty nice it's low profile and each of these three spots can wirelessly charge a device not to mention there are two usb ports on the top as well to charge those products that can't be charged wirelessly now i have covered quite a few different devices in the past which have nfc tags built into them but ultimately if all you want is the nfc functionality they end up being a lot more expensive than they need to be and just buying 10 nfc tags like this on their own can actually be really good value for money all you need to do to set it up is download the nfc tools application and then drag your phone over a tag to read it and once that is done you can create any kind of command it could be triggering a brightness change or opening a certain application and assign it to that tag and that means that wherever that tag is in the house just placing your phone on it will trigger that outcome i'd say they're especially useful and cool if you own a lot of smart gadgets for example you could even place one in your back garden and placing your phone over it could trigger a chain in color or change in brightness of your outdoor lights this one is maybe the most wacky on the list we are talking about a magnetic levitation stand and having played with this for a while now i think it's something which is cool to see but at the same time not something i would necessarily recommend buying except for one particular purpose it uses an electromagnetic field to separate this floating base over the main body and on this base you can place any object that weighs up to 500 grams so if you've got a little potted plant this might actually be a really cool way to display it but the website shows it being used as a smart phone stand which is why i initially bought it for this video but this i would not recommend doing because electromagnets are famously not very good for your smartphone if you did enjoyed this video i've got an entire collection of smartphone gadgets content so i'll leave links to that from this video and as always thank you so much for watching my name is aaron this is mr. who's the boss it'll catch you in the next one [music]
