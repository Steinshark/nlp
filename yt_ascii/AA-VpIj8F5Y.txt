- we have four treadmills
and four contestants. last one to step off the treadmill will get $1,000 for every mile they run. so if chris is the last one to step off and he ran 50 miles, he gets $50,000. the more they run, the more they make. all four of you, please step on the treadmills. set 'em to 3.3. here's the gist. whichever one of you stops
running/walking/jogging, i don't know what you're doing wins. - are we allowed?
- what the! - we just got those. - we literally just
started making tank tops and chandler already ripped one and- - too skinny for tank tops. - i like your nipples. - thank you. - if just one foot touches
the ground, you're out. no questions asked. last thing, anything you want, we'll get. you guys are not allowed to die on me. all you guys already know chris. this is marcus. anything
you wanna say to him? - hey guys, my name is marcus. that's about it. - you know, chandler, the
guy who loses a bunch. are you gonna turn that around today? stop, stop.
- okay. i'm not doing it. - you're gonna fall. chandler, we're doing
challenges until you win. so just hurry up and win.
- all right, let's win boys. - and then this is ty-
- hello. - from the cereal videos.
you guys really liked him, so we brought him back. so chris, how you doing right now? - i just ran at nine. i feel great. - how you doing martin, whoa, you've already worked up a sweat. how you feeling, chandler? - i'm doing great, boss. - all right, you all are
looking a little exhausted. so let's mix this up. currently, they're on 3.5 speed. chris, i'll give you a
chance if you want to, you can roll that die and whatever it lands on, you have to set your
treadmill to for a minute. so you can roll a one and then get a chance
to walk for a minute. - two.
- two. so now you gotta move your
treadmill down for a minute. you gotta go on two speed. look how much slower he's going. how do you feel? - feel like i'm not making money. - here, chandler, you do
it. roll the die. two! all right, so you can move it down to two. go for a roll. - six.
- five. he has to bump it up to five. ty, please roll at one or
the viewers will kill me. - what is that?
- six. - two. the viewers don't want to see you suffer. - it's a good thing these
new tank tops breathe easy. - i know. where'd you get these? - shopmrbeast.com. - hey, chandler, is
there anything you need? actually, it doesn't matter. ty, what do you need? - gushers. gimme gushers. - what? that's my thing. - marcus, do you need anything? - fruit snacks. - can you go get fruit snacks? - aye, aye, captain. - anyone else wanna roll the die? oh. oh, you did get a one. here's your fruit snacks
while you're on one speed, enjoy 'em.
- thank you. - i roll the dice. - okay, whatever you do, don't roll a six. - i'm gonna get that money, boy. . - come on, ladies, let's work it. - my shoes are unvelcroed. - ty, what are you at? - a mile. - so if you won right
now, you'd get a grand. what about you, chandler? - i'm at 0.9 86. - so you'd win about $900. - 0.987.
- $980. - 1.1 miles. - so you'd win $1,100. that's chump change, boys. get the numbers up. i want someone here to
walk home with 100 grand. - get it walk. - and like i said,
please, no one die on me. that'd make me look bad. - how's it going 10 right now? - let's go 10. - what happened? - we're still walking. - the electricity just cut off on us. - yeah. keep walking. - but they're still walking. - i think it's 'cause we went to 10. - it's 'cause we all win to 10. - all right, let's not all go to 10 again. - don't everybody go 10. - drinking applesauce. - that's gatorade. - it went in my nose. you want a hit of this? - sure. - and just out knocked to clean out. - well he just redeemed himself with some apple sauce. - how much apple sauce did you just take? - no, gatorade for you. - it's good. - ty, here's a rubik's cube. take it. here's a rubik's cube. marcus, here's a rubik's cube. chris, here's a rubik's cube. $3,000, if you solve the rubik's cube. - i'm color blind.
- but don't lose sight of the overarching gold challenge. - all right. - i don't know what i'm doing here. you try to trip me. - you good?
- yeah. - all right, you guys
all wanna just give up and move on to the next challenge? - yeet! - just throw it. you're the last one. you assaulted chandler. i'm gonna let you roll
the dice for marcus. one! hey! now roll the dice for chris. - yeah, we gotta go eliminate him. ah! mydreon, roll the die for chandler. - yeah, but i just kept it where it was. - two! oh my gosh, you're
just the giver of low numbers. ty is marcus' biggest competitor. you better give him a high number. - oh! - six. and look at everyone just like, literally barely moving and then ty. all right guys, so i'm
hiding in the bathroom and i have a secret i want
to tell you guys about. as you guys know, chandler has not won a challenge yet. he's lost all of these. we're gonna do "last to leave" challenges until chandler finally wins one. and you guys really want him to win one. so i'm gonna do something special. if chandler wins a challenge, i'm gonna give him a $50,000
bonus on top of the prize. so if he wins today, he'll
get the prize plus $50,000. so shh, he doesn't know about any of this. hey chandler, you really
wanna win this challenge. - every day.
- all right. - not even kidding. - just letting you know. all right, so chris has
the controller of marcus. chandler and ty all have controllers. they are now playing smash bros. whoever wins this game gets three grand. chris is a god at it, so i'd advise you three
team up in some sort of way or he's gonna get a guaranteed dub. you are red and the alligator. dude, your green and donkey kong, yellow and captain falcon. you're blue and link. - yeah.
- everyone likes link, that's why they like you. all right, marcus is down a life. he only has two left. - no, no, no, no, no! - marcus is out. three remain, three grand on the line. dang, chris is taking on both of you. oh my goodness. - i almost fell off. - he forgot he was on a treadmill. it is now one v one. - oh!
- hey! - i literally almost fell. and i was like, "i either
fall off the treadmill or fall off the map on smash." i was like, "i gotta fall off the map." - all right, chandler. - give me it!
- run! you're almost there. - i got it! - not yet, don't eat the hook! - no. - y'all are gonna feel that burger later. i hope you know that. - i'm feeling it right now. - anybody else wants some squirt squirt? - hey, be careful. i might wanna slow down. - i am speed, kachow! - chandler, you are struggling right now. - i am a tiger. - chris is currently at four miles. marcus is at 4.2. 4.1. four. that's it. so if one of you guys win you're only gonna win like four grand. let's see what happens
if i just drop legos? this is the ball of questions. whatever the thumb lands
on when they catch it, they have to read that question. - ever blame a fart on
someone else? hell yeah. - yeah, you do that to me all the time. marcus. - have you ever practiced
kissing in the mirror? duh. - hottest person in the room? me. - no, i agree with you, ty. - chris off the wall. you good? are you good? - i'm good. i didn't like that one. have you peed in a pool? last week. - chandler needs this right now. - da, de, de, da! all right, baby, let's go to 10. - chandler's going to 10 with a cape. - look at that technique. - superman.
- what? - who are you doing this for? - you know, i'm just here, man. oh, to save the world, yeah. forgot who i was for a second. - all right, ty, your turn. - i'm juiced up, bro. - five.
- five. - fiver, fiver. - dude, it got like 10
degrees hotter in here. - left, left, left, right, left. double time, left, left- - is that even in the public domain left? - yes. - how you doing? - hey chris, you wanna walk us through what you're doing right now? - i'm peeing. and i'm walking. get a couple shakes out. - you got it, man. - hot potato with the baby. chandler, go! caught it. - yep. hot potato. - it's my child. - that baby is not a
potato. it is a child. - chris, what do you need the money for? - i'm building a house. - chan chan, what would you
buy with the seven grand? - food and snacks? - you guys are bad at
seeing the big picture. it's a lot of money. - i'd buy a really big picture. - let's see. let's see.
- wow! ew!
- oh, that's sweat. that's pure.
- that is disgusting. so you're probably wondering
why is there a green screen? - why?
- why? - because you're running from a dinosaur. who we got behind you? it's a giant worm. - oh my god, the alaskan bullworm! - chandler, now there's
pickles behind you. there is wolves and pickles. now you're in the middle of the ocean. - oh my god, this burns! - do we get a-
- it burns! - all right, now it's just
a normal green screen. so how is your adventure everyone? - great. - gentlemen, you are now running
away from this little baby. oh my god.
- why? - here chris, we're setting you to four. i'm setting everyone to four. three's taking too long. - you can't jog. you can't run. you can't walk. you're just like in between it at four. - here you go, boys. cool off real quick. - well, only they got it. - i'm gonna help you guys run faster. - who you guys taking bets on? - the treadmills. - the treadmills. you think the treadmills- - the treadmills are gonna
win at the end of the day. - wait, wait, are you quitting? - wait. - chan, chan, whoa, whoa, whoa! no! no! - he quit. he quit. - all right, chandler, you did nine miles before quitting. when you see this video,
you're gonna feel bad. - oh! oh, okay. - when chandler drops out the challenges, you're in the endgame now. so chandler just lost, which means he doesn't get the $50,000. our next video's gonna
be a "last to leave vr." hopefully, he wins that. the prize is still on the table if he wins that one. and if he doesn't, he gets
one more try after that. and if he loses the next two videos, then no money for chandler. - what's going on?
- i dropped my burger. - you dropped your burger? - he dropped his hamburger! - technically, you've eaten
worse things off the ground. - chandler, when you see this video, i just want you to know, you have no idea what i'm referring to, but i just want you to
know it'll be okay, so. - what? what are you talking about? - i hope you win tomorrow's challenge. i hope you do. - wait, what? there's
a challenge tomorrow. all right. - cause the fans want you to win. - you know what, seeing
chandler, his defeat, gives me inspiration
to not suck like that. - ty, as the fan favorite, how you doing? - i am great. - yeah. how do you feel
now that chandler left? - not too bad. he left me in the last challenge so. - wow. - that went in your milkshake. - it's okay. - next person to quit, gets $1,000. are you considering? - don't rush him into it. - what about you? you don't want a grand? - hell, no. - all right, ty.
- what's up? - here's a hat. one side is water. one side gatorade. - crown me. - wow.
- all right, and then, here you go. it fits perfectly. - this side gatorade? - i think- - damn. - dude, that's probably the funniest thing i've ever seen. - can't get no suck. - are you getting sucked now? - oh, gross. - why are you running? - 'cause i got short legs. hey, you said 1,000 if i go. - 1,000 for the next person to get off. - man, stop. - mydreon, how do you feel about that? - no. - he can win over a 10 grand. he's about to cop out for one. - yeah, i don't like it. - you don't like it? - he wants to know if
you'll up at the two. - i'll do 1500 max. - 1500 max. - you getting off? - ah! - i cannot believe it. - you shoulda went for the money. you shoulda went for the money. - oh no. - nah, you good though, baby. you did that, baby. - one toke for the win. - to all the people watching, is there anything you want to say? - i thought i was gonna
win, but i'll take 1500. - hey. all right. did you have fun getting tortured? - yeah, it was fun.
- all right, i'll take that. we just upped the treadmills to six. and it probably won't last long. this whole video i've been doubting chris, but i'm gonna change my mind. chris, i believe in you. - thanks bud. - wait, you guys are
about to up it the 10. all right, up it to 10. wait, ty, are you on 10? - yes.
- no, you're not. - yes, i am. - take your hands off,
so it's an even game. - hands off, chris. - there we go. all right, they're both on 10. 12 or, oh! ty, you won! you won! oop! oop! - he did it. he did it. he won. - you won. you're the champion. all right, ty, you
officially did 13 miles, which means you won $13,000. - $13,000. - what are you gonna buy with the 13 smack-a-roonies? - a car. - oh really? - yeah, a big car. - can they see what car you're gonna buy? - sure.
- how do you feel? - dude, i feel like i'm about a yak. i'm so dizzy right now. - go to the bathroom. go
to the bathroom and yak. go to the bathroom. clear the way to bathroom! - ty.
- yeah. - heres $13,000. tyriq, i'm gonna let you in on a secret. we're doing another challenge tomorrow. if chandler wins tomorrow's challenge, he gets 50 grand 'cause he never wins. so he didn't win today, he didn't get it. if he loses tomorrow
and the challenge after, he's not getting it. he only has two more attempts. do not let him know. the very next video on
this channel will be "last to leave vr." we're gonna upload it in two days. make sure whenever you see that, you click it and you cheer on chandler because he's never won a challenge. and if he does, it's gonna be the
greatest day of his life. so i'll see you in that video. [music] mister beast 6000 [music] [music] oh [music] [music] mister beast 6000 [music] [music] yeah you know his name [music] [music]
