ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 13th and final day of the tata steel chess tournament we've got the challenger section with a dominant two-horse race and we got the master section where nodir back abdul satora from uzbekistan anish giri of the netherlands and magnus carlson surprise surprise rising up from the ashes are all chasing first place in this recap i will take you through the epic storyline of multiple players tournaments and we are going to crown a winner and the winner may surprise you by the way like my hoodie i haven't worn this one in a while little galaxy hoodie big news also i'm currently working on a gotham hoodie for all of you i've never done merch so let me know in the comments if you would get it i'm like customizing it's going to be really really nice really high quality stuff because i gotta treat the best fan base in the world that's you i gotta treat you well alright folks four games and tata steel 2023 is over first game i have for you all right we need the appetizer of the day we got alexander donchenko versus vladimir ivich and thenchenko has been a tour de force in the challenger section all right this one begins with actually an exchange sloth actually an opening that is completely symmetrical and what normally happens here if white wants to make a draw is play bishop d3 and then take take bishop d6 bishop d6 castle boop boop and you know rook c1 or whatever and then the players just make a draw but actually thenchenko plays this for a win so he tries to create a little bit of imbalance here and we get the following position very a very sharp line this is the line and thenchenko just grabs upon now black here plays queen c8 you have to trade queens you cannot stay greedy because then rook c1 loses actually so you always have to look for checks for the opponent so queen c8 rook c8 now you may ask yourself why would the guy with the black pieces go for a game where he is just cleanly down upon the answer to your question is i have no idea welcome to top level chess basically the meta here is that because of the opposite colored bishops probably this is just the draw even if one guy is ultimately up a pawn in the end because opposite color bishop end games are very frequently a draw well thenchenko is gonna try to win he plays h4 to make sure black cannot play g5 and yes black does create a very powerful blockade black completely controls the only file here's the thing what does white want to trade well white would love to trade the bishops but that's not really possible white would love to trade one pair of rooks not both because both would make an opposite colored bishop end game all right so bishop b8 rook a6 a4 and now bishop a7 rook b3 a5 so donchenko got exactly what he wanted he got a one on zero situation two one one zero that pawn's gonna walk all right and he's got the rook behind it too so both bishops drop back they are defended and now here's that exchange offer right one rook will significantly improve white's chances because black is actually despite going despite being able to take a pawn you're not gonna be able to stop this that pawn's gonna get to a7 you can run back that pawn's gonna go here and you'll just play rook b1 rook b8 and that's it game is over so bishop a6 and now here's the end game that we were looking for right this is exactly what donchenko wanted and the rest of the game is actually relatively straightforward there's the bishop trade we were talking about he gets to the bishop trade you get mine i get yours first i give you check so i try to deflect your king and now we have this and king f5 but this is a very winnable end game with white because your rook will hunt the pawns while this rook has to guard this now the only thing that might happen is your rook gets there and then you can't really you know move the pawn well here we go he's pushing right e5 rook a8 take take and the pawn gets to a7 now the king cannot be out in the open because he will be checked that's the meta here all right the meta is the fact that the white rook can't really move anywhere all right unless it's a check so the king comes here okay rook h8 might have been a little bit rushed but he plays this and he gets to this end game which is now a four on three probably this is a draw but it has not been very easy to stop danchenko in this tournament and evich blunders he blunders the fact that white actually doesn't need to take the pawn at all and just goes h6 so donchenko sneaks through his h pawn and that's it i mean it's impossible to stop it now you just can't we can't get to the pawn king g3 king f4 rookie seven and the white king just walks down and and he gets he gets the job done i mean rook c7 check black resigns because you'll stop the pawn you'll win this you'll push this dunshenko got 10 points out of 13. like bro he won seven more games than he lost like that is nuts that is absolutely ridiculous and when you win the challenger section in tata steel they that you go to the masters and speaking of the masters well here they are these are the masters so next time dunshenko with his fat 10 out of 13 points best tournament of his life probably unless he has another one we're gonna you know we're gonna we're gonna head up here so three games matter i mean some people had good events some people didn't have good events three games matter of is leading the tournament by half a point if he wins he wins the tournament okay he hasn't lost yet if he draws then it all depends on how geary and magnus do all right we will look at their games as well so not your back against jordan van forest right the dutchman places sicilian defense a taiman of sicilian defense bishop e3 queen f3 queen f3 is becoming like a bit of a new thing it looks dumb because it looks like the queen has no role but basically white wants to cancel and also white wants to play queen g3 and trade off and open up the rook and be like well i'm better now black has a lot of moves here black has played knight e5 and then when the queen slid over black plays h5 h4 after queen f3 black has played other things black sometimes goes b5 sometimes you know knight f6 yeah jordan plays h5 i don't understand this move i cannot explain this move to you this is some sort of i don't know really i have no idea and now queen g3 i'm assuming he would have just played knight e5 but maybe he would have gone d6 and played h4 like really h5 is a combative move and this is yeah i mean like this is clearly jordan is trying to win jordan's like going out on his sword he's like you know i've lost some games and i've made it into some gotham recaps but here we go h5 long castle b5 and now this queen trade take take but doesn't this just look like it's smart for white like now he has a target right bishop c5 played by jordan so now if you take the knight i take check and then i get this and this is just horrible for white two pawn islands that are doubled don't do this to your pawns now he plays g4 i think g4 was a slightly incorrect handling of the position the computer really wanted white to do this and then try to play for f4 all right now you can also play g4 once you have a little bit of backup but he plays g4 right away which attacks the pawn and jordan just gives it up this must have caught nausea back off guard like he doesn't care about his pawn if rook h5 take take knight f6 attacks this bishop e2 you're telling me black is like fine apparently yeah apparently like this is the point black is gonna sacrifice the pawn and just not worry about it and you have to know what you're doing like the guy goes g4 the other guy just gives the pawn away that move must have really gotten to know your back because he reacted the wrong way and jordan plays g6 and now things get real spicy knight f5 can be taken twice but you don't want to do that because since there are all these pawns on light squares you don't want to lose your dark squared bishop what do you have so many puns on line squares your dark squared bishop is very important but he trades it he trades it because now there is no way in the knights are kicked out there's no way into the dark squares now not your back still tries like he tries to lock it down jordan's like f6 f4 but now take take look at that juicy e5 square i guess who's going there the night hello that knight is looking mighty nice rook d4 rook d8 now jordan's like remember that h pawn you didn't take i'm back from the dead h4 hello you can go knight g4 but knight c6 rook h oh my goodness but now no direct plays e5 forcing jordan to lock the center and now look at this move you can't take me because if you do take my knight i have this this knight f6 hitting this and this and threatening the rook to infiltrate so everything is bad here so since you can't do that you got to close the position jordan's pieces are all on the back rank and yet look at this look at jordan's defense here bishop back to c8 rook back to h8 retreating to the home squares this is unbelievable defense the piece is literally returning to the squares from which they were born and suddenly norger back realizes wait i got nothing like the guy is just threatening to take my knight what not your back had to play here was the otherworldly a4 point is if you take the knight rook d6 and according to the computer black is not better despite being up a full night a full night he's not better because he's so pinned down on the back rank doesn't see that though because he's a human being he's not stockfish plays this and he plays the natural continuation but here's the problem all of that just for a drop of blood none of his pieces can move forward anymore and now jordan takes over take take rook back b3 takes the h file infiltrates with the rook just like you saw last game one rook trade just one you want to win an end game you need to trade one pair of rooks that's the magic number don't trade both then you don't have a rook anymore to attack with and if there's two rooks on the board the opponent can create counter play that's just the meta don't shoot the messenger all right jordan creates a massive barrier and now these pawns are weak so his knight rotates around oh oh nojebek tries to break out one pawn down rook in this pawn takes two pawns down rook seat oh my goodness i can't believe this is happening jordan vanfore has just defeated in the final game the at the buzzer the extra time goal this is not your back's first and only loss in the entire event he has been in first place since this event began and now he has to await what happens in the games of magnus carlson and anish giri so let's go to magnus carlson's game he's got the black pieces against arjun aragaisi and magnus showed up to play and what i mean by that is he's got the black pieces against yes eric guys he's struggling he's not having the best tournament magnus played a double theon keto the computer has an aneurysm watching this okay magnus dances in the center with no pawns he has no pawns in the center of the board and eric icy plays the right way like he plays the way you're supposed to but now here come the pawns magnus creates this dark squared pawn formation center is locked what opening does this position closely resemble the king's indian defense what happens in the king's indian defense white goes here tries to eviscerate the queen side black tries to eviscerate white here we go f5 f4 magnus is playing like 2010 chess before the computers was were saying all this stuff about the the king's indian being dead b4 g4 h5 blowing it open h3 hanging on now just so you understand if black does something like this the game is over for black black just cannot lock that side of the board so rook f7 bishop f8 rook h7 as the white king is evacuating that side of the board his incredible stuff look at this knight f6 the king is walking to his home square all right now here's the problem magnus is actually knocking on the door on two sides imagine a house a big house a house that magnus is trying to break into he doesn't actually do that for legal reasons that's a joke you got a front door back door magnus knocking on both of them he got dudes on both sides what are you gonna do right queen c8 just a menacing little move rook b2 well maneuvering not really sure who's gonna break through where now white would love to have this bishop here so he could play c5 but how's he gonna get the bishop there bishop d like this but the king's there so queen d3 knight f7 bishop e7 all right kings made it but now magnus takes like all right king is close and he breaks open the b four and g4 squares and now here come the rooks and look at the computer the computer doesn't like it it was like oh he rushed that rook a1 in rook h2 oh my goodness the infiltrate is with nuts this looks like a video game what is going how are two rooks just flying down the board every guy see blocks both rooks with both of his rooks now the rooks fall off the board but magnus had another idea to win this game for no reason at all he doesn't need to do this knight takes g oh boy he is giving up his night this is a very common idea sacrificing a piece like a knight or a bishop in order to create two connected past pawns those pawns are a huge liability when they are separated but together they are monsters look at those pawns now the computer finds different ways and claims different things but this is a very difficult position to defend and as a human probably what you need to do around here is sacrifice at some point not right now you lose your queen so you go here bishop g2 and now both players have made 50 moves now the computer does in fact give a big edge to white if he played queen c2 trying to target this by sacrifice but that's not easy i mean bishop h1 like the bishop's just hiding here all right knight c3 plus you let the engine think long enough it it'll stop actually thinking anybody's better bishop f5 oh my goodness look at this oh my goodness eric icy has a chance now to sacrifice boop boop boop so now he's given back the piece and the pawn can't come forward the problem is this pawn is so good but look at this queen look at this queen bishop f6 knight to f7 magnus carlson in this position demonstrated the absolutely ridiculous power of a queen by moving it to one corner of the board threatening infiltration on two different diagonals and just a few moves later when the queen had served its purpose the queen moved to the opposite side because it infiltrates here too yes you can offer me a queen trade but when you do that you walk to that side and then this comes and folks i got news for you this g-pawn's going there were too many problems too far apart in this game magnus plays queen a8 and then knight d6 guards his king and one final dagger queen h8 again i mean you can you this dude really just played queen h8 then threatened queen a8 and a few moves later when everything was said and done he went back i mean come on this is this is unbelievable stuff it's like a pendulum it's like and just back to h8 and that's it and the queen finally made it in what a game what a game from magnus queen infiltrates and eric icy resigned he resigned because he's getting mated in a brutal fashion here with the queen and the two bishops and the two pawns but the pawns never walk forward the pawns were merely a distraction they were an illusion but if you took your eye off of them they would become a problem so every guys you couldn't guard everything a brilliant final round game for magnus and now it all comes down to whether or not anish giri can win his game against report if a niche wins he wins the tournament all right if he draws then they gotta play a tiebreaker i bet you didn't think that we were gonna maybe get a surprising tiebreaker at the end all right e4 you already know reports not gonna try to kill the game reports got three wins in his last four games by the way do not sleep on the man of the hour so we get a classical sicilian this is called a richter rouser variation and now the main line is e6 and then you put your bishops like this and then you attack he plays this that's a weird move you know why it's a weird move because after takes takes you give black a backwards isolate upon a backwards pawn is a pawn that is isolated but also the square in front of it is like completely covered and it cannot move forward at all an isolated pawn generally is more confidently in the center of the board this technically a backward pawn would have like a neighbor that like it supports but can't move forward this is a very bad pawn but what black is going to do throughout this game is he's going to just use his bishops he uses his bishops anish does this he cannot take because of this by the way if you ask me why anish played bishop b5 and then bishop c4 i can't answer that i really don't know he could have just played bishop c4 right away i guess he thought that this was a bad move because maybe well frankly i don't know i don't know he played bishop b5 and then bishop maybe he just thought that he i don't know i don't know take take queen d3 knight d5 so this is what white wants white wants to blockade the pawn build behind it shut down this bishop with c3 and go to work all right rookie 8 c3 and anish has essentially a perfect position now here they threaten us with a repetition that doesn't happen and we have f5 so he's trying to utilize his bad structure activate his bishop bishop b3 we have take take bishop f5 pins the rook to the queen take take and this is around where i saw the game and i was like okay so white just has like a perfect position however and remember upon advantage makes no difference if it's opposite colored bishops all right like if it's opposite color bishops very high drawing chances however there's a reason why black is not rushing with this move it's because i would take and you have too many weaknesses like yes it's opposite colored bishops but at some point you're gonna lose more than one pawn probably it's just a very unpleasant position so queen d7 h3 b5 rook c5 looking for counter play and now this now this is not opposite colored bishops this is knight versus bishop with a horrible pawn very different situation so bishop b5 queen e4 king g7 and now anish goes i gotta play this for a win if i win this game it's gonna be my first win ever in tata steel it's also probably going to be the biggest chess tournament i've ever won like anish has been second in third place at tata steel and other tournaments he has one or two very major wins like he's won like this big tournament in china i forgot the name i think it's shenzhen something like this masters he's never won taught a steal it's in the netherlands it's in the country he calls home so he goes for the win and each geary goes for the win now when you go for the win you sometimes go for the loss all right you're making things spicy and in each g4 now make no mistake i would play like this i play f4 g4 no problem is if anisha's playing moves that i would like to play that could be very bad or that could be very good for me so he begins an attack report says come get some i got my bishops i got my knight let's go on my pillory on you know i'ma cover the head pierreon's got a beautiful fighting style by the way that dude is so good now in each plays bishop d5 he's going to build behind the bishop now you do not want to take this okay if you're playing with black maintain the tension but that's hard to do it's hard to maintain tension as the other guy is building the position up remember i've already talked about this knight for bishop is not what black wants but he takes all right then he plays rook c4 and queen e6 and anish continues to fire forward his pawns gf5 knight f4 in between move the knight dances to the edge of the board now hitting both the king and the bishop now report here needed to take a moment collect himself and choose a retreating square all right he could go back yes white can play rook f1 and try to load up some cannons it does look mighty unpleasant the attack will continue despite what the engine tells you however report with opportunities to go back or sideways report goes forward and he blunders something absolutely incredible he blunders the move well no no i should preface my sentence because we are at the end of a recap we are at the moment where a champion will be crowned the move king g6 allows anish giri to sacrifice rook takes d6 now it's not quite a sacrifice because if you take it queen of five is over it is absolutely done queen takes f5 on the board and it's mate so if you can't take the rook but the rook and the knight are threatening to get here the only thing black can do is run if you take this with anything like knight f6 for instance i take your rook rook f6 i go here and i start i start making it a bit of a weird game alright so anish says all right you want to run where you going where are you going you move the queen you can check me i'm safe rook f5 king is hunted and anish ends the game and the tournament with queen to g3 that's not me point is that if this this rook h5 is coming and this b4 and you gotta take and get forked and get forks he did queen g3 game over tournament over like paul pierce anish giri called game on richard report and he wins tata steel by half a point the final standings of the champions group the masters group is as follows this is probably anish giri's biggest career win it really is combined with the win over magnus tying for second place was magnus by the way as he tied noser back with his game but it was anish giri it's crazy magnus lost to the two guys right there up top with him that's the only way you can prevent magnus from actually getting back he tied for second place now other storylines in this event wesley so had 11 draws and two wins he was rock solid big performance for parham folks the guy who you see in number six he was a late replacement he was set to play this tournament like two weeks before it happened that's nuts that's like winning a high-level ufc fight on two weeks notice all right we got a lot of guys in the middle and the other big story line is dingley ren dingley ran at 12th place with five and a half out of 13. now historically every player who plays for a world championship has a horrible tata steal fabiano has had a horrible ton of steel jan didn't play in the last one sergey karyakan all right has had a horrible ton of steel before a world championship event so maybe he'll shake it off maybe this is where he gets the cobwebs off and it's a shame to see our guys see there in the bottom but it's life all right someone's got to finish last and you know eric is he had a really rough stretch at some point in the event he lost like four out of his last six games or seven so looking to see him bounce back looking to see some of the young guys do better next time like go cash for example what a final day what a tournament i hope you have enjoyed these recaps and i will just comment right now just very briefly on something i like to be open and honest when these events are going on it's very difficult to name my videos tata steel recap their team probably afterward i will go back and rename them something different but here's the thing and here's unfortunately the honest truth if you name your recaps with a magnus thumbnail and a magnus picture they're gonna get recommended more people are fascinated by magnus people who don't know anything about chess still know about magnus they don't know some of the other players and if one of the other players has an astounding game and i put him on the thumbnail he might not actually get seen sometimes there's more bring in 2 to another player's career by using magnus i mean some of you know this you follow football basketball you throw lebron on everything people gonna watch is why people cover the lakers and things like that right more than more than other sports anyway i sometimes like to have these little thoughts at the end of the tournament if you're still here i do appreciate it do let me know in the comments viewer retention plummets in the last minute of a video because everyone's like done they go somewhere else anyway that's all tata steel is over regular content resumes tomorrow merch is coming soon other big announcements coming soon tata steel 2023 signing off get out of here
