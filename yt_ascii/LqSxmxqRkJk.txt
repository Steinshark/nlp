ladies and gentlemen i just came across one of the greatest chess games i have ever seen i have no idea how i have not seen this game up until today and in this video i would like to share this game with you it's grandmaster wesley so with the white pieces grandmaster hikaru nakamura with the black pieces you may know one or both or none of these individuals and we are in 2015 in a tournament in st louis called the singfield cup it's actually 2023 and i'm currently in new york city and it's the first day that the sun is out in about two weeks because that's typical new york weather but this game was played in 2015 and it is absolutely sensational folks have any of you ever had a brilliant move in a chess game played a game and that little blue thing illuminated and it just like made your whole day made your whole week well in this game hikaru played six six brilliant moves in one game normally in my videos i cover things from white's perspective because that's just the way chess always works like you just look at it like this but in this video i'm showing you the game from hikaru's perspective just just enjoy just don't ask any questions ignore the sidebar i know you probably got some minecraft there probably got some tommy in it george not found some sports stuff i don't know what you watch on youtube god i really don't want to know what you watch on youtube but just ignore that all right just watch this video from start to finish yes because i get the watch time and the retention rate and i understand all of that but also because oh my god oh my let's go d4 all right and keep in mind that we are in 2015. in 2015 hikaru was the second highest rated chess player in the world hikaru is number one number two in speed chess with magnus carlson no question but in 2015 he was also number one number two with him in slow chess this was p hikaru and he was playing the king's indian defense which in 2023 the grand masters will not touch with a 10-foot pole because this opening has been proven in the very strong computer era to be very difficult to handle the positional setbacks that black endures such as a catastrophic lack of space breathing for oxygen as white tries to take away all your game plans over here it's just too difficult all right it's just very very hard to deal with so nowadays in 2023 and beyond nobody's playing like this but back in the day everybody you know everybody was giving this opening a shot and there was no practitioner of the king's indian defense quite like hikaru this man knew this opening better than it knew itself that doesn't even make sense but it sounded epic alright bishop e2 this is the main line and black's idea is to go e5 now nerds with the white pieces and wimps with the white pieces take this pawn and then trade the queen and try to oop no no that would be nice and then they try to trade and then they make a draw all right this is one way that white can sort of kill all the fun but it's not the way to play for an advantage and so people normally castle and black tries to induce the move d5 all right you know that scene when i'm gonna spoil harry potter for you you have five seconds to pause in case you haven't seen it for some reason if you live under a rock five four three two all right so you know how like in in the final right before the final battle in the movie between harry and voldemort when they jump off the balcony together you know let's let's finish this the way we started it tom together well this knight c6 d5 is essentially that let's close the cage you let's go alright make sure that when you throw the the jab that you got the shoulder here to block the counter that's what i learned in boxing class 97 when this locks here's the plan black is going to move mountains to attack white here white is going to deal with that and attack black here all right kind of at the source of the whole thing all right so the knights get out of the way all right it's like you know those fight videos we like to enjoy on the internet well it this is like when the people clear out and here they go just let them fight let him fight or you know you see somebody nowadays fight video fight videos on the internet all over the place but and and bishop e3 and f4 and there it is all right hikaru is launching his pawns forward and wesley with the white pieces is saying your attack is stupid all right and it's unsophisticated and my attack is sophisticated because you're trying to you know barbarically go for my king and i'm trying to take a little bit of space on the queen side and induce a weakness and then maybe get my knight in here and then maybe trade off your bishop because your bishop is an anchor to your attack and black is just like must checkmate white or i will lose so hikaru plays g5 right and i mean in a nutshell this is what the king's indian is sicaro has probably had this position in some sort of practice or training no less than i don't know a couple hundred of times if not thousands all right knight goes to d3 and every one of these moves is like a book move this is all been played before b4 is going to happen c5 is going to happen now in this position black can play a couple of things black can acknowledge white's in incoming arrival hikaru plays knight g6 which this computer game review gives an inaccuracy but this computer game review can you know frankly shut up okay that's what it can do that's what it can just shut up that could it it it you don't know you don't know what hikaru is trying to do bro so enough hikaru probably prepared this with a much deeper engine than this guy whatever whatever stockfish this is so here comes wesley i told you this is the plan right i told you this is the plan hikaru plays knight f6 leslie brings his rook hikaru plays rook f7 why is hikaru playing rook f7 two reasons one you would like to defend c7 seriously if white does this and then this and then plays knight b5 c7 is already protected because then you can play a6 if you don't play rook f7 then after the move h5 white can play take take knight b5 and then by the time you play rook f7 it's too late and i have arrived and the thing about this entire attack for black is it literally hinges on this bishop if black has to get trades down here this attack loses its power so this absurd move rook f7 is actually an increa extremely sophisticated approach by black and then that rook will join the party so wesley plays king h1 so comma wesley oh stiff neck and now kikaru plays h5 and now we have takes takes and there it is all right so wesley his name is literally wesley so so wesley i'm not doing it on purpose this is the way i speak all right i'm sorry guys you ever have a day you finished nearly three coffees and you still feel tired no is that just me do i have a problem i don't know i'll talk about that with my therapist hikaru plays a6 and in this position wesley plays knight a3 and for the first time in this game black is better now here's the thing okay sometimes in chess positions a person has an advantage but it's difficult to prove because you have to play in a very sophisticated way not in the king's indian in the king's indian defense if black is better the game is over the game is just over why because look at this i once said a long time ago in a video you can't stop an avalanche with a horse i have no idea what that what that means and frankly that could be used as testimony in a in an insane asylum's kind of situation but you can't stop an avalanche with a horse in this case there are no horses you can't stop an avalanche with whatever like if this gets here it's it's game over like the king will be brought out by his hair okay so b5 now this knight cannot get back into the game this is weakened so maybe night before knight c6 is possible but hikaru is just gonna keep attacking over here he didn't care about no knight c6 and what he's gonna he's not gonna hang his queen and then what this brick wall of pawns is really really tough for white to break through so in this position wesley plays rook c6 okay and obviously the idea of rook c6 is he's trying to apply some pressure maybe apply pressure like this and just so you're aware a move like bishop b7 is actually not a huge problem because white doesn't mind giving away the rook white actually would be fine giving away the rook for that bishop because that bishop is so important to black's attack so hikaru here plays g4 which is naturally a very clear follow-up to his entire attack now if you're bored okay and you haven't seen the six brilliant moves yet these are some of the best chess players in the world you're not gonna have six brilliances in the first 20 moves okay because even even one of them hung a queen you can't get six brilliances like chess.com's game review does not give you six brilliant moves for beating up somebody when they're dead lost all right that's like me finding it impressive you walk to your local playground and beat up a three-year-old okay now again if you're four or under and you're watching this for some reason if you're four years old and under and you beat up a three-year-old that's actually impressive for legal reasons i'm not condoning you to do that but i'm just like that's more impressive than you doing it right now if you're 15 or 30 or 45 or are people do people exist beyond the age of 45 i don't even know in any case so g4 okay queen c2 and now he calls queen f8 don't get six brilliant moves beating somebody when they're completely lost you get six brilliant moves beating somebody on equal terms that's when it's impressive in the words of chael sonnen mixed martial arts fighter goat not goat but you know people's goat turned commentator and analyst if you beat somebody that you know you're gonna beat that's bullying there has to be a mysterious element as to whether or not you're going to win the game then it's actually competitive rook c1 bishop d7 rook c7 and as you can see wesley is just sort of potentially holding on to the to the hope that this this this sacrifice will come in handy but as you can see from hikaru's position the attack has arrived the attack has arrived and if wesley plays the move h3 hikaru will be taking because if he goes here that only looks aesthetic but actually the attack is very much slowed down and you know he'll have to sacrifice to get in whereas this is yeah that's open g3 is up for grabs knight h5 knight g3 is on the way rook is going to come down it's it's a very very bad situation so fg4 by wesley and essentially from this point forward a series of brilliances begins okay my siri thought i said something about siri okay first of all f takes g4 hikaru does not take back instead he plays the move f3 that does not yet count as a brilliancy the idea is obviously to take the rook right that's why he did that that's why he sacrificed this pawn okay hikaru is now down two pawns so seeing as though he's down two pawns he now captures the what well my friends it's time you are about to witness one of the most spectacular sequences of moves that you have probably seen in a chess game that does not involve your 200 elo friend kikaru here sacrifices first the knight brilliant move number one the idea of this sacrifice is that after f takes e4 rook f1 check cannot be taken because it's checkmate and if king g2 the king is brutally hunted out with a sequence of moves so knight takes c4 but no problem wesley's just not going to take the knight well that's too bad wesley's not gonna take the knight because in this position after sacrificing his knight hikaru is going to sacrifice you guessed it the rook rook takes f3 two brilliant moves and there's four more to go this dude just played back to back more brilliant moves than you'll probably see in your entire life and this man's got four more to go he ain't done rook f3 can't be taken because queen f3 can't block take the rook king g1 bishop b3 here it's made very soon rook f3 two now wesley takes the bishop the most incredible thing about the move root takes f3 is that not only are you sacrificing a knight and a rook you're also sacrificing a bishop there is just a purely hanging bishop here and wesley takes it and is now up three points of material but that's great because if you didn't take my rook when it was on f3 certainly you might take it when it's on f1 three brilliant moves cannot be taken king to g2 and in this position with now the bishop staring straight down at the rook and the king hikaru place bishop to e3 four brilliant moves the idea of bishop e3 is setting up rook g1 check and the bishop cannot actually take the rook because if it does pawn sneaks in only option is to go here queen f3 check and knight g5 done call the coroner four brilliant moves bishop g3 everything is staring at everything else wesley is trying to sacrifice material now obviously hikaru cannot take on g3 because then the rook would take and then the attack would be kind of stopped so instead of h takes g3 hikaru played hg3 five brilliant moves five and one more to go what is the idea well this is the idea folks this is the idea because after rook takes f1 now that the pawn moves off of the h4 square knight h4 check king comes out and now it's time for the walk of shame queen h6 this meant hikaru is down five points of material i would argue he's down 10. this rook hasn't even moved this rook hasn't even moved yet the only way for wesley to avoid getting checkmated here in a variety of brutal fashions is to play g5 knight takes g5 and now king to g4 and folks you might ask yourself where are the six brilliant moves you've only showed me five if you thought hikaru was in the business of sacrificing only bishops and rooks no night f three with the idea that if you take the knight swift execution what a checkmate on h3 and if you take the knight with the rook the same thing and the other thing is i now completely block all of your pieces i am just threatening this you have a few ways of of getting out of this situation you can play knight to f2 and now hikaru ends the game with utmost precision by playing queen to h4 check king to f5 and the rook gets a turn rook f a check king to g6 he sacrifices the rook again king takes f6 double check with the knight and the queen king g6 queen g5 check mate aren't you glad you watched the entire game this man hikaru played h4 and then proceeded to play f3 94 look f3 rook f1 bishop e3 ag walk the king out to the edge of the board sacrifice the night and what a journey for the white king brutalized in the most egregious of fashions what a win six brilliant moves in one game more brilliant moves in one game than some of us will get in a year not a lifetime hopefully not a lifetime aren't you glad you watched this full video i'm sure glad you watched this full video that that was sick that was ridiculous i i got nothing i'm i'm just happy i could share this with that's it there's no i got no outro this video is not sponsored by anything just enjoy your day play play more chess maybe one day you'll do something like this from the white side get out of here
