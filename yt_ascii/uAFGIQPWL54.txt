really pigs and chickens mating i hate this game it's too sexual for my son what's up guys welcome to worst reviews on amazon all these are from people who purchase minecraft through amazon and just to clarify these are people who actually bought the game some random person didn't just go up there and leave it these are people who actually bought the game okay it's sad product arrived severely damaged whole punctured through it i does not work very misleading no hard drive where in this picture does it show a hard drive like are you oh my head hurts i can't kill the zombie the game reminds me if poop and buggies it in the lloyds a lot of killing i don't like how it's okay to hurt animals who would hammer or poor lamb my daughter thought the game was only about building never open the package o's for the wrong xbox that my grandson already had it for his xbox well then why did you rate it one star it's not their fault you're  i can't say the word it's not their fault you're mentally unstable i don't care about the game but i have a mom a dad and two sisters i cry when someone dies my cat died wah wah i have no life i have no friends don't get married there are some special people in this world i always get blown up by creepers it isn't fair this game is horrible my friends played 24/7 i played it no sense was made just like with your review no sense was made there's creeper alderman the robbers and cops and spider-man slenderman sponge android phone number of people i gotta be honest that's one of the best reviews i've ever read in my entire life they say heroines in this game i didn't install it because hara brawn can find us and kill us was missing all the attachments to fix the doll to the machine there there was no doll or ahh this game was very good if the game was good why did you rate it one stuff mom i need my bleach alright guys so that was the video sorry for how short it was these were actually extremely hard to find believe it or not i spent hours going through minecraft reviews and it was pretty torture some torture somes not a word about to enter sellout mode i just want to be clear the video is over you can click off if you want to i'm about to talk about how you can support me if you're interested if you're not interested click off now the video is over just want to make sure you know that the video is over feel fleet freak fleet feel flee to click off whenever yes english so basically there's this app called tad where you can watch ads and those ads give you points and then you can give those points to your favorite youtuber who can convert it into money basically it's a way for you to support your favorite content creators without actually having to give up any money which is why i like it so the app is called tad i'll link it down below if you want to download it and like i said the reason i like this better than patreon or paypal is you don't have to like give up a dime the app is free the way you get points is by watching these ads and everyone ad you watch you get some points and you can't actually cash in on those but if you give them to your favorite content creator they can convert the points into money so it's a pretty cool way to support people whose videos you like watching i want to give it a try i'm kind of curious how it works so i'll link it down below or you could search tea ad on the app store or google play store download it watch some ads and the points to mr. beast if you want to if you don't it's fine i'm just curious to see how it works every thousand points is a dollar so if you could like save up a couple thousand and send it to me i would greatly appreciate it but you definitely do not have to i don't need the money i'm just being a setup you know i am a sellout what am i saying so that interest you there you go i probably won't bring it up that much i probably won't ever bring it up again the video i might so yeah just want to mention it if you like my videos i don't know bleach out oh
