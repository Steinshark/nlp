ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the freestyle chess championship it is the second day of the quarterfinals and today the people who lost yesterday must win to force a tie break or they get knocked out our matchups no abdor leads one to nothing over dingl ren ali resa fua leads one to nothing over magnus carlson fabiano carana leads one to nothing over gesh d of india and in the other matchup vincent kimer versus leavon aronian that was tied with a draw yesterday so if they have a winner today in the classical portion it will go to a play that match is over if they make a draw then of course they have to play a tie break now it's classical chess and another very unique thing they don't play the same position twice which is actually i probably should have realized that but yesterday they played a game and they don't don't they don't play the same colors again today they show up and draw completely new colors h rather a completely new position so magnus now needs to beat ali resa fua in a classical chess 960 game fish a random game with a brand new position and that is the only way that he is going to force a rapid playoff he opens with e4 excuse me alli rest plays e5 king is in the center rooks are here if you're new to this event they're playing fisher random back row of pieces is shuffled a lot of you like to make the joke that the front row of pieces is shuffled as well that is absolutely hilarious you all have careers as stand-up comedians or chess youtubers g3 c6 c3 g6 clearly both guys like what they're doing here they are trying to nerf the corner bishop and they are trying to activate potentially the bishop over here now both guys bring their knights aliv reza just ming around copying magnus all pieces on the e file congesting the board which is quite humorous and now magnus plays rook f1 the idea of rook f1 is very straightforward he now cannot castle this way but he's trying to play this move f4 opening the center while negating the development of the bishop in the corner rook f8 and ali resa is just copying him the whole way through it's really funny actually he copies the whole position copies here then that's alternate but then he copies copies copies copies copies just copying him the whole way through and believe it or not it's the best way to play the position believe it or not the engine is actually saying that this is the best way to play all of this now magnus takes on e5 and ali reza continues to mirror him he's just trying to trade the center pawns and trade the rooks and they're both going to castle this way okay they're both going to castle using that rook cuz that's the way you castle in chess 960 you castle one way with the rook on the one side and you castle the other way with the rook on the other side side now take take take take the position still looks extremely similar which i find hilarious now magnus right here made his move and actually went to the confession booth and apologized he apologized for breaking the aesthetic nature of the position which is all the rooks on the e on the same file not all the rooks all the pieces on the same file which i thought was very funny now so this very peculiar opening of the position happens and magnus knows he can't trade the queen if he trades the queens even if he has a little bit more space the position is very drawsh black gets a completely symmetrical position and likely the game just ends in a draw i doubt there's anything here so instead he plays queen b4 and he asks s resa who's going to protect the pawn on b7 all right number one you can move the pawn forward number two you can move the pawn forward two squares number three apparently you can sack the pawn you can sack the pawn to get b file counterplay and take on b2 and if you try to if they try to fork you you actually just take with the bishop in the corner so aliv res has a lot of options he can also castle but that's too dangerous castling is too dangerous you get hit with this you go back and now white can start attacking well actually i guess the knight is hanging so you can't do that but let's say you go back this way i can't take your knight but i will go here and then i will just continue to it i why do i keep hanging pieces what is wrong with me playing like you guys and you this is how you attack all right it's just such a weird setup of pieces that things are just not defended under certain angles anyway alira goes here so he plays a little bit of a more safe move giving magnus more space and now he realizes he's in trouble and he spends a long time plays queen a5 but if he goes queen c7 magnus will just keep going forward and clearly al res doesn't like this he doesn't like what's about to happen he doesn't like the opening of the positions a lot of tactics here with pawn takes and rook here and knight takes and the bishop opening it's a very dire position already and clearly you know ali res is spending 10 minutes on this decision he should have been a little bit more active now he trades the queens and it doesn't matter how the game started if magnus gets to the phase of the game where he is more confident which is the end game and it doesn't matter how imbalanced the position is plays d5 d5 is a pawn sacrifice by by the way just a clean sacrifice but here's the thing if black takes now you castle and i'm i'm getting that pawn back and you have doubled isolated pawns on two sets and it's really bad this is this is magnus's bread and butter he takes on d5 brings the bishop right al res develops and here comes magnus just safeguarding his position here he comes forward this is this is magnus playing a bet an end game where he's got a slight advantage he has a two and he has a three ali res has got doubled isolated a pawns an isolated d pawn and a slightly more passive king now the engine does find ways to stabilize and hold but magnus keeps poking al is trying to defend himself yeah magnus's knight dances around and he's just attacking stuff and he gets in and it's it's bad it's really unpleasant magnus takes the bishop on the way out the door so now he has the bishop pair as well now a well ed b4 doesn't even matter that he's helping alira get rid of his weakness because his position just improves itself he's going to go king b2 he's going to go after this pawn alira has too many weaknesses and on top of that ala's got no time look at this move by the way knight c7 giving up the knight to get a knight back the weaknesses are still nice and solid rook d7 is on the way and magnus smooth sailing up a pawn in a bishop end game with some rooks doubled past pawns this is looking like a typical magnus game but it's not looking like they played fisher random king g5 rook a8 and and he's just going to push it doesn't matter how far ali resa's pawn can get rook a8 and here al resa resigns because even though he can get the pawn here it's stopped and the rook is trapped by the way there is rook b8 can't take but then i just go here and that's the end of the game king c3 king d2 nothing black can do the pawn's going to go straight to b7 and it's a fortress for white there's there's no moves for black black can't move anything magnus wins on demand magnus wins exactly as he is supposed to in regular chess he gets the game to an end game extinguishes the bright fire of alza wins on demand the goat is back and they will play a playoff before they play a playoff i will take you around the world starting with the potential comeback of dingly rand by the way why is that cut off is that just on my screen you see that the g is cut off in ding's name that that's not just me right i mean i'm smudging my screen it doesn't look like just me why is that happening what ch.com hello you cutting off of the g over here you guys got to fix that anyway ding has to win with white so we're going to compare openings we have e4 e5 just like in that game right we had e4 e5 this type of opening with the pawns so what is what is ding going to play wow same opening but queen c2 okay queen c2 is not what happened in that game in that game they put their knights and then they they copied each other in this game imbalances is actually created first by nock ding castles queens side right away and then starts firing pawns forward but look at nock in chess 960 you can make the mistake of committing your king too quickly and now you're under attack b3 d5 and noji also castles queen side but by move 11 he's already much better and this is really sort of the odd storyline of this tournament this is ding's ninth game he has one point no he has half ding has made one draw and lost seven games in this event he's half out of eight and now he's worse after 10 moves with white and it's just mindblowing i mean it it's it's crazy so no gives away a pawn he gives away a pawn on f5 with a check but it would be bad to take it because he would go here force the queen back go here and win cuz look at i mean good look at these pieces they are all stranded on the back rank so bishop f5 pawn takes and instead c takes d4 which is clearly what ding is going for and he wants to open the position but this is a very look at this this is this tremendous pressure building on the white position ding plays d3 which makes sense he's trying to stop d3 he's trying to play knight d2 knight c4 nck develops his knight he's a pawn down but he has he's a mass no he's not a pawn down he was almost a pawn down he was trying to sacrifice a pawn so he's not even a pawn down he has all the benefits of his position knight d2 reroutes the knight and he's just heading for these squares he's just heading for these squares the knight is going to go there or there and then it's going to land somewhere here look i mean this is just misery for white i mean he just can't get out knight c4 queen a6 and in this position no plays a very forcing move he calculates he plays c5 spend six minutes plays c5 the idea is very easy white has to take if white doesn't take if white plays king b1 black will play b6 white has no moves white cannot get out of this position so what's going to happen is black will go here black will go here and win and i mean if let's just say you don't hang the queen black will just put the knight here and you just can't move anything so he plays c5 the reason he plays c5 is because noc only needs a draw and he calculates out a sequence here where all the pieces fly off the board queen c5 he captures he takes on a2 yes he lost all his pawns but now he gets this one back white's king is too exposed there's just nothing you can do take take and if if like you know ding can't play for a win ding's king is not in a position to be playing for a win he's got no he has no roof dude's living in a house got no roof on it all right some people in the world are too but this king is just a bozo all right he just didn't fix the roof yeah so instead of that ding plays queen c4 and we just go to an end game and two rooks two rooks knight and bishop yeah no calculated this out and it's just an end game but you're not going to win we just trade the pieces and now we trade the rooks that's it that's the end and we play a little bit longer ding you know ding obviously doesn't just give up they play the moves out and this is just a draw it's a draw but that means that ding is eliminated and noj abdus stov is the first semi-finalist noc has not lost the game he was five and a half out of seven he was six and a half out of eight he is now seven out of nine and undefeated and he's clearly playing the best chess he's the first semi-finalist next yesterday fabiano defeated gukesh all right we're going to look at just like we've been comparing the openings of every game we had queen c2 in this one in this game we had knight e3 what's going to happen in this game between gukesh and fabiano gukesh has to beat fabiano yesterday fabiano beat gkes f4 wow and now the guys move a bunch of pawns so we have a totally different opening which is why this is so interesting right we got two games that went you know like this and then we got two games that went like that and then we got this whatever the heck this is so gukesh plays bishop d4 very interesting move he's trying to trade the dark squared bishop and play on the weaknesses of the opponent play on the dark squared weaknesses of the opponent fabby opens the center and there's a trade right he gets active now the knights come in we got to bring the knights in we got to bring the knights in and now we got a castle so now both guys cast castle this way that's the result of the opening 13 moves played an obscure structure gukesh went for a bishop trade he's got the strong bishop in the corner fi has a b has a pawn structure that does not exactly complement the light squared bishop but he's rock solid and remember fabiano's approach just like norre is i have to not lose i have to not lose i mean i just have to not lose the game that's it it's the only requirement so gash plays knight f4 fabby brings his rook good luck beating fabiano here again both sides have a lot of pawns maybe with white you try to open things up but black is very very solid and forward mobility is very difficult but gkes has to win he has to win it's like being down four rounds in a five round fight you lost the first four rounds so in this round you either don't do anything and lose or you got to try to knock the other person out not in not ges didn't actually try to physically assault fabiano i would imagine but you know you got to you got to do your best rook b1 and now fab's like i'm not even going to sit and wait i'm just play c5 i'm just going to play the best moves i'm not going to sit and wait i'm going to play the best moves i'm going to force you backwards and just make very slow and steady improvements to my position and the advantage is just growing i mean fabiano has everything covered everything protected gkes has a small opportunity to infiltrate he's like poking and prodding and he plays d4 but as the position grows gha's time disadvantage is now up to 25 minutes and he's just much worse and this game ends on the 22nd move gkes plays here and offers a draw and fabiano accepts gues plays here offers a draw remember this is not rated so this knocks ges out babano is in the semi-finals as well that was crazy ges got nowhere and that might have been from the opening he might have just chosen a bad type of structure he might have just not played the the opening in the optimal way but fabiano was lights out in this game he did not give gash a single chance he played a beautiful setup completely understood the structure and he got this and ges had nothing i mean fabiano was a brick wall fabiano's in the semi-finals as well and now vincent kimer leon aronian it turned out that before the game leavon analyzed the wrong position so the position was selected leavon was analyzing the wrong position and he had said they had he brought this up and so they talked to him and he said that's all right i'm i've lived long enough and and you know i'm i'm i'm happy to to to laugh at myself being an idiot which is good we should all be able to laugh at ourselves first and foremost and others provided you know you shouldn't make fun of people actively but as a as a society we should laugh at ourselves laugh at each other and not you never punch down it's the number one rule you never punch down but punching up have at it talking like taller people any anyway this one is a dutch defense so this one takes a totally unique thing vincent opens up his bishops right away these guys don't touch their e pawns at all g3 and now e5 so vincent decides i want to open up my bishop and my rook okay but by playing like this he gives levon something really sacred to every chess player time and every human time f4 that was a weird decision by vincent to play e5 like to to open up but be given time and now levon plays an active queen move and and this is a totally unique position than what we've seen already a5 a4 and now vincent already senses desperation he's not happy with how the opening turned out his knights are active but he's got no pawn play so his knights have no forward mobility and if you give oh well i can't actually do that it's actually hard to make a move for black like bishop f6 white's going e4 i mean white's going to castle long white's going to castle along and then play e4 and win the game so he plays g5 and this is like trying to get in a fight with your shoes tied and it does not work out levon knight c5 he's getting the bishops in he's getting the this bishop is a beast and this game ends in less than 10 moves bishop h6 king off the center line he continues to capture and my man levon slides over the queen targets the bishop targets the check which is a fork targets the knight opens up the rook for when his pece moves and vincent takes on d2 and on c5 but the attack never stops and the final piece of the puzzle is e4 e4 will remove the defense of the black position entirely it will open up the rook he can't castle vincent can't castle he can't castle in either direction take take knight e4 and you just sacrifice the rook you sacrifice the rook because it cannot be taken because before i take i will check you and your king is stranded in the center of the board king e8 queen g8 is mate king here this is mate rook a6 instead queen g7 d6 what a knockout rook takes d6 the simple idea being if this then this and if the king goes here rook c4 you're mated and if you take with the rook rook e8 king e8 and you're going to lose your queen which you never even managed to move leavon aronian shows up gets the job done and he is going to play fabiano caruana in the semifinals and these two still got a match to play they played classical in this portion to break the tie they play rapid this is game number one will the goat return completely to form and take down ali reza or will ali reza take down magnus carlson it's chest 9 60 so you really never know that's the beautiful thing about it all right c4 notice totally unique position king in the center knights over here will you bring these knights out like this how are you going to open up your bishops how which way you going to castle let's see c4 knight f6 oi resa takes queenside space magnus gives up a pawn [music] but whoa so white's not going to count that way right he's not going to go that way knight f3 but why is magnus wasting all this time look at him giving ali resa so much central space this is crazy and it's rapid right it's fast time control bc5 ma magnus's pieces are getting shoved to the back or are they what a provocative position h7 is hanging by the way you want to take it or you got to deal with the center first alyza castles wow black can not castle because knight g5 threatens not just mate but also the knight so that would be very bad and you would get into a bad position so instead of that magnus takes on d4 queen d4 plays f5 anchoring his knight wild complications already al resa is a pawn down ali resa loves giving up a little material for a little activity take knight f6 hold up whoa look at this this is just a pure x-ray skewer not x-ray skewer and magnus cannot play this because that does not stop c5 doesn't stop c5 you take i take the queen you take my queen i take your rook you take with the queen i take your queen you take my queen i take your rook so magnus after the move bishop f4 loses his rook oh my god he's down in exchange ali resa is cooking castles rook b1 and knight g3 and magnus plays e6 and basically here is the situation ali resa has a rook magnus has a bishop and a pawn so it's a onepoint differential between the two of them but the evaluation is 049 that's because the engine actually thinks black has some pretty powerful freaking pieces the the power of the rook here is not felt but you know where it will be felt the end game if white is able to correctly simplify the position very simple example but kind of dumb if white trades the queens right and then a couple of moves later black offers a trade of knights and then a couple of well here there's just purely rook b8 but then you know we get something like this like white is much better here like white is going to try to put pressure on d7 and try to open up the file but black can defend black can defend for a long time so knight g3 e6 oliv res the thinks plays knight e4 he's got five minutes to beat magnus carlson in the phase of the game where this man has made his bread and butter he trades one pair of knights magus plays bishop e7 now believe it or not the best move here is c5 it's one of the options if there's a queen trade you don't trade and instead you target h7 it's actually kind of hard to defend yourself you play g6 i play rook c1 so c5 is a very interesting idea if bishop c5 i have rook c1 anyway with queen d3 but why are we sacrificing a pawn it's the end game instead we're going to put our knight on d4 magnus stops knight to b5 ala brings the knight back to try to support the move c5 and now we takes some space with f4 magnus gets his king off the light squares general improving move for preparing for the end game aliva has a minute on the clock he plays king h1 magnus plays knight d6 now suddenly the momentum is back to equal the position is back to equal the momentum is on the side of magnus c5 take take magnus is completely in control weakness weakness bishop is going to anchor everybody but ali reza steps up to the challenge and gets on the file major decision to be made for magnus extremely weak square on f7 if you go to a rook end game only white can win so rook f1 he takes on c5 rook c1 it's it's looking like we're going to go to a an end game with like no pieces on the board rook d8 he takes rook d7 ali res has got a rook up but magnus has two pawns now i will remind you in an end game a while ago white only had four pawns and black had five now white only has two pawns and black has four but you got a really powerful rook plays bishop c4 all the rest is still the only one on the board with a rook the position is equal this is extremely tense stuff bishop to d5 rook b4 magnus plays bishop c3 bothering the rook rook a4 and magnus carlson chucks the pawn gives it up and is all in one minute versus 30 seconds you could bring your king you could bring knight c1 so i'm stopping this e3 now the best move here is rook a4 to then try to play knight e2 and bring the king aliva goes here and i don't know if he did this on purpose or what he blunders the pawn on a2 now if he takes an e2 is played it's this it's this it's takes it's takes and only black is playing this for a win but it's probably a draw now that's what happens we have this we have this magnus promotes to rook and this is the end game knight c1 king g5 knight d3 only magnus can win this position king g4 bishop back this is a draw this is a draw there is there's absolutely nothing here you can even take you can take you can take the pawn on h7 you can take the pawn on h7 because even though you're trapped your king can go here k g1 and if the kn if if if if they start coming back for you i think there's a way to save yourself there might be a way this also might be like a defensive fortress of course you don't want to get involved in any of that you but i think you might be able to take maybe you're just trapped knight e4 and now something absolutely ridiculous happens magnus in a completely otherwise drawn endgame look at ali resen knight h3 sacking the knight he gets alyza into awang alira keeps trying to sacrifice his knight and for reasons that nobody quite understands he wanders off and now he's trapped knight goes to c6 the king goes to d5 the knight is trapped bishop c3 and in this position it's a check and al resa resigns because the knight is trapped and magnus carlson wins an 80 move endgame which was probably a draw but not even that ali resa had a rook he had a rook and he decided either deliberately or accidentally to go for this endgame and just hold it and he loses he loses and now he has to win with war he has to win with black in a brand new position so position's completely different and he starts the game in the most provocative way possible by developing his bishop and not taking the center that is the way he opts to start this game to try to throw magnus off his game magnus just says all right listen rules of chess still apply principles of chess still apply i'm just going to play solidly and i'm going to take space away from you why cuz i know you're kns are going to want to come out but they're going to want to come out into these pawns so you're probably not going to put them there so what you're going to try to do is you're probably going to play on this side but i'm going to get a head start i'm going to get ahead start taking the space away from you on that side of the board ali rza knight f2 d5 knight d2 and again ali resa has to win so at some point he can't just let magnus over you know do nothing well magnus doesn't even wait he doesn't wait he just play c4 he says you know what al res you want a castle right the only way to castle is to move your queen how you going to do that you play queen d7 i'm going shove you right back in you go queen d8 i'm playing c5 you just you got no moves if you can't move these pieces you're going to lose the game so c4 ala plays knight g6 bishop a4 attacks the queen the queen slides over he slides up he's just going to move every piece off the back rank and leave the option to castle that way or leave the option not to castle at all remember remember ali reza has to win the game and he played this game in a way where he gave space away early on he plays c6 magna is just being annoying he's just not letting any piece go forward knight goes back to f6 now he captures knight transitions to the e5 square and ali resa goes here we trade we trade we trade and now simply knight b3 position is symmetrical we both have a d pawn but my pieces are of a much higher quality i'm going to go king a2 i don't even need to castle and your king is never going to get to any sort of safety knight g5 shoves the knight back and that's mate that i'm threatening by the way or at least the perpetual i'm threatening a mate or a perpetual check which one do you want to choose bishop e3 magnus still sacrificing this knight because the king is going to get cut off brutal absolutely brutal the black king goes to a7 f4 i mean my goodness he just rolls forward queen b5 fine let's go to an end game doesn't matter ali resa down to 12 seconds this is clean up rook c5 hanging hanging and just like he won the first game he wins the third game of the day against al ri he sweeps ali r beats him three times in a row to punch his ticket to the semi-final and he's up against nock abdu satov the man who has not lost a single game while in germany said so himself no's been playing the best chess and can't wait starts tomorrow we do have a round robin for fifth through eighth place as well so vincent gukesh ding and ali resa will play fifth through eighth semi-finals begin tomorrow and the goat is back now get out of here
