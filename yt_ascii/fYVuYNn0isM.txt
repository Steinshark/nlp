of my games now i had 1900 and i played a dutch defense against her all of these were blitz games and you know it's weird when you play young players because you try to you know you got to take a little bit of risk as a higher rated player especially in speed games it can be very difficult to just create winning chances like on demand so you have to try to find a way to do it and and as you see here like i played a dutch defense i i played a an opening that's very complicated has eight pawns on the board each and this was right after i had defeated megan in a relatively convincing game as being the rating favorite but in this second game she played unbelievably well first of all in this position you know i just played the move knight h5 i'm ready to start an attack she plays this extremely annoying move knight to f4 which essentially she's trying to double her pawns but then pressure me on the e-file which was extremely annoying so i played king h8 and she damaged my pawns and we got a very close center and suddenly i'm just much worse this is a 10 year old i'm playing okay she's ten she's not supposed to know this much chess like it's it's unhealthy and within a few moves she she just had like a completely commanding position i mean i tried to attack her king she just completely ignored took one of my pawns i played h3 to open up she just took another one of my butt she's just up two months to the two-point advantage against me and and literally the only thing i could do was rely on the clock that was it and she i mean she got here it's plus four she's plus four against me i mean this is you know it's a 10 year old a 10 year old whose video rating is 1924. and and i did my best i mean to be honest with you i i was down i was on three pawns i was completely lost completely lost she's gotta traitor rook she's gotta go for my other pawn the only chance i have here with black is to keep pieces on the board and try to infiltrate with my rook now you don't see a clock here because we played on chess kid she didn't have a lot of time on the clock so you know she gave me back a pawn and she traded rooks and she is still completely winning but i was trying to play very stubborn defense now one of the things she cannot do is move pawns forward which is actually very nice because if she had a pawn on a5 she would just go here here and then promote so i'm just playing defense but of course you can just play like rook c5 and rook b5 and win my pawns and if she played rook c5 i would have went here and then at that point you know maybe she should go d5 and try to crack the position open but she went king g2 and slowly i brought my king and she started kind of shuffling and and she started and then and then and then i got in and now i'm winning it was because she surrendered control of the only open file that's like the most important thing here so even though i was two pawns down i was able to create counter play because her bishop wasn't really playing a prominent role in the game and i managed to get in i picked up some pawns i had to stop her pawn and then i weave the checkmate net for the king with rook a1 mate i mean but this was not a good start all right it really this was going to show me that i was in bad shape now i played brewington and brewington and i we had a very very tense carl khan first of all he played the fantasy which is you know which is an opening i don't really like very much then he played a really weird line i played queen b6 and i took and i developed my knight with the intention of pilfering his bishop with knight g4 so i developed my knight with tempo i grabbed this bishop but he has he is a big boy center here i mean e4 d4 c5 he's gonna castle gonna play bishop c4 and it was a cat and mouse game i didn't know if he was gonna castle or not so i immediately attacked the center with the move b6 you'll notice that i'm actually not playing the natural castling move because i'm you know i'm not sure you know bishop g4 or like what to do i don't exactly know where he's going to castle and if i play castles i don't know maybe he's gonna play h4 h5 like maybe i'm gonna get mated so i played b6 and then here i could have taken with the pawn or the queen i decided to take with the queen and i still do not know which way he's going to castle and he surprised me because he did not castle he just played rook c1 and he can't even castle this way and then he played queen c3 and i thought oh look look at me i'm gonna i'm gonna mate him you know what he played in this position here and a few moves later i got my queen down there and guess what he just walks his king out and he's winning are you kidding me is that even possible i have a i have evicted the king forward and the king is completely safe and suddenly my queen is gonna get booted and sent packing all the way to a5 and c7 and he's just in good shape but here he loses his focus a little bit he actually was much better here if he had played the move bishop c4 if he had just kind of began trying to trade pieces he could have taken my bishop and then he could have pushed this pawn and then he could have hit his king on h2 and actually he's in very nice shape but because he allowed more of my pieces to stay on the board he ends up missing a very nice idea here which is stripping the defender of his center pond with bishop takes knight and that sort of was my plan minus you know the part where i was worse and then when the dust settles i grab a pawn and then i grab a second pawn i grab this pawn and he's in bad shape because we're gonna simplify and at the end of it i'm gonna win another pawn on b2 so he takes i throw in this capture with check i trade rooks and i go here and now i am up two pawns and this is a winning end game you're not always winning an opposite colored bishop pen games when you're up pawns but in this case because i have just a pure four on two that simplifies down to a two one zero and then i'm gonna promote so you'll notice the way i do this i bring my bishop back he trades rooks and now it's a very easy process i bring my king i kick his king out and then i get this once you get the two on zero usually this is actually drawable with the king and the bishop like this believe it or not but with more pawns it's not because if his bishop sacrifices for two pawns with no pawns on the board it's a draw with more pawns on the board i win so i put my pawns on dark squares and now slowly methodically i bring my bishop and i bring my pawns i wrap around check and then once i get down here i can end the game in style with king e3 and f2 so that was a nice win because brewington is very high rated and i'm like i asserted my dominance with a karo khan and you know our next game was also very interesting i played a reverse pot i played a reverse filador from a ponziani was a super interesting positional game was a very close position a lot of maneuvering i thought i had secured a pretty comfortable position and a nice advantage i also caught him with a nice trick which was knight takes a5 and then forking him and i had my you know i was advancing and i had my bishops and i and i was very very slowly trying to outplay two nights with two bishops and do all of this and simplify his position down and grind him in an end game but he defended extremely well and then he got me low on time and then i panicked and then i hung my queen in one move not only did i hang my queen i i hung everything i mean i this was the position and he was he was equalizing and the position was very tense but i think he was getting fully back into the game and i played the worst move on the board and hung upon and then hung my queen and then i resigned so that was that was very bad but i felt i thought you know what that's a fluke but then i played the final boss i this was technically my third round opponent but i played the best player on the opposing team and the best player on the opposing team is alice lee that's not a disrespect to any of the other players but alice lee is the number three ranked girl in the world under the age of 21 and she's 13. the number three ranked girl under 21 and she's 13. there could be people there that are 14 15 16 17' 19 20 and even up to the age of like 20 and a half and she's number three that's nuts she's probably knock on wood she's gonna be a grand master she's already drawing hikaru and you know i didn't i was actually terrified i wasn't scared of any of the other players i had no clue what to expect and it didn't help that she played every move in half a second i was like all right i just made a course on this opening i should be fine you know i bishop f5 she played this move instantly we traded i developed everything and i played bishop d6 and i did all of this and you know i think here technically the more accurate move is bishop e7 i played bishop d6 because there is nothing wrong with e4 here for black that's what i thought so she played e4 in half a second i was like really okay she's trying to take advantage of the fact that my king is still in the center so she took i took she took i took and then she can give me a check but my kim will go to f8 and i thought okay i'm just gonna go here and here but she's playing every move in half a second i'm like why is she blitzing she plays queen b3 attacking my pawn i'm like okay queen d7 i'm making an accuracy i thought i should lure her knight forward and i shouldn't go here right away i thought this was a bad move because she's gonna go rook c1 and d5 as it turns out none of that is scary if you have computer preparation because you can just walk out of the way and be completely fine but i was very scared and then she brought her rook forward and i thought okay she wants to go here but that move does nothing because i'm gonna take right so i thought okay i can either play rook d8 or g6 i thought okay i'm gonna bring my rook to the center everything is good she's gonna bring her rook to the center now if i take this pawn i actually lose in spectacular fashion to this and whichever way i take rookie 8 is made which is disgusting but i still thought i had this and i was actually com i was a move away i was a move away from completely escaping the pressure i i had done all right i had gotten out of the way of the prodigy rook e4 now the idea of rook to e4 is obviously if i ask you what's the point of rookie for it's obviously the double up right rookie four double up put pressure so naturally you would think take the knight which was my first idea just get out of the way then she would take i would go here she would go here and i don't know i would go here like this is a game all right i've at least i've neutralized the position right rookie four i thought all right but i was gonna take the night then i thought what about this what about this i thought about it and i and i had a thought here rookie 8 rook f4 right rook d6 or maybe even bishop takes and game goes on so i pl i thought for a while after rookie four and i played this i was like yay and then alice lee sacrificed the rook rook takes f6 and i was like god damn it oh my the idea of rookie four was to go rook f4 but not not necessarily right away she could sack first and that and what that does is it's called attraction it attracts my king out like a magnet and now this now i'm dead now i'm dead because if i go here rook f7 is going to win my queen and if i go here there are a few ways that like she could throw this i thought you know for example queen g3 right away i'm actually just escaping but she played h4 check and if i play king h6 she just takes queen e3 is coming and i got destroyed she played this game at like 97 accuracy i was like bro that what i just got destroyed by a child i got so naturally my confidence is negative going into game two alright it is negative i play the english she plays c6 and she plays the slav move order and she plays knight knight d7 and i trade and i and i played this structure and i thought look this structure makes sense to play because her knight doesn't really belong on that square it really didn't help i mean i mean i i thought i was getting somewhere in the opening but very promptly she put a knight in the center and then i took it and she did this and and i'm already worse i mean i'm already worse and i was not confident i was not happy with what i was doing and then here she played again the best move which is b5 and i had a choice here grab that bishop or go for that bishop and the thing is when you're nervous and not confident you do stupid things which of these bishops actually has access to my king it's not a trick question it's the bishop on d6 you idiot right that bishop isn't doing anything that bishop needs this to open but instead i was like oh other bishop but that's such a stupid move because her bishop on d6 is going to escort the attack i mean it's just it i was making bad decision after bad decision and she played rook c8 and now if i do this she's gonna go here and i'm gonna get no bishop okay i'm gonna get none of the bishops so i decided okay you know what i'm gonna take that bishop and and and slowly but surely now f4 is on the way i played pawn to g3 here she played g5 and i thought okay i'm definitely gonna lose this game i mean i this is insane i mean i'm just getting like juggernauted out here and then here i looked within myself and i found i found a chess god inside me here i thought all right her next move is this and she's gonna try to take my soul king h1 f4 let's go one of us is gonna go down swinging and here i played in my opinion the best move i played that day d5 d5 is a clearance sacrifice i am giving up a pawn to open my bishop because in the long run that bishop is gonna annoy the black king now the computer shows the the way to play here the computer shows this and after check the black king should walk toward the center and just hang out over here that's kind of not human she did this and then here finally she makes an inaccuracy all right she was intimidated by my opening of the diagonal so she plays bishop e5 and now i punish that with rook g5 a very nice idea and now folks we begin the comeback b4 i take the bishop and my bishop survives and that pawn move i made a long time ago is really gonna come in handy because black's king is going to be uncomfortable everything is paid off bishop d4 she threatens mate by the way never too late to get checkmated queen f1 she cannot take my rook because of this god bishop and now it's just a matter of can i simplify this down the answer is yes i can i find a very very nice idea here queen c8 walking into my pin queen g4 and now i am forcing a queen trade but it's worse than that because i have pressure here i'm not just forcing a queen trade i'm grabbing a pawn on the way out and i'm taking the knight and when the dust settles i have five pawns to three i have two pass pawns my king is gonna walk up here that's exactly what i did and now my queen side pawns are gonna go and ladies and gentlemen we have taken down the juggernaut of the kids team i was losing in both of these games make no mistake but i fought back in this one i was very happy to win this game i mean it feels ridiculous to be proud of like a victory oh you 'd be a kid i mean this is this ain't no kid bro this is she's a beast all right and i was very happy to win this game and i was also very happy in my next matchup all right i lost tatani over the board this was a nice way to to end the day i played the trumpowski my favorite opening and he played this very sharp line which you really have to be prepared for which is upon sacrifice line where i play h4 and he played rook g8 here and i played rook h7 rook h7 is a very fun move it's technically not the best move according to the computer but imagine your opponent just plants a rook here you know and now i want to play queen h5 so he blocks me and then we develop like this and then here tani who probably should play bishop before in this position now if he plays b5 i'm gonna jump in right so in this position he plays the move queen g5 and i was like wait a minute his his queen strapped his queen has no way back not only does his queen have no way back he can't go here can't go to any of those squares it can't go there because of my rook it can't go there because of the bishop it can't go there because of the bishop can't take the pawn because of the knight can't go there or the only square it has is queen f4 okay i just moved my king and pawn to g3 and the queen straps now he could play knight e3 check but then i would take and then he would take and then i would take and his queen is hanging and then i would play knight f6 jack and he would lose all the rest of his pieces queen g5 and by some insane geometry his queen is trapped and he resigned here and i was like okay yeah and then tony and i in our next game played like 70 moves and i managed to win but i probably did not deserve it it was it was equal for a while and it was a very very messy scramble then he was winning i ended the day six out of eight i beat megan 2-0 one of them was completely undeserved i went 1-1 with brewington won one with alice and i managed to beat tani 2-0 i got six out of eight eric rosen went 8-0 eric rosen hates children he beat he beat all the kids two times 8-0 ridiculous and we ended up winning the match mostly because of you know eric's heroics and who knows maybe i will play a rematch let me know if you did enjoy and yeah this was this was very fun i mean i think all of these players will be titled players i don't know if all of them will be grand masters but i'm hoping they will be and i hope you know they get to 26 and 2700 we'll see what the future holds or who knows maybe they will go to college and become you know investment bankers or some other very respectable profession that's all i have for you today i'm gonna go nap because my allergies are killing me goodbye get out of here
