from the beginning i sat in the meeting with jeremy and caleb and the whole team and we pitched comment section and we we had produced a pilot and the marketing team and the social media team was developing it they brought me in i could have been fired at any moment if they had not green lipped the show my job would have been a i had nothing else to do not my show would have been asked i would have been next sat in this meeting with jeremy we played the pilot and he got through it we watched all three you know looking back on it it's terrible terrible pilot but he looked over me he was silent in his normal jeremy way contemplating things and looked at me and he said i don't understand this show but i know other people [music] will hello everybody i'm talking today to brett cooper youtube phenomenon but but in the prepared manner that many people who are explosively successful are prepared brett started acting when she was very young she was very dedicated to her pursuit of her artistic career she was aided in that by the efforts of her mother and so she had that working for her but by the time she was 10 she had a pretty decent cv on the acting side behind her she spent spent a fair bit of time in hollywood expanding her abilities protected from whatever toxicity that environment might offer by the aforementioned commitment of her mother and then she got a stellar opportunity but also had set that up with daily wire she had worked with dennis prager and some other conservative organizations making short form social media content and learning how to do that and that's a real skill in and of itself and got the opportunity to expand that into something of longer form with daily wire was hesitant and afraid about that felt at 19 because that's when the offer came in that perhaps that was beyond her but took the plunge and has produced out of whole cloth a spectacularly successful youtube channel and with about 4 and a half million subscribers that's been built up in the short span of a couple of years and also has a plethora of exciting acting opportunities arrayed in front of her as a consequence of her partnership with the daily wire and so join us for all that so you've made a big splash in recent years that's what i've been told yeah yeah why why do you think that is what are you doing that's working i think i'm filling a niche that i myself want wanted mh and that i was lacking growing up i didn't have influences online that i felt like spoke to me that shared my values like a a common young person with more traditional values i did not see that especially growing up in hollywood that was i was not thred by that whatsoever and so when we created the common section when i came to daily wire i wanted to reach young people in general but i specifically wanted to talk to young women yeah is that fundamentally your audience no it's growing it's becoming more female oriented but it's always been more male dominant i think that's just because more young men are on youtube well that's that's a big thing to fight against so to speak and i think the last time i looked which is a couple of years ago like youtube was 80% male dominated so it's hard to not have a majority male audience but my female audience continues to grow and when i meet fans in public when any of my audience comes up to me obviously i'm thrilled to meet all of them and they're always such kind and interesting people and they always you know share interesting stories but the people that speak to me the most are the young women where i see myself they telling you they thank me for sharing their values on such a public platform they thank me for showing that it does not have to be scary to espouse common sense and traditional values they say you feel like a big sister that i never had or like a little sister or you give me hope for my daughters and it's it's incredibly touching i was just talking about it while i was getting my makeup done but i am incredibly blessed and incredibly grateful to have been given the platform right that i have yeah great right i'm honored so when you grew up in hollywood let's talk about that a little bit i understand that you were emancipated at the age of 15 pursue acting okay so let's start with that i don't think we have to go any earlier than that now did you was that the point at which you moved to hollywood no i moved to holw tell me story i moved to holw when i was 10 when you were 10 start from where from chattanooga tennessee oh yeah mh okay then i guess you have to you have to start i have to go back a little earlier well i would say so how was it that you and i presume your family decided that it was a good idea to move from chattanooga tennessee to hollywood like what what was behind that the short of it and i'll get into the long of it but the short of it was me it's i felt like i needed to perform like i needed to breathe i loved telling stories i loved being on stage and and you had been on stage in tennessee yes in a community theater so i my the first production that i ever did and i started in theater love musical theater was being a munchkin in my brother's high school production of the whz and they needed a couple of like younger siblings to get up on stage do a little munchkin dance and be in this high school production one of my mom's friends whose children also went to this private school said you know brett's six five would she like to come and be in this i was terrified i was deathly shy my one of my brothers had passed away the year prior and it had absolutely wrecked my family just absolutely cracked this open and i was reeling from that my family dynamic was completely different and i just shut down and did not want to get on stage had no interest in doing it i remember we were doing construction on our house in chattanooga and i would hide in like a credential like that and i would get in cabinets and hide i was just like i don't want to be seen don't want to be heard and my mom was noticing that and was making a conscious effort to push me go in and speak to somebody in a gas station by yourself here's $5 go bu a candy bar and so when i was just absolutely i don't want to get on stage i don't want to do this she was like well no i think that this is something that you should do if you're afraid of it and i got on stage and have like never felt that way and she said that me being on stage i just came alive and that's how i felt even at six years old that was at six that was at six okay and so what did you what performances did you undertake after that how that i did i did multiple at that high school then i started doing community theater production and then i was begging my mom to do more i was like let me find other things can i do a community theater production here she was originally from atlanta and atlanta was two hours away could i go do annie annie is being you know produced in georgia can i can we drive out there and i'll audition because i really want to play you know the little orphan molly and annie the atlanta symphony and opera i was a i started doing like singing lessons they were doing laboom and had a children's choir please let me go audition for this and so my mom would put me in the car and we would drive 2 hours and she would sit outside while i would be in rehearsals and dance classes and i just came alive and there was nothing that i loved more what did you why did you like performing what did it do for you it gave me it gave me an outlet to express things i didn't feel comfortable expressing at all what kind of things i think it was it was less of a specific emotion and it was more of i was just able to be completely openly me i was able to put myself in other people's shoes it's like that attacus fish quote where you know you get to put on somebody else your shoes and walk a while not walk a mile on the what he says and feel a mocking bird it gave me the opportunity to do that to put myself in character circumstances that were completely unlike my own it was an escape in a lot of ways well it's play it is you know what i mean kids like love to play and even though we don't really like let them anymore that's why they i think that's why they play so intensely when they go off to university i'm sure and switch roles and transform identities sure yeah i think in most of it's repressed play not most of it much of it is repressed play yeah well it you have to play a lot of roles before you find your part yeah right and that's what kids are doing that's what they should be doing between the ages of about two and a half and like well that really intense play period lasts probably till around 10 but then there are variants of it in adolescence as well as people find their way and find their role and what you were doing was a very structured yes variant of that and i think i needed that because so much of it was suppressed at home i was i think i was constantly trying to make myself as small as possible to not rock the boat my entire life have because of because of things because of how upset things had become yes and in the aftermath particular my brother's death my parents their relationship was not great from the beginning and they stayed together for me my brothers are all older than me and so that the death in the family just broke that open even more and so i and i knew from a very young age was very self-aware i knew that they were staying together for me was very uncomfortable and i just wanted to cause as few problems as possible and ironically that turned into then me traveling around the country doing theater cling problem logistical problems right right well those are those are you know th those are better problems than pointless and horrible problems yeah they were fun problems they were adventurous okay so you acred quite a lot of experience by the time you were 10 yes all right and then so your family up and moved to my mom and i did your mom your mom and you did my parents relationship ship i would say was already on the fritz like i said and i had been working in new york a little bit while i was n9 or 10 and and actually don't know if i've ever told this story on a podcast before but i desperately wanted to play jane banks and mary poppins and it was a musical that was on broadway in the early 2000s desperately and the show had been running for a couple of years and i would sit on my mom's big desktop computer and i would avidly watch youtube videos of all the girls who were playing jane banks this you know 12-year-old character and i learned who their managers were and who their agents were and there was one guy and he managed four of the different girls who had played jane banks over the course of three years i wrote him a letter a handwritten letter and i said my name is brett cooper i love performing these are all the things i've done i'm attaching my resume my biggest dream is to play jane banks and then i painted a photo of me as jane banks on bradway and i mailed it to him and then i got an email back somehow and brought me out to new york and i audition there and so then i started working more in the big leaks i would say and so i started auditioning for broadway shows doing workshops of broadway shows and how old were you then nine nine okay okay so this this is still prior tove yes prior to so this is in new york so you did all that research when you were what eight yeah eight and nine and i it was completely self-directed and i hit my growth spurt very young and on broadway if you are under the age of' and you're playing a children's role if you're playing a 12-year-old an 8-year-old a 15-year-old they want you under a certain height limit so the people in the back of the house can distinguish an adult from a child on stage and so i think for jane banks the specific role and for most of the young roles at that time it was 411 and i had audition for jane banks time and time again the national tour the broadway show somebody's you know a girl is being replaced because you know you have like a six-month contract and finally got to one where it seemed like it was going to happen i was pinned and they said come back in two months it's going to be you and a few other girls over that two months i hit the biggest growth spurt of my life came back and i was way too tall and i remember sitting up there and they they literally measure you before you can go in an audition and i was like let me shrink myself as much as possible hard yeah and they said no we're not going to hire you not because of my talent or anything like that but you are just too tall so me you cannot see sizeism i would say definitely you you were a vi i was a victim ofm at 9 years old that's right yeah it it was heartbreaking it was crushing at 9 years old and one of my best friends at the time got the role of michael banks so he played he was playing jane banks's brother and it was crushing because i saw him you know traveling around the country on the national tour and my management team i ended up signing with the guy who had represented all of those actresses was with him for 10 plus years adore him he said you basically can wait until you turn' and then you can play adult roles or you can go to los angeles and you can do fil at tv my mom said absolutely not she was originally born in california my brothers were all born in california she said i'm not going back that industry specifically film and television is disgusting i don't want my child in it and i just begged begged like this is all i want to do and i was homeschooled at the time already just for academic reasons and i basically just laid it out for her and i said we have the flexibility you don't even want to be in tennessee you don't really want to be in this marriage basically and i i like this is all i want to do and so she said let's go and try it and so we went there for three months and she said we'll see if you like it and i loved it and things started taking off signed with an agent out there and then we would do three months on and then three months off with my father and he would drive across the country with us and you know get us to the apartment and then i'd stay there for three months and then go home and then i think at 14 was when we permanently moved out there and then ipated we meaning you and and other again yeah and so what were you doing in hollywood between 10 and 14 auditioning and doing small roles on different tv shows and short films and training that's that's the biggest part of being an actor is that you are in acting classes four times a week you are doing singing lessons you are dancing you're building your skill set i remember you know i had to do a i was on a tv show and i had to learn how to fence so you're in you know fencing classes and and in addition to that i think this is important i had a lot of things outside of acting that i think kept me more well-rounded so that my identity did not completely get wrapped up in this industry that is very vapid and it is very based on vanity and selfishness and fame and i was you know a horseback rider and i was a ballet dancer for 15 years i did gymnastics i played tennis i was very very involved in school i went to an online private school incredibly incredibly academic and my i would say my identity was honestly more wrapped up in my education at that point in my life that it wasn't acting and acting was just something that i got to do and was your mother facilitating all of this was she helping you out yeah right so you enjoyed your time in los angeles between 10 and 14 i loved it there's been a lot of rumors about child actors in hollywood recently what do you make of all that a lot it's all true so what ha what did you escape unscathed i did i i would i i saw a lot of it what did you see for example i worked on a children's tv show on a major network and one of the writers after we wrapped on the show after the show was canceled had incredibly inappropriate relationships with young women like me who were on the show young women in my how young 14 okay and to my knowledge this was not sexual but it was objectively grooming it was inappropriate relationships between an adult and minors because hollywood goes ahead and it blurs the lines between what is appropriate between adults and children because you're working with adults constantly my entire life i spent my entire childhood i spent more time with adults than i did with children my management team they were all adults obviously agents managers directors casting directors producers wardrobes assistant you're surrounded by adults constantly writers in this case and and those lines get really blurred so if a a writer on a tv show that you worked on invites you and one of your co-stars out to lunch to talk about another tv show that he's working on your parents go oh okay yeah well you've worked with him for two years at this point let's take you to lunch mh and then you're sitting here with this girl who's a year older than you and he starts talking about the lesbian fantasies that he has about you and your friend like that's nothing nothing happened but that's the fact that he thought that that was appropriate the fact that he well that's a testing behavior yeah and then the fact that later we're walking around the restaurant and he puts his hand in my friend's back pocket who's 15 years old and i was just you know i'd get me out of here completely inappropriate she was how many of the young people in hollywood are sold into that so to speak by their parents now you you characterized your mother as someone who was loath to take you yeah on the hollywood adventure but there's no shortage of parents is it more common among mothers probably the cluster b type mothers who use their children to their own advantage come hell or high water yeah jz jennings for example speaks to mind right in the most brutal and horrible possible manner right but there's a you can see a lot of this on social media yeah you know parents pimping out their children transforming them as well you know and then proclaiming their moral virtue in consequence of the transformation you know my child is very very deviant but i'm such a wonderful person yeah that i still love them deeply right right monior pushed them in that direction in the first place and then you might say so yeah and i think another example did you read i'm glad my mom died by janette mccartie no i haven't read it fantastic and that i mean that i think is the most incredible example of what a lot janette mcc she's you haven't talked to her on your podcast no i have not i believe she talked to michaela michaa okay okay it it was just an incredible book i remember sitting i read it last year when it came out and i was just i mean full just tears reading it because these are the stories of the people that i grew up with they're the things that i saw but was protected against my mom was very wary about me being involved in this industry and a sharp she set firm boundaries she was always watching she was always within ey shot had a guardian oh yes right and the other thing that i think was incredibly important that she did was again like i said i had so many other things going on in my life so my identity was not wrapped up in this industry i never connected it to money at all because my money was put in savings accounts my parents never touched it my mom never touched it the state takes 15% of whatever a young actor makes and puts it into your cougan account so if you are in situation where your parents are exploiting you at least by' you have some money never touched any of that and never wanted me to connect hollywood and making money because i would see she saw people in my circle these kids they would you know do an episode on a tv show and then their parents would go out and buy yeah six american girl dolls and they would buy a fancy new car for the family and you know the the parents would take a huge vacation that the kid at 8 years old paid for right and my mom always wanted to ensure that i stuck in this industry because i loved it because i couldn't live without it because i loved telling stories and at least once a month she would say are you sure you want to do this because if you ever want to stop we'll stop i don't care how much money we've invested in your acting classes and your dance classes if you want to stop if you want to go home you'll pack up and move to tennesse what made her so sensible she's just a brilliant woman she's incredible she she's one of the most resilient people i've ever met she has been to helen back a million times her first husband passed away her child then passed away my older brother in light of my brother's passing has severe mental illness he's permanently in a psychiatric facility for schizophrenia very very hard marriage with my father very very hard upbringing where she was often the black sheep m she is very comfortable being nontraditional and doing things that would be considered unconventional in whatever circumstance she's in how how did you end up with traditional values then because she's very traditional but i i realized that as i said that i contradicted myself she is willing to be unconventional in the given circumstances so in hollywood we're so she's daring she's daring and the majority of people that we were surrounded by where parents were pushing their kids into this she was willing to be the one that says no my kid is not doing that my kid isn't doing this kind of project my kid is not going out for this project that is run by right a producer that we know has you know a bad track record is incredibly involved right well so fundamentally i mean the case you're laying out it's always useful to look at situational determinants of of unfortunate outcomes let's say and you know the first thing you said was well there are kids working with adults and so the lines are blurred and okay so that sets the stage and then you can imagine that within those relationships there's no shortage of people always whose ability to obtain intimacy like in a relationship or sexually is like stunningly compromised right and so those people at minimum are going to like just as a consequence of their inability are going to be looking for opportunity and maybe not even that good at distinguishing an appropriate from an inappropriate opportunity and then there's the ones that are really bent because they're resentful and because they're isolated they're actually looking for innocence to subvert and destroy those are the more people who tilt more in the explicitly narcissistic and sadistic direction and your circumstance was such that you had a mother who was watching out for you and so that instead of a mother who was complicit and exploiting you who turned to blind yeah now you said you had a gr spirit when you were how old nine yeah so what how physically mature were you by the time you were 14 relatively i always looked older for my age one so i that's another thing that blurs the lines of course right yeah and if you're around adults and you learn to act like an adult you're going to also present yourself you know in a more mature manner yeah and if you physically look like one i mean i yeah yeah well that's yeah it makes it very very complicated however it also it just shouldn't what did you what did you do do think that so often girls bully victims in general girls who are subject to exploitation are not very good at subtle signaling they don't know how to say no they don't know when to say no they don't know how to broadcast no yeah like right from the initial interactions right so how do you think you conducted yourself so that cuz i know you said your mother was protecting you but did you conduct yourself so that nothing got going yeah okay how i would say just intrinsically i'm very self-aware and have been for a long time and i think that that is because i had to grow up very quickly in terms of my family i was just very aware of everything that was going on you also said you didn't want to cause trouble yeah unnecessary trouble yes unnecessary trouble but i don't think that means that i was not willing to stand up for myself because in situations that were this severe in terms of my safety my innocence anyway i i think that i was very self- aware and then it goes back to my mother again when we moved out to los angeles she knew everything all the rumors about hollywood the casting couch she put me in women self-defense against sexual assault classes when i was 10 and i did those classes until i and that was useful the most incredible thing i've ever done hands down i was put in situations i started out doing group classes and you learn how to fight against a male opponent that is bigger than you because you can do jiu-jitsu you can do karate i think that those disciplines are incredible they often do not translate to real women women we hold our strength in different parts of our bodies when you are dealing with an assault their you know situational awareness is so important your voice is so important just being able to scream no yeah it was it was incredible and so i mean i was put in situations in these classes where you know a man comes up behind you my instructor comes up behind you holding a knife to your throat knowing how to get out of that holding a gun to your head you on you at least you at least were run through situation i was run through but i think this situation you described in the restaurant where this writer i think you said was a writer slipped his hand into the back pocket of this of your friend you said she was a little older than you yeah she was 16 why didn't he do the same thing to you he tried to and i moved away and i said that's weird don't do that okay did she do that no okay so so that that's the perfect example yeah well that's exact that's exactly my point those are the micro know that stop things from proceeding yes right yeah and so and i credit a lot of that to these classes that i did because as you said and as you brought up again i was unwilling to rock the boat i was a doormat in my family and still that's something that i'm still working through as an adult now i'm being very very nervous about that in my immediate family just because of the way that i was ra are you an agreeable person do you like to please people i do uhhuh right right right well you can also see the complexity because if you're an entertainer and you're on the stage you're obligated as part of your role to be magnetically attractive charismatic and all of that and to capitalize on that and so drawing the line marilyn monroe she said she could walk down the street as norma ray norma jeene norma genene norma genene or as marilyn right and if she walked down the street as normagene no one paid any attention to her but if she walked down the street as marilyn monroe then she was magnetically attractive right and so those are obviously well she was a master of that seductress role she's still iconic because of that and it's like 70 years later that's really quite something and it certainly destroyed her yeah right cuz that was too much well if you're an actor an actress then you have this can because you're rewarded for your attractiveness you're capitalizing on your attractiveness you're among adults but you have to hem that in so that you're not exploited yeah right well when exactly are you being exploited and when exactly are you exploiting yourself it's not like that's obvious so it's a very good thing that you had your your mother along with you yeah of course is too that's interesting because you were at least placed in frightening situations and you were at least alert to the fact that those sorts of things existed how do you think what you learned in the course is translated into changes in your day-to-day behavior they they addressed my doormat behavior they addressed my ableness because more than any of the physical fighting that i was doing and that was fun and it was an energy release that made me feel powerful emotionally i held myself differently my confidence skyrocketed because for the first time in my life i was given permission to say no i was given permission to draw a line in the sand and i think that is what my mom wanted more than anything i think that obviously she wanted me to be able to defend myself and as i got older that's when we started doing more of the you know date rape simulations and begun like we weren't doing that at 10 years old what she wanted me to learn because she had watched me grow up and be very very shy and refusing to get on stage and i think that she knew that i had this desperate urge to perform that i wanted to tell story she did not want she didn't want that mixed with my doormat behavior to then open the door for exploitation so women are more empathic compassionate agreeable than men on average and from what you've told me you tilt more in the agreeable direction and the problem with being agreeable one of the problems with being agreeable is that your agreeable people feel the pain of others quite acutely like literally so i'm an agreeable person so if i'm watching you in pain the same circuits that are mediating your pain are active in me y now if i'm not so agreeable that doesn't happen and that makes it easier for what does that mean well the downside is it makes it easier for me to be selfish because i don't give a damn about my effects on other people but the upside is i can tell you to go to hell when it's necessary and i don't care what your respones now i worked with a lot of women in my clinical practice who were like sequentially abused m and one of the things i noticed about them was that well first of all they were generally were very badly socialized and so had no idea where to draw those initial lines and that's what continually got them into trouble but they're also very unwilling to reject and to say no and the re that's the reason for that's obvious like if you reject someone if you say no to someone if you stop their advances you're definitely going to do something like offend them or hurt their feelings and so and if you're an agreeable person that's a very difficult thing to the worst thing you could yeah yeah exactly a disagreeable person will say yeah yeah a disagreeable person will just say well no and i don't care what you think about it or feel about it like screw off yeah right and you need that you need that especially if you're attractive especially if you're charismatic or especially if people are coming at you for a variet of reasons there are kind of two main reasons why people go to therapy mhm one is to deal with negative emotion let's say depression and anxiety the other main category is to learn how to stand up for themselves that's why learn to say no uhhuh uhuh and how are you at that now i'm much better how are you at contractual negotiations much better yeah how you do negotiating with daily wire i think i did pretty well did you do great i think i did pretty well i've gotten better as since then and it's good to surround yourself with sharks as long as they're not like gnawing on you yeah but it's been a have you had good agents i've had great agents that's good that's good so you've had you have had people other than your mother that been on your side yeah long-term relationships with them yeah oh yeah that's a good deal and i think one thing and i think we're goingon to talk about this later but another thing is my now husband i think has probably been the most influential in that starting a business can be tough but thanks to shopify running your online storefront

was something that i didn't want to be for a long time and i think that it was important that i learned how to control that because i think that it can be used really beautifully and to your advantage and i think it makes me a very empathetic person if you started crying i would start crying right now great with infants yes and well that but dead seriously like it's great with infants and so you know that's that's the place where agreeableness most appropriately manifests itself and it's partly because think about it this way m when you have an infant especially in the first let's say 9 months it's not quite that long but it's certainly the first six you have to agree with everything right every single demand that new creature makes you are obliged to say yes to right and so if you're agreeable and empathic and compassionate responsive then that's perfect match for that relationship problem is is that the relationship with infants isn't the same same as the relationship with well certainly not with predatory adults right those are those very different you yeah yeah opposite and so it takes it takes a whole different set of personality skills to be able to manage both levels of relationship it does so and that to be developed so let's talk about let's move from from hollywood to to the beginning of the comment section right because is that when the trend that's when yes yeah that's when your life transformed yes yes yes okay so tell us that story it was during co and i hollywood shut down as the world did i was in college i was at ucla what were you taking i was an english literature major yeah how did that go at ucla i feel like i english you in the english department that's so awful really that's so awful i i you crawling out of your skin i was but the the good thing is this was a blessing and disguise i had so i had a much better experience in a twisted way because of co because i got to go home and because i was in online classes i didn't you were protected from university oh god so but i i had a unique experience because i emancipated myself at 15 that's when i graduated high school started doing so you graduated from high school at 15 yes oh well congratulations on that thank thank you and why did you emancipate yourself i think a lot of people assumed that it was all for acting but it was mainly family my parents divorce had gotten pretty messy my and i was being used in the middle of it inadvertently so and that was not a position that i wanted to be in and i was making enough money to remove myself from that situation and i think the most important one was my my brother's schizophrenia had really taken off at that point point and it became a physically dangerous situation to be at home and there was a lot of turmoil there were just a lot of outbursts my mom was splitting her time between california and then flying back to tennessee to handle the divorce and the division of my parents estate while simultaneously coming back out to los angeles my brother was homeless at the time was using drugs when she was gone i would be the one to go literally find him on the streets of california and he would be you know passed out drugged out of his mind and that mixed with my parents divorce and then also i had a career on top of that and i was getting offers for jobs but because i was tically under the age of' i had to have a legal guardian you know within six feet eyesight earshot and my mom could not be there because she was handling this she was handling too many other things did your relationship with your mother maintain itself across she was and what your father struggled but my father and i have had a very tumultuous relationship for the majority of my life and so that wasn't like a a real breaking point it was just kind of like a okay here we go so it was more i see so you had practical reasons for this very practical and i and it was was a good decision it was it was the best yeah and it was not contentious i came to my parents and i said this makes logical sense i have a career yeah i am in college you graduated in college so you were ahead of the curve at the curve and i'm you know sitting here in los angeles and my mom basically i mean she agreed and she said this if i leave that means you're going to have to leave cuz i can't leave a 15-year-old child here in los angeles with a drug addict schizophrenic brother on the street i'm not going to do that so you'll have to come back to chattan nuk and i said i don't want to do that i don't want to go back to chattanooga i don't want to live in the middle of your mess of your divorce i'm not going to do that again and i have opportunities and so we so there's the time you said no yeah and i said i'm going to do this since we went to court in chattanooga my oldest brother helped me my parents off on it and you know i lived with my mom after that like it was not like i was ever around her but i got a job at trader joe's that i would have a stable income in between acting jobs and i worked there for five years and just kept that job until i left california best job i ever had and what did you do at trader joe's just a you know a bad girl basically we did people at trader joe's do everything you stock the shelves you bring in orders you like that i loved it why i felt physically useful i see so there was immediate reward there yeah immediate reward i loved the appreciation from the customers and i loved meeting interest to people because if you go to trader joe's you're always talking to people like the joke with trader joe's is that is the is the cashier flirting with you or not you go there to have social hour and i loved that aspect of it i loved meeting new people i loved feeling like i had a purpose every single day in a very acting in hollywood is very sporadic yes and you can be working on a series you know be a series regular and then they cancel the show you have no work or you might not work for yeah and i am a very i'm pretty habitual and i like knowing ex everyone is that's good not crazy well my suspicions are you're probably far less that way than most people yeah well because you take all sorts of risks and you able to tolerate you know a very dynamic life it's like people are creatures of habit like you can't possibly imagine and they go crazy way faster than you think if they habits are disrupted it's really hard on people we're pack animals mh right we like an orderly social environment we like a high degree of predictability and we like the same things at least a fair number of the same things happening on a regular and predictable daily schedule you know weekly monthly all of that otherwise the threads start to show yeah you think it was because i was experiencing such an extreme high and low cuz you are right because i do take risks i have been in very unconventional situations my whole life so i wonder i also think it might have been a again going back to family it was so turbulent it was so up and down but i think i i just needed some kind i had no structure there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to have to formulate a rationale for wanting some habitual predictability yeah right people they cannot function without that right mhm people think of anxiety as something inside their head that's not right you're anxious when everything around you is coming apart and so the anxiety is a reflection of that now you can find yourself in situations where your physiological state or your psychological state makes you overreact to uncertainty in the environment but generally for example when someone develops major depressive disorder it's in the aftermath of something truly awful yes like they just don't fall apart for no reason now having been broken once they may be more susceptible to being broken again in the future but it's not exactly a psychological problem and anxiety is not a psychological problem it's a navigation problem and you know you had complicated and mutable home life and your career was very complex and multi-dimensional the fact that you found a job that had this level of predictability and found that what would you say that offered you a certain degree of security that requires no explanation whatsoever yeah yeah well i loved it this is a good thing to know about kids too like you you want to routinize your children right they get up at the same time they eat at the same time they get read to at night at the same time like they need these little islands of stability then they can use those islands of stability as places to explore from but if they're in chaos all the time if you put your children in chaos all the time they will torture you to death and you deserve it for not setting them up with these predictable daily routines that's how they organize their those are the islands it's like at the beginning of time when the the the the the earth emerges from the primordial waters as these islands of stability that's what now allows people to plant their flag in the ground and to establish themselves it's a very good thing to know too about marriage is that you need routines and rituals they have to repeat because otherwise you don't know which way is up yeah yeah all right so tell me how you got involved with the daily wire finally we'll make it there during co i was i got involved in conservative media i would say in los angeles i lost a lot of friends at ucla because of my political beliefs i felt incredibly isolated not just from friends but campus life in general what conservative beliefs like what was it you know first of all one of the things i really have observed about the left and i do not believe that this is true of classic liberals or conservatives the left especially the radical types they will drop you in a moment if you say or do anything that's out of that ideological sn and that is not equally true of people corre on the liberal or the right side so the le they will cancel and exclude that's part of the entanglement of the radical left with cluster b psychopathology with narcissism with psychopathy with borderline personality disorder with antisocial behavior like that's all behavior that's associated with social exclusion it's very very aggressive like it's passive aggressive because it doesn't involve fists but social exclusion is a very effective form of punishment and the radicals on the left are masters at using it so what sort of views were you being i was not alienated yourself with so the first one was that i did not want to vote for biden in the primaries it was going to be my first time voting in a presidential election group of friends i was and how old were you' so like you were the one'-year-old female and i i walked into it's my favorite story from college i walked into a party at one of my best friend's apartments big rer happening and this is after i just had like a i wouldn't even call it a fight it was just kind of like a a reckoning in my friend group of they realized that i was not on their team and i had never considered myself republican i never considered myself i just didn't even think about it my family right so you weren't political up to no i was not my my family was always more on the right my mom studied under ein rand she was a libertarian my oldest brother who was one of the most important people in my life incredibly incredibly libertarians libertarian as you can get and my mom raised us based on values instead of politics she didn't talk about politics she didn't talk about current events but she talked about personal responsibility she talked about accountability one of the greatest things that she taught me sort of what you touched on when you were talking about anxiety being you know the mirror and something that's external is that you can only control your response to the circumstances in your life again that you are in control she valued freedom and independence and then the more political stuff was fiscal responsibility but we didn't even talk about that in terms of politics it was just you know we would sort of touch on taxation in my h school you know civics class so your mother really helped you with the understanding that you had some choices to make in your life and that you could make them well and then you emancipated yourself so that i sure made my choice yeah independence and this all really came to a head as covid was taking off did you finish your degree at ucla i did oh congratulations good for you you you stuck it out i did i did even though you took online courses mhm i did were any of your online courses worth taking yeah they were what percentage of them do you think oh gosh 60% but i i'm i'm a major english lit nerve like i loved english lit all throughout high school since the fifth grade i knew that i wanted to be an english major because i just again i love stories i love stories i love understanding the human condition through stories and i wanted to i wanted to study british literature and so i did it i did my final capstone on barnaby rudge by charles stickens and i've just i mean i was obsessed and so a lot of the classes i i made it through just because i number one i already knew my values i had a great foundation i wasn't easily deterred and i cared more about stories and i did have a few good professors actually the best and most common sense driven professor i ever had was at berkeley because i did a business program at berkeley's grad school and she was the most right-wing common sensical at berkeley at berkeley's grad school at the high school of business oh okay well you might find someone like that hiding in the business school and and she was fantastic how did you how did your professors respond to your essays and so forth at uca i the worst case of this was actually in my first semester at ucla so just a little bit of context so you know i know we keep getting off of the daily thing but you'll find this interesting you'll find this interesting i did community college for the first two years so i didn't go to university for all four and i think that was also a very important thing yeah right right right i believe that i got a better person at community yeah i went to community college for the first two years too and i got the best education in my life at community college my professors actually cared about teaching yeah and i had a personal relationship with them i loved them yeah because they were willing small classes yes and they wanted to be there because of the students and because they loved the subject not because they got the notoriety of being at ucla or because they got the the resources for their research or the book that they were writing and i think that i was much better off for it i would i would recommend it to anyone i saved so much money i think i got my full bachelor's for under $20,000 yeah because of that i got to explore so many subjects that i would have never gotten to expl you were still able to concentrate on the literature actually literature right so i studied that then came to ucla the my first semester at ucla i had to take one of those intersectional literature classes which actually since my leaving ucla they have i believe adapted their english literature department where now it is less about the miltons and the shakespeare and the bres and it's more about feminism through the you know bronte through the lens of feminism through what so wonderful at that when i was there you had to do bronte through the lens of resentful bitterness yes there you go that's or mak it even more enjoyable professors are morally superior to all the great artists of the past exactly that's basically but when i was there you only had to do one of those and it changed after i left i'm i'm just i think i got there the perfect time and so my first semester i did that class and it was race religion sexuality and asian-american literature and it was the one intersectional class available that semester and i just thought let me just get it out of the way and my final paper i don't remember what the book was but it was the story of a man who had immigrated here possibly from taiwan i believe and told his story of assimilating into american culture the struggle of being an immigrant alleged racism he was also gay and was dealing with that and what my professor came her conclusion from this novel was that he had faced racism and that was the he had endured racism and that was why he had all of these mental health struggles and the character was incredibly flawed you know incredibly depressed was just a terrible human being and the thing that she did not bring up or did not touch was that he was sexually assaulted halfway through the book and that's when all the behavior started so my take on it was i i argued that it was not necessarily racism i said i'm sure that he experienced some you know immigrating to america in the 70s however all of this behavior started after he was sexually assaulted and then he became depressed he was mentally ill where could you possibly go in the world that would be least less racist than california 1970s yeah right oh my god and and so that was my argument and i we had to give her our thesis statement prior to writing the essay and signed off on it she said sounds so interesting we had to go around the class read it out loud people would give notes on it that's really interesting when i got my paperb i think i got a d and i had never that was the first time that i had not gotten this sound so pompous i had never gotten anything other than an a on a paper before i was a 4.0 student i gotten a you know a b in my entry level statistics class my first year of community college other than that straight a i was crushed absolutely crushed and in the margins she had written i fundamentally disagree with your thesis and then all of her notes were she had a about the way that i had structured it but they were that your take on this novel is fundamentally wrong mh which how was a thing for a post is to say shattered my worldview about english literature and about the higher education system i was just like okay well i'm in for a treat for the next you know two years of my life and after that i was able to skate by i did not do any more of those intersectional classes my schedule i would give i would make myself wake up i lived off campus i would make myself wake up at 5:00 a.m. to beat the traffic to take a 8:00 a.m. class all the way across conservative value yeah get waking up in the morning to avoid doing classes like that why i would only do milton from this year to this year i would only dickens it was very very author focused and that was took a very proactive strategy yeah okay go it and because of that i loved it right well look one of one of the ways that it one of the things you have to do to be successful at university is to take an active role complely finding the professors and finding the courses you have to you have to search them out and once you have a good professor you need to stick with them and but you have to discover them you have to explore and job opportunities on top of that i think one thing that i've been ex just witnessing as i saw some friends that are graduating from college is that they are not being set up for career success whatsoever there's no push for internships there's no push for work i in that friend group where i got hit in the head i don't think i finished that story but i was hit in the head with a communist manifesto at a party oh yeah hit in the head like literally yeah when i walked into this party i know that was after my i'm not going to vote for biden yeah popped in the head th chucked at my face many people have been hit in the head by the communist manifesto i'm proud of it yeah where was i going with this oh but in that friend group i was the only one who had a job not just a trader joe's job they did not have internships in their junior year end like their third quarter junior year they got their first internship i had had an internship every single semester i was working i took that proactive stance right and colleges do not encourage it parents aren't encouraging it and so kids are going into this four-year environment thinking you know i'm going to go in you know $80,000 into debt i me you talk about it on twitter all the time and on your show that you know then you're popped out into the world you're in debt you have a meaningless degree and you have no job opportunity because yeah and my generation is entering the workforce later than any other generation ever has before mh it's just shocking so yes you do if you are going to go to college and i still am a lover of the liberal arts i still do love university i love that i went i love the things that i learned i love the essays that i wrote i'm such a nerd i you know i had my transcript up on the wall because i was so proud of it in high school like i just i truly love it but you have to be incredibly proactive it's not something that you can just passively skate through if you want to you know the marrow of it all right so let's talk about your current projects let's start with the podcast how did that set itself up i was doing social media for a couple of different political organizations young americans for liberty liberty prageru in los angeles which is where i really found community in the midst of co and blm and losing a lot of friends at ucla and foundation for economic education how did you run across prager's group they have an incredible student group called prager force and that at ucla no just generally yes i see and it's a online group and they have a facebook group and they have webinars that you can join and i was i think if you would asked me a year prior i would have been like i don't need that i don't want to go join like a zoom call with a bunch of you know like minded individuals or whatever because i didn't think i needed it but i was so alienated the world was shut down i was living in california there was nothing i could do i felt so alone and i was becoming more and more political by the day becoming much more aware of the world around me current events my value vales were transforming into something that was very tangible around me and i joined prager force i got to know other young people around the country around the world that had similar values and i got to know the people at prageru they knew that i was an actor they're also based in los angeles and they invited me into their offices and some we like to make videos for us it's like yes i have nothing else to do hollywood is shut down i'm bored out of my mind i want to do something that's meaningful and then i jumped from that to writing i did some economic journalism at foundation for economic education and did social media for them as well jumped to young americans for liberty running their tik tok and instagram accounts oh yeah oh yeah and and so i had a a growing i wouldn't say big because it's where compared to where i am now but i had a growing instagram presence just through tik toks and reals all short form and then i woke up one day and saw a dm from daily wire and they said hey we've been loving your content on instagram would you want that was what year that was 2021 2021 okay so it's three years ago now yeah yeah okay so you got a dm from who he was a producer at daily wi i see and she was like the social media video producer and she had been tasked with finding a couple of people that were doing well on social media young people and because they a member of their team who worked on the youtube channels he had the idea that we needed a youtube show and he was these were all people that were around my age and it was very very cool and i think a lot of people people look at my show and people that have critiqued me before and they imagine you know jeremy boring sitting in his glass office being like i need to get the youth like i what it was all this was like i'm going to create something for the young people it was all people my age they were sitting in the daily wire offices saying we need content for us we want something that we will watch that we relate to that is based on youtube that's based on the internet and so they tasked this video producer with finding some people that were already out in the world to doing that so i got a dm and they said would you be interested in launching a show with us as your business grows the workload can become overwhelming task that used to take a day now take a week if you're feeling this strain

overnight success and you certainly put in your 10 years and you said you'd accumulated all the social media experience and you'd said yes to a lot of things you said yes to prager you said yes to young americans for liberty etc you were and finally i almost said no to d wire uhuh i i was too scared because it felt like the big leagues like i had looked at daily wire i had applied for i had applied to be candace's assistant this was all during my graduating year like that spring i had applied to be cace's assistant i had applied to be a producer on ben show i had applied for some social media role i just i and then you got a bigger offer i got a bigger offer and i got i got no interviews for any of those roles and granted i was not really qualified for any of them and i i could have so what scared you about the daily wire offer it felt huge i felt like i wasn't ready and i also think weren i no and you know that's the good thing you just you know jump yeah well that's the thing you know when you make a status transition if it's a major transition you can't be ready when it first happens this is partly why faith is necessary in life hey because when you make a major transition first of all you don't know what you're in for you have no idea like maybe it'll work and maybe it won't but the evidence isn't there you know and then the next thing is well you don't necessarily know that you can do it why well you have haven't done it it's a new thing well so how else can you move forward in a situation like that except in faith you know and you said your mother helped you with this but that you had already learned that you could take tasks upon yourself and grow into them right and so you said even though even though you had done a lot of that that the daily wire offer intimidated you what was the offer exactly was it to start your own youtube channel yes it was to start the show okay and and how was that outlined like a number of times a week a full like the full-fledged it was not even so i i turned it down even before any of that i and obviously didn't fully turn it down but i didn't even want to send in an audition tape at first because they wanted me they knew that i had done short form videos and they said could you here's a couple of things that are going on in the world right now could you do a longer form reaction to this and just you know talk off the top of your head give your tap on culture yes mhm and i got so scared and i didn't even want to send in a tape and i think it was because i was out of practice taking risks for 10 years in hollywood i would audition four to five times a week i was told no 99% of the time and you have to be okay with that i would take huge risks i you know moved across the country writing a letter to that's why kids have to be allowed to fail that's why they have to lose in competitions they have to learn i lost a lot well well the thing is you know you you skipped over something there and you said you know when you went to all these auditions you've been successful but your your success rate was like 1% right well that's a lot of failure and most and most occupations are like that most like a job search is like that yes right if you do a comprehensive job search the probability that you'll get rejected for any given position is like above 90% yeah and so if you're not accustomed to that well what are you going to do you don't you think that you think the world is against you when the situation is actually that moving forward productively is rather unlikely and the default answer is generally no most jobs that are advertised for example don't even exist they have an internal candidate so you're not going to get that job that's posted for like technical reasons so they're going to say no to you it has nothing to do with you it has to do with base rate of rejection yes right the base rate of rejection in the world is very very high but it's not 100% right so you keep on plugging away and you have to be resilient enough to do that okay so how did you change your mind my mom yelled at me oh good good she did yeah and she said you were being an idiot and she said i don't care if you don't get this i don't care if you don't actually take the job later on but you are shooting yourself in the foot this opportunity does you know it's a once in a-lifetime opportunity and she said you've been trying to get in with the daily wire i had already seen what was talking about with what he wanted to do with creating a parallel to hollywood all of it i was completely bought in i watched matt and michael constantly they had just brought on candace i was just like i these are my people and i felt like i could learn a lot from them but then when this opportunity came around that was so big i went oh no no no no i teach you to ask for it yeah and no she yelled at me and i did it and it all and i also think what you were saying about humans needing routine and habit for my entire life like we've already outlined it's been up and down tumultuous for the first time at this point in my life i had normal s and structure and my mom had just bought a farm and i was living five minutes away from her i was working as a waitress at a really nice restaurant and i was doing these social media jobs i had gotten into law school i withdrew from law school because i decided i'm there's no reason for me to be a lawar i should not be a lawyer but i was going to i was wanting to plant down roots where i was and i where were you living i was in boy idaho this is a whole we don't need to spend that going that but yes and i thought this is where i just want to be i want to find a nice guy i want to get married i want to work in marketing i want to be near my mom and i had bought two horses that were on her farm i just want to live this is just normal and it's safe and i think for the first time it was just so comfortable and i didn't want to i didn't want to ruin that and she said this is not the time to be afraid this is not the time to be risk averse this is what you've been working for for 10 years and you get to be you know it's it's very common i see this i saw this a lot when i was working with people m people say no to what they want yeah right and they do that in micro ways right and then they do it now and then in major ways and then the opportunities dry up they do and they think why are there no opportunities coming my way it's like you have to say you have to be prepared for a lot of failure and you have to say yes enthusiastically whenever an opportunity makes itself present and then they multiply but boy it it's it's partly too because people actually they don't have faith that it's okay if good things happen to them right they don't feel that they're worthy of it and so you know and sometimes that's understandable it's not surprising that you were nervous about having to move from making short form content that's was it scripted the short form cont no okay so at least you had that i still had that and it and it was a physical move across the country it was leaving my mother who had in my rock through this entire career obviously my entire childhood moving across the country within two weeks right to as i to to nashville to nashville yeah yeah and again just work in the big leagues like i i i mean i walked in and just you know matt walsh walks by and i'm like you know this is somebody who i've looked up to it was incredibly intimidating i'm so i'm so glad that i do when i think about it too much it it just makes me want to cry because interesting in l and i was talked about this on a live stream at my wedding just a couple of weeks ago one of my bridesmaids gave a speech and she's been my friend for 11 years or so we were 15 we were at disneyland and she remembers a specific conversation where i said there's three things that i want in my life i want to be married i want to have a farm and i want to be successful at whatever i'm doing i want to have a successful career and at that time i thought that it was going to be you know a producer reese witherspoon esque running some kind of production company like that and so she stood up at our rehearsal dinner and she said you have just bought a farm i just bought you know 60 acres or something like that and i and you're now getting married tomorrow to an incredible man and you are successful and i think about if i had not taken that risk i might have i might have had the farm my mom had a farm a few minutes away it wouldn't have been mine it would have taken a long time to do that i might have married a really nice guy but it would not have been alex who i adore i just think he worship the ground he walks on he's incredible and i would not have this career now that is so perfectly harmonious with everything that i loved about hollywood i loved telling stories i loved being on camera i loved reaching people through media while also being true to myself and not compromising my values it is perfectly harmonious so your channel grew like mad crazy yeah yeah had a million subscribers in five months right and you're up to about 4 4.3 something like that now on youtube two years right right right so obviously you could do it yeah right right so that's well so that's extremely interesting and i will say and it wasn't i think that we found an important niche and but i also do believe as you said i did put in the time yeah yeah i had 10 years and so i think it's a combination of that and i all will often discredit preparation and opportunity like they have to m m then and then you have to strike when the iron is hot right i mean timing is crucial and you had this opportunity and you did take it what are you doing why is what you're doing working and why did it start working so quickly what do you think like you're very upbeat you're very enthusiastic you're you so you've got the charisma that goes along with that what why don't you characterize a typical show and and why don't you walk me through why you think it works i think it works because like you said i do approach things with a positive attitude i think a lot of content online right now is incredibly angry especially things that are you know i don't want to just say political but also cultural cultural commentary it's very angry it's very intense yeah and with my personality i think i have been able and my sense of humor and my levity and the fact that i you know i take myself my work very seriously but but you know i i can laugh at anything i think that if you're not laughing about something you're crying about it so you might as well find humor and i think that humor is an incredibly important way to reach people i think that is something that my show does really really well and it's the kind of show that i would want to watch and kind of like i said at the beginning when we sat down this is something i did not have i knew that this needed to exist because i would look around and i like i've said like you know i watched your youtube videos i would watch michael i would watch ben debate you know i have you know his his line about you know in that debate i don't remember where it was might have been uc santa barbara or something where you know that kid said well how do you know that girls can't be in boy scouts he's like it's in the name like i i watched all of those i was constantly consuming that i didn't see myself represented and it's weird for me to say that because i will often critique hollywood always saying you need to be represented you need to be represented but in this case i do believe that it was important because i did not see well that you occupied that look there's two ways of looking at that you can whine and complain about the victimization or you can see that that's a market opportunity because the n hasn't been filled right well the social media landscape is pretty new it's not surprising that all the niches aren't filled yeah and so you filled and this is why i compared you a bit to candice earlier is that you filled a relatively rare niche which is young female conservative commentators right who are entertaining right and engaging well you know that that's a lot of combinations of that's a lot of rare traits combined and i also think on more on the right whether you're a libertarian or conservative or classical liberal the women that i saw were either and this is not talking down to any of them whatsoever it just wasn't me i either saw you know the trump intern type girls and their pencil skirts the dc you know politicos right or i saw you know the hunter creative conservative those are very rare creatures i saw like the outdoorsy hunters i think that they're amazing but that wasn't like i i was in a weird box where i just felt like i'm a normal i'm a normal girl and why why do i not have anybody to watch that sharing my values that has a take on things that i can relate to that i feel like i'm i don't like i'm not crazy for the things that i believe and so i think that is one of the primary reasons why it just took off immediately because young people well you hit you hit the target i did right there was a gap there and yeah yeah and i think you know again the humor and my personality and i i really i care about it and i care about my audience a lot i i like genuinely care about them i genuinely want to make good content for them when i meet them and yeah that's really important it is and i because i see myself in them and i still do i don't look at them as like oh you were me a few years ago like i am creating things that if i wasn't doing this i would want to be watching and i would want somebody to care about me how's the daily wire being to work with in that regard incredible yeah i've had the same experience yeah they there's two things they do for me mh the first is they leave me the hell alone yeah well the thing is if you hire someone who's on a journey let's say a creative journey and you box them in yeah then that's the end of them right i struggled with this continually at the university as it degenerated because i love my job i love doing research i love being a professor i very much enjoyed being a clinician but i wanted to be left alone so i could do it at minimum at minimum just don't get in my way when i'm doing the job you hired me to do like that's the minimum requirement there's another requirement too which is well how about i bring you a creative idea and you jump on board and one of the things that's really characterized my relationship with the daily wire is that they've said yes to preposterous projects and like right away and back them they did that with the exodus seminar i did which is very high-risk a very high-risk project we did a gospel seminar and a western civilization project these were complex projects they whipped them up very quickly very very quickly it was stunning and they not only did they greenlight them almost immediately and then we went ahead with them right away but they also edited them extremely professionally produced them extremely professionally and did that all rapidly too and enthusiastically so we're in a fortunate position with that car because we're in a growth phase of that enterprise and they're you know they're they as far as i can tell not only do they put their money where their mouth is but the people there are fully and enthusiastically and non-rent and efficiently on board and so that's that's very very helpful even when they don't completely understand it they're on board i mean just from the beginning i sat in a meeting with jeremy and caleb and the whole team and we pitched comment section and we we had produced a pilot and the marketing team and the social media team was developing it they brought me in i could have been fired at any moment if they had not green li the show my job would have been a i had nothing else to do not my show would have been next i would have been next sat in this meeting with jeremy we played the pilot and he got through we watched all three you know looking back on it it's terrible terrible pilot but he looked over at me he was silent in his normal jeremy way contemplating things and looked at me and he said i don't understand this show but i know other people will and i think you know he was willing to take that risk on me i would when they hired me i was 19 years old right yeah i just graduated college oh it's no wonder you were nervous you should be nervous nervous yes u i was 19 they were giving me you know all i wouldn't say they were giving me a platform they were helping me with a platform but we were starting with zero they gave me resources an incredible team yeah and they took a chance yeah definitely and even when jeremy watched it he said i this show is not for me like i don't get the memes i don't understand the tik toks that you're talking about the lingo you're using but i know it's important because i know he confidence to to allow people to generate autonomous projects yeah yeah which is also the hallmark of a confident and creative manager and also something that makes that that group a pleasure to work with like a genuine pleasure to work with let's talk about your other projects as well so we're circling back into hollywood four years later okay so you have you have mr burum yes depend dragon cycle and snow white and the evil queen right so is that a good order to discuss them in they are yes so let's start with mr mr bertram is coming out very soon and what is that mr beram is an animated comedy here's a look at the trailer for mr burum when i was a kid men were men now everyone's wrapped up in fiing real men stuff feelings down with red meat cigarettes and violence you and the geriatric girl scouts will be bassed out in an hour burum bur mr bur b b richard buram let the record show him a dick watch mr burum an all neww animated series from daily wire plus now streaming it is inspired by a character that adam cora has been doing on his radio show for years he's a this a series a tv series tv series yeah it is you know he is a cogy shop teacher that is like wood shop teacher in schools who is incredibly traditional incredibly you know everything he does is tangible it is about as traditional as you can get working with you know tools and wood and he's watching as the world just changes around him as things get more technologically advanced as the world gets more progressive as the school is trying to push him out yeah saying your job is not as important and so it follows his and what role do you play daughter i see i see and and what what's the character of his daughter she's incredibly it actually reminds me a lot of myself she's incredibly precocious very smart very close with her father and who's who's the target market for it i think the target market is people that have felt abandoned by comedy who watch you know animated tv shows who adult is it an adult ser adult adult series adult okay and who are wanting comedy that is truthful that is not afraid to pull punches that i think that the common man will relate to it has some sat i wouldn't say that it is satire but it has many satirical elements to it it's the writing is incredible they brought me on and i didn't really know what to expect and i had done voiceover a lot but had not done it in a few years and that's always interesting because it you you know i we recorded this whole series i play a very significant role in it have not met met adam yet i have not you know megan kelly plays my mother in it yeah i have never met megan yet i'm meeting her next week for the first time but you record all of this complet powerful force she is yeah yeah and she's done she's done extremely well on her own yeah yeah so you know two thumbs up for her yes yeah we brought her in for that and but you record it all remote and so i only got to see bits and pieces of it i knew that the scripts were fantastic and then i started to sort of see the when does it launch it launches this month oh it does yeah okay and that's on the daily wire that'll be on daily wire okay let's talk about the pen dragon cycle yes so i that's a huge enterprise for daily wire they poured a tremendous amount of resources into it it's the biggest swing we've ever taken yeah yeah jeremy ever so walk through it i talked to jeremy a bit about it on my podcast but let's hear it from your perspective so pen dragon cycle and i'm sure jeremy told you this it is his favorite book series yeah from the beginning i mean he has wanted to create this tv show for 30 plus years this is something he's thought about dreamed about has physically written scripts for and it was finally the time when we had the resources it was the cultural moment he was able to step away to direct a majority of it he was the showrunner he produced it he wrote a significant portion of it this truly is his i mean i can't speak for him but in speaking with him while we were there and seeing him work this is probably the most important thing that he's ever done mh and we went to hungary i was there for 5 months he was there for seven months and i was the were you recording your podcast during that well yeah yeah yeah so we i was the only daily wire host that is in the show what role did you play i play merlin's wife so it is an auan legacy the tale of and and it follows the rise of christianity through the lens of an aruan like not speaking right not legacy and so i play marlin's wife and she is she a good wife or very she's a very good wife she's a good she's a good character she is yes she's a very very fun character to play she is she has a really beautiful balance of being incredibly strong but also being very feminine and very empathetic and very sympathetic for to or's very unique experiences and it was it was just a very very fun character to play and i saw a lot of myself and her i got to do stunts that i've never done before it was amazing it was fantastic it was a lot it was very very hard work because how long did you do it for five months so right and how many how many hours were were fil you know for the for the final series any idea what's going to come out of it i have no idea yet and i know that they'll probably like they'll have a first edit and then they'll cut it down kind ofu have you seen any of the edits i haven't yet jerem protected and when is it supposed to be when is that supposed to launch i'm not sure yet okay yeah they're in full postproduction now i think that there is already a first round of edits that is finished and now they're we have so much vfx that that is going to go into this so many vfx there's just a lot of post-production that has to be done but the very cool thing is even though we are using some vfx we did 90% of everything that you will see on the screen practically we physically did it all there was a the series starts with an incredible sequence with spanish bull leapers and they were physically jumping over these blls one of my best friends who played the lead in pend dragon rose reed she was in the arena with these bulls she trained for months to be able to look like one of these bull leapers she was having to navigate around the bulls i was on horseback with a spear jumping over streams you know chasing a boar we were physically fighting if there was an explosion that you see on screen we felt the fire there's a scene where i'm you know running through putting out a fire i was basically you covered in fire protection which is like a goop that you put on so that you can't be set on fire running through fire as people were being fully set on fire on it was absolutely incredible there was i mean they did not hold back good thing you said yes to the daily we kidding and it's also it's very special because it's very full circle because i get to go back back and do what i love more than anything which tell stories but i get to do it with people who i love and trust who i know are not exploiting me as a child actor who share my values and are genuinely creating content for the betterment of other people right well that's a good deal it is because i i would read scripts that i would be sent in hollywood and i would i would look at it i say i i don't want to watch this like these are terrible characters they're sharing terrible messages i don't even want to to be a vessel through which this gets out to the public right right and i knew that it again and you had you didn't have that feeling with the pen dragon it's an incredible story i haven't had that feeling with anything that i've done with say i think mr burum is incredible i can stand by behind that completely the pen dragon cycle is a perfect mix of something that is meaningful in terms of its values and what it promotes and the values of the characters that you will fall in love with while also being something that is beautiful and that people objectively can enjoy you're not going to sit down and say oh i'm watching you know i'm watching a christian tv show you're going to enjoy it because it actually is very good but you can know that the people who made it the hours that were put in i mean jeremy barely slept for seven months but i've also never seen him happier because this was yeah i gained massive respect for him watching this take place and he did it masterfully and so you can feel good watching that and it's incredible being an actor in that environment and being a vessel because you really are a vessel you go there you stand and you mold yourself to the character and you lose a lot of yourself in doing that if you hate the project and if you hate the character you're playing but if you're able to love the character if you're able to love the production and the story you're telling it makes it so much more meaningful and you feel like you're actually part of something that can impact audiences can impact the culture in a really important way so let's talk about let's close with snow and the evil queen so you were picked to play snow white yes yeah once upon a [music] time in time a prince would [music] come once upon a time but now that time time is [music] gone so we announced it when we announced bent key which is our children's division and i think a lot of people assume that we had already filmed the movie when we we released the trailer it was very backwards we did not do that i was we were we were maybe a week into filming pen dragon and i get a text from jeremy he just goes where are you like i'm at my apartment and he says i need you to meet me at the prey can you be here in five minutes and that was maybe an8 minute walk like yes so if you d me ask anything you say yes i'll be there sprint out of the apartment i get to the lobby of the pre i sit down and he says we want to do something that could be it might be impossible and this was at the time that every it was during the sag strike but everything was going viral about disney snow white everything disney perversion of the social order and the demolition of the narrative what of the traditional narrative let's just rewrite this be great every time oh yeah yeah we'll we'll improve it yeah yeah these so secret gay agenda and so that was in the middle of all of this happening and i had obviously been following it i had done episodes about it no the gay agenda is a mask it's just a destructive agenda it is it's just a de it's a demolition agenda with all traditional values we're pro inclusion that's the mask that's the mask that's so that if you attack it you sound like a bigot yeah then you can it's their their wall yeah no no we're just bringing in the marginalized it's like yeah wait till you invite the real monsters out from underneath the rocks you and you bringing in the marginalized we're starting to see that happen already yeah yeah the maps the maps oh no there's worse monsters than them right no no no no matter how bad there's no limit to what people are capable of doing right and so as you see one extreme emerge you can be absolutely 100% sure that that new margin has a multiplicity of more extreme margins on its fridge and there's no end to that well the end is that everything collapses that's that's how this has happened historically yes so okay so snow white where where are you where where where are you with this project we are in pre-production you went to see jeremy and he oh yes so i went to see jeremy and this was as everything with snow white was happening and people were very disappointed very upset about the way that disney was rolling out this project the way that they were they pick such a fun actress too it was and you know i i'm you've now heard me speak for i don't know how many hours we've been talking but about my love of literature and stories and i grew up reading classic literature i grew up reading the traditional stories i grew up reading grims and i love the stories underneath these fairy tales and so as somebody who is more traditional and has a love and appreciation for stories it's very it's sad to watch these stories be completely destructed for that agenda and so i had been watching this and commenting on it and so jeremy brings me in say luckily that luckily they fail they do because they're dull and and preachy and and obvious and transgressive in the in the in the casual manner not in the creative manner right yeah jeremy said we want to do the impossible and we want to we want to do our own snow white and we want to do it in line with the values with which it was written we want to honor the story and we want you to play snow white and jeremy had been watching no audition well i think my audition had been the first month of pen dragon i understand your audition but i but he hadn't even really seen me act before that he had you know watched my tv shows and that kind of thing but he really saw me during pen dragon uhhuh right right and so this was about a month into pen dragon or so and he said i'm going to keep you updated working on a script and at that time i think he had a very ambitious goal because that's when so might was still going to be released right around this time he was like let's try to film it during pen dragon and i was like okay well we'll see how this goes that did not happen and i'm very glad that it didn't because i think we will do the story justice justice yes with the the right amount of time in the prep and we got back from no actually i'm skipping over the story of how we created the trailer but jeremy started working on music and he had this idea for the trailer knew that we were going to be announcing the roll out of beny and you know the hundred episodes of children's content that we had on the platform he wanted snow white and the evil queen to be the first feature film that we do on beny and so i got a call probably at 4:00 and in the afternoon and he said i want you to fly to trento italy tomorrow because that's where we had been filming pen dragon that week we jumped back and forth between italy and hungry i want you to get on a plane and you're going to fly out and we have a costume that's being worked on for you they're going to finish it in the next six hours on the plane with you and you're going to fly out to trento drive you're fly into milan drive four hours up to trentino wake up the next morning you're going to come up onto a mountain another hour of drive and then stand in this forest and sing and jar was sending me oh gosh i still have the recordings on my phone one day i'll leak them to the public but it's jeremy on his on a piano app on his phone and it's what you hear in the trailer and he's singing it he has an amazing voice and he's incredibly musician and so he sent me the lyrics he sent me the song and he said can you have this ready by tomorrow i said sure and this man he i have never had to sing this high before and i'm a soprano but i'm not that soprano i texted m jeremy was not going to you know i sound like tweety bird and so we went back and forth and he sent me one in a lower octave i said this is much better and he was all nervous he was going the breath this sounds really low meanwhile i'm thinking this is still really high so i get up to italy we record it we we record it in the middle of shooting pen dragon so in the middle of a scene some of my other pen dragon cast is six feet away and at this point they don't even know we're doing so much because it has not been announced to anyone jeremy said do not tell your mom do not tell alex do not tell anybody we have like three people who know that this is happening nobody can know so i'm sitting here in this princess dress thinking this is really not the wardrobe that everybody else is wearing they're going to know i'm like huddled up literally hidden the rest of the cast is over doing something else jeremy says hey we're going to film a little commercial for a daily wire thing that we have to do gets the crew to turn around points the cameras on me and we film this teaser and then i fly back to budapest and i keep going on comment section and keep going on pendragon and then i wait to hear what we're going to do with it and then it launches with beny with a beny roll out it's huge success and then i keep i just sit and i wait i'm like all right jeremy when are we going to film this got back to nashville we wrapped pen dragon it was a raging success i truly think people are going to love the series and then we've now rolled into pre-production for snow white and evil queen so i'm in voice lessons you know three to four times a week i was classically trained as a singer when i was young but i moved more into pop when i was older and have not sung seriously in many years and so i'm retraining that muscle i'm in dance classes every week it's a musical we're super excited about it and that's what i can tell you and there's a lot of people that i see comments every single day and they're like what can you tell us about x y and z it's all coming soon we'll be able to share more soon but it is an incredible adventure and it's just always a joy and an honor to collaborate with jeremy specifically i mean he's incredibly creative he takes incredible risks i think i've learned i i've learned even more about risk-taking by working for him and working with him that was one thing that i felt incredibly comfortable with and excited about when i came to nashville and i came to da wire was i could not have asked for better mentors in the people that i'm surrounded with i mean i again i told you i i got this shob when i was 19 and i walk into a room and i was you know with jeremy boring and dallas son who was one of the you know greatest producers to come out of hollywood in recent years has just an incredible story michael ns matt walsh ben you know can i mean just you i mean just the fact that i remember meeting you when we were about to announce that you were joining daily wire and you were doing a photo shoot and i was in my studio and i think you would ask could i meet the youtube girl and i about just like fell out of my chair but i'm i just could not have asked for a better group of people and i you know they encourage me i grow every single day not just in my career but i learned from all of you you know emotionally and spiritually and in my personal life and that's just an incredible incredible gift typical hollywood story all right well look that's a good place to stop this part of the discussion i think what we'll do for everyone watching and listening i think what we'll do on the daily wi side is talk about women sounds great y because we haven't done that and marriage because you're newly married and the well the conception the conception of women in the modern world as it is and perhaps how it might be if it was tilted in let's say a more conservative direction and what attraction there might be in that and what obstacles there are in the way of communicating that to young women so that's what we'll do for half an hour on the daily wire side if you who are watching and listening want to continue to join us that also enables you to throw some support the daily wire way which well if you're happy with the state of the world then there's not much point doing that but if you think that things are a little unstable and that some additional voices on the side of something approximating tradition and reason might be useful well you know they're fighting a pretty good they're putting up a pretty good scrap and so and so also to all of you who are watching and listening thank you very much for your time and attention it's always much appreciated and hopefully never taken for granted and to the film crew here in scottdale arizona which is where i am today with brett and brett thank you very much for coming in today to do this it's a pleasure to talk to you you're very entertaining character and congratulations on having enough daring to to play the fool thank you yeah no kidding well seriously yeah you know it takes a lot of daring to throw yourself over the edge it's true yeah yeah happy to be here y all right everyone [music]
