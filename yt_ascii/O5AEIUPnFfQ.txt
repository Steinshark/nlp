[music] help me [music] hello hello there we are welcome to this glorious hotel room i'm gonna keep this intro short because it's been a really long day and we're in the middle of production on a really exciting dock and there's going to be a ton of bts content coming not going to give any more away than that but recently i got a job where i was able to bring dui who is my 2023 mentorship student along as a production assistant and he shot a lot of behind the scenes content as he went try to look at the footage and it seemed pretty cool so i thought i'd put it together and give you guys a look at you know a day in the life of a documentary cinematographer this isn't like a hardcore documentary subject this is a sort of calmer branded content slash docu style gig but it was still really cool really great subject matter and the basic processes processes whatever that is are the same so yeah enjoy day in the life video let me know if you like things like this there's a bunch more bts content coming and for now i'm gonna get to sleep because we have to be up at 2 45. see ya [music] [applause] this car was like one of those things where as i was buying it i was like are you a loser for buying this and then i use it all the time okay and then big green i think this park has probably gotten more use per dollar than any other thing i own you got everything probably not yeah we've got the camera we've got the audio i always forget something but we've got a charger we've got batteries i think we're good let's roll [music] welcome so let's slowest and creepiest elevator [music] i swear it's always this is [music] [music] welcome [music] [music] thank you [music] rich if i go crazy tomorrow looking for the reflector it's in the easy right back i i brought one [music] all right so we made it not too far of a drive we're finally here in victoria the very first thing we got to do is get the camera built because it's a super early call time tomorrow and we don't want to be any surprises so we're going to get the camera out of the bag set everything up and test it and then we'll run through really quick what's in all the rest of this stuff foreign so if you're ever building a cinema camera if you're renting a big package like this i think it's always way easier to do it on a tripod i didn't always do this when i started and i would just like lay it out on the floor on a bed but i don't know maybe it's obviously everyone else but i didn't do it for a long time but if it were me i'd build it on a tripod every time foreign [music] it's everything the camera is built turn it on make sure it works seems to be working so i always wheel this huge card of bags around and i think people always want to know like people love kira i love gear i'm a huge gear nerd so generally i bring all the same stuff on a shoot it's not a ton but it's also a fair bit so really quickly i'll go through the different bags i have this is a pretty normal shoot for me so it should give you a good idea of what i would do on a smallish production i've also been on a lot of really big shoots where we've flown with like 75 pelican cases but that's not what we're doing here quite a small production just a three-person team and this is what i would bring so the first thing is this old manfrotto bag it's not a good bag don't buy one of these but it was one of the first camera bags i ever bought and i just use it to transport the actual cinema rig itself so i'll break down the camera and everything that goes into running the camera from the handle to the microphone to the body itself and the extension handles everything that you need to actually go out and shoot i'll have in this bag so the camera's actually already out of the bag and built so there's not really too much to see in here so yeah i'll just get this out of the way and then move on to the next bag this guy this is an f-stop lopa i always want to say tilapia like the fish but i'm pretty sure it's talopa i feel like it's got the best balance between holding quite a bit of stuff everything that i would normally need as a one-man shooter i can put a drone in the top it can hold all my lenses and batteries and it's also extremely comfortable as a hiking backpack so i've climbed mountains on this i've used it to shoot two different seasons of the loan the survival show and here is what i would consider like my shooting backpack so this is all the stuff that i'm gonna go to regularly over the course of the day so in here i've got extra v-mount batteries this is a pretty straightforward shoot so we don't need any long lenses so i just have this 50 to 135 which is the partner to the' to 55 fujinon that's on the camera already i can pretty much do any shoe with just these two lenses i mean they cover everything from' to 135 so having the manual f-stops and the really smooth cinema gears they're just great to use because we're doing some interviews tomorrow as well there's also a big set of primes or a full set of primes i should say i've got a 24 35 a 50 and an 85. shooting on primes is a great look generally unless i'm really in control of the situation and i really can control the action i'll try and do it on zooms especially since there's only one camera here like as a solo operator if i miss the shot there's no second angle to catch it so primes are great and i love the look but it's also a risk you can miss something and since this is a job for other people i'd rather give up those extra stops of light just to make sure that i can cover a much quicker range or a much bigger range faster other than that i have this giant battery made by omnicharge i think this is the ultimate plus us this one is too big to fly with but we drove here so it's perfect you can recharge a couple of e-mounts you can recharge your computer a few times it can power four drone batteries i don't know it charges a bunch of stuff and it's pretty small it fits in this backpack so it's a great thing to have on standby got a card reader and that's it so that's the shooting bag one thing you might notice there in case it triggered any of your add is that i am terrible with lens caps i just always lose them and they're never on so if that's if that's triggering to you i'm really sorry but i'm a mess sometimes in that way let's move on to definitely the worst bag of them all to carry there's no comfortable way to carry this i call it the widowmaker a lot of the time it is just full of anything long and odd shaped this is where the tripod comes in i've got light stands these things are the matthews reverse stand and these are as far as i found the best sort of travel light stands out there because they can hold like these are strong enough to hold aputure 300d with a light box but they fold down pretty small so these are super useful i've got four of them got some electrical stuff extension cords and i've got a couple of two foot light tubes which are pretty useful we've also got a this thing is really cool godox sent me this this is a fl 150r this is a meter and a half wide led panel it's bi-color and lastly this is an audio boom pole for the sit-down interview with a longer xlr cable to connect to the back of the camera and a shock mount so once we actually film the interview tomorrow and you'll see how we set it up you'll notice that i'll use this boom pole to get the shotgun mic as close as i can to the person's face so what else last thing in here are these road rags these are basically like travel flags they're there's some silks there's cutters and there's a hard black piece of duvetine and two scrims as well in here there are five i think two foot by three foot light modifiers and they fold down in this tiny package so super useful to have all right so that's it for this horrible green duffel bag this is always the worst bag of everything here to carry it's the hardest one to pack it is so terrible but i desperately need it so it comes on every shoe with me as well all right next we have the like quintessential piece of filmmaking gear the pelican case covered in stickers i don't know if it gets any more cliche than that but i saw a bunch of people doing it when i was starting out my career so i just did the same thing now i've got a pelican case covered in stickers in here is where i keep a lot of miscellaneous stuff but a lot of grip related things but also some fragile things if i had a ronin or like a drone that needed to be packed into a plane i'd probably put it in here so next thing in here is this disaster of a bag this is sort of my all-in-one grip equipment so there's like a clamps and made for clamps all sorts of grip stuff so magic arms whatever you might need to attach something to something else or hang something off of something it all sort of goes into this little bag next is this giant roll of tape all different sizes gaffer tape two inch and one inch and super importantly paper tape as well people love gaff tape and it's really synonymous with the film industry but if you put gaffer tape on a wall or something fragile it will destroy it so don't put gaffer tape on sensitive things use paper tape instead this is just a giant translucent shower curtain from amazon i think it costs nine bucks or something i've had it for six years i've talked about shower curtains on this channel a bunch of times but just a giant piece of diffusion you can hang this in front of a light you can tape it over a window to make it a softer source it's really cheap impossible to damage and totally worth bringing along and then last thing is probably the nerdiest thing that i own but one of the things that i love the most is collapsible stool if you ever tried to do interview setups in the middle of nowhere know how hard it can be to find chairs when you can just whip out a stool in the middle of the desert or the jungle you look kind of like a boss and also a huge torque but i'll let you decide which one it is okay that's it for grip almost through it all this is i forget what model it is a think tank roller bag of some sort i think tank bags are really big in the photo community they are really well built super expensive and probably overpriced but they are incredible build quality and i absolutely love this thing i use this suitcase more like an admin bag i guess it holds a lot of odds and ends really that are a little bit more a little bit too delicate to go into the pelicans so things like the map box some square filters for the matte box some nd extra nd if i need it extra xlr cable i've got my ac pouch which has made an entire separate video on that if you want to go i'll ask the editor to link it somewhere up there battery charger for the v-mounts magic arms these things are super cool also in the top card reader extra xlr cable extra sdi cable redundancies of everything so if your audio cables go out or your video feed your sdi cable dies always got to have a backup because you can tell the client or the editor or whoever you're working for all the excuses in the world why something didn't work but they don't care they weren't here they're not going to see the stress you were going through all they're going to know is that you didn't give them what they asked for so save yourself a bunch of heartache down the road and get backups of all those fundamental cables that you need to keep the camera going that's pretty much all of the bags full of stuff the last things on the cart are this easy rig if you don't know what an easy rig is it's basically one of those vests you've probably seen on tv with the big arm coming and the camera hangs out in front of you you'll probably see me using it tomorrow a lot of misconceptions people think this thing is for stabilizing footage like it's a gimbal or something it's not at all actually if you don't use it well the easy way can way worse than just hand holding the camera the main point of the easy rig is to save the camera person's back and shoulders so it distributes all the weight and then the last things on the card are this bigger light stand that didn't fit anywhere else this is where the key light goes even though i said the the matthew stands can hold the 300d it's right on the edge so since we're driving and i have access to a car use the beefier stand just makes me feel a little bit safer umbrellas incredibly handy for filmmaking soft box for the 300d then we've got two lights two more lights got the aputure 300d which is my key light for almost everything and then this small rig 120d they have exactly the same name as each other's products so that is going to be probably a fill light that will use to bounce off something so pretty standard we've got three lights on this or three main lights two smaller lights two tube lights and then grip gear to run everything so that's that's it that's pretty much everything i bring i don't have like a drone or a gimbal you know i didn't bring everything i own on this shoot and i can make this even more complicated but for what we're doing tomorrow i can't actually talk about what we're doing so i'm going to keep everything really vague this is about showing you the process i'm just going to call it the job or whatever for the for the next day but for what we're doing tomorrow this is going to get us through it okay so we've gone through all the gear i'm here with richard this is the producer camera assistant slash general wizard for the day we're just going to quickly go over the schedule tomorrow and the shot list and make sure everyone's on the same page because it's going to be like a 6 30 a.m start so the more we can work out now i think the happier we'll be in the morning when our brains aren't working so we get in 8 a.m arrival we're getting there much earlier but then there's like shots of the app but i guess it's people these must be using portraits so yeah all right let's start the baggage train foreign [applause] vibes we're actually going to be able to see the light until quite a bit later yeah yeah that's all they want very roughly 35. so we just got to this location we rented it for the day to shoot some interviews and a little bit of b-roll and the main component for the morning is an interview so we're just trying to figure out the best place to shoot it i'm gonna spend the next we've got an hour and a half to set this up so we'll find something but this is always the fun part of the day when you show up to do location you've never been to and trying to figure out how to make it look like something when it's actually just a random apartment that you rented for the day so wish us luck here we go [music] so i'm setting up an aperture 300d just as a key light i'm gonna set up has a very rough position here [music] foreign [music] [applause] [music] [music] okay so we've got everything set up for the most part we're just waiting for the interview subject to arrive i feel like with interview setups like this you can tinker with them indefinitely but we are out of time so at some point you just have to balance what you can do with the amount of time you have to set it up i think it looks pretty good and now we're going to do a few last minute tweaks and then she'll show up we'll shoot the interview and then get on with the rest of the day and they told you it's really sound biting right so we want to try and keep the answers as compact and as close to one-liners as possible [music] foreign [music] [music] together [music] [applause] [music] all right so we just wrapped it's been about 12 hours since we started everyone's pretty tired so we just need to tear down this stuff as quickly as possible and make the last ferry off of vancouver island so we can get home and don't get stranded here for the night i hope that was interesting to see a bit of a day in the life of of how i shoot this isn't really what i normally do this is kind of a smaller branded content slash mini dock normally i'm working on bigger shows with a lot bigger crews but it's really hard to bring a bts camera on something like that so this is the best i can do for now i hope it was interesting that was a pretty smooth shoot overall it was a lot of work there was a lot of stuff to get through but we got through all of it and i think everyone's going to be happy with the finished product hopefully in the future i can make more videos like this bringing on to bigger sets but for now that was the day in the life of a documentary cinematographer sound down [music]
