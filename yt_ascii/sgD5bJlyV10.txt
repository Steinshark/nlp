today now let's get back to the video thanks sponsored gotham my friends this was not planned i was not trying to have the better help sponsor on a video about magnus carlson losing a chess game but let's jump into it magnus began with e4 his opponent for this game yet another indian it is seven games of action that he has played in qatar and six of these games have been against indian players the odd one out is a grandmaster from kazakhstan named alisher sulov and alisher defeated magnus in that game in the second round of this event so the 20s somethings the teenagers the next generation is coming and it really for those of you that are uninitiated to the world of chess this is a very rare occurrence that 2840 number one is playing 25 and 2600s every single day normally top events in chess are closed events to the top 10 players so it creates this bubble and the 25 and 2600s like murali for example they they don't get a chance to play against some of these players and get their rating points so morali starts with e5 we have knight f3 knight c6 and bishop to b5 5 this is the spanish the other day we saw magnus play this on the black side morali plays a6 bishop to a4 knight f6 attacking the pawn in the center and now magnus plays knight c3 that is a rare move knight c3 is a is a pretty big sideline generally white is playing castles here or if white wants to get exotic white is going to play pawn to d3 defending the pawn in the center and then kind of mobilize these these pieces a little bit later the mo knight c3 is is a is a very very rare move and the reason for that is this knight doesn't belong on c3 obviously it's completely fine and the position is equal but the point is that white wants to play c3 and d4 right so now the bishop is stuck so the bishop is going to get chased and potentially taken which is not really what white normally wants and white doesn't get to play c3 d4 does magnus not know how to play the ru lopez no that's not that's not the point he's playing a sideline black plays b5 you notice he spent about two minutes and then after bishop to b3 he plays bishop c5 this setup in the spanish with b5 and bishop c5 as opposed to the traditional spanish which let's say is castles bishop e7 rook e one like the bishop is here this is the clos spanish when you put the pawn on b5 and the bishop on c5 more aggressively this is known as the archangel the archangel variation of the r lopez it's a first of all gangster name like archangel is just a super cool name for anything you could name your kid archangel like if i named my kid archangel their their full legal name would be archangel gotham chess rosman because those names are on my passport knight d5 played by magnus and now we are actually really seeing the idea of the knight on b1 the knight on b1 is like an eagle taking flight after the the mcgregor khabib fight to try to get to dylan danis and the conor mcgregor team when he jumped over the cage if you don't know what i'm talking about finish this video go watch that super cool stuff don't condone violence but that was very fun to watch we're taking flight here to d5 and then we're going to play c3 and d4 that is what magnus is trying to do morali plays d6 spends 10 minutes clearly uncomfortable right i mean you don't spend 10 minutes on the seventh move of the game if you have it already memorized so already a pretty major moment in this game where magus has come with an opening surprise and we're going to see if murali can respond he plays d6 magnus plays c3 he's trying to play d4 and we have bishop e6 another 13 minutes spent all right so if you're going to play like this your light sores are going to be very weak if you're going to play like this that means you're going to get rid of your light squared bishop probably so magnus now can castle but black's idea here is that after here i imagine he will take and try to go after this pawn then magnus might play d4 pawn takes and pawn takes and you got to kind of fight these double pawns it's not really clear who this benefits i mean i know stockfish very confidently says white is better but i'm not sure that's the end of the story in any case magnus plays d4 in 7 minutes so this move probably took them out of prep and now magnus has to consider either this or this or he has to consider the lobster it's a it's a book reference i don't read but my wife does so i don't read not out of choice i just don't have the attention span i'm always on my phone but i did recently read trevor noah's life story memoir that was born a crime highly recommended great book d4 pawn takes pawn takes now if morali moves his bishop like let's say to a7 he will lose the game knight takes queen takes fork shockingly he does not do that if he did he might need to enroll in better help knight e7 now something might confuse you here why did magnus not block the check why did he move his king well if he blocked the check then black would have taken and then black would have gone here and there's actually no way to defend this pawn you might say yes there is levy queen to g5 yeah but that's shortlived that's really not going to you know this is just not a good position it's actually believe it or not better to move the king why because the king is going to be safe on g2 this pawn's going to move king's going to be safe this bishop is a target you don't need to trade that bishop because this bishop can't really go anywhere magnus is going to play bishop g5 right around here is when i woke up okay i woke up around here and i was like oh wow magnus is playing like stockfish and play like stockfish he did when a couple of ms later he went h4 now apparently the best move in this position was not queen d3 it was something like bishop g5 or a3 and actually stockish stockfish was very impressed by king f1 i mean it thought magnus was a genius but then magnus went h4 and and clearly he's got very bad intentions here for moral king morali played h6 which simultaneously prevents anything from coming to g5 and stops that pawn magnus played h5 all right so my man plays h4 h5 he's leaving his king here he's going to bring his rook around this way and morali took the pawn i mean he's just the pawn up so magnus giving up the pawn in the center of the board making an active gallop into the position with his rook he has what we call compensation but black castling long anticipating that over here there is nothing a4 looks very scary but believe it or not you're you're not breaking in here and black is actually very quick to fire back on the a file so very interesting to see how is magnus going to accomplish this well he kicks out the bishop and then he plays a4 so that now there is going to be a bishop hanging but morali just plays bishop to b6 so the only thing magnus has going for him here is a 38-minute time advantage which is a lot of time he plays knight to d2 rerouting the knight and potentially rotating the queen over morali plays rook e8 taking control of the e file very nicely done magnus now takes on b5 opening the a file and plays this move knight to e4 a nice idea because after a knight takes e4 you actually don't take this knight you take this and you threaten mate and that would be very very bad for black so knight e4 very very tense position morale plays king to b7 with just s minutes remaining very tense moment here magnus looking to apply that pressure and win the game queen f3 lining up the queen on the same diagonal as black's king morali defends with his own queen with 3 minutes and 47 seconds to go black now has 3 minutes and 47 seconds to make' moves you have to get to the 40th move of the game to get that extra 30 minutes that's the way chess time control works magnus is up 27 minutes on the clock very tense position but having said the fact that it's tense black is about to trade off a lot of pieces if white plays a move just like bishop d2 black is going to go here here here and here and soon here and you might have to trade the queens so magnus decides you know what i'm not i'm not sure about liquidating here i don't want to trade too many pieces bishop takes h6 i'm going for the win if pawn takes h6 knight takes f6 knight takes f6 and queen takes f6 and after bishop takes h6 if you play knight takes c4 i have rook e4 you can take my bishop but then i take and then i take and if this i have this and i'm hitting you here bishop takes h6 is a very nice move but suddenly magnus misses a one move tactic he played bishop takes h6 and he calculated pawn takes and knight takes but i think he completely blanked on rook takes and suddenly the bishop is still hanging and after rook takes e4 he just loses it remember the idea was to remove the defender of the knight but oh my god rook takes e4 and suddenly magnus is in the worst position because he gave up the rook for two nights a completely uncharacteristic mistake he was up 27 minutes on the clock and suddenly he thought for 9 minutes and boom he would have never played bishop takes h6 i don't think if he saw rook takes e4 or maybe he underestimated it i mean like again i haven't had a chance to talk to the guy but i'm not sure he would go for this because his next move following up black just untangles black is now off of the diagonal with his king and he slides the queen back to defend himself it's not the most accurate move the computer wants rook g8 or whatever but queen b7 is a fantastic move and suddenly he's threatening this and all black needs to do is trade queens because in the end game two knights are going to beat a rook in most cases so bishop takes magnus grabs the pawn morali just plays c6 look at this he has one minute to go to make 12 moves but unfortunately for magnus there's not much to be done rook d1 defending rook e6 but rook f8 an amazing defensive move a counterattacking move but rook f6 that's it magnus doesn't trade he plays g3 black has five moves to go and a on the clock rook d3 knight c7 here comes black untangling with the knight and the bishop morali rook g7 hitting the pawn rook d5 rook g4 we've made the 40th move the players now get an additional 30 minutes on the clock magnus's time hasn't added yet there it is rook f4 played he's going to lose this magnus does have a pass h pawn and black is only down to one pawn but unfortunately there is not much to be done here and in this position magnus actually resigned he resigned the game because his rook is threatened he can get it out of danger but black will go here and let's say rook b4 rook d2 check king to e1 knight d3 rook f2 discover check and i win your rook also knight takes right so rook b4 would not do it and let's say i go all the way back here pretty sure there's just a check mate net rook to d2 is an unstoppable checkmate there is check and rook c2 but knight b2 is winning and magnus carlson just lost to morale kikan morali is a 20 4-year-old 2600 rated grandmaster from india and he is now only the second indian grandmaster to ever defeat magnus carlson when he was the world number one' years ago in 2005 magnus carlson lost to pentala harak krishna in the tournament for the young it was like a young masters tournament everybody was like 15 16 years old since he became world number one magnus has only ever lost to vishwanathan anand in classical chess some of you may remember prananda defeated magnus i'm talking about classical chess in classical chess morali becomes just the second indian grandmaster after vishi anand to defeat magnus carl when he's been world number one that is an exceptional statistic and now on the complete flip side magnus is below 2830 for the first time since 2017 it's now been 6 and a2 years since magnus elo was below 2,830 he has suffered two losses in this event to people rated 26 and 2500 this is wild stuff there's a lot of things at play here there is the narrative of is this the the the the moonlight right the sunset of the magnus carlson classical chess career is he g to focus primarily on rapid and blitz many people also think that that's just the st s like a stupid argument because you know he loses a couple of games and this narrative happens more importantly the other side of that discussion is i think there's a ton of underrated people in the world i think we don't get to see grand masters like morali like alisher who defeated magnus in this event more often i think in india and a lot of different countries where there are not an there's not an opportunity for these young guys to play tournaments against the top players a lot of them are 100 to 150 points underrated which is crazy particularly in india so amazing stuff a crazy historic day today and i've got three more games for you so speaking of another superstar grandmaster from india shout out to dkes 2760 couple of months ago he was the world he was the number one ranked player in india now i think he's number two he slipped back under viana his opponent david parvon also underrated guy in my opinion probably should be like 2660 a very good player rapid and blitz as well online and yesterday he drew hikaru knight takes f6 gukesh goes for what's known as the tarta variation kind of interesting that he spent five minutes on move three maybe this was a surprise for him like maybe paravan usually plays the advance or ed or f3 like maybe maybe you know gesh pre the carrow and knight d two caught him off guard right so now he goes for the tarow he spends even 5 minutes here it's not that he doesn't know the opening he just spent 5 minutes because he wanted to make sure that he knew what he was doing c3 this is all theory all of this has been played before and there's this new edgy modern move which is h5 it's the way that you defend your h7 pawn and you try to march it forward at white's king you also try to prevent white from playing knight to g3 now parvon castles into that which is normal black plays a h4 all of this has been played before now bishop f4 that's a weird move i've normally seen h3 i've never seen this played in a way where you allow black to execute the entire plan so bishop f4 some of you may notice there's a tactic here rook takes e2 removing the defender of the bishop queen e2 bishop f4 that does look very very good but then here and you're going to lose your bishop or get checkmated so very very bad so knight a6 and gukesh plays this move h3 because that's literally black's entire idea like your position was designed to play h3 so he does but immediately david puts his knight on g3 which is the square that that pawn was defending so very like interesting dynamic here where parvon basically says you can go to h3 i'm cool with it and remember in all end games this is quite important in all end games like let's say all these pieces get traded white enjoys a very comfortable edge because stockfish says it's zeros cuz you know it's 3,800 or whatever but this pawn structure is very mobile and i think the positions are much more pleasant to play now admittedly in that position white would have just taken the pawn so you know it's we we still got to get there but bishop f8 and that pawn just kind of hangs out there for a little bit and finally parvan takes and just focuses on this little rectangle like he he doesn't touch anything here he just has more pawns and he's just going to slowly transfer pieces and potentially create some sort of attack like his knight goes to the center he puts doubled rooks like very easy position to play for white bishop to g6 gach defending his king rook g3 putting some pressure and here gukesh plays queen d5 and i think both players knew what was about to happen paravan sacrificed the rook on g6 what rook g that look that looks so stupid how could you possibly right but what huh but black's completely solid where's the follow-up that doesn't work that's just another well david realizes he could sack the rook and his position is so good he can just go rook e3 there's no rush that's crazy like his position is so powerful he could just very slowly and methodically improve and try to attack the king try to rotate the it's crazy it's position it's just such a good position that he doesn't even have to rush in black plays b5 to stop the bishop from going to c4 now a4 oh my god knight c7 take take he takes the knight and he takes the pawn and now he's got a pawn and a knight for a rook and gukesh has a huge weakness and if the king goes this way uhoh so the king is in dire straits and if if the bishop lands on this diagonal the game is over so gukesh now has to do everything possible to try to not allow that to happen bishop c4 it does happen he has to give up material and paravan very cool very calm just sends the game to an end game where he's up a pa and he's not just up a pawn he has two connected pass pawns the game is completely over this is not defendable gukesh has three versus two on one side but watch how paravan does this he just pushes his king his knight his rooks he walks his king up to d3 keep centralizing and and you just can't stop his pawns gues tries his best but it's too a little too late d5 d6 b5 c6 b6 knight d5 and rather than even prolong it gukesh resigned what a game by parvon i mean taking down 2760 this is the opposite effect this is the ges is definitely fairly rated because he plays a lot of tournaments versus the top 15 and parvan is i mean he probably should easily be 2670 or something this was just an amazing game by by parvan nothing more to say this beautiful game i mean oh my god gregory kaidanov versus jordan vanz i think gregory kaidanov might be the oldest player in qar not like in the country but i mean in this tournament he is 64 years old i don't even know that i thought greg kaido was like 50 all right he's a a longtime american grandmaster trainer of many young talented players i don't i don't know him personally i i don't even know a huge amount about him other than the fact that he's been around top us chess for like 25 30 years he might be the first or second old player playing in this tournament and jordan is like 20 all right and he's 2700 he's played all the top guys so this game was a was a was a semis slav miran semis slav bishop e7 very sharp line b5 b4 provoking you know a night move and then giving kaidanov the center to try to fire back at it later clearly jordan has not spent any time whatsoever castles castles e5 knight d7 all of this has been played before queen b6 so now jordan spends 25 5 minutes i would imagine that it was because bishop e4 maybe isn't the main line maybe it's i but i don't know bishop e4 does look very natural because it prevents c5 so jordan spend some time maybe instead of playing rook c8 or a5 or knight b6 like he thought for a little bit and he played queen to b6 but queen to b6 does a couple of things right it it pressures this it defends that and it prepares c5 and you can play rook d8 but it does something very very very subtle it stops doing something on b6 that it did on d8 very subtle covering g5 now that doesn't mean anything because knight g5 doesn't you know just bishop takes but kaidanov plays bishop g5 but okay so what bishop g5 knight g5 pawn to h6 there's nothing there right so bishop g5 doesn't really make a whole lot of sense which is why jordan takes it and jordan van forest in this position gets greek gifted bishop takes h7 now he saw that he definitely just miscalculated bishop takes h7 kaidanov spent 12 minutes calculating this take take knight takes g5 now the queen is coming here if black goes king here queen h5 is game over it's just made in a couple of moves all right if black goes to h8 it's also over so black's got to go forward all right now it's normally better to go here because if you go to h6 you're still going to get hit with the check so he goes to g6 and kaidon of plays queen to g4 and by the way f4 also would have worked so essentially this is like a poker game this is white saying i'm calling your bluff and black now has to show his cards queen to g4 f5 lashing out and kaidanov slides his queen back one square now black's king is out in the open he plays queen takes pawn to try to trade the queen or put the queen on g4 and now kidana finds knight to e4 check blocking the queen the king goes there check again check again to slide closer and now rook d1 and anywhere the queen moves i'm going to take on d7 with check and i'm going to win the game queen takes e5 defense mate takes here takes you can't take like this because it's mate you can't take like this because i win your queen jordan takes here knight c5 gregory kaidanov is up a full knight he's going here next he's going here next he's going to play h3 and bring the second rook into the game on d7 we have a trade he brings the next rook and in this position jordan van forest resigns resigned the game gregory kaidanov 64 years of age and i'm not trying trying to use that as some sort of you know like an agist kind of a thing but let me tell you something right now 60 playing like this at 64 is impressive i'm 28 i and i already have brain fog all right i can't imagine this man is double my age and eight more years and this and he just took down one of the best players of you know of of the next generation crazy and all because jordan just kind of i don't know didn't take this move too seriously queen b6 it's crazy how one move one move he thought on his own maybe he was hung over i don't know but he obviously knew the various ideas he decided to play queen b6 and and and kaidon have made him pay so fast i mean so fast unbelievable stuff the last game that i have for you is a great one this is i'm highlighting alua norova she was on the gotham knights those of you that followed the pro chess league she was our board four and she since then she has gained like 200 points she has been destroying this tournament she's scoring like 50% versus grand masters and in this game she had the black pieces versus an international master 2425 and i just want to highlight how to attack on opposite sides here white plays rook g1 in the night orf which is this obscure sideline trying to play g4 black tries to stop g4 we don't have to get into like look at this rook back to h1 right now white can't even castle okay but i'm not going to get into the specifics why on earth people would do this white is obviously going to castle queed side black meanwhile is going to castle king side ladies and gentlemen this is how you attack in chess this king is castled on this side this king is castled on this side when you are castled on opposite sides the attacking possibilities double because white will throw the pawns and black will throw their pawns and when you want to attack somebody successfully you need to make sure the center is locked if the center is open and pieces are able to open lines and transfer it's going to make things a lot more complicated watch how in this game black is the first one to start marching their pawns white also tries to march but black strikes first and instigates sacrificing a pawn very common in attacks to open up the position now e4 ripping open the center the knight can come here the bishop has its door open for the future very very potent and powerful attacking chess knight c5 bishop d4 trying to save that bishop but black says no no no no no nope i'm not we're not doing that queen c3 now f5 locking down more space in the center the bishop takes the entire diagonal queen slides out of the way so that the rook can take back the knight take take king slides to defend the pawn on g6 and now take take and ala knocks it all down b5 opening this this king is completely restricted by the pawn on a3 the queen look at this sniper sniping through two pieces queen b2 is a mate b4 b takes c four ala sacrifices the entire rook because queen b7 queen b2 so white can't take it white sacrifices the bishop to try to trade the queens but aloa zips over to the other side and it's too little too late she has too many pieces and she ends this game in style with bishop takes f4 and the very cool common collected rook to f8 a sacrifice of a rook an attack on the queen and the rook behind it and you can't take because if the queen goes there it takes its eye off of c1 and black has mate like this all because of this pawn on a3 all because a couple of moves ago she decided to play b6 a5 a4 and a3 you never know when you push flank pawns when you're attacking and that pawn changed everything a great game from her round seven is in the books magnus is out of the contention for first place it is absolutely unbelievable it is unprecedented and actually magnus in round eight is playing kaidanov so we're going to see how that goes we're going to see if hikaru can continue his streak he drew param maku this round he needs to win at least one of the two last games to make a case for first place that's all for me you know the drill get out of here
