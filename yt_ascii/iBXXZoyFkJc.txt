guys i'm going to be honest this is a strange one so you know soja boy soulja boy and crypto are two words you don't think you you'd hear together actually i don't know if soja boy is one word we're just gonna assume for the purpose of argument it's is it soja boy or sojour boy soja boy and crypto two different words you just don't expect those to go together but today they did for a very s such a dumb reason guys 2021 is turning out to be the year of dumb fraud you got the people flexing on instagram you got the people caught by the fbi you you know it's just things are just getting dumber and this has to take the cake for one of the dumbest ways to be a caught shilling something okay we got ourselves here soja boy you know from the song soja boy i don't know if anyone still remembers that from like 2001 or so i don't know when it was made anyways you might know him from some of his more recent endeavors if you're kind of keeping up with the boy you know he went into video games soju games he's look he's not just a rapper guys he's a soldier which means it's a whole franchise it's a whole brand he had soji games it lasted from 2018 to 2018 quite an amazing business apparently they were trying to sell a bunch of bootlegged nintendo games and he got she got shut down like immediately he said i had to boss up i didn't have a choice this is him talking about basically shutting his company down that had lasted for like seven months or something like that so okay so sojou boy's been up to a lot of things but crypto he's gotten into crypto recently and he started shilling a bunch of coins like a lot of influencers that shouldn't surprise anybody but what did surprise everybody is when he tweeted about one of these coins he forgot to leave out something he said found an interesting project safer mars looks moon worthy sfm pre-sale live now on dx sale rocket ship and he forgot to leave out something he goes they raise in 240k if they raise it after your tweet you will get 24k if you guys understand what happened he copied his email his promo email where he somebody told him you shilled his coin will pay you and he shield it but he copy and pasted the message and forgot to leave out the part where they said they were gonna they would pay him so he accidentally shield a coin told everyone who's gonna shill it and how much he was gonna make if they made the money and then immediately he deletes it obviously after he realizes his mistake but here's the worst part he then tweets right after that the same exact tweet without the fact he's gonna get paid so he realized he messed up and goes hey i'm already in in this deep sometimes you gotta crank that you gotta you gotta crank that sochi boy huh is the sec awake right now like these people are handing themselves to you basically going lock me up dude manipulating kryptos without disclosing it deleting the tweet because you accidentally disclosed it and then reposting the tweet i can't imagine anything more shameless yes i'm lying to you my audience by getting paid and pretending to be excited about something oh by the way hey great project super interesting project by the way the project he's he's shilling is a scam the crypto that paid him to do this is called safer mars and it is actually not original it is a copy of this coin safe mars ladies and gentlemen not to be confused with safe uranus but safe mars isn't even original and that itself was a copy of safe moon and i know what you're thinking wow what's next safe star the answer is yes now what does it mean when rappers start pumping krypto well personally i guess to sum up this video i would have to say that it means you should be very careful obviously just sometimes they'll objectively show you that they're shilling to you but also i just think generally it's bad it's a bad idea to take advice from a guy who told the world to superman that hoe i don't know is that the guy you want financial advice from is that who's doing your 1099 at the end of the year is that who's doing your taxes i don't think it should be quite frankly i think maybe you should separate the guy you listen to for rap and the guy you get your financial advice from because obviously these people can be paid off and he's already looking for new tokens to shell he just tweeted right now looking for the best crypto tokens to get involved in like he needs more mars and moons to shell so a hilarious slip up but you can be sure that a lot more go unnoticed so be very careful when your favorite influencer just starts shilling a coin and you've never known them to do that before especially if it's a scammy coin like safe or mars take care of yourselves do your own research thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next one
