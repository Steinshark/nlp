- thank you apex legends
for sponsoring this video. as you guys know, we did
a battle royale event sponsored by apex legends. and that was a lot of fun. and when talking with
the marketing guy at ea, he just wanted to do more stuff with us. so we decided to go to shroud's house because he's the biggest
apex legends streamer. and obviously they're the
sponsor of this video, and every kill he gets, apex legends will donate money
to a charity of our choice. so we just got to his house. we don't, wanna film the outside 'cause we don't wanna give away anything. currently he's streaming
and he's in a game. but when this game ends,
we're gonna barge in. - yeah.
- yeah. - so i kind of have to use the bathroom. so while we're waiting on him, i'm gonna donate and ask
him where his bathroom is. i hope it goes through
before the game ends. - oh, he just won. - oh really?
- yeah. - hey, what's up, man?
- no! - oh, you made it?
- yeah. - what's up man? - i just donated asking
where your bathroom was. i think you missed it. - in the flesh. how's it going?
- great. so basically apex legends hit us up and wanted us to do a video with shroud, where we just donate money to charity. so we're gonna play like a few games and every time he gets a kill, we're gonna donate a few
thousand dollars to charity, to put a little pressure on you. and by we, i mean, apex legends. - you wanna jump in right in right now? - yeah.
- or after this one? - no, this one right here. we'll see how you do,
we'll do 2,000 per kill. it's all apex's money. so it doesn't matter to me.
- okay. 2,000 per kill. - yep, go off. do you have any charity or is there anything that
matters a lot to you? - i'm not very good
with specific charities. - yeah. - but i would definitely like
to see some go to veterans. - okay. - so 2,000 per kill?
- 2,000 per kill. we'll see how it goes. - got one. - no.
- no. - tyler, this is for veterans, please. - come on, you can do this, tyler. - yes. - no.
- i can do another one. - we'll do 2,000.
- all right. well, let's do another one, then. - yeah. - you wanna make it 5,000 per kill, now? - yeah, sure.
- 5,000 per kill? - yeah.
- yeah, now he's gonna go off. - doesn't matter how many kills you get. every kill's five grand donated. - you wanna still do veterans?
- yes. - all right, let's give that a try. - and i'm praying. i think
we could get three kills. - three?
- three. i think we do three. all right, tyler. i need to drop 20, a hundred grand. - apex just walks in. they're like, "all right, cut it off, a hundred grand too much." - am i in right now? or canceled? canceled. you know, what's weird
about a live audience? its way more pressure than like thousands of thousands of people
watching you online. - i know exactly what you mean. when we film some stuff in front of. - i got one, where's the other one? down, nice. - bro chill. yeah. three baby. - all right you're at 15.
