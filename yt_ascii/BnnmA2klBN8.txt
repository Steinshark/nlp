welcome to
the festival of the spoken nerd you can't polish a nerd
dvd unboxing video. yeah, i've only got myself to blame. now, in here,
there's a few things involved, but we're going to go
straight into the disc first. we'll come back to this later. if i put the disc into the player... for a start,
that's now technically incorrect. there is a disc in the drive. although not a blu-ray disc!
i'll make that very clear. it's a blu-ray player. it's a disc which is definitely
both digital and, indeed, versatile. there's the copyright notice. you're not allowed to copy
or memorise this. we probably shouldn't be filming
the screen, either, but... what harm can come of that? ([music] festival of the spoken nerd theme) splash screen. look at that resolution! that is the great thing
about watching a dvd! you get to enjoy every pixel individually. wow! we've got chapter selection. ah! look at all those options! my favourite is the pi-endulum down here, where i try to calculate pi. steve actually wanted this selector
to be a tau symbol - terrible idea! helen was very keen it should be a banana, because she does stuff
about bananas in the show. my good... the argument! it was just...
it went on and on. i really hate it when those two fight. if we go back to the main menu,
we can see what else there is. we've got, oh, dvd extras.
let's check those out - dvd extras menu. just the one!
the plural was false advertising. just the unboxing video. we can play that. here we go. welcome to the festival of the spoken nerd you can't polish a nerd
dvd unboxing video. well, what did i expect? yeah, i've only got myself to blame. but it's ok,
i'm a professional unboxer.
now, in here,
there's a few things involved i'm going to do this properly
and professionally.
but we're going to go straight
to the disc first. we'll go back to this now.
we'll come back to this later. so, inside here,
as well as the disc we are now watching,
if i put the disc into the player... there is a booklet.
for a start, that's factually incorrect. so, if you want to look up
anything that's in the show,
there is a disc in the drive.
although, not a blu-ray disc. there's notes, resources,
places you can go.
it's a blu-ray player. if you look at any of the images
in the show and you think,
it's a disc which is definitely
both digital and, indeed, versatile. "i wonder what their copyright is?"
there's the copyright notice! we've got all the references
and copyright notices in here.
we probably shouldn't be filming
the screen, either, but... we have also printed, i guess,
what harm can come of that? the cover of the dvd. we were very pleased with this. we put a lot of effort in.
splash screen. we printed it at the highest quality
we possibly could. look at that resolution! that's the great thing about
printing something.
that's a great thing about
watching a dvd. you can enjoy it at very high resolution.
you get to enjoy every pixel individually. i'll put this back in here
because we've got some great options here.
wow! we've got chapter selection. wow! look at all those options!
wow! look at all those options! my favourite was adventures in tiling.
my favourite is the pi-endulum that's where i try to tile my bathroom
down here.
that's when i try to calculate pi. and end up starting a campaign
to change society.
steve actually wanted this selector
to be a tau symbol. no, this is your fault, all right.
terrible idea, although helen
was very keen it should be a banana, i will not take the blame
shifted on to me.
because she does stuff about bananas
in the show, and my goodness... this ridiculousness
is because you clicked on that... i really hate it when those two fight. if we go back to the main menu here,
if we go back to the main menu here, we have some other options you can enjoy.
we can see what else there is. there are subtitles
in the bottom left-hand corner there.
we've got, oh, dvd extras. you can turn on and off subtitles,
if you don't like listening to things.
let's check those out - dvd extras menu. just the one. there's the dvd unboxing video.
that's what we're enjoying right now.
the plural was false advertising.
just an unboxing video. we can play that. don't click it...! welcome to the festival of the spoken nerd you can't polish a nerd
dvd unboxing video. this is not going well. well, what did i expect? yeah, i've only got myself to blame. that's fine. i'm a professional unboxer.
we can still do this properly.
that's fine. i'm a professional unboxer.
i can do this properly.
we're going to go straight
into the disc first. this is not the only way you can enjoy
the festival of the spoken nerd video.
we'll go back to this now. inside here,
as well as the disc we are now watching,
we'll come back to this later.
if i put the disc into the player... the dvd is one option.
there is a booklet
for a start, that is factually incorrect. if you want a higher resolution experience
so, if you want to look up
anything that's in the show,
there is a disc in the drive.
although, not a blu-ray disc. you can download it from our website.
there's notes, resources,
it's a blu-ray player. if you go to festivalofthespokennerd.com
places you can go.
it's a disc which is definitely
both digital and, indeed, versatile. you can just buy the digital download
and that is hd.
if you look at any of the images
in the show and think, "i wonder download it straight away and watch it
in, mm, delicious high resolution.
"what their copyright is?" we've got
all the references and copyright notices.
there's the copyright notice. we probably
shouldn't be filming this screen. you can buy the physical thing, of course. that's on both festival of the spoken nerd
and on maths gear.
we have also printed, i guess, the cover.
but what harm can come of that? plus, we do a lot of live shows.
we do live shows all around the uk.
we put a lot of effort in.
we were very pleased with this.
splash screen. occasionally, we do shows in the us
and internationally.
we printed it at the highest quality
we possibly could. it's hard to organise,
but it is a lot of fun.
look at that resolution! that is a great thing about
doing a live show.
that's the great thing about
printing something.
that's the great thing about
watching a dvd. you get to enjoy it
in the maximum conceivable resolution.
you get to enjoy it
at very high resolution.
you get to enjoy every pixel individually. now, i'm going to put this aside
for a second. if you go back to the main menu,
you can see some other features.
i'll put this back in here because
we've got some great options here. wow! look at all those options!
wow! look at all those options!
wow! look at all those options! my favourite is probably
the gravity wave one where steve...
my favourite was adventures in tiling.
my favourite is the pi-endulum i can't! this is a mess! you should not have picked to watch
the dvd feature in the dvd feature! it's not my fault. i'm the top level!
no, this is your fault. you're the next one down.
i will not take the blame. i can't believe this.
this ridiculousness
is because you clicked on that... i really hate it when those two fight. so, as well as all the options
that you have here, all the chapters.
if we go back to the main menu,
we have some other options you can enjoy.
if we go back to the main menu,
we can see what else there is. if we go right back up again
there are different audio options.
there are subtitles
we've got, oh, dvd extras. so if you go into the bottom
right-hand corner,
in the bottom left-hand corner there.
let's check those out - dvd extras menu. you can choose what audio
you want to put over the top.

hd quality, you can watch that.
there's the dvd unboxing video.
we've already seen that.
the plural was false advertising. no, don't. if we play that...
no, that's...! welcome to
the festival of the spoken nerd... this has officially gone too far. this is not going well. well, what did i expect? yeah. i've only got myself to blame. that's fine. i'm a professional unboxer.
