this is a a a monument in montreal it's in montreal that's why i care about it so much you know the museum of fine arts bought a church across from itself and used it to show art and so the beautiful old church you know and then they commissioned a monument to put in front of the church and this is the monument right the transformation is is full right the broken empty angel whose wings are falling off that has an empty chest that has no face you know that is half mechanical half flesh you don't know what it is and these types of statements are not they're not arbitrary right it's like if i take your picture of your mother and i rip it like you know what that means you know if i if i show a disfigured version of someone you love you know what that means [music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [applause] [music] jonathan pajoto is a professional artist writer and public speaker who comes to us from quebec canada he lectures in universities conferences and numerous venues on art and the symbolic structures that underlie our experience of the world if you're like me you first encounter jonathan through one of his many engaging youtube conversations on the symbolic world and if you're not already one of his 177 000 youtube followers i encourage you to sign up that number indicates that the topics we're talking about here today have a broad resonance as we heard earlier in this morning not only with people of faith but people asking questions about meaning and purpose and how to integrate art and beauty into identity he's a skilled icon carver and as you heard from aiden earlier this morning he's also an artistic entrepreneur because he started the orthodox arts journal that's trying to revive liturgical art today he gives carving workshops with a hexamerin school of ecclesial arts which is accredited through pontifex university he's also working on a graphic novel and i heard last night maybe on some fairy tales so he is an artistic creative entrepreneur we are delighted to have him following his presentation there will be a conversation between jonathan and myself as well as rj snell who also hails from canada and he is here locally now at the witherspoon institute where he's the editor-in-chief of public discourse he studied philosophy and taught philosophy for for quite a number of years at eastern university and the templeton honors college he is widely published on natural law ethics the liberal arts and a giant now in the catholic intellectual tradition so after we hear from jonathan we will then have a conversation with myself rj and jonathan thank you jonathan thank you so first off i'd like to thank margarita and david and aiden this is a a bit of a tangent but it's important to understand that i started wanting to thinking that maybe i could carve icons i could do liturgical art professionally almost as a as a dream as a prayer as a hope you know maybe about 20 years ago but about 10 years ago the situation in my life made it possible that possibly i could maybe do this maybe at first in my spare time wasn't sure trying to figure out how to to make it happen and and david clayton who's right here is the very first person to ever write about me you know kind of promote my work just just talk about what i was doing and and the same with aiden you know aiden for those who are not in the orthodox world or not in the world of liturgical art there are waves of artists and in some ways the waves that came before are the ones who struggled the most and who made it easier for those that came after and aiden is part of that wave that made it possible for so many of us who are able to paint icons to to to make that it's credible that we could create liturgical art and he was also one of the first people that i wrote when i was kind of struggling and and he was an icon carver he he was actually doing it and i wrote him sent him some images of my carvings and his criticism of my work was extremely helpful and and just a kind of common sense about how to go about this was very helpful to me so it's a great pleasure to be able to to speak with you and to meet all of you for the first time in person so i want to thank you for that it's one of the it's one of the prime reason why it came was like oh i get to meet aiden and david all right i'm there i'm coming and so what i what i want to talk to you about today is i want us to maybe start thinking a little differently about art or kind of provoke you to think differently about art i'm very fortunate that aiden went before me because he really set the stage for for for what i'm gonna say i almost wanted to like it when you hear someone speak and and he really does a good job you almost want to kind of reformulate everything just before starting but we're kind of we're gonna go along and i'm going to try to i'm going to try to to answer also some of the the the powerful ways that aiden presented this his image his vision of liturgical art and so in the modern world we we have a you know we we are the fruits of the avant-garde right we are the fruits of modern art and there's a lot of tangents in modern art but one of the things that modern art has done and and not just modern art but even the romantics before you know even the pre-moderns there's a sense in which we started to understand art in a few particular ways one was to understand art as something like questioning right what the artist questions the artist pokes the artist provokes and tries to change and tries to to revolutionize the means of of of of of seeing the the cultural means and so we are left with this idea you know the creative artists who who is trying to find some new way of representing things to challenge the old ways of seeing and this is a very deep this is a very deep kind of underlying assumption that we have in the manner in which we understand art and so you know of course the king of this is who who really went so far you know as to to just take common objects put them in the gallery you know to to play with identity you know to to to to question identity itself in his art production and and this is like the culmination of what it is and people like matt said deshawn became in some ways the the pioneers for what then became contemporary art whether it whether it's pop art you know andy warhol and all the way up to today the contemporary artists are in the line of of and so you all know banksy now here's a here's a very powerful theatric example of of what it is that we tend to think that art is and so banksy had this very theatrical stage i'm sorry it's obviously staged but you know he they brought one of his paintings out to sell at auction and while they were doing the auction it started to shred into pieces you know as they were selling it and everybody just celebrated this thing and now the piece is worth way more than it was when when it was just a painting you know but this type of of gesture is is a is a you know it's a it's a prime example it's a very recent example of how it is that we understand what it is that we understand are to be you know as this idea of questioning that's provoking you know the punk rock rock and roll idea of what culture is and so when i want to bring you towards is a a different perception of art and it is in some ways the more universal perception of art now i don't think there isn't room for the provoking there isn't room for the the fool the holy fool who who you know make sure you know that the king is in god right the graffiti artist that reminds you that this this thing doesn't isn't full in itself there's a role for that but because we're so unused to thinking about art in the very ancient more traditional way we almost have to re to relearn how that is and so you know the word art means well fitted together right that that's what the the word means it's actually close to the word also in greek techni which is our origin of technology and even oasis which is the origin of our idea of poetry comes the root of it is something like making right so this idea of bringing things and putting them together properly towards their purpose right that is the manner in which the ancients understood art and so you have a there's an idea there's a pattern there's a episteme there's a there's a high understanding and now you want that to land in the world and so in order to do that you have to gather things together and you know bring them together and make the thing visible for us right and so this is actually very much closer to the way that the ancients understood what art is and and and funnily enough like so much so much irony in the modern world in america and in the west it took someone who came from ceylon so ananda kumara swami who is up here being quoted was the when a curator is at boston museum at the beginning of the 20th century and he was the one who for the westerners reminded them reminded them that ancient art that the the that the medieval art the liturgical art but also the art of all cultures in is first and foremost in light of this that is art the art of carpentry the art of cooking the art of wine making the but also the art of rhetoric the art of poetry you know and then the art of painting the art of sculpture that these are all ways in which someone is skillfully capable of gathering means together towards a purpose right towards the telos towards something which is the reason why the object exists in the first place and so this is really a you know it's it changes our way of of thinking about art you know because not only in the contemporary world we understand art as being provocation as being questioning as being you know kind of poking at the system we also tend to understand art as something which is received as a viewer right received as a as public and so you have a performer and you have a public you know you have a painting and you have a viewer and this is so ingrained in ours right it's the root of entertainment it's the it's what brings us to watch our television screens but there is a far deeper way of understanding art in my my estimation that is more about this gathering because the gathering that the ancient arts did was not just the gathering of the stuff but it's also the gathering of the people and it's also the gathering of the people around that care for the thing you're doing but if you make a good meal and you do it well it's not obviously it's not just about making a good meal right it's about the people that will come in and sit with you and enjoy it with you and that's true for anything right it's true for making a piece of furniture right you don't just make a piece of furniture because you dream it up in the morning you make a piece of furniture to hold clothing to sit on to participate in the life of people and so the this ancient vision of art is not only gathering the stuff but it also ends up being gathering people into the purpose that that the art is making manifest okay and so and there are a few people in the 20th century that actually started to have inklings of that starting to to re-understand it for example interestingly enough heidegger in his questions concerning technology you know because for the ancients there was no different no difference between art and technique these were the same you know when it says in scripture that that christ was the son of a carpenter what it says is that christ was the son of a tecton the son of a artisan right the son of someone who makes things and for the agents that there was no difference between i mean there's a difference because obviously making a piece of furniture and making a painting is not the same skill but it was all about bringing these things together and so so heidegger in reading the ancients and reading aristotle particularly he comes to this image where he says that techni technology or arts right is a mode of unveiling right it's a mode of revealing because whoever builds a house or a ship or forges the sacrificial chalice reveals what is to be brought forth and so the artist right gathers the things together so that all this wood all these bits of stuff become a boat become a chalice become something which has telos something which has purpose okay and so it's very important to understand that and when we understand that then when we look at ancient art we have a different a different perception you know one of the difficulties that we have even looking at ancient art is of course that we encounter these things in museums that are septicized that are reduced you come up to a statue that is on a pedestal with a nice blank wall behind it and then you just look at the art now of course you know none of that art was made that way none of that art was made to be participated with that way it's fine there's nothing wrong with the museum it you know the especially since these art these arts don't have a participative role to play anymore it's it's wonderful to be able to see them but the the agents in every culture would have understood the arts mostly this way right in the sense that this is the building that is the highest point in our city it's dedicated to the god that is the patron of our city and we make these things that bind us together as a city so for athens to exist the parthenon is key right it's it's this gathering together of things is gathering together of people this gathering together of attention right the reason why these temples were often higher than all the other buildings so that everywhere in athens you could look up and you could see the thing which is binding you together you could see this image of your patron god let's say that is binding you together and so this is the the this will make you now again see different things so if you think for example of folk dancing then all of a sudden folk dancing takes on a very different allure you know we think that dancing we think that you know dancing is something you go to a performance and you watch ballet you sit there and then you watch the ballet that is somehow high culture right that is the highest form of culture is to to to be a an observer of people that are doing something with excellence now there's a very there's a big difference between that and something like folk dancing because what does folk dancing do folk dancing makes you participate right square dancing in the united states for a long time did something like that force you to participate but not just to participate right the traditional clothing the traditional music the language of our culture and so there's a way in which folk dancing becomes a concentration of a certain level of identity that's a good way to understand it it's like i have something in common with these people and it's actually the reason why i live with them it's a reason why we're not just a bunch of strangers you know like in this in the suburbs but we actually live together with reason and with a common identity and so we have a way to celebrate that we have a way to remember that right we have a way to to to to bring all this stuff together so now the dance the costume the music all of that becomes art becomes art in the sense that i'm trying to get you to understand it becomes this joining together of things of people of aspects of reality together so we can recognize them as an unveiling of unity right it's like oh yeah we're bulgarian or whatever like we we have something in common we're we're a group and and once you understand that then you know this is this is the beauty of what aiden was bringing out this notion of liturgy right this idea of liturgical practice where in the church you have all these things that were made with love and attention by people and that enter into a dance together in order to manifest the very reason why we're together in the church it's different from this because we're not just celebrating or participating in the reason you know the fact of being this or that group or this or that you know having this or that origin in common but we are celebrating the very source of reality itself we are celebrating the the reason why everything exists right right why all things exist is something that we're celebrating when we come to church and we are in the building and we have all these these objects this music you know the words all of this comes together with the people in order to reveal this and make us participate in in that reality and so this can help you understand maybe also why because so these are some of my carvings the understanding this and there are a few people in this room that had the same revelation understanding this and understanding the power that art has to bind us towards that which is most important you know is what made us move away from the contemporary art world what made us realize that there's a richness here that people have forgotten there's a richness here that is is really tapping in to the way the world works it's not just it's not just something that was is a nice picture or that is a nice object that i can look at and enjoy but it's more than that right it is it is a form of a deep form of participation in the way that we exist together and actually in the way that reality reveals itself to us and so of course there's still a lot of that today we often don't think about it but there's still a lot of this idea of art as participation of art as celebration and usually the remainders of that is of course civic art the public spaces or the you know the go to washington dc why would you go to washington dc it's not like you can talk to the president or anything you go there to liturgically participate in the common origin that binds you together as a nation you know and so why would you go and look at a statue of this dead guy you know and you know i'm gonna be really i'm gonna push you but it's like there's a little bit of veneration there's a little bit of i want to stand there and look at the image of someone that i recognize as having that participating in the reason why i'm here like it i look at this image and i know that one of the reasons why the united states exists as a country that is one is because of this person okay and so it is liturgical you cannot you won't be able to avoid liturgical the if you try to break it down and you try to avoid liturgical you're gonna end up in graceland and you'll be looking at elvis's shoes like you just cannot avoid it right or you'll be dressing up as obi-wan kenobi with your lightsaber right that you cannot avoid this this is something that is deeply human and the most cynical anti-religious person will unironically dress up as obi-wan with his lightsaber and we'll go to comic-con and we'll just be so excited to enter liturgically into the story of star wars okay so i just want i just hope you can kind of see how inevitable this is you know and in this image you actually see that the artist tried to portray this in the very image itself you know in the seat that abraham is sitting on there are the the fastest they are the this ancient roman symbol of binding unity right all these sticks that are bound together in order to manifest unity and so the the artist clearly understood that not only is this person one of the reasons why that unity exists but also at a secondary level the people who come there who read the the inscriptions and the stone who look at this statue are reenacting are participating to some extent in that story and in that that identity okay now this also means that we have to be very attentive we have to be very attentive when that starts to shatter when it starts to break you know and and and i don't want you to to say any statement of for or against whatever but it's important to understand that when those liturgical things when they get taken down there's a world that is changing right there's a memory that is changing there's an identity that is changing and you can't avoid that you know the christians took down the roman god statues and when they did that it meant something very profound it meant the world is no longer the same the thing that binds us together is no longer the same as what it was before there's a deep transformation which is a foot when you start to see this happen and so it's important to pay attention and to and to it's not my job to deal with that but it's important to understand what is happening and so this this of course you know and this aiden oh i want to talk about this one last time so one more time this this is also important to understand that art that is civic and that is celebration that is participating in identity necessarily has to have certain forms right if you take an art that is there to question to poke right to rip at the identity of something and you put it up in a public space and you put it up as a civic monument you are entering very dangerous a very dangerous place and the difficulty we have and i'm saying this because there's a lot of that that happened in churches in the past 50 years and it wasn't done on purpose it was done with with people who were looking at the modern art around them and not totally sometimes understanding visually what the art was doing not completely gathering into themselves the the implications of showing broken people of showing you know things that are cut things that are things that are shredded and then just putting that up in public spaces in in the church you know just wanting to kind of be modern and not realizing that that there there are and these are very organic they're not arbitrary right it's like if i take a picture of your mother and i rip it like you know what that means you know if i if i show a disfigured version of someone you love you know what that means and so the fact that we just kind of forgot that and we've accepted these weird things and so this is this is a a a monument in montreal it's in montreal that's why i care about it so much by david atmed you know the museum of fine arts bought a church across from itself and used it to show art and so the beautiful old church you know and then they commissioned a monument to put in front of the church and this is the monument and so right the transformation is is full right the broken empty angel whose wings are falling off that has an empty chest that has no face you know that is half mechanical half made half flesh you don't know what it is and these types of statements are not they're not arbitrary and so you know what you're seeing in some ways is the is the the evisceration of the church which was now transformed into something else i wish they would have done it differently they could have or they could have done it differently but that's the way that they decided to go at it possibly for reasons all right and so this of course is you know i showed you an image of the the parthenon to kind of tease you a bit or to poke you myself i'm sorry you know there's a way in which there's a problem with this that there is a problem with this this thing you know the gods fight amongst each other right the identities fight amongst each other the all these cultures they also lead to conflict and war and so how do we deal with that problem right the the questioning of identity the the poking at the system is not always completely illegitimate because identity leads to conflict it just does that is part of that's part of the problem and what you see in in scripture is you see the beginning of a of a of a transformation of the problem there's a there is a very deep relationship between art and identity in the negative sense in the in the bible and one which god transforms into something beautiful and positive and glorious but it's important to understand it because we have to be cautious about the way we enter into identity and especially as people start to poke at identity we sometimes want to just react and say it's like no you know i am this or i have i have this identity we have to be very careful and so in scripture the develop the development of the arts follow one thing they follow the murder of abel and so cain kills abel and then cain is chased away from god on on his body is placed a mark which excludes him from the presence of god we could say and then that mark leads cain and that exclusion leads cain to develop civilization to develop the first thing he does is he builds a city the first city is built by cain himself and then his descendants are the origin of music the origin of metallurgy the origin of tent making and so you see in the descendants of cain this this strange thing why why is it that it's in the descendants of cain that this happens and there are corollaries to this actually in in other in other cultures you know hephestos for example is a is a it's almost like a it's almost like a cane figure right he is thrown out of olympus for some impropriety and he lands in hades and that it's in hades that now he develops the skill to make the beautifully forged objects the the weapons the things that the gods prize in terms of in terms of techni and in terms of art right the capacity to to make things and so why why is that it has to do with the with the problem it just has to do with the problem of inside and outside it has to do with the problem of identity because once tech once civilization starts war starts it's it's inevitable part of building a wall around your city if you build a wall around your city means there's some people that are inside and there's some people that are outside and those people that are outside you know they're looking inside maybe they want what you've got and now you've got to defend your walls against the people outside and it creates it's an acceleration of the fall itself right that's what happens when adam and eve take the fruit for themselves and are see themselves as naked they immediately see the other as a threat right right away what happens adam blames eve you know eve blames a serpent it's right away me you you know you're the bad guy it's not my fault there's just this immediate opposition which happens and this this opposition is just a just a part of of civilization and it ends up being a part of of technology and of human making one which is difficult to deal with now what what happens in in the in the bible is that god takes that and transforms it powerfully right he does exactly aiden had such a beautiful image taking it from saint ephraim saying right the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil think about it this way the fruit of opposition of opposition between two things right if taken for you yourself becomes yeah it becomes that it becomes it becomes opposition now the if you are given the fruit then it becomes it can become life itself in the sense that it becomes the capacity to distinguish the capacity to distinguish is not wrong but it has to be let's say it has to come from heaven is the good is the best way to understand it has to come from above and what you see in the story of the tabernacle is exactly that god reveals to moses the pattern of the tabernacle the tabernacle is the memory of eden that is what it is the tabernacle is based on the image of the garden of eden it is the idea of i mean the candelabra that's there and you also have the cherub that are guarding the ark guarding the the the the tabernacle and so there's a direct relationship between the participation in the in this space and a return to paradise a return to eden and it is you could say it's something like memory perfecting itself slowly memory being because memory is two things right memory is distance from something right and memory is also direction towards something right when i even the word like we remember it's like we we bring multiplicity back into its talos when we remember and so when you remember god when you remember the heart all these these expressions that we use in in christian thinking that is that is what you're doing you know you're going to see that obviously all this will lead up you know to communion ultimately as this perfect you could say perfect memory but this is already what's happening here in the in the the tabernacle and so if you read if you read exodus you'll see it's not just the tabernacle it's the passover it's all these things which are remember remember what happened remember your origin remember where you come from remember what binds you together why are you israel because i am the god of abraham jacob abraham isaac and jacob that is why you are israel you are bound both by especially this revelation it's powerful because god is saying i am the god of heaven i'm the source of everything i am supreme but i'm also the god of your fathers one comes after the other in some you know in an important way i am that i am but i'm also the god of your fathers i am the place where you recognize your origin to be in abraham right so it's a so the the participation in the ritual of the tabernacle the remembrance of passover the remembrance of these feasts was always to remember where you come from remember where you know where where you are and that becomes a way to participate in it or to participate in something which is kind of beyond the beyond the beyond the now now like or just the the commonality of everyday life and so now this this this this question again like right this is the problem right this is this is the problem that i'm talking about is that techni unity identity often leads to this it leads to babel you know and this is of course the ultimate image of the city gone wrong right the city that tries to contain everything the city that tries to take the fruit for itself that tries to make a name for itself and not receive the name from above not receive the revelation from above but make a name we're going to make a name for ourselves right we hear that in common parlance but this is of course what leads to babel in the kind of the the at the complete distortion of art into this pride is best way to understand it all right i want to speed up here but what i want to show you is that this idea of of memory and of celebration and of remembering is one which even though we have this kind of modern art there it's always there it's always kind of it's this underlying current you're going to see it if you pay attention you'll see it and so everybody you know this is he's the famous artist jackson pollock is a famous artist you know he he it's process it's it's all about process it's not about the thing it's about it's about this expressivity it's about a kind of ordered chaos it's about this this explosion of color and of end of an of art and he's the avant-garde right he's the one who's pushing the boundaries right who's at the edge but while this was happening and even the teacher of this person is is this person thomas hard benton and in the united states you have this whole current called regionalism that a lot of people don't know about for some reason that was a desire to you know with the crumbs that are left to celebrate something about about out our lives to celebrate the worker to celebrate you know the stories the the difficulties that people that people went through and so there was this this desire and you can see that this type of art this type of art and the other is a completely different nature they're just not in the same world they're talking about things very differently not just visually in terms of subject but also in terms of purpose right in terms of purpose and so regionalism is the type of art that you will find in the 1930s in civic art in the united states because it had some it had the right way of celebrating of remembering the things that the sacrifices of our of our forebearers and and putting them there for us to be able to to see them okay now you know this is i want to show you how difficult it becomes is that you have some similar situation happening in europe and in russia and there it goes the other way that it went with pollock is that you have this push in russia this push towards supremacism and constructivism to kind of break the way that ain't people used to see the world to really push it to its edge you see you know the craziest example is of course in in in futurism italian futurism bocioni is a was one of the members of the futurist movement in italy where it's it was really explicit like art is violence art is destruction art is this this this push that we need to break everything to be able to move into the future you know but that that that can't hold it's almost like you pull the pendulum so far and then when it snaps then it goes into this which is also modern art right this is modern art that that's modern art there and there was obviously a version of this in in in germany as well and so how do we how do we deal with that because that's a problem i hope you agree that's a problem and this is a problem right it's like what the stalin the you know stalin the hero so so how do we avoid participative art that wants to remember that wants to make us connect to our origins connect to our particip to our to our world to our to our commonality without propaganda how do we do it right because the modern artists that were breaking everything some of them had the right intuition about the problem of propaganda right and we have to understand that this is not a new question you know plato knew that in the republic plato knew already the problem of art the problem of poetry the problem of rhetoric the problem of artistically putting together things because they can be used to manipulate your your your idea they can be they can be used to make you care for things that maybe you wouldn't care about right it can they can be used to make you think something is important that maybe you shouldn't think is important right that's ultimately for us that becomes advertisement it's like advertisement is all celebration advertisement is all participation but that's not what we want right we don't want something that is so shallow and so and so manipulative and so how do we do it how do we deal with this and i think that i think that christians you know as they came into place and as the language of the art in the church started to establish itself i think they found what i think is the the best solution and it's one which is not arbitrary to christianity but is rather at the very source of this the particularities of what christianity is as images started to appear in the christian church and started to take shape it took several centuries it took a while for this to kind of gel and to crystallize you know by the by the 10th century by the 11th century you could say that there were there were two basic images of christ two central images of christ and one is the one we could call the pentocrator which is christ here shown with the book and this is it's an eschatological image it's a christ as he will appear in glory it's christ as he will show himself to us when all has been revealed and all has been brought together in the finality right it's not just about future it's something that can pierce in now it's something that you can experience now but there is a sentence which is beyond the the it's beyond the mere historical something which is piercing through from the other side piercing through from that final moment and then the other image that becomes central you know especially there is a sense in which one becomes more central in the east one becomes more central in the west but it's a little over exaggerated but then you have the cross and so you know we have to every time you look at a crucifix like don't forget how weird that is like don't forget that you know you have this thing above the iconastasis or above the altar in front of you that is the image of a dead person and and it's and it's crazy but it's an interesting just just i'm going to be utilitarian it's an interesting idea it's like wait a minute at the top the thing that's the most celebrated is actually the thing that gives itself oh the thing at the top the thing that's actually most celebrated is the thing that empties itself huh okay well that's different from the king right that's different from athena or zeus that goes around raping everybody it's like it's quite different right it's quite different you know there's a there's a different vision it's the same for this idea of of christ the eschatological christ it's like no no don't think you've got it right don't think you've mastered it it's coming it's coming over the horizon right call for it ask for it ask christ come lord jesus but don't think that you've you got it right like that you're the one and so these two powerful images they they're they're like i said it's not arbitrary it's something about the very nature of the of the of the christian faith which makes these images the central images and bring the the possibility to celebrate to remember to worship you know at least given the possibility of alleviating the problems of pride and the problems of identity doesn't mean the christians were always able to do it you know your history obviously not but there's a difference between there's a qualitative difference between that and the you know the the then the augustus the son of god who is all-powerful and is literally a manifestation of a divine principle in the world and that can rule over you you know with his with his fist or some other roman emperor or some other ancient egyptian pharaoh that had right of life or death over everybody in their kingdom there's a there's a there's a big difference between the the two so what what that will give in terms of culture what what type of images it will provoke can be very interesting to think about this way and so this is a this is this is a type of image that you'll see in many medieval churches orthodox churches and what it is it is the rich powerful person this in this case a rich aristocrat in constantinople sometimes the emperor himself sometimes the king himself prostrating himself before the true emperor the true king and what is he doing he's offering the church but the church the building that is he's offering the art he's offering the arts to christ right that's what's going on there it's like i paid for this church i hired a bunch of architects a bunch of artisans to make this beautiful church and i and i'm offering it to christ and so the summit is again eschatological this image of christ is the christ he's sitting on his golden throne he has returned he is the the christ that fills up the entire cosmos it fills up the entire world this is what the art is being offered to and then then you'll notice that in in let's say several there are different images that manifest that this is an image called the hetemasia which is this image of the prepared throne and so it's an image of the throne which is prepared for the final revelation of christ and so you know it's it's a beautiful image of this offering up right it's like gather these elements together there's the book there's the throne there's this throne of the emperor which is prepared for this final moment you know and so that is what we do aiden this morning you know beautifully talked about the the eucharist in a way that like might scandalize some of you because he he came right up to it and i'm going to push you over the edge he said he said eucharist is art the gifts are art we're made them we made the bread we made the the wine and then we offer it up to become the very blood and body of christ you know it's like that's a really powerful image you know in in in some moments during the byzantine period it was the emperor who would come up to the door of the of the iconostasis of the of the the temple on and would bring the bread to be to to to hand over to the priest or the bishop who would take it and then consecrate it it's like here's my kingdom here's all these things gathered right here's all these things that are our works our efforts all this stuff that we do all these activities that we do and we're offering up to become the body of christ and so that's a a very powerful image and then that again and then the eucharist obviously it has many there's there's beyond symbolism in the eucharist but one of the aspects is that emptying as well that's there in the eucharist right the eucharist is both is both the eschatological christ and also the christ that empties himself and gives his body and his blood for to to fill us up and so i'm going to speed up really fast and so this is one of aiden's ascension and so if you if you think if you start to think that way then you're you're going to start to notice that a lot of the images especially in the orthodox tradition is the tradition that i know have a very strange eschatological element you know in them and so this image of ascension is obviously an image of the ascension i mean it's the moment that christ rose but it also is eschatological in its very form right it's revealing to you the the structure of the world right the divine logos is above in heaven you know and he's either going up or coming down you're not sure this could be like the return of christ in in a very strange way and then down below is the the the footstool of of the throne the mother of god is there underneath him and then you have the church which is gathered and how do you know it's eschatological because saint paul is there why is saint paul there this is not just a snapshot this is trying to bring you into that moment where the entire church is gathered in the in in the the in the pantry in the one who rules over all things and so and then you have some images with which have aspects of kenosis and of emptying and so an example again is in the image of of the nativity where christ is represented as a child who is already in the tomb who's already you know contained in this you know it's weird for people again that story of jesus is so weird it's just so bizarre we're so used to it we stopped thinking about it like why was christ laying in the food trough for animals right why because he he's em he's going to the bottom right he's going to do it he's going to do it when he dies but he's already doing it now he's going to the very bottom of the world the very place where animals eat right to the to the foundation of all things and so you have this canonic element as well all right and so and then all of this is of course leading to the final image right and this is the final image which restores the story from the beginning we have to understand the heavenly jerusalem as the final restoration even of you could say cain not say kane is saved i don't know god knows that but it's it's the restoration of the very first moment of that sin that sin of murder that led to civilization is being transfigured is being filled you know in the image of the heavenly jerusalem which comes down and if you read it if you read the text it's very powerful right it says i did not see a temple in the city because the lord of god almighty and the lamb are its temple the city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it for the glory of god gives it light and the lamp is its lamp this is where it's related to to what i i'm telling you about in terms of how do we make our identities proper how do we make our rejoicing our celebrations proper it says the nation will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it so what do the kings do they offer their glory to god they bring their glory into service of the heavenly jerusalem on no day will its gates ever be shut for there will be no night there the glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it and again a repetition of that very theme which is all our identities all these little identities that we have if we live them properly we live them in service we live them in in giving them up towards the true king and so there's nothing wrong with being american or canadian or or french or whatever identity that you that you participate it doesn't have you could also be like part of a soccer team or a football team or part of of something that you recognize as being you something that you participate in that gives you a sense of meaning and a sense of purpose all those things can can really be filled if they are ultimately you know directed towards the the heavenly jerusalem towards the highest good towards towards the the highest image and in this image again surprisingly enough you have these two images represented quite powerfully in this particular image which is you see the christ you see christ in glory christ as the king christ as the ruler of all the one who fills the world with his power and his judgment and then on him is the lamb which is the sacrifice and those two together are what these two images i talked about this eschatological and cannotic image coming together as being what the christian what christianity proposes as a possible solution to to art to identity to the way we participate in the world so thank you everybody [applause] thank you jonathan i have to say that was fantastic i was cheering there as you got to the end and i want to give the first question to rj but don't worry i decided all kind of summarize a little bit of what i heard from jonathan to get us going when i'm teaching a great text or have students listen to a great guest lecture i often try to pull out some key scenes and i wanted to do that here i was doing that myself as i was listening and we were having a conversation yesterday about thinking visually i often kind of teach visually okay how would i organize what jonathan said and i wanted to highlight some really key terms and the mic is not on so good okay is the mic on now great okay sorry especially for those of you on live stream what i would like to do to start us off is to pull out what i heard were some really key themes from jonathan and if we don't get through them all today we also i mean this morning we also have the breakout sessions with him later but what i thought the very first thing you said really struck me and i have like this schema that i have right on the one hand there's identity as performance or identity as participation i also heard you say we can think of art as tearing down or gathering we can think of how we interact with the material world and art as something that's a manipulation or a celebration art can have an impact on our common life by promoting division or union we can think that what goes into art is purely arbitrary or there's form foreign then we can think about our relationship to the material world as one of possessing or offering and then i thought you pulled it together so beautifully because after kind of laying out those tensions around the place of art and identity and culture you then offered a vision you know aiden this morning kept talking about art as offering a vision and you offered an incredible beautiful vision of what art could be because you brought in the transcendent you brought in god you started with the cross and you talked about worship and the eschatological and the eucharist and you essentially let us to see that the proposal of christianity is that the heavenly jerusalem can be made known through form and through worship and through art and then flow back out in a healing river to a culture that has suffered a lot of division and manipulation and tearing down and in a way of forgetting of who we are as human persons so that's what i took away from your talk jonathan does that sound do would you own that most of it i would say no and i didn't miss anything i just i'm saying just i would say i i would say that i would say that at least in our situation i i don't like the heavenly jerusalem is eschatological right so in some ways it can't be completely known by human forms now it can be you can be it can bring you closer right and so you can be brought into an inkling and into a a an anticipation and into a a let's say a smell of of what is the final revelation and in some ways it has to do so you know i i didn't go as deep into the notion of memory but that's the best way to understand it it's like you know we think we only remember things in the past but actually no we also remember the future and that's an that's a moment when we're remembering the future you know we're we're actually remembering in the in the future and you do it all the time by the way it's not weird it's not like this weird magical thing i'm saying you know every time you build something you're remembering the future because you haven't made your thing yet and so you're you're looking into the in the the future and you're remembering towards that point and that and the heavenly jerusalem is the ultimate version of that right thank you i'll just say there's a there's a term already and not yet that's a kind of anticipation i turn it on i think thanks so much for your talk margarita thank you for the invitation thanks to all of you for being here i apologize for my eye patch i'm not cosplaying pirate whatever my seven-year-old thing recovering from eye surgery margarita had asked me to think about some of the questions of art and jonathan's talk as they relate to the political common good of how we might think of the the work of the artist contributing or failing to contribute in some ways from your own talk to the ability to have a shared common political life so we see this i think in many ways in your discussion of the gathering together the folk dance brings a common good of the dance the temple which is raised high above the city gives a source of unity and direction to the people so that there's a kind of common good but i'd like to explore a little bit some of the challenges that i think we face at the contemporary moment and wonder if art's up to the task in some ways of needing to do what what we need it to do so first if we think about some of the challenges facing us in the political common good i think it's not the case that everyone goes to washington dc and venerates at the jefferson and lincoln memorials if anything it may be quite the opposite so some months ago when margarita mentioned that i may be part of this panel i watched some of your videos and this week i thought i'd better watch some of them again i was watching very serious videos about symbolic realism but then because of the wickedness of the powers of the algorithms on youtube there was on the side a conversation about the inverted pentagram talk about you so of course i had to watch about the inverted pentagram and in your conversation you mentioned how the pentagram the right side up pentagram has a source of unity at the head and then you have the the top of the triangle and then you have the four differences brought into unity the inverted pentagram is quite the opposite the inverted pentagram is trying to in some sense bring unity at the bottom out of the many e pluribus unum from the many one but it doesn't work and you make of in that talk a very interesting suggestion which is you you suggest that in our own cultural moment not having a source of unity we're trying instead to fragment by going to the margins those who were the previously the oppressed or the marginalized the sub-altern their experiences are privileged and there's not a veneration for unity in fact a whole lot of our culture looks like the angel in front of the church at montreal prime minister trudeau recently said that the nation of canada has no identity at all it's a post-identity nation it's the inverted pentagram that's why i moved to the united states where it is also e pluribus unum though but but not working so that's when the political reality seems very difficult two the power of the arts to do this many years ago the welsh poet david jones wrote his epic poem the anathemata it's his attempt to recreate british identity through art and it fails miserably no one understands any of the references to the earth arthurian legends and in fact the introduction to the poem begins with his notion of the break which is that because there is no cultural memory there can be no art he says the poet is dead the poet can't make reference to wood and assume that the citizen will think of the cross or the tree of life there'll be no reference at all you can't refer to water because there'll be nothing there to refer to even some of the images that you refer to here i wonder about their their power so you show us the reference of tubal kane the image of tubal cane that you showed us is from the spanish chapel in santa maria novella those of us in my own school call that fresco the triumph of saint thomas aquinas but tubal kane is in the very bottom right of the piece there's a narrative unity prior to the works of cain if you think of the piece at the top we have the holy spirit descending upon the upper room where the disciples are gathered around our lady and she's immediately above thomas aquinas who is the source of synthesis it's a dominican propaganda piece across the wall is the dominicans dressed as dogs attacking and tearing apart the heretics thomas is above a varuese arias and nestor and all of that theology and holy spirit provides the back story for the arts and sciences and tubal kane is on the very bottom and the very right and the ordering of the arts and sciences is from the least important to the most important yeah it's always the point of view of the people in the icon that will help you understand which side he's on yeah and then very briefly the tabernacle that you referred to lord rabbi jonathan sacks used to use the image of the tabernacle in a very interesting way he would say the story of creation in genesis 1 is very short the story of the creation of the tabernacle is very long it goes on and on and his take was it's very easy for god to make a home for us and very difficult for us to make a home for god but that the story of the tabernacle was in some ways the story of the formation of the hebrews themselves as they made it but then he would also remind the reader but of course there had been a story before of god making the people so what is it that we're remembering now if the break is so severe and are the arts really up to the task no i don't think i don't think the arts are up to the task in it it's if you think of it in the political realm there's no way there's no it's not possible that you know there's a you can really understand it if you want to understand what's going on you can understand the culture in what it celebrates if you want to know where our culture is just look at what it celebrates and then you will see what's going on in that culture and right we could say in some ways that if you think of a traditional church of like a medieval gothic church you had the altar in the center and then you had the knave and the narthex and then outside you have the gargoyles and the and the weirdness and it's actually you know we looked at the manuscripts yesterday and and in late medieval manuscripts they had that very structure in the manuscript itself where in the middle of the manuscript you had even a sacred image and then on the outside and on the margins you had even sometimes quite lewd and and you know vulgar or or humorous or kind of crazy images of mixtures of different animals and all this stuff and so you know there's a sense in which our whole culture right now is like worshiping the carnival is the best way to understand it it's like like we're we're worshiping the gargoyles like all the idiosyncrasy all the strangeness and but it's important to understand that the carnival has a role or the carnival isn't bad the carnival is good we need the carnival purim is a is like a celebration in the bible like it and we have we have mardi gras we have carnival in the orthodox tradition right so there's nothing there's nothing wrong with carnival it's always about its place right and there's nothing and the gargoyles are fine if they're in the proper place now if we flip it and then we take the gargoyles and put them on the altar right then you have the they have the problem with the abomination right you have this and all of a sudden it becomes like a scandal to have that and so our our culture through many many iterations has come to a point where there is this like worship of of carnival is the only way to say it in terms of entertainment in terms of of the this kind of upside down and you know swirling culture all of that is is what what carnival is think about just like a giant carnival wheel just you're going around with like with with clown music playing like that's that that's what we celebrate so i don't think politically it is possible to deal with that because politically the solution to that is not a great one because politically it's like all right well now we're gonna just bring the knife down and you know the end of carnival is lent right remember that and so it's like we're gonna fast now and so that's a dangerous it's a day it's like a dangerous move when i showed you ilinsky and the russian constructivist and the and the russian artist the same thing was happening in germany things were chaotic dada and all this weird stuff and then the knife came down and what you have after that is a kind of authoritarian reaction to the carnival and honestly i don't think politically it's a solution that's why i think the solution is a is a religious one there is no other solution the solution is to turn our hearts towards god to become saints to become to become the thing that we're talking about to live it out in our families to live it out in the world around us and to know that that you know that remnant whatever however it looks you know it will ride the ark through the through the waters and to me that is really you know and i and i'm not against political action i think political action is fine but i but i don't think that i really don't think the solution ultimately is there [applause] thank you jonathan i wanted to just you know continue with this conversation if you could perhaps say a little bit more about following on rj's question about the civic so the so the solution is not a political solution it's at turning us back to god but then could you talk us through what that just what that would look like right if we turned back to god and then that specifically yeah well because i think the implication was that if we turn back to god it'll have an influence on the civic okay so i'm fine i'm trying to talk about that one of the problems we're facing right now especially all you in america i'm canadian it's it's weirder but it's different that is that one of the problems we have is that if we don't have the top place which is held by the divine logos all we have are idols and so one of the things that's happening is that we expect the we expect the founders of your nation we expect the important people that have led to his important historical transformations to be god that's what we expect because because the problem that's happening is people are seeing their sin and then they're freaking out like they're sinners destroy the statue right and that's that's the problem that's what happens like when things fall into the political sphere that's what happens right those statues of stalin and of lenin they are gods for all intents and purposes they are the highest point of attention and so this is the this is the problem now if if i think the medievals had a really interest had an interesting way of seeing it you know they they had this whole tradition they called the nine worthies where they would celebrate the people the ancients of the past and there were there were a certain amount that were like from the old testament and then there was pagans and there was people in their own age and you know when they celebrated alexander they would say this is why we celebrate alexander and these are his sins this is why we celebrate this person and these are his sins but it's like yeah that's it that's that's what it means to be human but that is also because our highest point of attention was beyond those people right it wasn't a kind of worship of the political leader it was something which moved beyond it so i could i ask you maybe a follow-up to that jonathan you know we had a conversation on youtube a while ago about mary the mother of god and i've been teaching a class on ecumenical devotion to mary here at princeton theological seminary and i taught that class because there seemed to be a renewed interest among my protestant students to think about mary mary in revelation mary in scripture and then i had a local artist who's here with us today juana belcher whose art is in the room come give a presentation on prototypes of marion art and boy the students were just fascinated by the images and so as i've taught this class i've actually begun to wonder if maybe you know we said you just said a moment ago the answer isn't purely political i i wonder if part of the enduring attraction of mary the mother of god is that it connects the liturgical and the charismatic the church and the home and that maybe what liturgical art can do and proper veneration including veneration for mary the mother of god it can make the faith that you're talking about personal and from the home then can outflow the the the the grace to build unity right i mean i think sometimes people want to build community with a strategy anyone ever been to a community building strategy session yeah i mean you all laugh right community has got to be built person by person and i think somehow i'm just conjecturing here that mary the mother of god represents that that personal person to person that what happens in sunday worship has got to be taken into the home in into the place of the messiness of home life with pain and suffering but also celebration and joy and from the church to the home and then back out into society so is that my question i guess is mary the mother of god and i know i think i think for sure the mother of god is important in especially even because she is in some ways that body right she she's that place where it comes together in the sense that she's that gathering you know you saw in the image of ascension it's well it's beautifully represented where she stands in the center and and all the all the disciples gather around her you know it's like she's this mother that is kind of gathering them inside and so she she is of course an image of the church like the culmination of the of the church on earth you could say i don't know how to say it in the right way but and then then also she she's also been very much the great protector of cities by the way because she is also an image of the city or the common or the the the coming together people and so you know when when the the the barbarians would come to the gates of constantinople they would take the the icon of the mother of god and they would parade on the walls with that icon and there are many examples of you know them just turning back or all kinds of miraculous stories and then of course the the image of the protection of the veil which some of you might have seen where there there's a kind of a version of that in catholic art too you see the mother of god standing above the church and she's holding a veil which protects you know the the common protects the unity in the the catholic tradition you have this image of her with her with her coat like her vestment open and then all the people that are gathered inside her and so i think that it's that definitely there is something in order to embody and in order to to be able to understand the common and the places where we we can recognize each other and recognize each other as participating in something that binds us that that her example and her her guidance is useful well and i'll just say i mean i i began this morning you know and i talked to you about how when i visited my mother's home village in cuba that the villagers came out and after 40 years they had preserved the memory of the people that had lived there before and the stained glass windows with the blessed mother and roses not only had the church been desecrated the rose garden that my mother remembered was gone right if we don't protect our churches and our sacred art people stopped planting roses you know and then after time you know what else happened they stopped working because if we tell people that they're only made to work and they're not made to garden and they're not made to worship people in cuba stopped working and i asked myself these people have preserved for 40 years these windows what have i preserved for 40 years you know the only thing i could think of that i've not thrown away in all my moves well two things photographs of family members i have preserved and an icon of the mother of god that i got when my best friend got married in cyprus and i've taken that icon and i've kissed it i've slept with it when i was scared or upset and it comes with me on every single trip photographs of my family and an icon of the mother of god help me connect remember past present and future help keep me grounded to those mysteries that happen in the sacred liturgy and remind me as you know aiden talks as if it's so easy to live up to our vocation as human beings i often want to you know pull back and just kind of put the covers over my head but when i have that icon with me and i have the memory of the people who've gone before me i remember that my life has a purpose and that i'm participating in something and i'm not doing it alone thank you jonathan [applause]
