walmart is turned on and so am i that's right after being laughed out of town when their overpowered series of gaming desktops received universally negative reviews walmart is now back with a full slew of gaming peripherals we got speakers monitors webcams microphones keyboards mice desk pads and even the desk itself some of it's good some of it literally smells like poo and i'll tell you all about it after this segway to our sponsor nzxt nzxt wants to make building a custom pc easier with nzxt build just set a budget see how the computer performs with your favorite games and build takes care of the rest use the link below to get your own custom pc today our journey begins with the aptly named home trends computer desk they helpfully left out words like trendy or deluxe and they do admit that it's made of pvc has a soft closed door though oh well hold on sorry there you go having not seen the listing on their site i'm guessing 119 canadian dollars wow well you're not you say canadian i said canadian you're ten dollars over on the canadian price i'm ten dollars over wow well that's pretty good i'm not saying i'd pay that for it yeah and especially when you consider that you could just go to ikea do the classic like countertop plus four legs and a set of alex drawers for half the price yes well if you get the alex drawers it's like ten dollars more certainly it'll be larger this is like a little linus size desk well we brought you a little linus sized chair ew what makes this a gaming chair other than that it's rgb sort of this isn't the actual gaming chair that we got you this is just their default office chair i see this is their default office chair whose office has you know what to their credit the butt cushion on this is actually better than almost any chair i've ever encountered under like a hundred bucks yeah that might be true for the first half hour i'm guessing no i'm guessing 89.99 u.s or canadian canadian it's 69.99 canadian it's 69.99 canadian yeah and if feasibly if it's for like a child who's very lightweight the foam was probably going to be plenty of support and it is kind of child sized along with this desk let's get some gaming accessories i think the first thing we have to start with is our monitor oh that's a cute pun i thought the monitor was just called the game which i guess i lost now but it's game on which i guess is more just their slogan and the product is the curved qhd gaming monitor well that's definitely for gamers it's very light are you getting the point based on like how easily i can label this around you've got what used to be speaker grills down here clearly this is a repurposed chassis from a different model of display because there's no speakers in there you got hdmi one hdmi 2 and display port you should power in external power brick and a headphone jack base a mounting though that's always nice to have and it's got joystick style controls nice quick and easy assembly so far though it's completely tool-less up till now wow this is surprising it comes with both a display port and an hdmi cable which isn't a big deal for a high-end monitor but for budget monitors where they're trying to save every couple of dollars it's an unexpected inclusion it means that it'll be ready to go for both your gaming pc and your console if you're in your dorm room or whatever right out of the box i'm saying this puppy is 239.99 us 209 usd 209. okay well i'm glad i didn't go higher and wait it's even got height adjust okay none of that wow suck on that apple oh do these have on branding on them no these are just the most generic displayport cables i've ever seen that's funny because they actually sell on hdmi cables and on premium hdmi cables for twice the price wow what makes the premium ones premium the price i mean before we get anywhere we need something to plug it into protect on oh i thought it was a joke when it was like game on yeah they even they're still making puns here hang on what hang on oh i get it and you know protect on that thing that everyone says yeah protect holy crap this is dollar store grade but with 5 volt 2.4 amp shared charging man i'm sorry i know this is going to derail things a little bit do you want to guess the price before we go in there the price better not be more than like 10 bucks 25. this boy got mashed initially i thought there was absolutely nothing clamping down this main ac power cord like i thought you could just pull on this thing and it would just heave on the solder joints but that's not actually the case the plastic molding has these little ribs that use this screw and this one to kind of clamp down on it to be clear it's not great but it's something well let's get you to the accessories we're back to gaming on yes oh this is a mechanical keyboard hey oh that's that's why it's called rgb mechanical keyboard satisfying sharp click well i think satisfying and sharp is a little optimistic also do they mention what kind of blue switches no they don't but these are extremely twangy cheap blue switches plastic base but metal deck actually decent flex multiple cable channels height adjust i'd never buy it at this price because i recognize the legend on the keys and i know that you can get boards from this manufacturer for like 40 to 45 us dollars but i'm going to say this one is 60. 44.94 really yeah with the wrist rest and everything all right i just want to highlight i was taking a look through the quick start guide because i think quick start guides for things like keyboards are funny here's a way that they cut some costs you can download the software at their website but do you think that they paid money to get onn.com oh no it's o n www.onn dot tech braided cable storage for the dongle on the base okay you got my attention onn no you're supposed to say you're turning me on color indicated dpi cycling probably forward and back buttons on both sides it's ambidextrous i'm kind of into this if this is less than like 45 bucks then i like it a lot type c charging oh what got logitech beat 36.88 what okay man we've now done monoprice amazon basics and i think aliexpress for gaming setups i think walmart might be coming out ahead right now what are the flipping odds especially given their inauspicious start in the category they haven't gone the amazon route of trying to do everything they have a lot of different stuff under the on brand but they're not like trying to make 20 different versions of any everything which seems good this could be for now though it could get much worse they could end up sprawling and making a bunch of well we haven't tried any of it yet yeah it's still plenty of time for it to be terrible how much is the wired one i would guess around the same price given that it has very similar specs oh it does have a different body type well with all the savings they can make on shipping those lightweight mice they come in at 24.88 do you have the scale is the scale here i don't think the lightweight mouse is light 100 grams and i'm even supporting the cable here how much is the wireless one 110 and it has a battery in it and for context the super light is 63 grams yeah all right see you later we have much better boxes for our mouse pads just want to say lttstore.com much higher quality packaging oh god it's rgb here's your micro b power input all right the top fabric is nothing special this is a freebie grade mouse pad but with rgb strapped to it i would never pay this but i'm assuming it's like 20 bucks 16.88 okay if you want to stream surf on ring light webcam with autofocus 1440p resolution oh that's a mistake and a built-in microphone i think the built-in ring light is probably worth an extra five bucks so i'm saying it's 20 the webcam with ring light comes to 29.94 juice on wireless charging lamp charging pad wirelessly charges your qi enabled device led charging indicator oh okay you can kind of position it wherever you want i mean i'm sure it's not high cri or whatever but like if you just want a little led lamp to wow it really stays exactly where you put it very adjustable what's cri cri i actually don't know what it stands for but i know that sorry color rendering index basically what it means is that the light outputs within a very narrow band of the visible spectrum so you don't just have a messy wavelengths that are not supposed to be there might not be super accurate because we have we do have filming like here but like if we get really close that's 82 that's that's actually not terrible actually but the red channel is really bad right okay so if you're filming don't buy this like so wireless charging work only one way to find out ah yep immediately and for only 1988 not bad yeah of course we need some way to listen to audio yeah because it sure isn't going to be through the empty speaker holes on our monitor break the silence the days of lip reading on your pc are over what these better not be more than 25 bucks the speakers with volume and bass control are 19. nice but i mean wow that's been a good trend is that you've been overestimating most well it's more than i just thought like with inflation you know cheap crappy computer speakers were 20 bucks when i was a kid so i kind of thought well surely they've gone up a little like i haven't shopped for them since then right and now for the pace to live resistance the walmart computer what it doesn't exist they've been shamed out of existence they don't make any computers anymore really yeah there's no pre-builts they don't even have laptops for sale anymore just their tablets so is this based on parts that are available on walmart's website or is this just a test bench this is just my test bench oh okay there we go it's on it was funnier when i did it what is this wallpaper i'm sorry i'm going to design it hey no this is this is my test bench i have i chose my wall oh my god you set this wallpaper and then the activation window closed and now it cannot be changed what could i say i'm a hacker man i could they came this has been a while oh oh yeah they like literally just got delivered great we've got our headset i think we should maybe consider these for wan show because i don't know if we have podcast mics rechargeable and wireless and based on the pricing i've seen so far i'm gonna guess i don't know 65 bucks the wireless gaming headset is 52 52 bucks and i still managed to come in over comes with both a usb c charging cable and a three and a half millimeter it's a four pole jack four pole yeah so well oh no it's not for i was thinking like like audio file for a pull this is just because it has the mic on the same plug yes yeah it's been a while since i've been this impressed by a budget product lineup every single one of these i have overestimated the price walmart you heard it here first put that on your box cheaper than linus expected and you know what holy crap this is not a tn panel what it's not a good non-tn panel but it's not tien i'd say it's ips because you can really see that blue glow when it's off axis to be clear that's not a bad thing at all wait onto dot tab wait holy crap it doesn't even load up a site it just immediately starts downloading the setup software [laughter] not sketchy that is absolutely terrifying as an end user i would not if i wasn't making this video i would not want to open any file that just automatically downloads when i visit a url it didn't even like look at this i didn't even realize it was downloading something like watch this it doesn't even change the page i'm on professional sound quality with cardioid recording pattern ideal for podcast vlogs and voiceovers say it again testing testing is this thing on dammit they took the joke from us this is one of those products where i have seen impressive cheap cardioid desktop mics so it's entirely possible this thing doesn't suck that's not bad even with this light right behind me though that is very usable for 30 bucks have you turned the ring light on huh i have no idea how to turn the ring lights on oh my god what just happened is it touch oh it's touched it's up here it's right there's a label right there now let's try the ring light it's underwhelming it's like no brighter than your display oh wow yeah check this out david how can you have below zero for context let's go ahead and measure one of our studio lights we're at 96 and you can see the biggest difference is this red channel here that's really really important for natural skin tones because of all the you know blood coursing behind our skin so if you have a streaming light with absolutely no red channel output it shouldn't be surprising that you look like a ghost or at least i do we forgot to record the audio so let's do this again we're gonna start with the microphone right on the webcam and i was supposed to play games like i'm a streamer right now or something like that it's not working very well we just applied a driver update from amd and the game is just it's not working so let's switch over to the headset mic and i'll give you guys a audio sample from that and yeah it's crazy like i'm firing i can't i can't see anything so let's just go back to the windows desktop and let's give the podcaster microphone a couple of different chances here first from its position right now under the monitor and then second there we go if you want to try and get it a little closer to your mouth in front of the keyboard it's not the most ergonomic thing ever but walmart doesn't have an arm so as a walmart gamer i guess i don't get an arm give it a chance to kind of sound a little richer and more podcasty i can't hear any of this you guys are going to have to be the judges so it turns out these microphones are really spicy and you need to turn them way down in windows to get them not to clip like insanely so here's one with them not clipping this is the podcast microphone it's placed right in front of me and then here's some keystrokes in the background you know i'm typing a message and then here's the audio for the webcam same deal keystrokes in the background let us know what you think hopefully they sound a little bit better than when linus did it 13 14 year old me would have been happier than a pig to have a setup like this [music] like [music] would 13 or 14 year old you want one of these wait what is this this is what happens when you search gaming chair on walmart it's the x rocker play 2.0 floor rocker gaming chair it's got two speakers in it folds for storage it can't be worse than what i'm sitting on right now okay i kind of want this ew it smells like a fart my god smell it oh my god it smells like actual horse it can't be that bad oh my god no david it smells pure it's it actually smells like poop what the why what do they do i don't know but it smells really bad i don't want to sit on the poo chair here's your audio input it runs on 5 volt 1 amp power i give you my personal linus tech tips guarantee that these speakers sound as bad as they smell i've heard enough this thing sucks can we please return this one yes yeah it smells like i really do not want to have this in the building and i'm going to say 75 99 no they their 2.1 version comes on a pedestal so we can sit at couch height and that's 278. no
