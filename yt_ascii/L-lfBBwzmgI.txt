which software engineers get paid the most 
don't lie if you are a software developer   software engineer you definitely have googled 
this before or is it just me am i alone in this   it's completely natural to wonder which kind of 
specialty field in software engineering gets paid   the most whether you actually want to pursue it 
or not that's another thing i thought today it'd   be really fun to sit down and just google what 
software engineering roles get paid the most   now i really want to highlight something here that 
even though there are some very high paying roles   in software engineering don't just choose a role 
specifically because of the big price tag that   comes along with it and this is so important to 
highlight because even if you choose a role that   typically isn't paid as well as a role that is 
paid more usually if you are really passionate   about that role and you want to grow into that 
role the money will follow whatever you're   passionate in and i know it sounds kind of cheesy 
but it's so true the money will really follow   mugsy versus just doing something 
for the sake of getting more money   you might actually find that in end you 
don't get as much money because there's no   you're not putting in the extra 
effort or the passion is just lacking   before we get into it though make sure to hit

topics that you want me to cover and okay let's go   question for you what do you have in common with 
me and the engineering leaders at amex slack   netflix and more we are all attending the interact 
conference on april 7th for free i'm so excited   to be participating in the interact conference 
not only as an attendee but also as a speaker   this is a one day conference featuring 20 speakers 
all selected by thousands of engineering leaders   in the dev interrupted community if you are a 
developer team lead vp or cto that is looking to   improve your team this is the virtual conference 
for you plus you get to join us for a live taping   of the dev interrupted podcast interviewing 
american express vp of engineering which is   mind-blowing the people that you get to hear from 
and get to hear their wisdom and advice and what   you know from their failures to successes and 
so much more i mean the fact that this is free   when the information is can't even put a 
number on it is i'm so excited make sure to   go to devinterrupted.com interact to register 
today also i want to share with you some more   speakers that i am really looking forward to 
hearing on the day of the interact conference   one being sarva nas who is the vice 
president of technology at american express   another is luca the founder of refactoring.club 
trung anne a vp of engineering and employee number   one at flow sport which is pretty cool and jenny 
who is the director of engineering at reprise   and is responsible for engineering execution and 
recruitment hearing insight and advice from some   of the top engineering leaders is something 
that we typically don't get the opportunity   to do whether you are a leader yourself or 
someone who is aspiring to become one not to   mention what something that's really unique to 
this conference is that you can keep networking   after the conference is done a lot of you 
ask this is a great example probably the   best one of something that you can hone in 
on and really use your networking skills for   dev interrupted has a discord server with 
over 2 000 engineering leaders that are   constantly it feels really like a big community 
i have linked the signup page for interact down   below in the description once again this is a 
one day conference completely free and i will   be attending and speaking and just soaking 
up all the information with you so go attend for this video for purposes of this 
video i've done a lot of research on   what engineering roles keep on coming up as the 
highest paying but that taken into consideration   one thing you need to remember is these roles 
and these salaries will vary greatly based on   location based on company and based on years of 
experience so don't base the numbers i'm sharing   with you solely on these need to be reflected 
on to your experience maybe you have experience   where you have gotten paid more maybe the 
experience we've gone paid left less but   don't get too caught up on this it's more 
so to say hey these are the roles that are   really in demand for this video i am using info 
world they have on their website the' highest   paying developer roles in 2021 and i really 
liked this resource because where these came   from where this data came from is so important 
to me where are we getting this information   and in this case we are getting the information 
from robert happ's 2022 salary guide and this   is a salary guide that is done every year for the 
highest paying software developer or engineering   roles in the us so this is us-based that's another 
thing to say that's very important and all of the   salaries listed in this are in us dollars shoes 
are at the top or bottom that is a real question   i feel like we gotta start at the bottom and 
work our way to number one okay let's do that   i was deciding if we should start at the bottom or 
top like the highest paying to the least highest   paying when i say lease it's still very high 
paying but i think we're just going to mix it   in together different roles and because once again 
these are all very in demand roles so the pricing   or the salary will vary coming in at number one 
is cloud and software architects according to   the robert half salary guide the highest paying 
role that was non-c-suite for 2021 in the u.s   was a cloud architect with the average salary for 
cloud slash art network architect being 153 000   to'0 thousand then right underneath of that for 
an applications architect it'd be a hundred and   fifty thousand to a hundred and eighty thousand 
now i don't think i need to say this but obviously   these are all annual salaries so what exactly 
though does a cloud architect do an architecture   role essentially whether you're a cloud architect 
whether you are application architect you are   overseeing the company's it infrastructure so 
you are really working with whether it be the   client or the company itself that you work for 
to understand what technologies are best to use   and how to build a system how to build how are 
you going to build a system for this company   so in the case of the cloud this could include 
cloud adoption plans cloud application design   cloud management and monitoring okay let's move on 
to the next one we are going to talk about which   is software and applications manager of course on 
a management level you typically do get paid more   the more senior you get so there's no surprise 
here what is listed for a salary of software and   applications manager is a hundred and forty two 
thousand to a hundred and sixty six thousand and   i think this is pretty explainable as to what a 
manager does for software and applications at a   manager level you typically aren't coding as much 
maybe some companies you will be others you won't   but you're managing a group of people now this 
is similar to a dev lead role in the sense that   you're managing people and if they have questions 
you are going to them and in some companies   the title is actually interchangeable but at a 
lot of companies a manager level is higher than   a dev lead role and in the case of that you are 
coding less you are managing doing more of the   people management side but to some degree still in 
the software side another high high-paying role is   of course senior software engineer and this is a 
role that is between 135 000 to 162 000 annually   typically i'm going to stop saying typically 
because you get the point of this and a senior   software engineer what they do once again varies 
place to place but from my experience as a senior   software engineer or developer what it really 
entails of is you're taking more of a lead role   so you're helping other software developers or 
engineers in their career if they have questions   they come to you you're still really in the code 
base but there's a lot more meetings involved   a lot more discussions involved in how the 
software is built what features are coming up   and the natural kind of progression from a 
senior software engineer is to become a dev lead   some companies already align senior with devlea 
like once you become a senior you're immediately   a dev lead where i work that is not the case 
you can be a senior and then the next kind of   mini step is devlead but some companies intertwine 
them both okay let's talk about another one that   is super popular and for a long time i really 
wanted my career to go in this direction   i don't know if anymore but and i find that really 
interesting because as you grow in your career   you find different areas that are interesting 
to you versus what you thought you wanted to   do even a few years ago which i really love that 
about technology and the tech industry is you're   constantly evolving as the technology does too or 
you should be anyways or else you're going to be   stuck really far in the past very quickly this 
role is devops engineers i think this is i know   everyone says data science is a sexy role but i 
think devops engineers is a sexy role i don't know   why but i've always been very like thought that is 
such a cool role like people who are in devops wow   they they are just geniuses they know everything 
anyways so if you're in deb ops kudos to you   okay let's see what is the average devops 
engineer salary so in this case it's a hundred   and twenty five thousand to a hundred and forty 
nine thousand now something similar to devops   is a site reliable site reliability engineer 
with the salary range from 126 000 to 154 000. make money rain is that what they say i don't 
know i'm really i'm really outdating myself   here just stay in my tech bubble but devops 
engineer is another great great role to do   and to kind of get into more of what exactly 
is a devops engineer because that's something   that i had the question of for a long time 
and i think it's because it varies so much   place to place company to company that this role 
always intrigued me as to what exactly do they do so for this in this case rather than giving my 
own explanation which i'm sure will be very wordy   i just simply googled what is devops engineer 
so this is an explanation according to red hat   a devops engineer introduces processes tools 
methodologies to balance needs throughout the   software development life cycle from coding 
to deployment to maintenance and updates   and i also think it's really interesting like many 
technical roles a devops engineer needs a lot of   soft skills too a lot of good communication 
skills working in teams working together   problem solving skills it's not just as much as 
technical skills are important soft skills are   equally if not almost more important i would 
argue because without the proper communication   it doesn't matter how technically technical you 
are if you can't communicate what is going on i   think it'd be very hard to do this role i think 
regardless of what path you choose to go down   just even knowing what jobs or the highest 
paying jobs within software engineering   that are in demand is really interesting because 
if you're like me and you're kind of figuring out   what area you still want to specialize in 
for me for example i thought it was devops   but now it's continuing it's always been cloud 
and i have a lot of different certifications in   clap i never thought i wanted to pursue it 
as much but it is really interesting to me   and i guess i'm sharing that because regardless of 
what path you want to go down just being aware of   what jobs and what roles are most in demand can 
help you as far as figuring out if you have a   wide variety of interests where you maybe want 
to hone in on specific interests especially if   they align with one of these career paths i will 
link everything down below the salary guides all   of that so you can check it out as well because 
it's super interesting to me and it isn't to be   showy or braggy or anything like that but rather 
the opposite let's educate ourselves on what roles   are out there what the salaries are so we can make 
informed decisions sounds like a parent like a   parent ad or something but it's true also if you 
haven't already i linked interact down in track   conference down below in the description this 
is a free conference a one day free conference   i will be speaking at the event i will be 
attending the event it's gonna be phenomenal   speaking of engineering the top engineering 
leaders as i mentioned earlier are going to be   there speaking so it's such a great way whatever 
stage of career you are at to soak up all this   information and advice that they will be providing 
okay i'll see you all soon thanks everyone okay
