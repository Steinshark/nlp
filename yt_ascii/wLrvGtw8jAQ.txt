hello everyone and welcome this is the second of a five-part series where i have teamed up with formula e and in this video we're gonna be talking about whether or not the future of transportation is electric and what role electric cars have in the future of transportation so to help answer this i was at the mexico city iii and while i was there i was asking this question you know what is the future of transportation to all of the engineers the team managers that i could find and so there was quite a bit of good insight that they shared and so i want to bring up five of the points that were kind of brought up during those discussions and talk about you know what is the future of transportation so first up i was speaking with lukas de grassi who is the season3 formula ii champion he also has been making a remarkable comeback this season for he's also the ceo of a robo race so electric or autonomous racing and he also and all the other free time that he has is developing an electric bicycle so an electric bike that has a hundred kilometers of range on a single charge so very cool work that he's done he's a brilliant dude and also a very good driver and so i was speaking with him and one of the great points that he brought up was that you know electric adoption is all about size and so if you think about like laptops and cell phones these all use batteries they're all electric and that makes a ton of sense for small things so small things electric based power makes a ton of sense so having a battery makes a lot of sense as you get larger for example a cargo ship where a cargo ship is paid based on you know how much cargo does it bring so you want a really high energy density fuel like diesel fuel versus a battery which a battery won't have the high energy density like diesel fuel and so that means you would have to have more storage on your cargo ship taken up by batteries taking up more space taking up more weight that could be smaller meaning you know economically it doesn't make as much sense same idea with an airplane so an airplane obviously weight is extremely important the more weight you have the more lift you need to produce to actually fly and so jet fuel very high energy density versus batteries with a lower end density and so you would have to have a lot of weight carrying batteries and that's just wasted energy you know from an energy standpoint you don't want to carry all that excessive weight and so where do cars fit within all of this and they're kind of right there in that happy middle area where for some people based on your scenario they do make a lot of sense if you're in you know a city where you don't have long travel distances battery powered cars do make a lot of sense you know all the infrastructure is right there versus you know let's say you need to tow things well then maybe a battery doesn't make as much sense because you have to have quite a bit more weight in the form of batteries just to be able to tow and pull all that extra weight those extra distance is so it kind of depends on your scenario for you know the current day what makes more sense electric or internal combustion from an energy standpoint and from a cost standpoint and so it's dependent on how that changes with time energy densities whether or not larger vehicles are able to adopt electric technology and battery technology so this brings me to point number two which was with vennett patel who is the chief engineer for mahindra formula e of a very brilliant guy and so what he was saying you know often this comes down to location so what's the environment that you live in if you live in an urban setting so in a city with high congestion short travel distances and charging infrastructure then electric cars do make sense if you're out in the middle of nowhere you know if you live in a more rural environment electric cars don't necessarily make sense because you've got longer travel distances you don't necessarily have the charging infrastructure and so you know things like hybrids in those urban settings or rural settings make sense the infrastructure is all there ready for hybrids they're very efficient they you know have a low environmental impact in comparison to many of the internal combustion engine alternatives so hybrids the infrastructure is all there for in today's current age they do make a lot of sense and then the other point that he was bringing up was hydrogen and so you know it's all about economics and currently economically hydrogen doesn't really make sense it's super expensive and from an efficiency standpoint the energy required to produce it is is worse than if you were to just create energy and put that into an electric car so for a hydrogen car you have to produce the hydrogen then you store that hydrogen in the vehicle then the vehicle turns that hydrogen into electricity and then it uses that electricity to actually move the vehicle versus an electric car you produce the electricity you store it in the electric car and then you power the electric car with the electricity so it's a simpler process there are less losses throughout that process and as a result it makes more economical sense so why might there be a future for hydrogen transportation well simply put there is a ton of hydrogen available so if we can find economically viable ways of producing hydrogen because we have so much of it it's such an abundant element if we can find economical ways of getting it available for use then it could start to make a lot of sense because you do have you know clean energy consumption with hydrogen you don't produce emissions you just bruce water but the cost right now is you know kind of a limiting factor where it's expensive to produce and currently most of that production is done using natural gas now this leads to the third point which was the discussion with delphine bsk who is the team manager for venturi and she actually has a history working in formula one out of college from you know she graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering went to work for williams formula one and worked in development for the curse system so kinetic energy recovery systems and then from there moved on to working in formula e and so very brilliant lady and what she was saying you know ultimately what's going to come down to is which form of energy is do we have sustainable production so there's really two parts you need to look at an electric car is sustainable energy consumption but of course it's also dependent on where does that energy come from so you need to have two parts of the equation and/or to satisfy everyone's needs so you have to have sustainable energy consumption as well as sustainable energy production so whether or not it ends up being electric cars using batteries or electric cars using hydrogen as the fuel source is dependent on whether or not the production of that hydrogen is actually sustainable or the production of those electric cars as well as the energy used for those electric cars is sustainable now historically energy production does become greener with time and so electric cars do start to make sense there so then why might there be an argument for hydrogen well hydrogen vehicles use much smaller batteries because they're using hydrogen as the fuel source they're then transferring that turning it into electricity and storing a small amount of that in a battery but most of that is just used to move the vehicle so if you have smaller batteries then you have a more sustainable option if the production of the hydrogen itself is sustainable now continuing the point that energy production gets greener gets more efficient with time we get to our fourth point which was the discussion i had with nikki shields so she is the formula ii pit lane reporter she also hosts a tv show called supercharged and so when i was discussing with her one of the things she brought up that i thought was a great point is that electric cars get greener with time so what does that mean well let's say you know ten years ago you bought an internal combustion engine vehicle a gasoline car and or ten years ago you bought an electric car so when you first bought those cars they're going to have some carbon footprint and assuming they're very similar in size and everything the electric car may have a slightly higher carbon footprint as a result of needing that battery and so then as you start to use them the electric car has an advantage in transportation because it doesn't produce as much carbon as it's actually driving now that's purely dependent on where it gets its energy from and so if that energy comes from you know purely coal then obviously it doesn't do as well then if it's energy came from solar or renewables and so often this is used as an argument to say that you know electric cars don't make any sense when in reality you know coal only makes up 14% of energy production in the united dates and that number is declining versus renewable energy which doesn't make up 14% yet but the number is increasing and so you have to start to look at the trend and so historically energy production becomes greener becomes has less of a carbon footprint as you you know move on with time so we start to use cleaner methods we start to have more efficient processes of producing electricity and so as a result if your car is electric and you've been driving it for those ten years the energy production part of the equation so you know you have the two parts production and consumption the energy production part starts to get better and as a result the energy consumption of the electric vehicle improves so its carbon emissions improve versus the internal combustion engine the gasoline vehicle ideally it just stays the same with time because it's still you know hopefully getting the same miles per gallon as at you when you bought it new and in those cases that means it's producing the same emissions from its tailpipe as you're driving it now getting to the fifth and final discussion point i was having a discussion with paul vickers who is the engineering director for neo formula ii and the point that he brought up which i think is you know pretty much the one that universally is always going to be true and makes the most sense is that it is all about batteries and so you know how quickly a battery technology develops is basically the only reason of what's going to change evie adoption in general and so battery technology today is not at the point where we have super high energy densities and we also have decently long charging times and so as a result you know the range isn't necessarily there the cost isn't necessarily there and the charge time isn't necessarily there so it's all about improving batteries and as we improve batteries more v's start to make more and more sense and i think that can be demonstrated with vehicles so i'm driving the 2018 nissan leaf in 2011 this had nearly half the battery capacity it was a 24 kilowatt hour of battery and now in 2018 it's a 40 kilowatt hour battery pack in the exact same dimensions so the energy density in those seven years has improved by 67% a tremendous improvement you also have more power more torque and the core actually costs less today than when it was introduced then so everything about the nissan leaf has improved at basically the exact same price point and so if that technology trend continues evie start to make a ton of sense in the future where you have longer ranges faster charging times and you can bring down the price so is the future of transportation going to be electric and i think you know that's heavily dependent again on how much do batteries improve with time i think they do make a lot of sense from an efficiency standpoint from a cost perspective long term from you know an energy cost perspective from how much energy do you need throughout the lifetime of that vehicle there are a lot of advantages to electric course i think the part that now needs to be overcome is simply the battery portion of it which it is improving so the future is always unknown and whether that's going to be a mix of fuel cell and electric vehicles i don't know but it's cool to think about and i thought there were some great perspectives offered by the folks at formula ii so if you guys have any questions or comments i would encourage you to leave those below thank you for watching
