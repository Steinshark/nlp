what's up guys last time i gave a homeless person $10,000 and a lot of you guys were like you should have split it between people dived it up so help so if you want to take it it's about $110,000 i'm not joking you're right so today i have a lot of money we're going to be giving multiple homeless people $1,000 each because that's what you guys wanted and so yeah i'm just going to drive around and try to find some homeless people and this money was given to me by quidd all the thousands of dollars i'm going to be giv giving away to homeless people were provided by an app called quidd so before i show me giving away the money i need to tell you about quidd quidd is a new app on ios and android and it's pretty unique quidd allows you to collect cards and stickers from your favorite shows like breaking bad or adventure time i like adventure time all for free i mean surprisingly it's a free app so as you see you open packs of cards and you collect cards and actually some of these cards are pretty rare there's only a limited amount which makes it kind of cool because you can trade these cards back and forth with your friends and quidd also added new collector packs where you can actually open up mr beast packs like you can actually open up packs and get stickers of me which is like insanely cool and to make it even more interesting and the part that i personally like about the app is that you can send these cards through text messages you can actually drag and drop them onto text messages and you know me and my roommate have watched adventure time before so it's kind of fun just to send them some of those or i'm sure a lot of you have seen breaking bad or know someone who loves breaking bad you could you know open some packs and send them that it's just a cool way to interact with other people that like the same shows as you you can just you know send cards like that through text and i don't know i find it pretty cool hey how are you doing no not much i'm a youtuber and i
