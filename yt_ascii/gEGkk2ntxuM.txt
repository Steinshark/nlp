you got me oh my goodness look at this this person is a phd okay first off i want you to know that when you see someone with whom is a phd okay i just want to let you know that they're probably smarter than you and you should trust every single word that comes out of their mouth so this will accurately describe who i am all right this is it's true your editor tells about you my girlfriend is a phd phd is not thought what is your favorite text editor wait what your favorite text editor reveals about your personality i do want to do this okay hey guess what this was published in towards data science okay not data science but it's just like towards it okay statistics by the way you know there's there's two there's there's there's an old phrase about statistics right there's lies there's damned lies and then there's statistics all right so let's do this okay this would be someone who does not respect themselves because they haven't figured out how to write properly nice nice job uh is claimer the author is a avid vim user okay respects up okay respect is up let's go so the story may not be unbiased besides gender unspecified language what hold on besides gender unspecified language is used for obvious reasons which doesn't mean that the story is free of stereotypes brackets the yuppies okay here we go i'm not exactly sure what just happened here but we're gonna keep on going when did the word yuppie go out of fashion it's a shame because it fits perfectly to the type of person that uses brackets it's the kid with the horn rimmed glasses tweed pants and chest long meticulously trimmed beard who obsessed with the espresso and the cafe around the court what the hell is brackets what the hell is brackets is brackets just yet another vs code clone made with love and javascript dear sweetness stop stop making editors with javascript goodness gracious this should we just have to stop okay you have to stop you have to it's it's inappropriate why because they can make any site look breathtaking in brackets as their go-to tool for that plus for the reasons that nobody understands the layout reminds them of packaging of their favorite beard shampoo got him webstorm the javascript world enthusiast i have a very i have an idea of who uses webstorm this kind of person who's clever but doesn't open their mouth very much the kind of person with wild dreams that nobody knows about the type that would like to see their name in programmers hall of fame but keep quiet about that in other words your average javascript developer yeah got em damn that is like that is just harsh that's the type that uses webstorm tailored to javascript like no other editor the one that is made for people who do javascript world and nothing else okay is that a comic book is that is this supposed to be is this supposed to is this does this picture supposed to be webstorm coda the web developer i don't know what coda is coda deez nuts what is coda is this gonna be another one of those developers instead try out our new next generation foley native mac code editor okay code has been discontinued okay so code is not even a real editor code on deez nuts code a website once but now i'm a janitor all right solely for os x coda is the is it is for the person next door that always runs around with shiny new macbook and creates elusive graphics for the web this is vs code this is vs code vs code can be described as the person who will sit down at starbucks opens their macbook pro drinks coffee and complains on twitter about capitalism they are the macbook crowd they usually they are usually city hoppers and never staying in one place for more than a few months they tried to work working on farm but notice that the chicken drove them mad while they're trying to code that's me yeah i know i'm sorry for being so accurate i'm sorry for attacking you i'm not trying to attack you that's definitely not xcode okay xcode xcode is is a place filled with people who've become sad about development that's what xcode's filled with okay no one wants to open up that's why i'd rather learn and react native okay no one wants xcode one can't help the feeling that this person is hiding thousands of books worth of life experience buying their business casual attire but their masters at hiding their inner secrets from the outside world both on and offline i don't know about this the notepad plus plus the kid oh casey oh the faithful folks who still haven't abandoned windows welcome to the world of messy hair thick tinted spectacles and navy blue sweaters that look like they've been picked from a nearby thrift shop bathed in pizza dough and washed until they're clean enough to not lose that pizza attire damn she's just being mean to casey right now and in other words welcome to the world of no pla notepad plus plus a lightweight tool for ms windows which promises to say do you even have to say ms is ms like a is that a requirement can you just say windows you know exactly that fits this you know for a fact msds nuts a damn it's true users of notepad plus plus care about their cpu space as much about the environment there's just one thing they care even more about you guessed it it's pizza okay sublime text sublime text is the kids that used to sit at starbucks with their macbook pro and complain about capitalism but their generation x and they don't feel heard so now they just sit at home and play eldon ring okay that's what happens they have no idea which file they put where or what they called that variable 50 lines earlier of the code and for that reason that nobody understands they expect their text editor to take care of all the mess welcome to sublime text the text editor that cuts through all the cutter with so many pop-ups and instant switching even between modified and unsaved files that this editor let's see that this is the editor that those people who use who oh my goodness who think they're wait i can't even read the sentence this is the editor that those people use who think their messiness isn't only efficient in their heads but also in their projects this is a roast this is a just a roast you know what albert einstein said about a clean desk right you know what they see you know what he said right he said they say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind well what does an empty desk imply got him albert einstein get wrecked adam the collaborator your typical atom user is the friendliest person on earth always sporting pastel colored sweaters and bringing breakfast for the whole office what's not to like about them i mean to be fair every time they type a key there is like 750 milliseconds of lag so i mean this makes perfect sense they just can't actually work due to them losing their mind they're always let's say they're always happy to be helping when a hand is needed because they can finally use a different editor but they never ask for praise always self-sacrificing if they achieve something they let everybody else collect the prize money but everybody knows that nothing would work without them they're the glue on every team the knuckle in every book welcome to your average atom user when was this written this is in 2020 like a day before covet happened like one day before covet happened this was written i'm pretty sure that adam was already discontinued at that point visual studio code the perfectionists their shoes are squeaky clean their hair is neatly groomed and on their desk there is not one speck of dust what does it say if i know what i'm talking about there are not unfriendly but they're the person who spot let's see who spots the hair in the suit before everyone else everything needs to be perfect there is no space for unwanted debris in their life the same goes for style of coding never i repeat never would they write their name under a piece of code that contains even the tiniest of bugs that's the user of visual studio code debugging is made so easy you don't even need a compiler anymore a must-have for every bug adverse coder am i about to have a philosoraptor point if you have a debugger because you don't need a compiler how does your debugger run the code right like am i a philosoraptor all of a sudden is that what's happening who gave me this link who gave it to me speak up who did this who gave it to me speak up who did this say it joe did damn it joe joe biden you tell me joe budden came in here just to topple this stream it was the javascript community it was written by a nano user it just got back what happened remember she has a phd if there's ever been a better case for why you shouldn't trust a phd i think this article is it i genuinely think that this is pinnacle bad observations okay first off visual studio code users are the ones that are still wearing sweatpants at 1pm they show up to a job interview and drop the f-bomb just to make sure you're cool enough to hear the f-bomb during a coding interview studio people say phrases such as but not limited to i just want a code man okay i don't want my editor i don't want to know my environment i don't want to know anything but just coding okay visual studio code that's me yeah i know okay got him where's vim okay first off netbeans this is okay first off netbeans is like near and dear to my heart okay let's do netbeans your average netbeans user is obsessed with code and beans but especially beans a day cannot start with a holy coffee bean brew of their favorite coffee shop after that they'll stay for the rest of the day frantically hacking around the people actually i did do this okay i did i would spend 12 hours in the coffee shop i did this okay so this is not far off except for i didn't care about the coffee i just wanted the internet and i didn't want to be at my house they're the the they are of the anxious type nope not anxious at all always scared of losing out nope dressed slightly below casual i wore gym shorts every day so yeah always a little jittery and unfocused okay they don't really need coffee to wake up they need coffee to calm themselves down okay yeah that's that's called add that's called add i hope you know that adhd has this peculiar effect where when you drink a lot of coffee it actually kind of slows you down a little bit let's skip over to this is a definitely intellij this is intel if this is i've ever seen intellij this is intellij right there dreamweaver vim the person who hasn't had a haircut in the last three years false false of slanderous okay i cut the hairs of my face yesterday okay who hasn't brushed it for the last five months false the person who stare still wears mom's sweaters for work okay my wife's a mom and she buys me sweaters so i guess technically accurate technically okay they just didn't say who's mom okay i'm a mother lover by the way the person who's let's see the person whose shoes are falling apart okay that's not funny that's not that's not funny okay it's not funny it's not funny welcome to your average user of vin it doesn't get geekier than this one half of the editor war vim is all those who think in a rigid systematic categories and don't need much personalization okay a little incorrect okay now your characterization actually has fallen apart vim is for those who want to personalize them is for those who think personalization is the only state vim is for those who like to learn a structure then never let go of it okay that's fair fair vim is for the geeks of geeks appreciate that appreciate that emacs is the go-to editor for all nerds who haven't reached geek status you know it's probably why lex switched to vs code honestly he couldn't make it he couldn't cut okay he couldn't cut it you know lex still lex i'm still waiting on my podcast to invite lex just saying lex okay i'm over here waiting on you and yet somehow i haven't seen it this is the kind of nerd who has slight dislike for graphical user interface is odd because you run emacs in squeeze okay but you can't go without meow the kind of nerd who likes to write code but still wants their text editor to be capable of more than code yep that sounds right the nerdy person who's in the corner who's always drinking rose wine let's go oh that is a great characterization this is great see how would you turn lex into a 1.5 speed yeah i don't know maybe the person who when asked a black or white question will always answer with an elaborate gray the person who gets up at 11 a.m not because they were sleeping before but because they were too busy thinking about the optimal time to get up you suck at making decisions use emacs this guy uses emacs typical emax user okay typical typical what's wrong with rose just something emax people drink okay because rose is like the ultimate i couldn't decide okay i don't want white wine i don't want red wine what's the wine that can make it so that i feel like i'm having the best of both worlds rose everybody knows this okay this is just how it works okay ridiculous the name is the primogen
