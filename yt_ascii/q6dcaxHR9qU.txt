it's time we had the talk not about the birds and the bees but the scammers and the fees guys today we're taking a look at the phenomenon known as the dogetuber okay the dogetuber they're a strange species a subclassification of the family of scammers and the specific genus is financial shills but it's even more specific than that the doge tuber lacks empathy heart and any morality at all it masquerades as a genuine analyst for crypto but in actuality it only has one analysis in its arsenal to the moon buy now get rich 420 dogecoin elon musk discord buy the the signals now the dogetuber is full of enthusiasm but they lack any moral empathy for people getting wrecked by their advice they only care about their own profits which they get by constantly evangelizing about the latest crypto that they're holding or they're getting paid to promote and look the reason i'm making this video is because crypto's in the news right now and doge troopers can be highly deadly to your portfolio's health and i want to make sure you're as educated as possible because it's my advice that you stay away from these people but they can be hard to spot which is why i'm gonna be giving you four symptoms someone you know could be a doge tuber no really this is a real thing look they're hard to spot like i said they can look like they're just enthusiastic about crypto but there's key differences so number one what does the dogetuber do those tubers they give investment advice while pretending to not be giving you investment advice and look you may have seen this disclaimer in a hundred youtubers bios i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice it's for all and entertainment purposes do your own research at diligence before buying stocks and crypto blah blah blah look this is a normal legal disclaimer people have to use it's like when a lawyer who's not your lawyer says this is not legal advice but doge troopers use this as camouflage as cover as a loophole to sort of willy wonka their way out of legal liability because what they'll do is they'll portray themselves as an expert then they'll give you financial advice sprinkle a little fairy dust i'm not giving you financial advice and they somehow absolve themselves which means that if you get wrecked it's all on you they're not gonna take any responsibility and to be clear not everyone who has this disclaimer who's like educating you on how to analyze stocks is a problem they're not doge troopers right if a finance youtuber is teaching you how to evaluate stocks that's not financial advice they're teaching you sort of how to do the thing what is different is if someone gives you financial advice they say hey go buy this go buy that how is that not financial advice they're telling you hey you want to get rich like me go buy this that's financial advice you can't then say i'm not a financial advice this is all entertainment if you're telling people what to do now for this next tip we got to go to the board so the next tip is that doge tubers are constantly shilling some dogecoin that they've been paid to promote so this combined with part one is what makes the dogetuber so deadly by pretending to be an expert saying that they're not giving you financial advice but giving you financial advice they can enrich themselves while making you poor so these people they're not gonna tell you what their position is in these cryptos they're not gonna tell you that they got paid but nonetheless they will promote these things to the moon telling you that they're the next big thing but not telling you that they're gonna make a killing on it here's what one of these dogetubers looks like on twitter it's a sam pepper by the way he's famous for like faking a prank where he killed his friend or something i don't know they say this coin is bound to go up interesting might be five to ten minutes late announcing info and then they say i'm really excited to be promoting and hyping this new coin by the amazing team at rootkit finance they're telling you oh it's gonna be so great huge growth it's going to the moon it's going up the project keeps expanding blah blah blah truly amazing project and at the very bottom not financial advice once again we see the dogetuber's classic note but the key thing here is that it's not just one thing he's constantly shilling altcoins that's what he does on his twitter account now the next feature of a doge tuber is that they're never negative this is a key thing they're always bullish there's no money in bad news there's no money in real analysis which sometimes includes you know like the truth like the coin sucks right instead they replace analysis with words like get rich to the moon and pumping now look let me be clear the doge tuber is not the same thing as a crypto enthusiast who also kind of sounds like that sometimes because here's the deal i'm not gonna get mad and no one's gonna get mad about people getting excited that they put 500 into dogecoin two years ago and they saw it go to a thousand or a hundred thousand dollars i'm like i'm happy for you dude i wish that was me but the difference is this the doge tuber isn't excited about their portfolio they want to get you excited so you buy in and then make their portfolio go up right that's the real intention behind it all this is what makes them so slimy is because they say they're trying to do one thing which is this i'm just a crypto analyst baby just analyzing these sweet cryptos when actually they're just shilling it and they're just salesmen right which brings us to number four the dogetuber used to be thought of among ecologists among cryptologists as being a relative of the analyst a weird you know offshoot a genetic mishap but the truth is is that according to new research coming out in the journal nature the doge tuber is actually a relative of the salesman because even though they might provide some analysis or some like facts about a coin they're only doing that to give you the good news and they'll never give you the bad news which is more like a salesman right like you go to a car lot they're going to tell you it goes zero to 60 in like four seconds they're gonna tell you you know what the price is how great everything is what they're not gonna tell you is that it's been in like four wrecks and the transmission's gone in two weeks right they never show you the bad side of it which makes them different from an analyst and it's all of these four things right giving advice pretending not to be giving advice constantly shilling things that they have a stake in and they're not telling you they have a stake in they're always giving you super bullish price projections saying it's going to the moon and of course the last one which is their salesman not actual analysts the four of these is what identifies the doge tuber scumbag and here's where i want to introduce you to a doge trooper to give you an idea of what all four of these together look like this is miles g investments and it only takes a single look at this guy's page to understand what's going on here dogecoin breaking news huge moves rocket dogecoin two dollars dogecoin get rich tonight or one of my personal favorites dogecoin will make you rich tomorrow for 21 that was the day dogecoin actually that of pumping crashed to say that this is irresponsible is the understatement of the century you're sending hundreds of thousands of people constant sales pitches for dogecoin making them rich and no amount of saying well i'm not an investor i'm not financial advisor when you say miles g investments no amount of that is gonna absolve you of this responsibility i don't even care if it's like a legal thing like hey legally he covered his bases you're a douche like you're a bad person if you do this to followers because no matter what you say they're gonna follow you right they're gonna look at your headlines they're gonna look at your titles and yeah you might say that i'm just playing the crypto game right i just have to do what i have to do but when you're doing this and you're telling people they're gonna get rich tonight they're gonna go in a lot of them are gonna get wrecked and what are you gonna do nothing you're gonna say well it wasn't my fault these people are a blight on the crypto community i hate to say it and it's look it's not up to me to you know grandstand and say they should be taken off the platform you guys know i'm not a fan of anyone getting deep platforms instead i hope these people just reflect on what they're doing and they're like hey this is bad right it's not just this guy by the way i'm picking on him specifically that's why it's an entire classification it's the doge tuber this is what they do they feed on other people's portfolios in order to make themselves rich and they feel no kind of problem with just blatantly shilling things and telling them they're gonna get rich while full well knowing that this is a super risky investment by the way the irony is not lost on me that i got my channel deleted for one video on dogecoin where i was like saying people should be responsible and that this guy is like shilling a bunch of coins every single day and his channel's allowed to stay up but whatever and look at the end of the day these people aren't going anywhere i'm sure miles g will probably continue to make his videos i'm sure doge tubers will continue to make their videos right across the spectrum it's not just about doge it's about any kind of shilling of some cryptocurrency with ulterior motives but you have to remember that they are not analysts they're salesmen and they're trying to sell you a bill of goods often a bad one so i don't think there's anything to be done about them i think you the viewer have to recognize it for what it is and stay away for your portfolio's health or you could just learn the lesson the hard way and get burned eventually but i'd rather tell you guys help you out help you save your money sorry that's basically it i hope you enjoyed this taxonomic look at doge tubers now you can spot them for yourselves and save yourself and your family from the dogetuber that may be near you thanks for watching i appreciate you see you in the next that was where you one me wake up and smell the coffee
