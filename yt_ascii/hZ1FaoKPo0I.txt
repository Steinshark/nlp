first up a revolutionary charger this is one of the world's first that is built using gallium nitride instead of the traditional silicon and what that means is this can charge with 45 watts of power in a footprint that is half the size of apple's 30 watt charger oh yeah and add to that that this has the mains plug built inside of it then we've got something that looks completely indistinguishable from a standard tpu smartphone case until you turn it around inside you've got a power button and once you turn it on this thing can interact directly with your smartphone without needing a battery of its own so when you get a call or a notification the back will pulse and this one here has been customized with the mr. who's the boss channel logo next up the table selfie which is a super simple but at the same time a kind of genius product it's got a rubberized base and a rotating wooden top the idea being that you can place your smartphone in it and it'll rest at a very particular angle you can use this to take a panorama shot one that will capture the faces of every single person sitting at a round table but to be honest that's only one of the potential use cases just as a tool to take general panorama shots it's incredibly handy and creates super stable super high-quality results the reason i got this product is because of this man right here he's who i want to be according to that image this holder is capable of being placed around your neck and on its own supporting a full-size smartphone or tablet we'll see about that initial impressions of that the construction is very solid and the end holder clips into place in a really reassuring way and can be fully readjusted alright time to test it out and i think at this point part of me still couldn't quite believe that this was a real product but anyway i placed around my neck did a little bit of adjusting and was instantly surprised it completely holds in place it doesn't matter if you put a mini phone in a full-size flagship phone or even an 8-inch tablet on there this thing managed to fully support it and there was no movement at all as part impressed and also part kind of worried that i might end up actually using it this is the power cube xs which i keep calling the tennis we'll get there eventually but it is a wireless charge with a twist so when you drop this wireless charger on to its base station then any smartphone will wirelessly charge when placed on top of it and from that angle it's exactly the same as every other wireless charger the difference comes because it's removable so you can take out the charger itself and it just acts like a five thousand milliamp hour power bank with two full-sized usb ports and the ability to wirelessly charge your devices on the go to cut a long story short this product right here is pretty much everything in one it's actually being sold as an fm radio and yeah while it does do that i did unless the coolest part of this product yet first of all acts as a power bank so you can plug a full-sized usb in there and charge your smartphone it's got three leds built into it for a flashlight brighter than your phone alone could produce it's got solar panels on the top to charge during the day but the coolest thing in my opinion is this lever this is a crank and allows you to generate friction to charge the battery just by rotating it round and round it'll charge slowly but easily enough to use the flashlight and the radio alright this thing right here should be fairly self-explanatory this is the phone floaty and the main thing you're getting here is this foam like material which has 3m tape on the back and you stick it on the provided case which then goes on your smart phone and to state the obvious for sure it is a thick bitter kit it is pretty much tripling the thickness of the iphone 10s were using it on here but if you do spend a lot of time near water this can save your device from almost guaranteed death it'll automatically make your phone float whether it's in freshwater or saltwater and it's built to make sure that your phone continues to have reception so even if you went on holiday and dropped it somewhere in the sea you could probably use something like find my iphone to locate it precisely then we've got something called hops not exactly a smart phone gadget but a way of turning portrait mode photos into 3d physical images using a technique called lenticular printing so you take portrait mode photos use the pops application and then you can order these prints through that and as well as being able to look around inside portrait mode photos you could also just have two completely flat images and let it rotate between them welcome to a product that i've been searching for for last seven years this is tablet hooks and if you're anything like me you spend a lot of time traveling whether it be planes trains or cars this has got you covered you get two hooks and each one mounts into the seat in front of you that then allows you to place your phone or tablet on it and it'll be perfectly angled so you can see it clearly and perfectly secure it it's fully adjustable it's a really intricate little gadget i was quite surprised by it so i was drawn to this pack of two lenses by welt basically the massive flashlight you get on one of them turns out one of these lenses is a fisheye lens the other one is a super macro lens and that's one with this fancy led and i was kinda supported with the fisheye there's too much distortion and too much grain but the super macro on the other hand does a fantastic job unless you get a lot closer to subjects then we've got a product that is kind of claiming to be the smartphone game controller the all-in-one solution and to some extent i got to say it does accomplish that it does feel a little plasticy but you do have these nice high quality metal shoulder buttons which gives you a little bit more responsiveness and tactility while gaming the very nature of having a controller like this to grip reduces fatigue at least it does for me and this one has a little bit of a trick of its sleeve and push the button on the back and it's got a fan which basically sucks in air from behind and blows it to the back of the smartphone and it then exits through the top the bottom and the sides it's not the most efficient mechanism but at the same time your phone temperatures should fall at least a few degrees splash pure is nothing crazy it's a treat to very simple ideas meshed together but it works this is a screen cleaning fluid combined with a screen cleaning cloth so you spray your phone and then just wipe it using the bottle itself makes so much sense and whatever they've actually put in this bottle it does the trick after using it my phone felt good as new probably better than you now definitely the largest package in this video this is from a company called - voom so i've tried a few of their product video mostly speakers and audio stuff and they've always got unusual form factors they're always audio with a twist this is no different this is the tivo matte it is the ultra plus-size version of the standard devotee who my first impressions were something along the lines of well that is one heavy speaker add to that the fact that it's hardly portable this is moving slightly beyond the category of something i would take in my bag but it does have some interesting features that make it worth it for example this display which is kind of impressive in its own strange pixelated way there are a lot of things it can show admittedly not all of it is particularly useful but it's cool to have and what i was more impressed by it is that for a speaker that focuses this much on design the sound was really good it's got one really powerful subwoofer and two powerful tweeters by a company called kira scope this is well there's a really weird product it's a t-shirt designed to interact with your smartphone actually went and bought one that was two sizes too big so what army but at the same time for the sake of this video it'll do the job so you see this pattern we've gone the t-shirt there's an application that you can install on your android or ios phone that is built to recognize it and it shows you inside of you which is completely terrifying the first time you try it i can also tell you a heart rate which it figures out when you place your finger on top of your camera it uses it to detect your pulse there's also interactivity so you can click on various parts see what they do quite a cool different learning tool as well as a toy and obviously a t-shirt if you enjoyed this video it'll be massively appreciate it if you could subscribe to the channel and i've got plenty more smartphone gadgets videos so i'm gonna link them from this one my name is erin this is mr. he's the boss and i'll catch you in the next one [music] you
