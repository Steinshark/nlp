would pick one fight to focus on replaying it over and over to grind the time down this was a logical way to do it the game has a built-in timer and displays your exact time after the fight so players could easily compete on individual fights and post their times on game faqs that's what the old school runners did for years but one runner did something a bit different he decided just for fun that he was going to complete a run of the full game all 14 fights back to back he was the only old school punch out runner to do a full game run and it was way ahead of its time the runner who did this was matt turk mat turk was by far the best punchout player on the planet he was one of the most dominant speedrunners in general his times were so hard to beat that years later the game's best players had to embark on a quest to take them all down but even after conquering all 14 records matt turk was was still hungry for something more so he decided to try an any% speedrun that's a straight shot through the game adding up the times you get on all 14 fights and so we arrive at the first speedrun of mike tyson's punch out 17 flat2 by matt turk except there's no surviving video turk rarely recorded his runs back then since he didn't formally submit times anywhere in my opinion it's likely that his times were legitimate his knowledge of the game was incredible and what little footage we do have is extremely impressive for the time so we can't watch turk's full game speedrun but thankfully we do know what times he got on each fight and let's just say it was exactly what you'd expect from a matt turk [music] speedrun turk started with blast joe he's a complete pushover in a casual play through however the fastest way to beat him is tougher you wait until 40 seconds then time a punch within a 4frame window when joe charges forward if done properly he'll go down and won't get up punch out runs at 60 frames per second so a 4frame window is just 11 15th of a second that's a tough way to have to start your speedrun but of course turk nailed it matching the task time of 42. but a few fights later turk had to deal with the most dangerous back-to-back fights in the run first up was don flamco 1 aka frame perfect dawn by punching then dodging and waiting until the last 60th of a second to counter him you'll get a star star punches are essentially powerful uppercuts and on dawn one a star star punch instantly knocks him down he gets up but with little health and once you punch him down again he'll stay down for the knockout if done correctly dawn one can be the fastest fight in the game at just 14 seconds but it's a brutal frame perfect punch just 1 160th of a second to properly time it every miss costs 6 to 7 seconds so the time can snowball quickly not only did turk get the star on his first try but he ended up once again matching the task time of 14.97 complete perfection yet again from matt turk then came the second part of the backtack king hippo he is the living embodiment of rng you can only hit hippo when he opens his mouth and he has a 38 chance of doing that on any given punch you need him to do this at least three times to knock him out so the fight all revolves around waiting for to open his mouth the best fights get three opens straight away this is only about a 5% chance but can lead to a 37 second fight from there each additional non-open adds 3 to 4 seconds and it can get bad fast turk ended up getting a 48c hippo fight three blocks and three opens that's a solid fight given that blocks are much more likely than opens but this combo of dawn one and king hippo was super punishing you needed the frame perfect punch just so you could get a chance at hippo's randomness it was a terrible one-w combo but on this run turk had made it through relatively unscathed the next several fights featured a mix of tricky execution and harsh randomness we're going to get to most of these fights later for now it's important to know that turk had a pretty clean run through most of the second half no fights stuck out as getting terrible luck and he made few if any mistakes matt turk had himself a very solid run going yet none of this actually mattered because there's a fight at the very end of this game that makes the previous 13 seem completely irrelevant i think you may have heard of him before mike tyson reg regly tops lists as the hardest final boss of all time he's lightning quick unpredictable and can knock you down with one hit those who've tried know how hard it is to beat him but speedrunners need to do more than just beat him they need to do it in the first round that's three knockdowns in under 3 minutes it seems completely impossible but there is one way to do it we'll break the fight down into to three phases one per knockdown in phase one tyson throws uppercuts and you can hit him twice after each one by delaying your second punch to the last 60th of a second before he would block this punch does five times the normal amount of damage if you're a frame late he blocks if you're a frame early you barely damage him it has to be on this one magic frame so in phase one you have to and frame perfect uppercut after frame perfect uppercut you don't need to hit them all but you need to hit a lot of them in phase two tyson starts by throwing more uppercuts meaning you need more frame perfects but at 130 on the clock his pattern switches and he throws hooks here it's much easier you just dodge and punch twice after each one no need for anything frame perfect after sending him down again you enter phase three which is quite simple tyson only throws hooks so you punch him down for the tko phase three takes anywhere from 52 to 55 seconds depending on tyson's pattern so if your second knockdown is at 204 or lower you've got around one fight in the bag the key to the fight is that you can damage tyson much more during his uppercuts than his hooks so the earlier you knock him down in phase one the more uppercuts you'll throw in phase 2 before one 30 and the more damage you can deal generally you need at least four phase 2 uppercuts meaning a first knockdown of 109 or less but you can get as many as six uppercuts with a knockdown under a minute of course tyson can randomly delay and screw everything up most notably in phase one he can do the 8sec delay where midway through the phase he just stands still for 8 seconds it happens 50% of the time and while it doesn't completely kill a round one attempt it can turn a solid phase 1 into an impossible one now with perfect execution and a lucky pattern it was possible to round one tyson down in the 220s however these times were extremely rare and took hundreds of attempts from even a seasoned veteran getting a round one fight at all was unbelievably difficult and when it happened it was usually just before the end of the round in the 250s even matt turk couldn't always pull it off under optimal conditions with nothing at stake and the pressure off turk could round one tyson a bit over half the time but at the end of a world record- paced speedrun with 13 fights behind you and just one to go conditions are anything but optimal trying to land frame perfect punches under this type of pressure is unimaginable inable but if anyone could do it it was matt turk and he ended up finishing off this run with a tyson fight of 250 he cleared round one with several seconds to spare while we can't watch this run today its legacy lives on like most things matt turk did it was so far ahead of its time a clean first 13 fights and a round one tyson at the end those two aspects combined made this run a amazing shortly after this run the original punch out community started to die off by 2010 matt turk stopped playing as well so with no competition left to lower them all the world records remained stagnant including turk's full game speedrun but then in the late 2000s there was a shift in the speedrunning community rather than being scattered across different websites like game faqs speedrunners started to centralize at one website speed demos archive for a few years mike tyson's punch out didn't have a submission on sda but in 2010 a new name popped up on the website he was the first new punchout runner in years and unlike most before him his main focus was completing a run of the full game this runner's name was sinister one [music] sinister reached out to matt turk and began piecing together strategies for a full game speedrun however he quickly realized there was a pretty big skill gap between the two of them so sinister turned his focus to completing a segmented run punch out is naturally broken up into circuits every few fights so sinister grinded each of the three circuits individually plus tyson on his own and submitted a four segment speedrun to speed demos archive this run clocked in at 1631 nearly half a minute ahead of turk however these runs really can't be compared sinister could optimize each circuit to a high degree rather than having to get everything in one straight shot turk 17 flat was definitely the more impressive speedrun so once sinister kept practicing and getting better he decided that it was time to take the training wheels off and complete a single segment run of mike tyson's punch out the whole game in one segment just like matt turk did sinister tried for weeks and while he was able to get runs in the low 17s he struggled to do better than turk the main problem was the combination of dawn one and king hippo dawn's frame perfect star killed a lot of runs and the few that made it through usually died to hippo's randomness it was so hard to get runs out of the early game and although sinister eventually got a 1706 he was still behind turk his best efforts to get the world record had failed so sinister gave up years passed and turk's 17 flat remained untouched by february 2013 not much had changed matt turk 17 flat was still on top and sinister was right behind him however a new player was just starting to mess with running the game this guy had a pretty good track record he was the world record holder in both super punchout and punchout wii his name was zard one right away zard started looking for new strategies dawn one's frame perfect star was still brutal and he wanted to find a way to make it more consistent he ended up finding a timing queue that helped a little but not much and sinister one was not impressed by it he told zard come back to me when you find something that can get the start 10 times in a row otherwise he wasn't interested and with that sinister fired up a stream of super metroid and what happened about an hour and a half later absolutely floored him all right let's check out this zard video the dawn [music] destroyer oh my god are you kidding me dude no way this this can't be real see this guy's a hacker hacker no way okay i'm going i got to try this all right guys you might be about to witness the greatest thing of all time [music] wow wow i'm so astonished i had to get hit one time i don't believe it i don't believe [music] it in mike tyson's punchout if you hold down an input while something else is happening the game will execute it on the first possible frame so by holding down different inputs consecutively you can perform a series of moves that always come out on the first frame and therefore always take the exact same amount of time inputs like this are performed all over super punch out to get dizzy knockdowns which is where zard originally got the idea so on dawn one by buffering a left gut punch a left dodge a left quick dodge then a left face punch all in a row you arrive on the exact frame where you can get the star it turns a frame perfect trick into a few trivial inputs zard also found that you could do something similar on glass joe by buffering a left face punch in a series of gut punches you can guarantee a 42 knockdown no timing needed the dawn one buffer was probably the greatest discovery in the game's history instead of resetting half of his runs now sinister would never have to reset there again zard had revolutionized mike tyson's punch out but sinister was the one who could really take advantage of it i don't have work tomorrow world record incoming tomorrow it's a [music] lot all right i'll take a [music] 53 over the following several fights he was able to keep it close with turk le le in time without falling too far behind but sinister knew there was one place he could make up a bunch of time the penultimate fight in the game super macho man matt turk's split here was a 118 this was a solid enough time back in 2008 but by 2013 the fight had evolved in a worst case scenario fight sinister was looking at a 110 or so best case scenario it could go under a minute macho's speedrun strategy looks ridiculous with punches being snuck through his guard and stars thrown all over but the fight largely comes down to one specific moment if macho's fourth punch is an uppercut which is 5/8 likely you'll get a good fight if it's a hook then it'll be a slower fight either way as long as his execution was clean he'd save big time over a 118 that's a good start anyway this is pretty good luck you guys all right 59 it was exactly what he needed in one fight sinister had shot himself into the lead but his job was far from over after all this he still needed to round one tyson in 254 or less the pressure was on 105 that's a good time sinister had pulled it off after carrying a lead into tyson he had nearly matched turk's round one fight clutching out a 251 to break the world record this was the the first sub7 in the game's history and while sinister was elated he knew there was still work to do the dawn one buffer had blown the door wide open and a few of his fights had suboptimal luck and execution so sinister decided to see if he could shave a few more seconds off and just weeks later he got on this [music] run cool yes oh boy all right this is now serious did i just gain time in that split dear god above an enormous lead with three fights to go next up mr sandman got to take advantage of the situation here sandman has a big mix of rng and execution the hardest part in the fight is his dreamland express where you must dodge three times in rapid succession you can counter him for massive damage afterwards and by getting intentionally knocked down at 159 or later he'll do another dreamland express when you get up so it's incredibly rewarding if you dodge the dreamland express correctly but if you're too slow you can't damage him enough after sandman also has two main pieces of randomness when you knock him down the second time there's a 25% chance he gets up with a big health refill which loses 10 seconds and before his second dreamland express there's a 50% chance he does a long delay which loses 6 seconds so that adds to 16 seconds of variation from rng alone plus tricky execution and on this particular fight sinister ended up getting both the good refill and the short delay although he bled a few seconds from slow dodging on the second dreamland exp press an extremely lucky fight on an incredible pace and his lead ballooned to nearly 28 seconds so far ahead on macho sinister ended up getting the bad hook pattern on the fourth punch which cost 10 seconds but heading into tyson sinister still had a mammoth'c lead all he needed was a round one fight and this would be a massive world record [music] yes okay he's going to throw five yes world record there it is i don't care that i lost time oh man these are some beautiful looking splits he built up a huge lead and finish it off with a round one tyson that's a winning formula for punch out speed runs the only path sinister saw to beating this run was saving time at the end 109 and 254 were good enough splits but it was possible to gain a bit on each he just needed to be within striking distance by the end well does this count as striking [music] distance all right next fight a few months later sinister was in a tough spot he'd made a 7-second mistake on honda 2 and got awful luck to lose 16 seconds on dawn 2 this was a big deficit but he did have time to save was it possible to climb out of [music] it good start yes yeah 57 baby he needed a 247 on mike tyson there had never been a world record with a tyson fight in the 240 sinister needed to break new [music] ground oh my god dude yeah those tyson fights in the 220s i talked about earlier this is how you got them a 57 phase 1 unfortunately phase 2 didn't go quite as well but a 15 was still an incredible pace now he had to finish it off and see what time he could get get yeah yeah dude oh my god i got that i can't believe it this was a legendary tyson performance with his back against the wall on world record pace sinister managed to go 9 for n on frame perfect hits in phase one the final result was a 243 an unheard of time for the end of a world record as the congratulations poured in sinister debated if he should keep going those last two splits were really brutal but he also had lowered the record pretty quickly maybe he wasn't at his full potential yet ultimately sinister decided to push onward he wanted to get one more improvement before stopping 5 weeks later sinister had another good one going he was tearing through the world circuit and once he finished off sandman he had amassed a lead of 19 seconds but he knew what he was up against in his final two splits and right on q macho gave him the bad pattern but he recovered nicely and was on his way to still having a nice lead going into ty [music] no [music] his entire lead was gone and then some a 5-second deficit against this tyson split sinister would need a [music] miracle [music] against all odds sinister had actually brought this run back he was guaranteed to finish tyson between 234 and 237 enough for a new world record albeit a fairly small one but there was something else sinister could go for here frame perfect hooks in phase three tyson gets up with 40 health normally you hit him twice after each punch for two damage each a total of four damage but if you instead delay the first punch to the last 60th of a second possible you'll throw a single punch that deals five damage theoretically if you land eight frame perfect hooks in a row you can get a 37 second phase 3 a massive time save over normal but going for frame perfect hooks is risky they're harder than frame perfect uppercuts since you can't easily establish a rhythm each frame perfect hook saves about 2 seconds but each one you miss can cost up to five generally hitting four hooks is enough to save you some time while hitting two is enough to break even but add in blocks and your phase three time can spiral so it was decision time do you take the guar gued small world record or risk it to go for glory going all [music] out could get it i couldn't get it dude i couldn't get it man i couldn't get any frame perfect hits i was too [music] nervous had sinister just played it safe he'd be celebrating a new world record but can you blame him for trying it was a chance to demolish the record he had missed on this occasion but that was all right shake it off just get another run back to tyson and you'll get it next [music] time [music] you're kidding me dude you're kidding me 8sec delay there there he does the 8sec delay good game good game [music] luck and it's over 8sec delay killed [music] it [music] what what what no dude you got to be kidding me right now that was going to be a low one minute time man look at his health that was going to oh my god man come on who dang that's a pretty good one yes dude holy what i got a pv how does this happen zard 1 discoverer of the dawn one buffer became the second person to beat turk and get a sub 17 zard was still well behind the record but sinister needed an improvement even a small one would boost his morale and finally on march 26th 2014 he broke through sinister was able to get a lead early and never relinquished it he started with an excellent 41 on hippo and got average luck on sandman and macho his tyson execution wasn't perfect but a 105 knockdown meant he'd get four uppercuts in phase 2 he ended with a 251 enough to lower the record by 3 and 1/2 seconds but sinister's relief wouldn't last long because zard one was flying down the leaderboard and just days later he finished off this run oh man that's quite the pb dude i got whoa the run had a notable mistake on great tiger tiger is one of the only fights in the game with no rng the execution consists of four gut punches that each have a six-frame window they're usually not too hard to hit but when you miss one like zard did here you earn a 54 instead of a 48 it was a 6 and 1/2 second mistake zard missed the world record by 6.23 seconds had he not missed the gut punch he would have dethrown sinister and taken the top spot these two guys were neck and neck they had similar consistency over overall and could both reliably round one tyson in the 240 to 250 range given no 8sec delay but as similar as zard and sinister's skills were their ultimate goals were different zard wanted to keep lowering his personal best and maybe snag the world record while sinister had even loftier goals he wanted a single segment run that would beat his old segmented run the 1631 from 2010 after all these years it would be a remarkable achievement so each player had their own goals and for the next few months in 2014 they both continued running the game going up against brutal rng and frame perfect punches galore but neither one was able to find success zard couldn't catch sinister and sinister couldn't catch his segmented run so zard moved on to other games while sinister went after matt turk's 213 mike tyson record and all the while the single segment record stayed put but one random day in august 2014 sinister decided he needed a break from the tyson grind so just for fun he did a one-off stream of single segment attempts he hadn't played the category in months and was fairly rusty but you never know when all the luck will fall into place a few fights in he made it to king hippo who promptly opened his mouth three straight times unfortunately sinister was a bit late on the third open meaning he needed a fourth open to deal enough damage yes yes the bailout dude the bailout but hippo immediately gave it to him the odds in four straight opens on hippo less than 1 in 50 sinister was off to a great albeit lucky start after some clean execution on the next few fights sinister arrived at soda poppinski soda is another super random one he tends to team up with king hippo to bury most promising runs the fight revolves around a mechanic when soda crouches down for his uppercut if you press down on the d-pad while he's crouching he'll stay frozen and you can punch him for a star this star then has a special property where no matter how much health he has it'll instantly knock him down the problem is soda only throws uppercuts 75% of the time 25% of the time he'll throw hooks instead which wastes roughly 9 seconds so you need a 75% chance pattern once per phase working out to a 42% chance of getting a clean hookless fight but he can also randomly delay before each uppercut making each phase anywhere between 16 to 21 seconds with the three fastest uppercuts you'll get a 50c second fight but with the three slowest ones it'll be more like 102 to summarize soda will kill more than half your runs by throwing hooks and for those he doesn't kill he can delay to waste a bunch of time any fight under a minute is great and on this run sinister found himself at 36 seconds with one phase left to go this is a great pace but he still needed one more uppercut wow dude oh my god i actually oh wow okay this is actually now officially i think the best pace i've ever been on in my life the pressure was on on bll two he missed a precise punch in the opening that cost 5 seconds it was his second significant mistake of the run but he was far enough ahead that it was okay down the stretch sinister was able to tighten up his execution he played sandman perfectly getting the good refill but the long delay macho came through with the good uppercut pattern and sinister turned it into a solid 102 nice okay got him so through it all sinister had built up a 20 second lead over his segmented run he needed a 248 tyson fight to get it done but he'd been used to fighting tyson in an individual level setting that's very different from the end of a single segment [music] [music] run that was a horrible execution of phase one pull it together man and pull it together yeah it wasn't pretty but a 108 was still doable sinister got his four uppercuts in phase 2 and landed a 157 phase 2 knockdown playing it safe here wouldn't cut it sinister needed to land at least four frame perfect hooks to get this he had come all this way gotten amazing luck and it would all be for nothing if he couldn't execute right now [music] ah is that it i i got it i i did it dude i think that's it i think that's it oh my god is this hold on hold on hold on let me put in the time yes yes 1627 out of nowhere four years ago sinister's best efforts at a segmented run yielded a 1631 now he could beat that with a straight shot through the game this was a pretty lucky run as sinister made multiple mistakes that could have killed it but even though he was rusty he still executed where it mattered most right at the end on tyson sinister was more than satisfied with this run and he turned his attention elsewhere now it was zaller's turn to focus on single segments with this new record the difference between his run and the world record had doubled unless he could take 12 seconds off his pb zard couldn't move out of second place he'd be competing against a 42 hippo 56 soda and a solid final three splits to finish it off but still that fall zard started up run once again even if he wasn't directly going for the world record maybe he could shave a bit of time off his [music] [music] [applause] 1639 come on tyson just just round one that's all i need just a round one [music] [music] fight i can't i can't do anything about that i just [music] [music] can't this is in danger real bad i'm not going to do it i'm not going to do it [music] guys i don't even know what that is i don't even know is that the record no it isn't he's got a 27 man such a c rushing pb in phase one zard actually played quite well he got the 8-second delay but still turned it into a respectable 108 but phase two was his downfall with two blocks and several other missed punches because of the pace going into tyson it was still a massive pb but this luck was practically impossible to see again he got a 37 hippo a perfect fight along with a good enough soda and an incredible sandman and macho zor's only hope to pb from here was to save time on a relatively soft 255 tyson split the good news was that he nearly caught up to sinister he kept playing over the next few weeks not making much progress but by mid november zard would get another [music] chance it wasn't a super inspiring run at first he bled time over his 37 hippo split and got bad luck on dawn 2 to lose some more but he was able to keep pace with his strong final three first getting the good refle and delay on sandman then the good pattern on macho it wasn't amazing but heading into tyson he had a chance zard needed a 241 on mike [music] tyson near perfect zard was easily on pace to get this but phase 2 was a bit more dicey he missed two of tyson's uppercuts and missed all of the hooks now he couldn't play it safe he had to hit at least a couple of [music] [music] these [music] zard had been dominating super punch out and punch out we for years now he was the king of mike tyson's punch out too congratulations poured in across the community even from sinister who was good friends with zard and was happy to see him succeed but admittedly it was pretty tough for him to lose this record he'd been known for holding it over the years and suddenly being in second place was a big shock sinister did some attempts shortly after zard 1625 but ultimately his heart wasn't in it and within weeks he stopped zard had passed him and sinister had come to terms with that beyond punchout sinister had kind of lost interest in speak speedr running as a whole it had been 5 years of constant grinding for world records and after losing the punchout record he decided he was ready to step aside and let the next generation of runners take over so as 2015 rolled around punchout didn't have much activity sinister was retired and zard was satisfied with his world record ever since matt turk these were the only two runners with a shot at the single segment record they were just a cut above the rest but with them both being inactive maybe there was room for a third runner to step up enter ouiji later in his career ouiji would become a world record contender in many popular nes games but his first speedrun was mike tyson's punch out he began running the game in early 2015 and right away it was clear he was a natural he quickly became just the third player ever to get a sub 17 and as weeks passed and his time kept going down ouiji began to make a push for zor's record however if ouiji had one problem it said his tyson game was a little weak now it's no exaggeration to say that fighting tyson at the end of a single segment run is one of the hardest challenges in speed running after playing through the whole game you have to find a way to battle your nerves and execute frame perfect punches over and over and in the back of your mind you know that you might not make it here again for weeks or months your mental and physical skills are both pushed to their limits despite some struggles on tyson ouiji took his time down to 1641 but he wasn't the only player going after zor's record that's right by spring 2015 sinister was ready to return he smelled blood in the water and wanted his world record back it was a head-to-head battle sinister versus ouiji neither player was messing around and so they both compared against zard 1625 splits ultimately it was going to all come down to tyson both sinister and ouiji were capable of getting there on pace but competing against zards 240 was a tall order so both players knew they would have their chances the question was who could close it out on tyson [music] first nope not it 16 [music] 28.25 [music] this continued for months ouiji and sinister could get a lead after 13 fights sometimes even a big lead but whether it was bad luck or bad execution the run always died on mike tyson the best paces the game has ever seen all lost at the very end but here's the thing although the 8-second delay is a big problem it's still possible to get a fast fight with it a time in the 230s is doable although there's little room for error sinister and ouiji had to forget about the rng as long as they played well they could have a chance at the record but that was much easier said than done on july 16th sinister had another one going into tyson he needed a 242 and right on q 8sec delay that was usually enough to kill it but it didn't have to be it's all [music] right dude that last delay was a [music] killer [music] got it got it dude oh my god man got it by like 1 second now that's how you fight tyson this was the first record in the game's history to feature an 8-second delay on mike tyson sinister nailed frame perfect punches throughout the fight and overcame bad luck along the way it was the best execution the game had ever seen from start to finish and despite getting worse luck than zard sinister still finished ahead of him at 1624 even though he was back on top sinister didn't want to quit he continued doing record attempts hoping to get a run without the 8-second delay meanwhile weie was as motivated as ever and a few weeks later he was able to take his time into the 1630s but as the months passed the record stayed put at 1624 that seemed to be the limit for sinister and ouiji but what about zard at this point he hadn't run the game since his 1625 nearly a year ago he was happy to let sinister and ouiji battle to take the record however in october 2015 zard signed up for a three-way punchout race in the annual best of nes marathon he was going to be up against sinister one and ouiji meaning he needed to shake the rust off and get back in practice so for the first time in 11 months zard fired up a stream of single [music] segments it's not going to matter he's going to 8c delay [music] this or not question marks okay [music] what are you talking about tyson tyson threw his sixth uppercut just as the clock ticked over to 130 it probably came out on the last frame possible and zard was not expecting it however the run wasn't quite dead if you get up on n9 count to fully refill your health a knockdown costs about as much time as an 8-second delay in other words zard could still get a pretty fast time but would it be fast enough i could probably do something with this sadly and i just got hit what a stupid run dude 1627 okay it had taken zard two attempts to nearly match sinister and oui's combined output over 6 months if he didn't get knocked down or had he not gotten blocked in phase 3 or a mad of other small changes across the run this easily would have been the record zard had to settle for a 1627 on his first day back how could he possibly follow that [music] up all right here we go oh all right soda y [music] one uh-oh it just got real that's a split you're not supposed to gain time on 48 this is so dead this is the deadest speedrun i've ever seen oh my god dude this is doomed this is doomed this has no chance zero possibility of finishing this is the deadest dude you can't get this luck tyson's 8c delaying this i will bet you all the money i will bet you all of the money cash this is not going to happen this cannot happen this isn't even real [music] dude okay like you don't understand this can't finish it's impossible and what happened on mike tyson on the ultimate dream run ever of punchout well i'll let zard take it from [music] here what what it's 102 i never got the 8sec delay in that first phase so that meant i pretty much got past every luck barrier in the entire game and it's just me versus tyson that's it like all the nerves that i didn't have they came back like right here right [music] here [music] i remember thinking well this is the dead this is where it dies [music] but this is i feel so bad right now so so [music] [music] bad i i don't i don't i don't i don't i don't i just don't this is one of the craziest runs in nes speedrunning history and by most accounts it was inferior to the last record it had more mistakes it had a knockdown it had more misses on the upper cuts but it also had unbelievable luck and that was more than enough to make up for the difference sinister and ouiji had been left in the dust zard was breaking new ground with this one run standards had changed and mike tyson's punch out entered a new era the push for the sub16 for years it was a theoretical time but more of a pipe dream than a rational expectation much like the mythical 457 in super mario bros but now zard 16007 opened up new possibilities sub16 was suddenly realistic and that was enough to make zard commit to trying the blueprint for this run was simple there was no way zard was going to be ahead of the record going into tyson the 16007 got all the luck and trying to compete with it would be a losing battle but as long as his deficit was reasonable zard could make it up with an insane tyson fight at the end you need the ultimate combination of luck and execution on tyson for starters you need to get your first knockdown before 1 minute that involves hitting all nine frame perfect punches in the first phase and not getting the 8sec delay with any luck from here tyson throws six uppercuts in phase two and if you hit five of them you'll knock tyson down before he has a chance to throw any hooks and from there by hitting a few frame perfects in phase three a time in the high 210s or low 220s is possible that is' frame perfect punches at the end of a world record baced run these used to be unreasonable expectations but this wasn't 2014 anymore tyson execution had gotten better and if zard wanted to get a sub6 that's what he needed to do within days he was back to doing attempts hoping just once he could clutch out the tyson fight he'd need on november 9th he had one with potential although he bled a bit of time on hippo and soda he was able to keep pace everywhere else but after an unfortunate mistake on macho the deficit ballooned to' seconds zard needed a 225 tyson fight and after a 144 second knockdown it was clear that this was going to be close come on [music] man oh my god please without the mistake on macho zard would have had a sub6 instead he had to push onward a couple weeks later he had another similar one this time he needed a 220 tyson he got an incredible phase one pattern but got blocked after missing a couple too many frame perfects in phase three he had to settle for a 227 man killing me dude 1613 a short while later another familiar situation now he needed a 223 tyson and of course deja vu headed into phase three you gotta be why why just why time and time again zard just couldn't quite get the tyson he needed he was playing well but not perfect at this point over a month had passed since his67 and zard wasn't able to beat it but he wasn't the only one trying that's pb it is a p baby man that was 1622 all [music] right in there baby oh pb baby pb dude that's a good run 1614 man we are closing in dude i think i might have just pv all right it's pb dude all right i'll take it missed world record by 4 seconds guys all of a sudden sinister and ouiji had closed in they were both within 5 seconds of zor's record all three of these guys had been grinding heavily over the last month and zard was the only one with nothing to show for it ultimately they were all capable of getting the sub6 it was a dead heat and it was going to come down to whoever ever could clutch out an amazing tyson fight at the end of a run first but even though ouiji and sinister had mostly caught up zard was just on another [music] level oh baby come on yes yes oh yeah oh yeah dude it's done dude it had happened zard had just gotten a 218 tyson in a run just two years ago this would have been the fastest recorded tyson fight ever this speedrun was the product of years of attempts from punch out's best players it started with matt turk's initial run then sinisters grind through the 16s and finally zards push to take it under 16 minutes punch out's ultimate barrier was broken it wasn't a perfect run most notably he got a hook on soda which costed about 10 seconds but the 218 tyson fight more than made up for it zard was done and seeing what he had accomplish ouiji and sinister decided to stop grinding as well everyone was satisfied with this incredible world record the sub6 was real by 2016 most of the punch out community was inactive this is common once a landmark world record is set people feel no need to even try beating it so for months there was no movements on the leaderboard however that changed in late january 2016 for the first time in a year somebody new entered the top three and all of a sudden in one fell swoop he passed both sinister 1 and ouiji only trailing behind zor's world record this runner was me yeah this punchout history we've been looking at i was absolutely invested in back as it happened there's some of my fondest speedrunning memories and were instrumental in getting me into speedrunning as a whole sinister 1627 was the first world record i ever watched live and from there i was hooked i slowly began learning speedrun strategies for all 14 fights by mid 2015 i was doing full game runs while ouiji sinister and zard were all battling for a sub 16 i remained in a distant fourth place with my 1642 but but after zard sub6 i made it to the 1630s then the 1620s and finally i managed to break through with a608 he was especially surreal to pass sinister one he was the one i first watched with awe back in 2014 all of a sudden i was a world record contender and that felt really strange the only remaining run i could beat was zor's 1557 but that was going to be an enormous challenge and here's why for starters it had a 41 on king hippo 90% of the time just from rng i'd lose time on that split a 106 on bll one was really good as well as a 54 on honda 2 soda poppinski was a soft split and i could gain time there but after that it was a gauntlet 128 and 140 on boltu and dantu were both excellent splits there was time to save on sandman and macho but not much and on average i could expect a time loss and on tyson i was up against a 218 that was faster than my best tyson fight ever i was practically guaranteed to lose time there so the goal was to keep it close into soda pick up about 10 seconds there then try and preserve my lead as long as i could and with king hippo killing run after run early that was not going to be easy but i was determined to try and so i embarked on a quest for my own sub6 for weeks i streamed my attempts on twitch going nowhere as early game rng stopped me but eventually i started to break through first getting a607 then a603 little by little i was chipping away at my time but what kept preventing greatness was mike tyson zard split was too tough to compare against i was pretty reliably able to get fights in the 230s but lower than that was extremely rare eventually i caught on that my tyson execution was holding me back and started to focus on him i worked on building my consistency and over time fights in the 220s started to become more common as such my confidence started to grow if i could get a run on pace i had the ability to get the type of tyson i'd need on march 1st 2016 i started my session with tyson practice just like i always did and on my first attempt i recorded my fastest ever phase 1 knockdown 55 seconds the fight ended at a 223 my tyson execution was on point today now i just needed to get a run there and roughly 2 hours later this [music] happened it was everything i could have hoped for i was ahead in soda saved 10 seconds then got godlike sandman and macho luck to add to my lead this was a ridiculous pace with incredible rng and my nerves were out of control my hands were literally shaking but right there in the chat helping me calm down were the current and previous world record holders zard and sinister they put any fears of losing the record aside to help give me encouragement just an amazing display of sportsmanship i did my best to gather myself and press start on [music] tyson [music] this was better than i could have ever imagined i had clutched out a 224 after these first 13 fights it wasn't quite as good as allard's 218 but given the circumstances i was more than happy and right there cheering me on were sinister and zard two guys i had idolized were celebrating me taking their world record just a completely surreal feeling with a 15sec lead over second place i felt pretty good this run had outstanding luck and a solid tyson at the end there were very few spots to gain time and i had no intentions to try and lower it so i took a step back and played other games but i loved punch out and struggled to stop playing it for long as it was i didn't want to try and grind to beat my 1542 i felt it would be impossible without a miracle run however if i could find new ways to save time then maybe beating it would become realistic so that spring i went into the lab searching for new strategies and time saves on all 14 fights and with help from other community members we were able to completely overhaul two fights first up piston honda 2 this has always been an incredible fight to watch as you pummel honda while he can't even throw a punch however there was one problem honda starts dodging uppercuts midway into phase 2 so in order to get the last one to land you had to stand around and wait for his eyebrow pattern where he was forced to take it the end result was a fight between 52 and 55 seconds depending on refill and starluck however in early 2016 zard began messing with implementing max damage uppercuts on the fight by carefully pressing up and start within a small window you can throw special uppercuts that deal more damage and that honda 2 cannot dodge i struggled to hit these consistently but by messing around one day i figured out that doing a quick dodge beforehand provides a visual timing quee making the punches much easier so now there was no need to wait for honda's eyebrows and the fight ranged from 45 to 51 seconds and the other fight was don flamco 2 we ended up transforming him from a normal fight to the most random one in the entire game even more than hippo and soda on the first counter of the fight you get a star and you get another guaranteed one every seven counters but on all the rest of the counters you have a 1 in 16 random chance of getting a star it's a complete mystery why nintendo designed the fight this way and frankly it's pretty baffling but getting extra stars can be enormously beneficial since they deal massive damage to dawn zard worked out a phase one where you'd get nine chances at the 1 in6 random star and from there i help develop a road map for the rest of of the fight depending on how many stars you get and what health refill dawn gets in phase 2 this unlock times on dawn 2 that were previously impossible with two stars in the mid refill you could get a time all the way down in the 120s the problem is getting this luck is extremely unlikely most of the time you'd get zero stars in phase one and end up in the 140s like usual now this 1542 world record was quite optimized for the strategies used and the new tech wasn't guaranteed the help honda 2 was now harder and dawn 2 was way more random but there was clearly potential here to beat the 1542 i wasn't sure exactly how much time i could save but if i got everything to line up the record could go down by a lot so in may 2016 i got back to the world record grind my goal time sub 1520 i didn't know if that was a realistic goal but i wanted to at least try for it and right away things were not looking good the random elements kept ending run after run hippo barely let anything through soda killed half that made it to him and dawn 2 was never giving me stars they were teaming up so that on every run at least one fighter gave me unwinnable luck the new strategy didn't seem to be helping but there was still one way i could beat the record on may 24th i got on a run that lost' seconds to soda poppinski this effectively killed it but i decided to play it out and entering tyson i had a 10-second deficit i needed a miracle fight and ultimately proceeded to get the first ever perfect tyson in a run that's hitting all 22 frame perfect punches throughout the entire enre fight in all three phases doing this on the uppercuts isn't too hard but proceeding to then hit all eight hooks is super tough but with the pressure mostly off on a pace like this i was able to get it and lower the record to the 1530s a few days later i was in a similar spot the first 13 fights had done me no favors so i only had a 7sec lead compared to a 210 tyson i need needed another miracle fight and i somehow did it again a 213 matching matt turk's iel record from 9 years prior this time it was a perfect fight other than one missed hook in phase three clearly i had stepped up my tyson game a bit but i was doing it with the pressure off neither of these runs were on a good pace and the tyson fights are the only reason they were records if i wanted to reach my goal of sub 1520 i had to execute on tyson when the pressure was on and a few weeks later i'd get my chance it started with a perfect 38 on king hippo after a solid next couple of splits soda gave me uppercuts and i got a 53 i made it to dawn 2 with a 17-second lead and while he didn't give me the god luck i got one random star in a good refill after a decent sandman and a great macho it added up to a 21 second lead going into tyson this was an amazing run now those 210s and 213s i had gotten were super rare i could maybe pull it off one in 20 tries add in the pressure of a pace like this and it wasn't looking likely but i didn't need a perfect tyson if i could beat him around 220 that would be an amazing fight and i would get the sub 1520 but i also had the 8sec delay to contend with as well as nerves no time to think here we go i had to execute right [music] now [music] [music] a [music] i didn't know how to feel 232 is not a bad tyson but after a 56 phase 1 i was on pace for something amazing it was still a world record but not the one i was looking for so i kept playing this was going to be a very hard run to get out ahead of a 38 hippo and 53 soda meant i was pretty much always going to be behind the obvious time save was tyson even if the super low tyson weren't realistic i could still save a solid 10 seconds there with some regularity but keeping pace with the rest of the splits would be brutal although there was one other place i could hope to save a bit of [music] time every time i fought dawn two in a run it was like a lottery ticket about 96% of the time i fought him i'd get a fight in the 130s or above usually this resulted in a time loss against my 138 however roughly one in every 25 fights the stars would align literally and i'd gain big time getting two random stars plus a good refill meant i could finished da off in the 120s and that had massive implications on on the run it could turn a bad pace into a good pace it could turn a great pace into an amazing pace a good dawn 2 is so rare that you can go weeks without seeing it but whenever dawn 2 decides you win the lottery your run is suddenly thrust into serious [music] territory and that's exactly what happened on june 22nd dawn 2 gave me a 124 approximately 1 in 50 luck and all of a sudden i was ahead of my splits with three fights to go this was a golden opportunity a 7-second lead knowing i had time to save on tyson at the end i just had to avoid a catastrophe oh bad refill on sandman there's 10 seconds gone ah bad delay there goes another five bad macho pattern another 10 gone and and a knockdown the run is over this is what the game does it'll give you false hope with a miracle dawn too but you're far from out of the woods sandman and macho can team up to immediately kill your run and there's nothing you can do about it by this point i was starting to get pretty frustrated i'd been grinding every day for over a month and although my goal was sub 1520 i hadn't even gotten sub 1530 i realized realized that part of it was a mental battle i was going up against my 1531 which had an amazing early game to make me always in the red so i decided to run against my 1534 splits again which were much friendlier before tyson but even still although i could get out to a lead it always came crashing down somewhere this continued for weeks and i began to wonder if sub 1520 wasn't realistic the type of luck i needed on top of an amazing tyson at the end might have been too much to ask i kept doing runs but they always died somewhere i couldn't get everything to line up the sub 1520 just wasn't a feasible goal it would take a near perfect run and the game just doesn't let you finish runs like [music] that [music] [music] [music] w [music] this run was so good that i can get away with the suboptimal dawn two here a time in the 130s would be fantastic but even something in the 140s could be acceptable with the lead this [music] big [music] [music] [applause] [music] i couldn't believe it on the best pace of my life i had gotten the 1 in 50 dawn two luck this run was approaching once in a lifetime territory but i still had three more fights to go i pressed start on mr sandman waiting for this perfect luck to come to an end more perfect luck i felt like i was dreaming the good good refle and the short delay meaning another 6sec time gain time for super macho [music] man perfect luck again this was impossible punch out doesn't let this happen i now had an incomprehensible 36 second lead a typical good run was a low 13 going into tyson only once before had i had a sub3 and it was a 1259 this run was a 1245 going into mike tyson this would likely be the only chance i'd ever get at a pace like this i was about to do the most important tyson fight of my speedrunning career i knew the odds of getting a super good fight were minuscule but i was really hoping i could avoid a disaster if i got the 8sec delay and missed punches the fight might go to the 240s or worse i had one shot to get this it was now or never [music] what [music] it felt amazing this time tyon was far from perfect but on this run i was thrilled i'd only missed one uppercut but unfortunately i missed it late rather than early a one-frame mistake that cost 10 seconds i'll tell you though i literally did not care a 227 under this type of pressure was easily good enough and it led to a remarkable final time of 1512 i couldn't believe i'd set this record and neither could most of the community it felt like a category killing world record the luck was just too good and a great tyson on the end solidified it i wasn't going to beat this run i was done with mike tyson's punch out for good okay hysterics aside let's talk about the 1512 rationally this run wasn't called unbeatable because of my execution all in all i did pretty well given the circumstances knowing i might never get an opportunity like this again i had to hit numerous frame perfect punches while battling crazy nerves but technically speaking my older records like the 1534 and 1538 had better execution overall no the 1512 was insane because of the rng here's what i mean on king hippo i got just one block which is in roughly the 90th percentile of luck bald b one gave me the literal best pattern he could in the 99th percentile honda 2 gave me the good refill and i played fairly well soda poppinski did three nearly instant uppercuts in the 95th percentile dawn 2 we already know he gave me the 1 in 50 god pattern mr sandman we got the good refill and short delay with solid execution and macho literally the best luck at every random event finally at the end of all that mike tyson could have done the 8-second delay to kill it but he didn't he too gave me good luck virtually every fight gave me perfect or near perfect luck the result was this super statistically improbable world record in just one year thanks to a combined effort from sinister zard and myself the world record had gone from 1625 to 1512 i was now 42 seconds ahead of second place there was nothing more for me to do i wasn't beating this record so i moved [music] on as the months passed in 2017 more players got sub 16s but nobody was really approaching the 1512 meanwhile i was busy working on the mike tyson individual fight record i ended up getting it and lowering it a few times but it also had a side effect of building my overall tyson consistency i had always been able to get low times but now i was starting to see them a bit more regularly more like 10% of the time rather than 5% it made me look at my 227 from the world record a bit differently it was wasn't bad by any means but i was starting to see a realistic 10 to 15 seconds to save there and if i could save that much time in one fight maybe the 1512 wasn't so unbeatable by 2018 i hadn't grinded single segment in a year and a half but the possible tyson time save was enough to intrigue me so i got back to doing attempts if there was any hope of beating the 1512 i had to get a crazy tyson fight there is no way i was going to get out ahead of these splits i know i've said that before about earlier runs but for real this time i had no chance of being ahead after the first 13 it may have been only about a 10% chance on tyson but it was the only way this was going to happen i began doing runs and immediately it was rough the worst defender was dawn to that fight was pretty much a guaranteed 15 second time loss and on the rare rare exceptions that he gave something passable someone else always stepped up to kill it this continued for months and typically the culprit was dawn too but one good sign was that my tyson game had definitely improved and even if they weren't records i was getting some really fast runs what a run oh my god 1517 the real test was going to be fighting tyson when the record was within reach and thanks to dawn 2 and the rest that was never happening hippo killed most runs soda took care of some and dawn 2 was the insurance but finally on april 7th i managed to only lose 13 seconds to dawn two on a run tied with the record that was actually a pretty good fight and after i matched my sandman and macho splits my deficit was only 12 1/2 seconds going into tyson believe it or not this was was my second best pace ever other than the 1512 and i still needed a 214 but luck and execution were both on my side yes i just beat the mike tyson's punch out world record i don't believe it we did it man i was not expecting to beat the 1512 that was the power of a good tyson fight this run still had great luck from start to finish in fact it was virtually identical except it didn't get the godlike dawn too but since it's a 150 pattern i couldn't be too disappointed after nearly a thousand attempts over a few months and run after run dying to luck i finally had a new world record to show for it for months after this i continued trying to lower the time i had three runs make it to tyson ahead of the 1510 on the first two i got the 8-second delay to kill it and on the third one i got the luck but my execution wasn't there i hate as i've said before getting it all to line up is nearly impossible i could get a good tyson fight but having to do it on a pace that you might not see again for months it becomes so much harder i was happy with my 1510 and had a comfortable lead so i stepped side once more and stopped running the game however my break would come to a sudden end the following year when completely out of nowhere punch out's greatest discovery ever was made king hippo had been the bane of our existence for years he was about to be made completely irrelevant this is the hippo minipo punch out is super random and naturally players had long wondered if you could somehow control the rng but it seemed unlikely the game looks at two memory addresses to determine each random event one tracks frames elapsed since power on and one tracks all inputs since power on there was no way humans could control that but in 2019 the game's fifth place runner lucor 58 and his brother zoox began looking into it more they took a look at the first first mouth open on king hippo which is controlled by rng they found that punchout actually has a frame roll system just like super mario bros rather than 21 frames it's an 8 frame system so as long as you push start within an 8f frame window you'll arrive at the first open on the same frame every time that solves one memory address but what about the one tracking all your inputs well every frame fr a button is pressed it adds a corresponding value to the memory which is stored in binary however hippo's first open is strictly determined by the two rightmost bits which are in turn determined by how many frames you've pressed right or down so if you don't press down or right at all until king hippo you can control what the memory value is by then pressing start in the corresponding 8f frame window you'll arrive on the correct frame with the corre cor memory address and king hippo will always open his mouth the hippo minipo was born later lucor and zacho were able to extrapolate this to hippo's third and fourth punches as long as you cancel the second one when the dust settled king hippo had become a non-random fight you had to start a timer upon powering up the game then press start in an eight- frame window then carefully fight him to get the second and third opens it was a difficult strategy but if done correctly you would always get either a 40 or 41 on king hippo it probably goes without saying but this was enormous we used to reset 80% of our runs to hippo now we'd make it past him 80% of the time and always with a fast fight we'd now have so many more chances at soda dawn 2 and the rest the world record was already down to 1510 but with the hippo man nippo a sub 15 was starting to seem realistic just a few years ago sub6 was thought to be the ultimate barrier for punchout now 14 5x was the endgame around this time i enlisted the help of one of my viewers i am the danur he built an archive into my split spreadsheet so i could keep track of every split of every run that i performed this was great data to figure out my average fight times my consistency on certain fights and my overall luck danny swur also helped me with something else we plotted all my runs comparing their paces and seeing how far they made it before the hippo mano few runs made it past the early game but with rng manipulation in effect it was a different story for the first few weeks i had many runs go deep but none faster than the 1510 let's take a look at this run on july 22nd we were off to a great start thanks to the hippo minppo and a small strategy change on honda 2 i had a 4c lead going into soda you can see that this is one of my fastest paces ever and right on q soda threw a hook it hurt but a world record was still within reach but after dawn 2 gave me a 139 and sandman and macho didn't help much my chance was all but over not only did i need a perfect tyson i needed a fast perfect [music] fight oh my god that's so [music] fast it's basically dead i mean i would need i would need something [music] amazing oh my god oh my [music] god somehow somewh way it was a new world record this was a very unorthodox way of getting there but in the end i had brought it back it was a small improvement and wasn't what i was ultimately looking for but it showed the power of hippo mano it took just a couple of weeks to set a new record still i wanted to go faster i continued for a few weeks and then on august 6th i managed to get a 49 on soda in a run three instant uppercuts it turned turned a mediocre pace into a great one heading into dawn 2 i was praying i'd at least get something and i did two stars plus the mid refill i was starting to break new ground with this pace my fastest run ever the next step was to make it past [music] sandman uhoh this was getting ridiculous i had to hold it together next up super macho [music] man that's going to hurt i don't really know where his guard is [music] here i made like a two second mistake there one maybe one second mistake the rest of that was on macho back to reality but i still had a chance on tyson if i could get a really good [music] fight oh my god all my games fell sorry that was so loud i hit my console hard and all the games on top fell off run over i hit my punches and got the 8sec delay it seemed like a crazy pace but it was just a tease the game took it away in an instant nothing i could do about it but thankfully the very next day i'd get another chance let's go he coughed up another good fight 124 this time i had to preserve an'-second lead with three fights to go mr sandman gave the good refill but he also gave the long delay meaning i broke even macho gave me kind of sketchy luck but it was still good enough for a sub one minute fight i was able to take a 13-second lead into mike tyson this was my best pace ever since the 1512 i was still 4 seconds behind that run but i had the chance for a massive record if i could avoid the 8-second delay and hit all my punches then sub5 was on the table here i had to calm my nerves down and try to handle the frame perfects my heart rate's not even that high man i'm just shaking all right do my [music] best wow that pattern that was a phase three uppercut pattern [music] it's too fast man i can't do the buffer my god 15 minutes flat oh my d oh my [music] god so close half a second from sub 15 this was an awesome record nearly a 10c improvement i missed just one punch on tyson overall i was happy with my execution under pressure especially because of dawn 2 this would be a tough run the top however thanks to the hippo mano i wasn't the only one going for the [music] record yes all right all right that's a sick pb right there what is that 156 let's go dude let's go zard was back and now that he had the hippo mano he was able to demolish his pb with just one run he cut my lead in half and he was a serious record contender zards 1516 didn't get the crazy dawn two luck that i had and his tyson pattern was slower but other than that we had very similar runs he was also able to take advantage of a new strategy i recently discovered on soda by taking an intentional knockdown he always does an instant uppercut when you get up so i was able to route a strategy where you take damage at specific moments and essentially get a guaranteed phase where soda doesn't hook it helped made the fight just a bit more consistent with zard right on my tail and a new soda strategy to help i pushed onward for the sub 15 a couple weeks later i had one with potential it was one of my fastest runs ever in zadon 2 i had a 4sec lead unfortunately don wasn't playing nice and he gave me a 140 pushing me well behind the record but after after a good sandman and macho there was still a chance wow okay jeez what i needed a 207 to get the sub 15 a really good fight but i had done it before and it got off to a good start a perfect phase one and phase two it was crunch time if i can now hit all eight hooks then this would be the sub [music] 15 [music] couldn't do it man i couldn't do it i can't i can't just get a perfect tyson fight every single time man i can't do it hitting 22 frame perfects under world record pressure is not easy i was three hooks away and couldn't quite hold it together the next several weeks were awful dawn 2 was destroying everything in sight i'd enter him with a lead and the run would be dead moments later every time he was never giving me stars and always giving bad refills this continued for a couple months and then that october i had a run going that looked like nothing special but it took a sudden turn at dawn [music] 2 come on toe [music] just like that it was over tyson gave a horrible pattern and i missed too many punches if it's not obvious yet this fight is so brutal the hardest part of the run by far right at the very end i kept going i had less time to play in late 2019 and a few months passed without anything significant however in february 2020 we had a serious [music] development i'd gotten a 128 dawn two after already being on a great run and after a perfect sandman i found myself 7 seconds ahead it was my best pace ever to this point two fights to go i moved on to macho the fight started as normal and i was able to successfully sneak in two punches after his first uppercut although i didn't get a random star the most important part now i needed to get the good pattern and i did that meant a 28sec knockdown with one star in reserve in phase two i was hoping he'd stand still so i could get stars since i didn't get the random one earlier but he backed up so instead of hitting him with an uppercut after his spins i had to do something a bit slower phase three was now the inverse i wanted him to back up right away since i had loaded up on stars but he just stood still 2 more seconds down the drain in the end i got a 57 second fight not great but it was far from a bad time and it all added up to a 1240 going into mike tyson this was the first time i had a lead over my 1512 this late in the run it was by far my best shot ever at a sub 15 tyson started and almost right away i missed a frame perfect that was okay as long as i didn't miss any more and for the rest of phase 1 i was able to hold it together and avoid the 8-second delay a 56 phase 1 a very good start however in phase 2 he started delaying everywhere it messed with my timing but i'm managed to still hit my punches and knock him down by 132 i'd made it phase three on sub 15 [music] pace [music] sinister had set the first sub 17 zard had set the first sub 16 and now i had set the first sub 15 it was my best chance ever to get it and i was super happy i'd clutched out tyson when i needed it i'd done nearly a thousand attempts since the hippo manos discovery it was mostly a brutal rng grind with some heartbreaking deep runs mixed in but at long last the sub 15 was finally real even though i was thrilled with the run i was still interested to see if i could take it lower and right after this the pandemic hit and i had a lot of free time on my hands so i started grinding attempts harder than ever and man the game absolutely destroyed [music] me this was months of playing nearly every day and i just could not get it more often than not dawn 2 was to blame he'd take a good pace and destroy it in an instant eventually this turned into years of failure i poured hundreds of hours in the single segment after my 1455 and i still couldn't set a new record it was mostly due to luck but i'd had my share of chokes too i kept thinking if i just play a bit more i could finally get it but it never happened 2 years after my first sub 15 the world record remained the same perhaps out of sheer stubbornness i kept trying on april 6th i had a really nice run going into dawn 2o and just like he done nearly every time in the past 2 years dawn gave me nothing pushing the run back into mediocrity however sandman and macho played nice with a 219 and 53 this this run was like several i'd had in the past couple years i had a chance but only if i could get an amazing tyson you can see from my pb perc column developed by z sox that i had an estimated 4.6% chance of getting a new record here we go but it went well i got no 8sec delay and hit all my punches in phase one for a 55 second knockdown phase 2 went just as well i got him down at 129 at this point this was a guaranteed record as long as i could hit all eight hooks in phase 3 but i fell for the oldest trick in the book i dodged too early tyson's hook was frames away from hitting me i frantically hit dodge again praying that mac would move out of the way in time and i just cleared it somehow even managing to land the frame perfect too after surviving that i knew i had this [music] record yeah oh my god oh my god 2 years of heavy grinding all for a quarter of a second improvement this was the happiest i'd felt after a record in years i knew the work that had gone into this and i knew how well i'd played on tyson the final time wasn't much lower but i couldn't care less 26 months later i finally had an improvement i debated whether or not i should continue i had really seemed to run into a wall at 1455 it could take months or years to lower it again i didn't want to repeat the same nearly fruitless grind on the other hand there were developments from other runners 8bit gamer had rapidly improved and a few days after my new record he moved into second place with a 1514 8bit had developed some nice tyson consistency and i knew that given the right run he did have potential to break my record but i still had a 19sec lead and beyond him there really wasn't much movement so i felt pretty safe at least for the time being throughout the rest of 2022 and into 2023 i didn't play a single segment and all the while the record remained the same i maintained a big lead over second place nobody else had even broken my 1512 from back in 2016 that time was nearly 7 years old now all these guys easily had the potential to do it but they hadn't devoted the time to grind for the rng needed and also hadn't capitalized on tyson when they had the chance so with a 19-second lead over second place and a solid world record i was feeling pretty good about [music] myself let's go [music] holy holy cow dude oh my god oh my god holy cow oh my god dude are you kidding me this was the closest anyone had been since i got the world record k3 pretty much out of nowhere had become a force to be reckoned with getting a perfect fight at the end of a run is no joke and he had just done it to catapult himself into second place now he was just 8 seconds from the record had he not gotten a bad pattern on super macho man k3 would have beaten me and he had no intention of stopping now i had never seriously felt a threat to my record in the past seven years that had just changed and as much as i liked k3 i also wanted to try and hang on to the top spot i had tried to lower the record earlier in the year but i ended up coming short once again after hundreds of attempts for whatever reason 1455 just seemed to be my limit but with k3 getting close i had to push past it so as k3 played alongside me i set out on my most intense grind yet as usual i struggled to get anything going i was able to get a couple to tyson on pace but each time i either got bad luck or made a mistake i wasn't getting good tyson like i used to meanwhile k3 had just finished off his pb with a 207 i i felt like i had fallen off i couldn't get perfect fights anymore beyond that the red zone was also killing a ton of runs that was a nickname we gave to three consecutive fights soda bol two and dawn 2 you already know about soda and dawn 2 but bll 2 has random misdirected gut punches that have a 25% chance of going through if you land three of them you get an excellent fight if none of them go through it's a huge time swing overall it's easy to get good runs to the red zone it's not easy to make it through a live between the red zone and tyson run after run was a failure i had done hundreds of attempts since k-3's 1503 and i had made no progress still i held out hope that maybe it was just a funk i could work through and on june 11th i had a chance to do just that all right dude i did it [music] right yes dude oh my [music] god i did it dude i did it it wasn't much but i'd finally shown i could still get a good tyson and although the record was no harder for k3 to beat at least it wasn't a 1455 anymore i had hopefully passed that mental hurdle these splits were pretty balanced except for one point in the middle i got an incredible 48 on soda followed by an awful 134 on bll 2 i decided that for future runs just to make it easier i'd pretend my soda split was a 54 and my bll two split was a 12 28 i knew my job was far from over k3 was still going and i knew what he could do on tyson but i had improved the record once surely with enough time i could improve it again right well i kept getting these heartbreaking runs i'd make it to tyson on pace and whether it was my fault or his the run would always die there i just couldn't do it i was getting chances but i wasn't capitalizing meanwhile another runner was starting to close in this is jder over the course of may 2023 he was rapidly lowering his pb through the 1520s and the big payoff came in june when he blew his old runs out of the water yeah top three baby so now there were two runners with a 1 15x both were within 11 seconds of the record and both were actively trying to get it i committed to the grind even harder it was a mad dash to beat the 1454 i was desperate for a breakthrough and finally on june 28th i had this [music] run [music] [music] he all right i ended up missing the record by 2 seconds but at least it wasn't my fault this time i had hit my punches on tyson and just gotten unlucky this was an insane pace through sandman my best ever by far but it did didn't matter with tyson's 8c delay and that would become a trend over the next few [music] [music] days yep yep yep as always but finally on july 8th tyson gave it up i scored a 54 first knockdown and 12 28 second knockdown and once again i had to hit all [music] eight finally a substantial improvement for the first time in over 3 years i lowered the record by more than a split second and it was a fairly innocent looking run up until the very end this run was carried pretty hard by the last two splits it was nothing special through sandman but a 51 macho and 206 tyson were incredible fights at long last i had a bit more breathing room the next stop from here was getting a sub 1450 a 14 4x to get that i need to run around 1240 or less after macho which i'd done a handful of times before then execute a perfect tyson in other words get better luck execute the first 13 well then clutch out a great tyson when the stakes are even higher i didn't know how long it would take to do this but then just 4 days later i did [music] this [music] it's over wait that was it that was it that was it that was it that was it oh that hurts that hurts i threw it away i'd gotten no 8c delay but punched probably one frame too late in phase 2 with no mistake ak this fight could have matched my 206 a huge missed opportunity i was getting in my head on paces like this when i could see that i had a massive lead i tensed up and tended to mis frame perfects so i decided that going forward whenever i knew i had a good run going past dawn two i'd stop looking at my splits even if i knew it was a fast pace not knowing what it was exactly tended to calm my nerves a bit now i had to get another good run passed on to and by some miracle that only took a few days now we're cooking with three incredible red zone fights in a row i knew this was an amazing pace but no need to dwell on that i closed my splits my good luck continued on mr sandman as i got the good refill and the short delay but macho was a bit slower he randomly blocked my face punches in phase one then backed up in phase 2 when i had no stars i ended with a decent but not great 59 at this point i knew i was ahead of the record but wasn't sure exactly what tyson fight i needed i figured it had to be perfect and probably something like 21 or less i dialed in on tyson and managed a perfect phase one phase two also went well and i had him down at 132 i needed one more perfect phase hit it hit eight i think i need eight but had i known my pace i would have seen that i actually had an 8sec lead i only needed a 214 on tyson hitting all eight here would put me well ahead of that but i was ignorant to this in my mind i needed to hit all eight right now what did i get what did i get what did i get what did i get what did i get what did they got let's go oh my god [music] dude this one felt really good despite being nearly tied with my best pace ever into tyson i still executed a perfect fight and the result was the world's first sub 1450 now it wasn't all perfect my bull one fight got pretty bad luck and my macho fight wasn't too fast either and although i got no 8sec delay tyson did give several other short delays but all in all i didn't care this was a record i've been looking for for years i had regained a 15-second lead over second place it felt really good about where the record was at the only way to beat this time would be to get another perfect fight on a run close to or ahead of my pace into tyson and given that my fastest pace ever was a 1237 that didn't seem too likely so although i kept doing attempts to lower it i wasn't expecting too much but i also wasn't the only one playing [music] cal one punch at a time let's [music] go [music] that was too much dude oh that double switch back dude k3 had just managed the best pace ever into tyson by over 4 and a2 seconds the fight itself did not go well k3 got bad luck missed too many punches and got knocked down but just being in this situation was remarkable across all my thousands of runs i'd never gotten anything close to this going into i'd had numerous upper 1230s but never below 1237 this 1233 didn't get off to a crazy start but it took off in the world circuit he had three excellent fights in the red zone then followed it up with essentially perfect sandman and macho luck and all the while k3 never made a mistake he saw what pace was developing but was still able to lock it down until tyson the truth is while i had had more overall chances at the world record k3 had the very fastest ones back in september 2022 k3 had a 1248 into tyson with a 19 second mistake on honda 2 this could have been a 1229 again my best ever was a 1237 so even though i held the top spot i did not feel safe k3 was an excellent player and he could demolish his 1503 at a moment's notice i kept going and the next few weeks were pretty slow the attempts were really adding up and i wasn't sure how much further i wanted to go i was just looking for one more run on a fast pace where i could knock out a perfect tyson and finally on august 21st i'd get that [music] chance this was an extremely balanced run throughout the entire world circuit every fight gave me very good but not perfect luck i didn't gain or lose too much time anywhere at the end of macho i had a 1239 and i needed to gain 2 seconds over my 210 [music] tyson world record world record this was just a very clean and steady run no splits stood out as being incredible it was just a great run from start to finish compared to what we've seen over the past 10 years it's almost an anticlimactic record to end on but 1446 is where the world record stands today i never never could have imagined the journey i'd go on when i first got the record in 2016 the remarkable 1512 the discovery of hippo mano dawn 2 crushing my dreams the sub5 and the rise of some amazing competitors all these factors combined to take the record to where it is today that and thousands and thousands of attempts from the days of matt turk through sinister one's dominance through zards world record battles and through my own reign with the record punchout has an incredible world record story and i can't wait to see where it goes and who takes it there in the future this has been the history of the mike tyson's punch out world record thanks for [music] watching [music] n
