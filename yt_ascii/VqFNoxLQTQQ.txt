you can learn anything you want there's one mistake that i see so many people making when they're trying to learn something new this is something that has been realized by all the most successful people in the world everyone from steve jobs to elon musk they all have this one thing in mind whenever they're trying to learn new things that's exactly why they are so incredibly successful no it's not about having the right material it's not about being smarter than everybody else steve jobs himself has said that the world around you was built by people that are no smarter than you so you are absolutely smart enough to learn to do anything that you ever want as long as you keep one thing in mind it's about the why why are you learning the things that you're trying to learn for me for example i'm learning computer science because i'm interested in technology and the future of the world i want to understand how all these devices around us work and the reality of working in tech is something that really seems to match with my personality those are some of the reasons why i am learning computer science on my own whenever i am feeling be motivated all i need to do is remind myself of these goals and that is the fuel that will keep me going whenever i'm not feeling motivated motivation is overrated what you really need is discipline the best way to have discipline that is something that has been realized by the most successful people in the world is having the why in mind the reason elon musk is able to do so much and create these insane companies that are changing the world you know because he's smarter than everybody else or maybe he's now because he reads so much but all of that is result of him keeping in mind his goal and his passion for changing the world and affecting the future of humanity in a positive way and it is that fact and enjoying the process of following your goals keeps him going and from burning out that is exactly what i am doing with my process of self learning in computer science and is exactly what you need to keep in mind as well whatever you wanted to learn did you know that you can learn computer science on your own without a degree online for completely free if you want to know how i'm doing that right now you need to watch this video right here because i explain step by step how i'm going about learning computer science and i believe that you can do it too
