honolulu is three hours behind seattle so i wake up at six o'clock every morning to match 9 a.m time in seattle i think working 6 a.m to 2 p.m is awesome because it allows me to finish earlier and enjoy more of the sun while it's out every day i start by checking emails any meetings or check-ins i have for that day or any other administrative tasks what people don't often mention is just how much meetings can ruin your productivity not just because they eat up your time but because of the constant context switching that's why i like to get all of my meetings out of the way before lunch if i can every other tuesday we have an iteration check-in in the morning i just finished iteration check-in most iterations are two weeks long my iteration is a month long so we check in every two weeks to see where we are with our work and if we need any help getting it getting it across the line in the afternoon is where i do all of my coding i already have a day-in-the-life video where i talk about exactly how the coding works so today i'm going to talk about the parts of the job that aren't coding if you're a software engineer you're going to have to plan what you work on and then you're gonna have to design it and also you'll have to present that design then you're gonna have to figure out what metrics are gonna give you insight into this new feature and and will tell you if the feature is failing then you code it and then you test it and the testing takes probably longer than the coding itself then you deploy it then you monitor it and then you collect and respond to any feedback and then you fix any bugs so coding itself actually turns out to be a quite small part of the job and there have been some months where we have to do administrative tasks or security things that i actually haven't coded at all in that month now this isn't meant to scare you away from the job i'm in hawaii right now it's probably one of the best jobs you can have but it's a reality now after work the fun bit i finished working about 2pm and then is off to explore the island some days we go for a hike this is diamond head it's right in the city of honolulu and it gives us an awesome view of the city [music] with great pineapple drinks at the end some days we go snorkeling well most days we go we go snorkeling and we get to see all sorts of awesome fish here [music] it's considered good luck to see a turtle and we saw at least a seven or eight in the water on the beach and even swimming at times [music] some days we went surfing but wow it's harder than expected and i didn't really get very many good oh they're videos waves over there that's a really good wave one thing that's crazy about this whole trip is i thought i would have to explain to my boss and try to convince him to let me go but he encouraged it everybody i knew in seattle happened to go to honolulu at the same time so everybody i knew my entire circle was there and we didn't even coordinate with each other so it really goes to show that being a software engineer definitely in the new age post covit is going to give you so much more autonomy to to be where you want to be and to enjoy the locations that you want to enjoy if you want to learn more about the real coding that goes on in the day-to-day life i highly recommend you check out the other video if you guys enjoyed this video please like the video it helps me out so much and i'd love to see you guys back here please give us a subscribe and click that bell icon thank you so much
