as with many asian countries taiwanese society encourages people to go to college and beyond the reasons are job and prestige related chinese and confucian influenced societies have repeatedly emphasized the prestige of an advanced degree as the poet wong zhu from the song dynasty says to be a scholar is to be the top of society what happens though when higher education becomes universal if everyone has a college degree then does it really give you a leg up on everyone else i've seen this sentiment expressed in unguarded moments by taiwanese people that the degrees that they worked so hard for aren't so useful for finding an actual good-paying job the sentiment is usually twinged with a bit of resentment and i don't blame them gosh what did i spend those four years for in this video i want to talk a bit about the economic forces behind this degree devaluation and why it exists in the context of the larger economic trends happening across the world today but first i want to take the time to talk briefly about a new thing that i've been working on the asianometry email newsletter for the newsletter i just finished up a newsletter recapping and reviewing a previously popular video of mine the one about ant group i was able to add a few new items to the video script including an author's note including what to make of xi jinping personally deciding to stop the ipo as well of china's new antitrust tech laws in the future i hope to do this more using the newsletter to add new items and thoughts i had after posting the video so yeah i hope you'll find it worth subscribing and i hope to try to make it worth your while you can expect a newsletter every four days at one am taiwan time much thanks and now back to the video essay in japan south korea and taiwan college entry rates for young people are over 50 percent the academic threshold for what is considered to be universal education access such numbers are far higher than what we can find in many western countries like the united states which shows 41 percent as of 2018. japan south korea and taiwan breached the 50 college entry number relatively recently taiwan number one in 2004 south korea in 2005 japan in 2010 compared to the latter two taiwan's universal education initiatives went harder further and faster note that in 1998 the taiwanese bachelor entrance rate was 33 in just five to six years that rate skyrocketed to 50 in 2003 then continued on to 67 in 2010. south korea's universal education access started slow and ended fast starting with 45 in 2000 going to 51 in 2005 and then speeding up to a staggering 71 percent by 2008. my guess is that this is driven by the global financial crisis or some government initiative japan barely budged from 40 to 43 from 2000 to 2005. population of course has a lot to do with this with taiwan having the smallest population of 23 million south korea 51 million and japan 125 million i think that's something that we need to point out there is some inherent value in a college education many people make it clear that going to college has many benefits beyond that which is just employment related to them the liberal arts education helps make a more valued well-rounded person it's more than just a crude financial investment and of course i agree with them in many ways a liberal arts education of the type i had was instrumental in making me the person i am today no denying it with that being said there are also studies that point out that expanding higher education access to a universal level can deflate the value of these degrees as an employment credential it becomes a supply and demand question too much supply graduated humans brings prices human wage down there is evidence that this is what happened in taiwan i have done a previous video about taiwan stagnating wage issues the guess of the problem is that taiwan's economy gdp-wise is still growing but the average wage for labor has not kept up i said it in the other video and i want to say it again here this is a global problem tied in with our world's increasing income inequality issues each country has their own flavor of this problem this is taiwan's flavor taiwan's flavor hits higher education graduates especially hard from 2000 to 2010 wages went down for everyone but wages declined most seriously for higher education degree holders it went from 51 000 ntd a month in 2000 to 42 000 ntd a month by 2010 though i will have to note that the 2010 measurement period is coming off the 2008 global financial crisis this is in contrast with people with junior college degrees in upper secondary equivalent to high school the wages there are basically flat perhaps due to the wage issue unemployment rates for higher education degree holders rose to be higher than those for lower status degrees this is unique in the cohort of south korea and japan who show a unemployment benefit from having an upper degree so that is the supply leg of the equation universal education access brought a lot more educated people into the labor market knowledge worker types the problem is that the expansion of supply has not been matched with an expansion in knowledge worker demand as we exit the 2010s taiwan's transition to a service-based knowledge economy remains incomplete the economy still has a heavy industrial and manufacturing component taiwan still makes things like actual living breathing things and that's not a bad thing there are plenty of economies that do find just making really good things germany switzerland the european countries think about all the people in america complaining that the us doesn't make things anymore experience in making things counts for something taiwan can build an elevated mrt extension 10 miles through a crowded urban area in just nine years that's an advantage think about how much it helped when taiwan needed to generate its own domestic supply of facial masks taiwan is by some estimates the world's second biggest maker of facial masks and that happen in just six months an advanced manufacturing economy can be great but it is not equipped to employ a huge number of knowledge-based workers but those workers have to go somewhere if they don't leave the country so a new type of worker employment was created the quote associate professional these people are technicians supervisors service workers and sales people these jobs are broadly different and often vary but in general they share a common thread they require a degree yet pay little more than half of what actual knowledge-based professional jobs management admin etc do it's not a high-end job and the surge in these types of jobs is indicative of a labor force not being properly absorbed by the labor market and since these jobs do not pay so well they have limited social mobility the people who take them sort of never qualify themselves for anything better middle class but not quite on the way up but not taiwan has include continued the education trend beyond just the bachelor's degree a stunning percentage of young taiwanese have a master's degree the number of master students has surged six times over in the past two decades there's a lot of evidence that this trend in students getting master's degrees are doing so because they want to distinguish themselves in the job search they are worried about their employability and wages in other countries like the us uk japan and canada there is a significant wage premium associated with getting a master's degree that has not been the case with taiwan since universal education access was achieved in 2004 starting around then the wage premium of master's degrees holders have declined likely has a pylon effect from decline in earnings power of the bachelor's degree i am reminded a bit of the situation from the roman empire days in the late 4th century the huns began invading the lands of the germanic tribes the visigoths or just goths the goths unable to compete were forced to seek refuge with the roman empire worsening tensions between the romans and the goths would lead to the sack of roman 4 10. the bachelor degrees owners in this metaphor are the huns the goths are the masters degrees holders forced to flee to worsen lands okay i know there's a weird metaphor but it's the first thing that popped in my mind the taiwan education earnings paradox is a warning to developed governments around the world who mandate hard university entrance targets with the idea that economic prosperity and high employment will follow many north east asian economies hong kong singapore south korea struggle with this problem to some extent or another too many associate professionals it's a good way to really disenchant your young people to inspire your kids to study hard and go to college only to have them end up working the counter at 7-eleven if they can find a job at all that really gets people down then they get angry and start doing things like protesting or calling for socialism don't get me wrong i still think expanding access to education is a good thing but even too much of a good thing can be a bad thing each economy has its own situation however for example america's economy likely needs more knowledge workers japan's to such and such and it also has a lot to do with the university themselves are they coming out with the right type of person etc etc but that's beyond this video for the case of taiwan i do think that things are getting better a wave of deglobalization has revitalized the local economy in addition taiwan is one of the few winners in this recent economy in 2020 the shift in supply chains the restoring of capital and high demand for taiwan electronics has triggered a surge in economic growth here it will take some time but wage growth will pick up as businesses face a reckoning and are forced to raise their wages it happened in america so it's likely it's going to happen here the government has more to do of course in order to encourage this but i am optimistic all right that's the end of this video essay a lot of people have been asking me about kind of taiwan local economics and wage growth and the employment issue and it's a really interesting study enjoyed doing this thanks everyone have a good evening enjoy yourselves bye
