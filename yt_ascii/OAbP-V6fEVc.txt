- today we are gonna rob
this house. here's a rock. chandler, smash that window. (glass shattering) you're probably wondering
why am i robbing this house? this is chandler's dad's house and he thinks he is currently competing in one of my last to leave challenges. our next contestant is
todd, as you guys know, chandler's father. todd, get in the bed. last to leave the bed wins $10,000. - bring me the money. - but, that's just a diversion. and while he's competing,
we're gonna take everything out of his house and leave
$50,000 on the floor. chandler's dad is going to lose
his mind when he comes home. - dude, i don't want to be in
a hundred miles of this place. i don't know what he's gonna do. - i know. this is terrifying. chandler, what are you holding? - my family. - you're stealing them? - i'm stealing my own family. - and we have a giant moving
truck to fit all the stuff. i guess i'll just put this here. let it be known that this
$50,000 is not to move. i'm gonna have todd count it.
there better be 50 grand here. - robbing this house is really easy. - don't say that outside. - what? we can't say robbing this house. - we are robbing the house,
but it's a prank, everybody. - okay. don't call the police, please. and i brought back up. we have carl and we have tyler because we have to move a lot. i'm putting chris in charge of you guys. me and chandler have to go
check in on the last to leave. you guys keep robbing the
house. i'll be right back. chris is in charge. - yes, sir. - all right guys, jimmy left me in charge. make sure you're doing
everything you're supposed to be doing. (change clatters) - are we doing it good? (upbeat music) - todd, it's been a
while. how are you doing? - doing great, man. - have you gone crazy yet? - you don't want your snacks? - not right now, man. i'm gonna have to get him
to go to the bathroom, bro. (chuckling) - 'cause usually when
chandler has to poop, he just gets out. - i took care of that this morning. so i'm good on that front. - yeah. you texted me - guys, let's give him some solitude. as you guys know from this
video, silence drives you crazy. don't talk to him. let him lose his mind to
his own thoughts, all right. everyone just get away from him. - all right, y'all heard the man. bye. - let's see what damage
they've done. chris? tyler? what are you guys up to? - nothing much. just robbin.' - heck yeah!
- whoo! - we said robbin.' - [all chanting] we said robbin.' - come on, neighbors. - shh. robbers are supposed to be quiet. but screw it. - [all chanting] we stay
robbin'. we stay robbin'. we stay robbin'. we stay
robbin'. we stay robbin.' - we're robbin' the neighborhood! - that was a joke. that's a joke, everybody. honestly, robbing's kind of
fun. we should do this more. comment if we can rob your house. - it's just a prank. it's just a prank on my dad, guys. - we're totally not stealing anything. nothing suspicious here. - we own this television, i promise. - let's go look at chandler's old room. lock the door. don't let him in. - [chandler] hold on. let me- - hey, we're in here. - this is chandler's old room. guys, let's find something embarrassing. why is that so low? - chandler has a teddy bear. (chandler screams) - why is there a teddy bear on your bed? - that's not mine. i don't know how- - chandler has a teddy bear. - that's not mine! - [all chanting] chandler
has a teddy bear. i want you guys to comment
until the day you die, "nice teddy bear, chandler." - it's not mine, guys. - let's leave chandler
alone with his teddy bear. no, let's go out. have some alone time. - it's not my teddy bear. (upbeat music) - oh, god. this couch is heavy. let's put this down. i think
we need a moving company. this furniture is getting heavy. hey, can i have five movers? (dial tone screeching) - [man on phone] sure. - the movers can't know
we're robbing todd. - yeah. - if the movers ask, this
is our friend rob's house. - oh, i get it. - before we go any further, i wanna make sure the viewers know that this is actually okay. i got permission from all
of todd's family members. - yes. brought my sisters. - when he comes home he's gonna be shocked and he's gonna lose his mind. - yeah. he's gonna freak out.
my dad is gonna freak out. - but after that we're gonna
give him brand new furniture. he's gonna get $50,000. and if he wins the current
challenge, he gets $10,000. and seeing how he's
the only one competing, he'll probably be the winner. he's going to be happy, i promise. (upbeat music) - so far everything's going good. looking forward to dinner.
did i have lunch yet? looking forward to another lunch, and then some dinner and then
a little nighttime snack. - we got one box filled up. we're gonna take it to the truck and keep going until everything's empty. - you're the bottleneck to this robbery. - come on. - families are love, memories, laughter. we can prank and rob each other. - good news. the movers are now here. hey, i want the whole house
empty. grab whatever you can. let's start in the back left
room and work our way up. huddle huddle. don't forget, they can't know
we're robbing this house. - shh. oh you mean-
- [all] hey, hey, hey. - hey.
(all clapping) - whoo. - i bet todd's just
napping while we do this. [music] inside, outside, usa [music] - carl, we need to move
your car. it's in the way. - okay. yeah, it's just- it's in the car. - you left your keys in your car? - yes. - perfect. now i know where his keys are. we're gonna take all this furniture and dump it in carl's house. so after we surprise todd,
we're gonna surprise carl with the house just full of furniture. (upbeat music) we're back at the studio where todd is. now we need to come up
with the story to sell him. we should make todd think
that someone else got out. - you're right. - these are the three people
he's competing against, all make believe. i think tom got out. - yeah. tom got out peeing. - todd, i have good news for you. tom made a mistake and already got out. - sorry, tom. - you still going till you get the dub. - oh yeah. i'm not going anywhere. - i'm gonna go check on craig. chandler, you wanna sit here and bond with your father a little bit? all right, so next we're
gonna go visit craig and see how he's doing. that was a lie just to throw him off. we're back at the house. let's
see what the boys are up to. are you guys playing frisbee? - you gotta take breaks in
life. it's very important. - here. here. can i see that since we're- - don't our frisbee.
- okay. that was a little uncalled for. - what are we doing in here, chris? - i was just showing you
there's nothing here. - you wanna know something?
- what? - it was empty before i left. - okay. this room wasn't
empty before you left. - all right. all right. to
be fair, it wasn't empty. i'll give you that. - zach's gone. chandler's on
the toilet. jimmy won't answer. - my dad just texted me. he
said, "did you leave me, boy?" - chandler went to use the bathroom and then just left to come here and forgot to say bye to his dad. his dad thought he was pooping
for the last 50 minutes. this is mike, he's one of the movers. basically, all i need you to do is act like your name is craig and that you're currently
laying in a bed. is that okay? - sure. - [todd] hey, bud. - hey. so we're at the
other office and we're here with craig, your worst enemy.
do you wanna say hi to him? - [todd] what's up, craig?
- how you doing man? - that's craig, just so
you know. bye. thank you. you might not have
understood what just happened but i really appreciate it. - no worries. (upbeat music) - boys, the house is almost empty. - todd is gonna freak. - my dad, literally, is
gonna just freak out. = let's rehearse it. come over here. chris is gonna act like todd. - dang, blast it. they
took all my furniture. - now we gotta lay stuff inside because a robber would also
mess up the inside of the house. chandler, you see these drawers? - yeah. - make it look like they were robbed. chris, there's a fridge here.
- yeah. - putting you in charge
of getting rid of it. this is a bunch of broken glass. you're in charge of making sure all the windows look like they're broken. we're being respectful. instead of breaking all the windows we're just making it look like we did. - so i know jimmy told me
to get rid of this fridge. i'm actually gonna get
two of the movers to do it and i'm gonna go upstairs. i'm gonna take the toilet out. if you're gonna rob a house,
you have to take the toilet. it's like a rule or something. he's taking out the toilet right now and they're gonna think
their toilet got robbed. - oh. (upbeat music) - we have a problem.
- what's the problem? - would a robber leave all
this good loot in the garage? - this is gonna take like two hours. (upbeat music) - wait, why are you guys- chris. why are we stealing a toilet? - i thought it would be comical. and i was right. it is hilarious. - yeah, but. whatever.
i'll buy him a new toilet. i'll also buy him new curtains. i'll also buy him new windows. can you guys just calm
down for five minutes? - cassidy, hannah, i need you to guys come to the house and see how empty
it looks before we show dad. - so craig, i'm gonna
call todd and i need you to act like you got out. - all right. - hey, so, todd, we
have great news for you. craig, like tom, he had used the bathroom and he got outta bed to go pee. do you wanna say anything? - you're lucky i got a small bladder. - i've had to go twice, man. i stood up in the bed
and peed in a bucket. - tell you what, todd, we're
gonna come visit you next. we'll be there in a little bit. - what's good, mr. cockyboy? i told you the man was
all cocky like that. he fell out the bed trying
to pee or something. oh! hang in there, sydney.
i'm coming for you, girl. - perfect. now todd thinks
it's only him and sydney left. but in reality, it was only ever him. now it's time to set up the hidden cameras to capture his reaction. what i'm gonna do is put
tape over the red light so he doesn't see that. then i'm gonna put it deep
in this plastic. boom. when todd comes in this
door, this gopro right here will easily capture him,
and you can't see it at all. - wow.
- welcome back. it's been a while.
- oh my god. - we put some stuff here on the ground. so, you know, it looked
like he was robbed. - the toilet? - chris got a little toilet
happy. we'll buy a new one. don't worry about it. - oh, my gosh. - the entire house is now empty. - it's so empty in here. - he's gonna freak out. oh, my gosh. he's gonna be so tired and
all he wants to do is sleep on his bed and it's not here. wow, dad is gonna lose his mind. - if he doesn't get mad about anything, he'll get mad that all
the windows are open and the a/c's going. (laughing) - you guys killed it today so i wanted to give you guys
$10,000 as appreciation- (all cheering) - thank you. thank you. appreciate that. - the house is empty except trash. the 50 grand is still here and all the hidden cameras are set up. i'm gonna go end the
last to leave challenge. i can't wait to see how he reacts. we're back at the
studio. we got the squad. we have his family. we're gonna go let him know
he won so he then goes home. and, who knows what happens then? all right. todd, we are back. - we were checking on sydney. - she said she didn't feel
comfortable using the bathroom. and i was like, well, if tom got out and then craig got out
and then sydney got out. - no way. for real?
- [jimmy] you won. - seriously? - [jimmy] yeah, man.
- yes! - [all chanting] todd. todd. todd. - we are currently 10 minutes
away from todd's house. that is todd and chandler. we are gonna follow them all the way home. and the boys fixing the plumbing, said they needed five more minutes. - uh oh. - so this is gonna be a very close call. i hope they get out before todd gets there or todd might start
throwing hands at them. (chuckling) cut the car off. cut the car off. okay. all right. let's go. let's go - oh, god. what the hell? move, son. trish! - [jimmy] oh, my god. he's freaking out. dude, he's freaking out. (suspenseful music) - [chandler] you're gonna
give me a heart attack. - [jimmy] a's just a prank. - i'm killing all of you. - [jimmy] it's just a prank. it's just a prank. - i had a damn stroke, man. - [jimmy] did you notice the duffle bag? - the who? - guess how much money
is in this duffle bag? - i have no idea, man. - $50,000. - yeah! - we're gonna redo your entire house so we just took the liberty of getting rid of all the furniture. so then we could just
move it all in tomorrow. but in the process we wanted
you to think you got robbed. you know, just for fun.
- i did. - your whole family was in on it. your wife, she spent the day
buying brand new furniture too. that's getting moved in tomorrow. - are you serious?
- yeah. - you're the best. i swear to god.
(chuckling) - i'm glad you're happy. (all cheering) - [jimmy] 50 grand plus
all the new furniture. - you and me, we going on a vacay. - oh, no. - i just remembered something too. tom, craig, and sydney,
they were all fake. (laughing) - y'all suck, man! damn! - i asked him if he still wants it, he was like, "that cocky craig." (all laughing) - hey, all right, let's go
check carl's house real quick. - yeah, let's go to carl's house. - but we'll see you guys tomorrow morning. - [trish] see you later. - i hate this. i really do.
you guys were with me all day. i'm so nervous. i don't
know what's happening. - why you nervous? - 'cause i don't know what
you guys did to my house. - we're just having a sleepover, carl. - i hate this. - [jimmy] you ready to go inside? - yeah. oh my- (laughing) mom? - [jimmy] i didn't have
anywhere to store all of todd's furniture. so i
decided to use your house. - you did. the moving trucks. - [jimmy] yeah. i had to return those. - it goes forever. literally forever. that's the wall at the end,
if you can see it that far. - [jimmy] carl, did you say
you were going to your room? - what'd you guys do? why?! - [jimmy] there's more furniture. - [chris] look, you got a
picture of chandler's family now. - [jimmy] all right, carl.

window isn't smashed anymore. - this is great, man.
