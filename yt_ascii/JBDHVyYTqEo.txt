hello everyone and welcome in this video we're viewing the front right suspension of a 2017 ram power wagon a heavy duty truck particularly well suited for off-road conditions with over 14 inches of ground clearance to understand what we're looking at starting with the obvious on the right we have the tire the wheel and the brake caliper moving left you can see the spring and damper towards the bottom is what ram calls the articulink an additional linkage in the lower control arm which allows for greater articulation of the front axle above the axle you can see the track bar or panhard rod you want to allow up and down motion of the suspension but prevent lateral and longitudinal motion the track bar is used to restrict side to side movement above the track bar you can see the drag link this is part of the steering linkage and is used to rotate the right wheel which is then linked by a cross car tire rod to rotate the left wheel finally we have the jounce bumper or bump stop which is used to prevent contact between the axle and the frame when suspension travel is excessive due to shock impacts here's a slowed down clip of the jounce bumper serving its purpose it's fascinating to see just how much movement is going on underneath your vehicle while inside the cabin things remain surprisingly steady for the remainder of the footage i'll let you enjoy watching without my voice until finally the tire smashes the gopro into the frame of the truck well that's the end of that while you're around consider checking out my suspensions playlist my other videos or going outside thanks for watching
