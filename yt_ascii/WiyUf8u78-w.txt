[music] repleni scazib a string of letters that sounds like it comes from an alien language but actually it's something much much simpler the intel processor likely in your computer right now is a beast and its assembly is so powerful that some even refer to it as an interpreted language repany scasb is an x86 instruction and what it does under the hood is actually pretty astonishing the stir len function a c subroutine used to calculate the length of a string can be executed almost entirely with this instruction alone but how does it all work refni stands for repeat while not equal and skasib stands for scan the string byte to set up the processor for this instruction register esi must point to a string to be measured and eax and ecx must both be zero now run the instruction and let the magic begin in one instruction under the hood while the byte pointed to by esi is not a null byte ecx is decremented and then eci moves to the next character at the end of the instructions executed ecx contains the negative length of the string negate the ecx value and boom that's your string length subscribe for more crazy intel instructions and i'll see you in the next video
