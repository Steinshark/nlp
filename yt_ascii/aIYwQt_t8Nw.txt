subs up guys try not to wake the the wife here hey the old ball and chain right now after dark don't normally film with this hour but today is an exception for you because i haven't gotten a video out today and i need to do it anyways enough of that let's talk about what i came here to talk about which is the greatest youtube kung fu master guys i realized the other day we've got a lot of them in the guru space so we're gonna take a watch today up first oh boy we've got mr brian [applause] rose now i'm not going to play too much of this audio because brian brian rose here has been known to take down clips that have this video in it because he doesn't want you to know that this exists but i'll play a little bit okay you'll have to imagine the side effects here i'll do it for you oh whoa brian well careful brian excuse me i'm not trying to get this video rated here any kind of kind of thing let's just check it out what's up with this upward crotch shot by the way brian who art directed this i didn't even mean to talk about this but you're giving me all the material i need thank you brian everyone put thank you brian in chat also put in chat who you think your favorite kung fu master is does it mean they would be good in a fight none of these people would be good in a fight but i'm talking about who are you most entertained by the upward top shot wow okay all right that's enough with brian i'm i don't want to push my luck here up next ladies and gentlemen we've got quite an amazing man someone who's sort of a youtube phenomenon i don't know if many of you are old enough to have gotten this guy his name is ashida kim and this is his video called ninja invisibility and he actually teaches you to be invisible with ninjutsu let's watch technique here cross step two crosstalk now behind the end cross step crust crust oh my gosh let's check this out because this man first of all you can already tell he didn't pit himself against a weakling this man right here i don't know who he is but just from that stance he's a formidable opponent these by the way this is some great good old 2010 youtube where the background noise is louder than the voices themselves it's like that used to be how all of us watch youtube all the time okay let's watch oh my gosh that's incredible this is wonderful this is not the kung fu master although he looks to be it let's watch what actually happens is this fake this has to be fake right no no i mean not fake but like is it a joke is what i mean is it like satire or is this guy real somebody tell me in the comments i'm not too up today this is my first time seeing these clips up next we have a new guy steven seagal okay you heard about about this guy now steven seagal famous you know kung fu action star i don't know if he does i think it is akido this man takes his not his sport too seriously he takes his life too seriously you know a guy like that in your life wow incredible well let's get let's get into this bud just oh wow he started so what kind of technique is that you know all in all of these you actually become more impressed with the people throwing themselves around than you do with the actual guy performing the art move look at how completely bored and serious he is he looks like he's waiting at a dentist's office right now i guess just another day at the office clocking in meanwhile all these guys in the back none of them are impressed and or they all look up to steve so much steven seagal that they all want to be just like him i've been in the martial arts for almost 50 years wow this is pretty it's just it's lame the way he's tossing them about so easily it's just like he makes it boring it'd be kind of cool these other guys are putting on a show but the way he just is so just sad it's this is you could really put some sad music in on this and it'd be like a depressed scene of like a sad fire here put some sad music on here like look at this it's just it's oh my tragic okay so steven seagal honestly i like to see a little bit of effort and that's not what i saw from him i saw it with brian i saw it with the sheet of kim now our final contestant is someone you guys may know ladies and gentlemen dan lok yes he's he's like the student of the student of the student of bruce lee or something i think that's what he claims anyway he's got some fighting skills too well actually i couldn't find any clips of him actually fighting it's just a bunch of him like showing people how to i don't know ladies and gentlemen do we have a real fighter here this is more of what i was expecting somehow what is this protection gear he's showing you the inverted hook kick watch this you can do the straight kick i like this is like a hook like that you can see aka the old kick in the balls now you'll find that kung fu people they love the kick in the balls it's a tried and true technique and in fact it's not it's actually a vault it used to be you just said yeah kick him in the balls everyone knew what that meant no now there's there's a real there's technique to it booze uses that a lot from there which you actually scoop the groin like that you can do you hit also with the toe more like that do you actually give him a little a little joint like that come on that's not fair that's not right even if you're just playing that's not right look he he he doesn't like that listen how did this innocent video get to so much groin talk with brian rose and dan love that way but for now just simple like that right yeah that's it sorry did he did he just do that simple like okay okay guys that's wow what a great way to in this video what a beautiful surprise sometimes you're just gifted a little surprise and that is the lesson today now
