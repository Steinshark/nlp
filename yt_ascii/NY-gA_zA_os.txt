linus this is the most expensive fan in our office more expensive than all of these combined and this one's 250 dollars right now it moves like no air is this honestly i was this is without a doubt the strangest most expensive most niche fan that we have ever seen and i cannot wait to tell you guys how it works after i tell you how to make money on youtube pdq take patch management off your

at pdq.com linus hey linus are you okay to be shocked for science i mean what choice do i have at this point i mean a lot of people fantasized with physically harming their bosses to understand the principles behind this strange little fan first we need to have a little chat about piezoelectrics a piezoelectric refers to something that is able to turn mechanical energy into electrical energy or vice versa piezoelectrics are all around us from the quartz crystal that keeps time in your watch to the stylus of a record player or even the switch of this lighter the way this guy works is there's a spring that compresses when i push down the switch then when it hits a certain point all that spring energy gets released ah a small hammer hits this piezoelectric crystal resulting in and this can work the opposite way and turn electrical energy into mechanical movement so inside this fan there are two piezoelectric ceramics that are sandwiched together one that contracts with positive voltage and the other that contracts with negative voltage that means when you plug it into the wall the ac power will make it start to vibrate let's do that how does this have no specs on it is that even legal it's fine well what voltage does it run at 120. this is one these vibrations are very small which is why the very fact that i'm holding it dampens them out so much that you can barely even see that it's moving but if you place it in something more rigid or even hold it a little tighter oh that's because the blade had to be very carefully tuned so that the natural frequency matched the input frequency and it has to be matched within a couple of hertz ah that's why we need this power supply instead of just running straight off the mains your mains power can be kind of all over the place to illustrate the importance of this think of the blade here kind of like this washer on a string if i just randomly move my hand around the washer barely moves we're not blowing any air with this but if i time it correctly i can get the washer going pretty good that's because i'm matching my input to the natural frequency of this system same principle here so the size and weight of this blade has to be carefully tuned or it will barely move which actually means that this one here won't work in europe because here in north america our wall power is at 60 hertz and in europe it's 50. they actually tried tuning the blade to somewhere in between but it has to be within about one or two hertz for it to work it's hula hoop an elementary gym class all over again really i have no rhythm sorry but your your waist what are you saying what all right where do you want this masking tape just right on the end somewhere it doesn't really matter it's like a big old whack of it or like i don't know i haven't tried this yet oh i see maybe it'll work way better okay i think that what i'm trying to do is increase the surface area all that you're trying to do is just knock it out of natural frequency oh i see well all right there will that be enough oh it still seems to work pretty good that's way less than before though i want to touch it can i touch it you can touch it [music] all right we have a job to do 0.55 let's go back just that tiny little bit of masking tape and then try it again whoa whoa nelly now it's almost an inch that's double with just that tiny piece of tape so we're basically paying for some master piezo craftsman no we're paying for it they only make a couple of them a year that was later in the script but like you know now before we go any further this is more than just a party trick and blowing air by waving a piece of fiberglass around has a couple of big advantages first of all there are no wear surfaces i mean sure this fan has high quality bearings that'll let it spin for a while but eventually it's going to seize up noctow rates their fans at about 150 000 hours of operation or about 17 years that's not bad but the folks over at piezo.com had one of these babies nailed to the wall in 1982 that ran non-stop until 2008 with the only required maintenance being occasional dusting oh yeah and actually it was still fine after those 26 years they just moved offices and figured the poor thing had had enough another key advantage is dust management if you were in a clean room for instance and you had a fan like this running it would shed tiny trace amounts of oil and dust into the surrounding environment this on the other hand sheds absolutely nothing an even bigger benefit though is power consumption this tiny 40 millimeter fan is rated for 0.5 watts which when you factor in the inefficiency of converting ac to dc power lands us at about one watt that's about as low as you can get with a traditional fan our piezoelectric fan on the other hand gets most of its motion from hitting that natural frequency making it incredibly power efficient i mean think back to our washer again what's more efficient going like this or going like this this one is rated for 100 to 200 milliwatts but unfortunately we clearly don't have the resolution to measure that so we're going to move on to our next station which is testing its performance compared to this boy can you see this okay or do we need a black background here see it but black background might be better you know what i have an idea how about this ltt store backpack we're going to have four waves of availability in the coming weeks so make sure you get your order in so that you are in the queue oh wow it really goes doesn't it i didn't think i was going to get that much airflow out of it you can really see a night and day difference between it being slightly behind the fiberglass reed and then right next to it so that's clearly where the intake is like right along the sides here that's so bizarre the air current is so much greater than what it feels feels like be freaking blowing this into i can't even feel it in my notes it says it has essentially zero static pressure and needs free air around it to bring in it's not actually like a normal fan but this still even though i'm reading that off a teleprompter i don't get it how can something blow this much air and yet i cannot feel it at all like there's no pressure like i can but barely okay well let's just compare it to this sure a 40 millimeter it's gonna get absolutely annihilated noctua would never let us down yeah my cost performance analysis is that this is probably better for most things don't need the lab to tell me that no no you're good you're good yeah i could get into incense if it's always like playing around with cooling fans you're with it technically the steam deck is a computer and it is one that we already managed excellent results with using a 40 millimeter cooling fan so will rpa's electric fan be a suitable replacement i suspect no but we're gonna give it a shot anyway alex how the hecking okay this is pretty cool i might want to turn it off first no no it seems fine i'm turning it off yeah that's probably for the best you don't need to undo it that much i had it undone so it would be like perfect you could have just slotted it right in oh valve steam deck now with three thousand percent more vibration how much does that fan make the bomb go up ah that's pretty good though i mean it's fairly lightweight you know bud low power yeah low power which is really important in a in a mobile device you get to plug it into the wall oh yeah no no we couldn't run this off of this steam deck battery because it's ac you can get lower voltage versions that would probably work back oh god so there's part of here no i'm not even what that do you know how to hold a steam bag okay yeah maybe this one oh my god alex you knew you were gonna do this didn't you oh my god okay let's not do that you just clamped onto the screen of a steam deck do you know how few working steam decks there are in the wild none work better than this one so don't ruin it this is the best cooling solution we've ever had on this steam deck it's the worst one so low power while i tool around and do maternal to heat this boy up alex is going to explain more about the construction of our piezoelectric fan our goal is less than 63 degrees which is what we got with our 40 millimeter noctua it's basically just a circuit board fiberglass you have your two piezoelectric ceramics which are just thin little things instead of putting copper in your circuit board you put those in smack it together whole thing sorry i didn't mean to interrupt if they made a lot of them could be very very cheap yeah i was going to say so what's the issue it's the precision manufacturing or no just they make very few of them they actually mentioned that they really like it when videos like this come out because a bunch of people buy them just for tooling around with them like us apparently there are a few on the space station which is pretty cool because while on earth convection happens naturally when air gets hot it gets less dense it rises letting cooler replace it in zero gravity though that hot air just stays there around whatever is producing heat so a piezoelectric fan is a super low power way to simulate convection in talking to me day though they were like yeah we have some fans deployed for zero gravity but those volumes are so low it can hardly allow you to run a business fair enough quite a few then are also used for sensors like temperature sensors smoke detectors chemical detectors and so on and so forth by gently moving air across the sensor you can significantly reduce how long it takes for something to get detected and once again the super low power draw means that a sensing unit can be battery powered one other benefit this fan has over a traditional fan is the start and stop time it is blowing air within milliseconds of being powered on and stops almost instantly when power is removed and one situation this can be very useful is for lasers this is the chiller that keeps our laser tube cooled but even though it keeps our laser tube within a couple of degrees on etching jobs a couple of degrees can be enough to noticeably change the darkness of the etch in some highly advanced lasers then they'll have both heaters and these fans to control the temperature to within one hundredths of a degree and finally they do get used to cool electronics just not in this application now we actually maxed out at 50 degrees celsius on our cpu i have no idea how that works maybe we're utilizing more of the heatsink well but also like our other fan it was off the whole time oh damn yeah like it's actually working pretty well normally not in an application like this though normally in a sealed container just to create a any bit of airflow for the poor low power chip that's going to the deep sea or somewhere equally unpleasant for electronics you know what's never unpleasant though my segway to our sponsor vessi vesi proves that
