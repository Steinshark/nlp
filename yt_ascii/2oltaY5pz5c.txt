[music] you think it's gonna work there's only one way to find out well you better find out fast my sensors indicate he just arrived all right i'm going in before you do if i could give you one piece of advice yeah don't go easy on him hey thanks for coming in have a seat right there to be honest i'm a little surprised you agreed to this this is against all legal advice that i've gone the last thing i posted was a script it was actually made for me by lawyers i've been having to bite my tongue for this whole month while we collect all the evidence and that's that's what's messed me up the most man not being able to come out and just talk well we appreciate you coming in and finally talking but you know okay we've already done the investigation we already have all the evidence that's what these boxes are here for so we know what you did you know you're this crypto mastermind you've got multiple wallets hundreds of tokens we've got them all okay i am no crypto mastermind all right i'm literally a content creator and i trusted the wrong people and it's led to this disaster that i'm in and i really want to apologize about being led by somebody that i should not have trusted so much i should have invested more of my time into really understanding what went on instead of relying on others and for this i hold my hands up that's absolute bull you can't just scapegoat sam pepper you know i mean don't get me wrong he's a bad dude but let's be honest you're looking pretty bad here too buddy you were the ambassador of a kid's charity coin and sold within 24 hours it was the actions of one individual that caused the entire project to not be able to sustain itself which was the original plan not this again okay we're going in circles buddy look let's take a quick break i'm gonna go grab a cup of coffee don't you go anywhere okay i'll be right back he's not confessing even after everything he just keeps saying it's sam what do i do well i ran a few simulations and i really think you should try something else you know i don't believe in treating the witnesses hostile no not that so far you've been leading the conversation try having him start from the beginning and see if you can catch him in a lie it'll make it harder for him to backtrack all right okay we're gonna try something different i'm gonna actually try to give you a chance here do you have any actual evidence for what you're saying here everything i'm about to say has been investigated and looked at by numerous blockchain detectives oh blockchain detectives huh yeah my partner told me you sent in some evidence of you confronting sam pepper or something yeah we'll we'll play it right here on the screen we can see his wallets where he's literally got hundreds of thousands of dollars he must be hiding something to lie to me about this and then show me your wallets but right now all the proof i have is that you made a ton of money sam bro sam then help help me help you then all right help me help you but right now it looks like you made a ton of money bro and you've lied to me and said you didn't and that's what's hurting me the most what hurts me the most is that you lied bro i'm telling you i didn't make a all right i'm gonna pause it right there i'm gonna be honest with you kay there's a there's a problem with the evidence you're showing here that wallet you're showing on screen right now that has all this money that sam pepper supposedly made it doesn't belong to sam pepper i personally traced it down it belongs to somebody named boinkboink i actually called boinkboink to confirm this okay is is this boinkboink.eth yeah that's me hey you're not sam pepper are you nope you have nothing to do with sam pepper nope ck not only were you wrong about sam pepper owning this wallet you put on screen instead had 170 thousand dollars all the proof i have is that you made a ton of money sam you also slandered someone else's reputation in this ridiculous quest to be completely innocent i mean what do you have to say for yourself man everything i'm about to say has been investigated and looked at by numerous blockchain detectives kay you've already said that and look i hate to ask this but are these blockchain detectives in the room with us right now okay the blockchain detectives that i hired over the past few weeks have found reasonable evidence that suggests that many of these wallets connect back to sam himself wait wait wait wait slow down now okay you're changing the subject on me we can go there but to be clear now you're talking about the pre-sale list sam had you're saying those wallets are secretly his what evidence do you have for that and the biggest concern and what we've really found out and what led us down a deeper rabbit hole was that if you type in all of these twitter names on the left half of them are fake not even real accounts who even knows if these accounts ever existed so the people that sam are trying to verify are real people putting money into the pre-sale are in fact fake people that don't exist currently it's looking extremely likely that these wallets are owned by one single person so that means that one individual owned 12.24 of the total supply which is obviously insane okay let me just stop you there bud not only do these people exist but you were wrong about the most basic piece of information a lot of those names aren't twitter handles at all they're telegram handles like this pronous 333 the example you gave here but he a hundred percent exists he called himself the wordsmith of the wild west as we can see from an archive or take another guy from this pre-sale list which is all controlled by pepper he simply went by jamie when i reached out and interviewed him but one of the things k said is that you guys in the pre-sale list didn't exist and that you guys secretly were controlled by sam peppers like sam pepper y'all were fake accounts and sam pepper controlled everything but that's not true is it no no no not at all a lot of us actually lost a lot of money on save the kids like me personally i lost 6b as well so kate your whole theory about sam pepper secretly controlling 12 of the coins and all these accounts being fake it's just more incorrect information i mean for all this so-called self-investigation you've done you've uncovered nothing but a bunch of false information which you used to paint yourself as innocent and sam pepper as this evil villain but does it ever occur to you that maybe you're in the wrong here look just try saying sorry to the people you affected i am genuinely so sorry that any of this ever happened it was never my intention and if i could take it back i would instantly in a heartbeat good good actually hey that's a start you know just leave it there don't make any more excuses even though i was tricked by somebody that took advantage of me and my fan base all right look that's it this is over if you're gonna lie you're gonna deflect blame okay let's see where that gets you right look you just hang tight someone will come get you but for now this interview's over that's it we're wrapping up here i may be wrong here but i detect frustration in your tone you know what a little bit i just thought after collecting this much evidence catching kay in this many lies i thought he would come clean why woody with a fan base of literal children i assess he has a 68.2 chance of escaping this at its current course and that's calculating if law enforcement doesn't intervene so what do i do i feel like i've shown people everything well confessions are nice but the next best thing is an airtight case you've demonstrated several flaws in case defense but perhaps there's more evidence to be found will facts even matter at this point i'm tired of this i know but your work is far from over you've got to finish what you started as i went back to the studio i dreaded the long night ahead but somewhere late at night buried in the blockchain i found something that made it all worth it okay you got it ladies and gentlemen with the with the sun pouring in through the windows here i've been up all night researching the so-called response of fraser k and i'm ready to debunk it so far i've already demonstrated that kaye's so-called blockchain detectives are about as reliable as dream's harvard astrophysicist and that the conspiracy theory of sam pepper controlling the pre-sale list is false but i want to say here i'm not defending sam pepper by any means sam pepper was a key player in save the kids the scam but so was fraser k and with his ridiculous self-investigation where he found himself innocent k muddied the water by throwing a bunch of accusations against sam many of which are not true so i had to clear those up but now let's move to fraser k himself if you watched my last video on save the kids all our reporting ends up standing up pretty strong k started the coin sam pepper changed the anti-whale code and both of them have an incredibly shady and long history in cryptocurrency but kaye is now denying a lot of this accountability in a new response video that he put out he's been basically saying he doesn't understand how crypto works he said it multiple times i am no crypto mastermind all right i'm literally a content creator and i have no technical background or knowledge this is easily debunkable not only because kay then reveals four wallets of his but we also know that in these wallets are hundreds of different types of cryptocurrencies take for instance his main wallet which has over a hundred unique types and i'm just gonna say this right now if someone owns a hundred of anything you're not gonna believe them when they say they have no knowledge of that thing kate knew what he was doing and pretending to be a dumb influencer isn't gonna work now another thing i want to address is kay pretending that he was somehow a victim of sam pepper he makes a lot of noise about the supposed money he lost on save the kids which he tallies up to be thirty seven thousand dollars but i'm going to exactly break down to you how i lost thirty seven thousand dollars on save the kids now as i said it doesn't really matter if he lost money on this scam the problem is you dumped the coin and that you made six figures on other cryptocurrencies but even this 37 thousand dollars he lost i'm not sure he actually did see one of the biggest costs he mentions is a 55 000 listing on an app called poo coin two hours after save the kids was launched i sent 55 000 of my own money and this was for one single purpose if you're familiar with crypto this website is a place where you go to check out all of the the tokens the graphs everything like that and that is exactly what the 55 thousand dollars was for now this is crazy this sounds like a lot of money but what k doesn't tell you is that technically he could take back that money anytime to understand why let me explain how this works save the kids got on something called the vetted list for poo coin now to do that you have to be a top 10 contributor to their liquidity pool once you are you will show up on a top 10 vetted list but here's the thing about this list you can take your money back out of these polls at any time something that i confirmed with the poocoin promotional team and they said that they decided to block save the kids from the list after everything went down quote when tokens are blocked they can then withdraw their poo coin lp at any time which they should do because there's no longer any benefit in keeping it there so right there ladies and gentlemen in black and white this payment that frazier made can be taken back out and speaking of that block sure enough i noticed that the number six spot is blocked right now on poo coin so i asked the team is that save the kids they responded yes number six is a blocked entry for save the kids now what's great about this is we can still see how much money is still in there forty one thousand one hundred ninety five dollars and 84 cents i asked the listing company how much money could be withdrawn from here after fees he starts by saying if the 42k is withdrawn it will turn into 21k and bmb and 21k in poo coin and then after some calculation he says so in total they will get back thirty seven thousand two hundred and twenty eight dollars which coincidentally is about the amount he said that he lost how i lost thirty seven thousand dollars on save the kids but there's actually more here i discovered as well because after kay confessed which wallets he owned i went back and checked and this wallet right here it was the largest owner of save the kids tokens at launch let me repeat that the person with the largest single save the kids token balance at launch was none other than fraser k and of course we know what he did with these tokens he sold so just imagine for a second you're an ambassador of a coin you created it you have the largest balance and then you sell almost immediately and then when you get caught you blame it on sam pepper a guy who worked for you and you say oh no i didn't know anything about crypto but it gets even worse than that this ladies and gentlemen might be the point where kaye's whole dodging of accountability falls apart so far we've heard repeatedly from kay about how he was backstabbed by sam pep how sam pepper caused everything when sam pepper sold his tokens but given all the lies from fraser k i wasn't sure did sam actually sell before frasier well i went back and checked their main wallets we know of and what i found made me sick to my stomach here's a little spreadsheet i made with their main wallets along with their first cell of save the kids in the transaction id and for reference these tokens were given to them at june 5th at 10 26 p.m utc time and if you take a look at this and i put their fast to sell in bold you'll notice that it was not sam pepper who sold first it was actually frasier k frasier k sold 30 minutes before sam pepper an entire 30 minutes before this man who threw this guy under the bus completely and played innocent in actuality started selling first now again is sam pepper a dirtbag yes you only have to watch my other videos to know that i am not a fan of sam pepper i do not like sam pepper he had a huge role in this scam but for k to play the victim when all the evidence is against that narrative i can't sit idly by and let him lie to people sam pepper was not the first to run for the door sam pepper just ended up selling a little faster in the end now other things you should also probably know is that k is not past his days of trying to silence people see right before launching his new response video kay sent another cease and desist letter not to me this time it was to sam pepper now i can't show you it on screen because unfortunately it was marked confidential but what i can tell you is that part of the cease and desist letter was apparently because sam pepper had given me and some ordinary gamers my co-investigator who you should watch here he'd given us information that's right ladies and gentlemen if k can't stop me from talking he'll try to stop sam pepper from talking and i confronted frasier about this by the way to give him a chance to deny it because we all know that we take pepper with a grain of salt but he didn't respond for comment but it just seems like more and more action by frasier to deal with this by silencing people rather than coming out and just being honest about his actual dealings and save the kids now at this point we've already debunked nearly every point of fraser's self-investigation and proven his response to be massively wrong at best and completely manipulative at worst but there's another feature here i'd like to discuss these giveaways that fraser k addresses see he says it was there's only one mistake in all of the giveaways so it's come to my attention that one giveaway out of all of them was missed and this is a 500 giveaway to a single person but this is not true the wallets i'm about to show you not only won multiple giveaway tokens from fraser k but some of them are also getting paid b and b by k coincidence maybe but when five wallets when two or more of your giveaways and multiple of them are getting paid from your main wallet it starts looking pretty suspicious take for instance that second wallet on screen here ox4984 it won three giveaways from k it was also paid five thousand dollars from kay's main wallet and then oops what's this it also bought into the save the kids pre-sale probably a coincidence i'm sure but not only that this wallet which won all these giveaways also got paid by hilariously enough two known sam pepper wallets in fact the first ever transaction on this wallet is from none other than sam pepper.eth making it likely that this wallet which won multiple of fraser's giveaways is either sam pepper or someone close to kay and sam i asked sam about this he denied it being his wallet but tell me again how all of these so-called giveaways were on the up and up i mean sure some money was definitely given away to real people but there's some seriously shady business too which kay has obviously not addressed why do the people he's picking to win also have a history of being paid by known sam pepper wallets and his wallet in the past i thought they were random strangers but now that we've talked about these giveaways i have one last surprise for you guys one last big reveal so far most of these videos have been focused on the perpetrators of the save the kids scam but i'd like to shift gears and talk about the victims of save the kids the fans previously we didn't know who invested and why but now that's changed because i just got access to the public pre-sale request list and why that's important is because in order to get on it you had to answer some questions most notably why you wanted to buy save the kids and how long you planned to hold it the purpose of me sharing this is to get you in the heads of some of the people who bought in to save the kids token many of whom who lost money because right away from the responses it's pretty clear some of them just wanted to make money why do you want to buy lambo lambo i want to buy lambo lamborghini sir lamborghini i want to buy lambo so i can afford lambo to buy lambo to buy a lambo but others weren't in it for the money they were just fans support the cause and faze clan love faze clan and what you guys are doing faze moon heard about this through follow frasier and my other faves from faze first of all i like the ambassador very much i've been following phase k for a long time and then interestingly in the how long you plan to hold section this person said i plan to hold until phase k abandons this project just kidding well turns out k wasn't kidding these are just a few of the responses there are almost a hundred responses like this that mention phase specifically others mention a specific phase member like k or nikken others really just wanted to save the kids quote why do you want to buy because i want to help participate for charity help people with charity and earn some money as well because being on a charity coin and getting rich at the same time is just so satisfying and what this shows is the real humans behind a scam like save the kids they don't all go in for the same reasons they're not just numbers on a chart these were real people that this affected nobody seems to care about that everything is about blaming sam pepper and how k didn't do anything wrong but the truth is it wasn't all sam pepper's fault k owned the biggest wallet he started selling before sam and he created this coin don't let him lie to you not about that or about sam making hundreds of thousands of dollars from save the kids because the evidence just isn't there these blockchain detectives that he hired are a joke they mistook boinkboink for sam they mistook an entire pre-sale wallet list for a conspiracy about sam pepper owning everything see the truth is all these influencers love shilling crypto when it's fun and making them money but the second people get scammed and people start to think there might be some trouble involved everybody disappears nobody knows how crypto works and it's impossible to get anyone to take any accountability and i can't help but think it's ultimately going to take law enforcement getting involved for anyone to actually stop this but whether that happens tomorrow or 10 years from now either way you can count on me being here in the 10 million dollar studio losing sleep tracking down these cases for you drinking too much caffeine because i won't stop until we do actually save the kids all the [music] are you promises same as choice
