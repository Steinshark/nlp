we're going to talk about the new location based game pokemon go like in the old pokemon games you walk around and you collect pokemons but the new thing is that this time you're not walking around on your game boy in your in your virtual game space but this time you're actually walking around the city and you collect pokemons wherever they appear in the city first you download the app from the iphone store or the android store so we have a couple of streets here you need to be outside because the game uses gps to track your position so this is us and we actually physically walk around the city with our phones in our hand and then hopefully suddenly a pokemon appears and then when we're there we see the pokemon on our screen it switches to like a very simple augmented reality view with your camera and then we use the pokeballs and do a very simple flicking game so i have a i have a pokeball here and then i have to try to throw it at the pokemon and if it works the pokemon is captured by the ball and then goes into my my backpack or as it's called in pokemon lingo by pokedex so we're here at the university and over here is a pokestop and if we do this we get bonus items that we need and there's also pokemon next to it let's see if it works i've hit it but now it might escape so we need to wait a few seconds it has escaped so let's try again so yeah yeah i need to i need to i need to hit the pokemon with the ball by flicking it in this direction and my aim is very very bad at the moment yeah so i've hit it now goes into the ball and depending on the strength of the pokemon and my level and the quality of pokeball i've used it might or might not escape yeah gotcha psyduck was caught so i got experience points for it and stardust and candy do you already have that one i already had that one yes so it doesn't matter that we're a little bit away from that particular no because because gps is very imprecise anyways it works really well when you're driving on the street because then the phone knows that you are on the street so it will fudge the results a bit and actually put you on the street but if you were just walking around then the gps will jump around a little bit at some point i will run out of these pokeballs because i only have a limited amount of them so what niantic has also done is they placed so-called pokestops in the environment and i can see them on the map that i have and then if i walk to these pokestops i get bonus items pokeballs etc so i can refresh my energy basically and then there is a another type of location so called gyms now when i walk to a gym i can place one of my pokemons inside this gym and then the pokemon is protecting the gym and i can leave the spot again i can walk around further collect other pokemons train these pokemons and then if another player comes to the gym they can fight against my pokemon that is protecting the gym so the gyms are a bit like a boxing gym rather than kind of a workout gym is that right yeah they actually look very much like a like a boxing ring so you have like a platform and then you can see the two pokemons fighting against each other each pokemon is using their their special abilities there are about 750 different pokemons in this game i believe and in the in the overall pokemon world there are plenty more so i'm sure niantic and nintendo will release a couple of more as soon as everybody has found all the pokemons because that's what what the game is basically about to to catch them all to to complete your pokedex then to train your pokemon make them better and gain prestige by by owning these gyms so these headline gotta catch them all it's not about getting every single one it's about getting the different types is it yes yeah they're as i said they're like 750 different ones i believe and if you if you find the same one again you do get some some bonus experience points and some some stardust and candy and all these kind of things but then you can exchange them for more bonus items etc so you want to have like one really strong pokemon of every type who's making the money out of this what's going on with the money yeah that's that's an interesting question many people ask that already when niantic was doing ingress which is the the predecessor in pokemon you have the freemium model so instead of instead of walking to the pokestops and collecting new pokeballs i can also be lazy and just pay pay money and then then get these items so that's one one business model and the other interesting thing is by following the people around the city and observing how they move where they go where they congregate etc niantic also learns a lot about the structure of the city about people's movement etc and so that's potentially very interesting data to analyze and then use in other ways than just gaming maybe some kind of data harvesting going is that right well they they need to do some data harvesting anyways because that's what they are what the game is all about to send people into into unexplored environments for example that's also one of the fascinations that that the pokemon go game has that you see that there's a pokestop somewhere and that's why you go there and you go to an area of the city that you haven't been before and so you so you explore the city you learn you you see the city with new eyes in a way so you're doing sightseeing in your in your hometown which is something you often don't actually do you think that the people who are playing this game are actually seeing any of the sites or are they just staring at their phones well that's that's something i've noticed when i when i'm playing the game and for example here at the market square there's often a big congregation of people playing the game and yes people people look at their phones and they look at the map so they they can see where the poker stops are etc and they focus very much on the map they catch the pokemons with the augmented reality view they do the flicking game etc and sometimes they seem to be a bit remote from the from the actual environment and that's something that we in research have tried to to investigate like what makes these games exciting how much coupling between the real world and the virtual game space do you want to have how does it change the game experience because what niantic is doing is they have a big database of all these landmarks where they place the pokestops and the gyms etc and so all of these locations are at interesting places but then again there's no strong connection between the game content and the actual location because if i go to this pokestop or to this pokestop that doesn't have any different meaning another interesting question is in a way a legal question or an ethical question because you're placing all these virtual objects into the real world into the into the cyber space so to say so who owns the cyberspace of your location if i if i have if i live in my flat and then because of how the game is set up a pikachu appears in my back garden that will potentially attract other players and they might then feel enticed to climb into my back garden and they don't necessarily will feel that it's something illegal they're doing because the game kind of tells them there's a pikachu come here pick up the pikachu and then it becomes an interesting question what happens if there's an accident for example while they're trespassing other cases that have been in the media are locations that don't really want pokemon to appear there for example the holocaust museum in new york or auschwitz cemeteries in general so suddenly you have people running around a cemetery holding up their phones onto onto graveyards so it's an interesting social and ethical question that you have to ask yourself when you're designing these games and when you add content to these games why does that happen on those particular places what what's causing those to become hotspots yeah because niantic is using a very simple trick so to say to create all the content so they haven't gone and opened google maps and placed a pokestop here another pokestop here and pier should be a pokestop so they have a big database of locations which they have increased by by the previous game ingress and so now they have a giant database of landmarks of monuments of schools universities statues etc and all of these locations are chosen for the game and then auto generated as pokestops and gyms so there's no moderation process in there at the moment this you must
