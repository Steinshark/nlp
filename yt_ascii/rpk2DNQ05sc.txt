ai is taking over all jobs i'm just going to give up i'm like where's the closest speech i just i'm over it there's going to be no job soon okay can i say something listen ai is not going to take over all jobs what it is doing is it's making and creating new jobs new opportunities in different fields you know what i should do i should sit down and share with you exactly what these areas are so you're well informed and can stay ahead of the game all right fine tell me more all right we're going to start with one of my favorites or one thing that i have been dreaming about since i was a little girl and i think a lot of you have two or i'm basing that because a lot of times when we watch movies or see in story books this is what it is can you guess autonomous vehicles or autonomous driving now this is really interesting to me because the rise of self-driving cars is not only changing transportation but it's also opening up a wide array of new job opportunities and i think this is really cool because if you have certain background skills maybe not directly in tech but in other areas you can apply them to many of these different jobs and learn about tech as you go i mean okay let's talk about the tech side and i want to show you just how many roles are within this sector i mean for one you need machine learning engineers who develop the algorithms that power these vehicles then on the other hand we need a lot of cyber security experts i mean a lot cyber security is an area that is continuing to grow in demand and i think with autonomous vehicles we are going to see that continue to increase i mean think about all the safety that is required with this then here's another one for more of you designers or creatives out there uiux roles will play a huge part with self-driving cars i mean think about the experience from when you get into one of these vehicles you want to have it very it feel very natural feel very seamless okay speaking of autonomous vehicles i want to share with you probably no not probably the coolest autonomous vehicle that has been making waves specifically in las vegas and it will soon be coming to so many other major cities so it's something that you should be aware of i'm referring to the hyandai ionic 5 robo taxi now here's the really cool thing i've seen this in different clips shared that are located in vegas where it is currently being tested but here's the really cool thing it's actually undergone a driver's test and i think this is super fascinating the person who did the driver's test she typically fails almost 85% of people who take their driver's test on a daily basis so i was like there's is it really going to pass her test and here's let me share a clip with you i'm candice jones a certified drive examiner for the dmv i've been doing it for about 25 years in that time i have felt thousands and thousands of students in the interest of public safety if i take about' a day three would [music] pass and we're going to get this started do you think it'll pass i have my doubts [music] it's going to be the same criteria just like testing a human will be monitoring the speed are you going too fast too slow how it does a lane change did you signal early did you signal late did you forget to signal okay so you're kind of like me probably thinking there's no way this is going to pass the test but before we get to that i want to share with you how these ionic 5 robo taxis are really impacting people's lives okay i want to share with you though about pearl pearl is someone who lost her vision and check out her story but i have a retinal degenerative disorder and as my vision got worse i gave it up smooth water people don't realize how her freedom is limited by her disability a lot of blind people don't get out in the world there have been times where i've wanted to go somewhere but it's challenging to get a ride or ride chair is too expensive so it's like you're always on somebody else's schedule so you can see just how incredible the impact is on these autonomous vehicles the ionic 5 robo taxi now here's another thing these ionic 5 robo taxis i mean for me i don't know about you but when i am driving or someone else is driving driving me around i often find that they're either on their phone distracted by billboards or ads or just not fully engaged and end up missing a turn getting stuck in traffic it is so frustrating now with these ionic 5 robo taxis i mean they don't get distracted they are there they are making meticulous calculations to get you from point a to point b in the fastest time possible okay but i feel you the other thing that comes up is around safety how can you feel comfortable getting in something like this and at first i felt the same way but like everything we have to go back to the tech so the ionic 5 robo taxi is actually class ified as an sae level four autonomous vehicle and it's equipped with various sensors to ensure safe driving in various in all different environments and these sensors include advanced radars lighters and cameras now back to the driver's test so it ended up passing the driver's test and the driver instructor goes on to say it did so very very well she was extremely impressed which is really cool to think about surprisingly it was a perfect score oh my gosh that's awesome i'm impressed i'm giving it a thumbs up i mean even at the beginning of showing about the driver instructor she was hesitant you know she was open and honest that she didn't know if it would pass but then by the end when she was riding around in it she was 100% confident that yes this is so safe this is the future and she was so excited about it which was really cool to see so it brings up the question with the adoption of the ionic 5 robo taxis could this mean in the future that we don't even need to get driver's license we just hop in one of these vehicles to take us around i mean think about all the time it would save all right coming at number two is nlp or natural language processing so it's no secret this is a very budding and trending area right now and edge machines get better at understanding and generating human language nlp is continuing to find applications in various sectors i mean a few to name examples would be content creation language translation think about how you interact i'm going to use the example of chat bots because that is most commonly right now how a lot of us anyways interact with nlp so what opportunities will be created with nlp i mean think of linguists data scientists and software engineers these are just a few examples people who will be building and interacting with nlps to various degrees and i think another thing that is so important to note is that a lot of these roles even if you don't come from a tech background but you have another background that you specialize in you can bring that knowledge when you start really integrating that knowledge with other ai knowledge it's pretty cool when you stop and think about it i think one thing that it will really do is ai will need experts from various fields to come together depending on how it's being used all right number three on the list is computer vision this to me is fascinating and it's threaded throughout some of the different things we spoke about earlier but here is why it is going to make such a big impact in the job market so ai powered computer vision is honestly revolutionizing industries like healthcare retail and manufacturing now what exactly does computer vision do what how would you explain it so when you think computer vision or you want to explain it in a simple way you can think of it as enabling machines to interpret and understand visual information so where could this be used well think about it in examples of using it for medical analysis cashierless stores and then also to production quality assurance in production lines production quality assurance and yeah you get what i mean some include data annotators computer vision engineers and domain experts who can apply this technology to specific industry areas it's pretty cool if you ask me number four on the list i mean look at my little friend here i i only wish my little friend here was real but number four is robotics and automation now this is something i am so interested in i think it's super fascinating and i think you should be too and here is why so as you know ai is enhancing the capabilities of pretty much all software systems it feels like nowadays but what happens when you mer ai software with robotics hardware that is when magic happens in my opinion that is when you can get some really incredible things that start working and start taking place i mean we've seen different examples think about nvidia's little robots that they recently showcased and i say little they're very powerful but little meaning they made them look cute and friendly in this one but there are so many job opportunities with within robotics that are continuing to open up i mean think of robotic engineers ai specialists technicians these are because it is a hardware aspect to it it really opens up this entire world of jobs for hardware specialists so maybe you don't come from a software background you have a hardware background next thing you know the two worlds are merged it's pretty cool all right those are the top four areas that ai is going to impact the job market mak so many different jobs for i mean even within these areas that i listed are so many different areas that you can specialize in it's pretty incredible when you stop and think about it we often hear the negative side of oh my goodness is ai going to take all jobs or different things like that to really hone in on our fears but when you really take a step back and think about it ai is going to open up so many different opportunities for us and there are so many jobs and roles needed honestly some that as i was researching for this video i didn't even know existed which is pretty cool all right thank you all for watching this video i hope you found it very valuable and helpful as you navigate looking ahead as to what's next for you what are some job opportunities that are out there i think it's pretty important to be very well informed if you haven't already you know you know the drill hit that
