so the rampant wobble is legendary and as with a lot of legends. they're not always entirely true the ram pack is now on there so it takes a little bit longer than now to to power up then you go in there's the cursor so we could type in our program again 10:00 print. let's do a hello this time took a little bit longer to enter it into the memory go to 10 so there's our program but as you can see the machine itself kind of wobbles a little bit as you're typing in code and if that rampant one was too much. we lose the data, but actually our one and we haven't done anything clever here, this is just a standard old ram pack, but actually if we wobble it move the machine around a little bit actually if we now type run it's still working. okay, so you know the ram pack wobble? the classic one that everybody talks about is the blue tech allegedly recommended by sir clive himself and you would put a piece of blue tape between the case and the ram pack and that would just stop the moving i think in reality that doesn't necessarily work that well. how strong is blue tech. you know but we've had some brilliant resolutions to this so quite often we've probably had two or three machines as xat ones and they donated on a piece of white melamine chip board and there's a bloomin great big ugly metal aluminium bracket that holds that so the piece of wood and then there's another aluminium bracket that holds the rimpac down as well they look really ugly but actually when we laughed about this we plugged the enemy tried it actually if you still messed around with and soo much it would still lose that memory this one's particularly good connections for whatever reason. i don't know that it's just good they actually made it worse because as the machine the connections tarnished a little bit that got in the way and the connections and that you know caused more problems but the one that i did which was a bit harsh. i admit is to take my machine out of the case completely and chop the wires that hold this connector in place and in solder it directly to the back of machine itself that was harsh, but it worked and i ended up and i really regret this taking a machine that i had at the tone called a tangerine micro 1065 it's actually a really quite a sought-after machine now there weren't many of them but just gracefully i took the keyboard off it because i hadn't i particularly used for that machine and i took all the tracks off the back of the keyboard and rewired the matrix so it matched the zajonc 81 and i had a proper zelich's 81 with improper keyboard, and i've sold it on ram pack, so it was absolutely yeah, i'm a completely reliable so what sort of programs, would you write on your? oh saw some random stuff. i mean i had a go at writing games. i grand visions of writing these amazing games i wrote these kind of well. i mentioned the game called piece of kroll that i've seen on the nasscom some years before and i wrote a version of that which i've called crystal castle or caves, i don't know and i never did finish it it was probably rubbish anyway but i did you know adding up things you know kind of bank accounts. i was 11 or so so the thing is what the most important thing about this machine is the thoughts of what you could do with it not necessarily for a lot of us what we actually did with it but that's just as valid because then later on you know you'd have that drive things go and do it on machines that you know would have more use to you later on a lot of the time i was loading in things like lunar landing and and and some of the games i was bought the the maths pack the mind this is the junior education pack but dad you know i wanted to meet to learn so obviously bought me the mass spec and i'd become a mathematician at some point which still it's not happened so it's not managed to get them to buy me the games take i think these are about four ninety ninety three ninety nine i remember having i think two of these and these hold a lot of affection for me because they've just the look of them i had two of these one was games one was the mass spec and i had another game, which i think might have been an analogue? game, maybe a kong type copy or smoke i remember now but again i've had three original tapes for it there's a real branding thing there i go well sinclair i think was really really cute on this side of things he was very very much about the aesthetics and the look and the presentation those products and again although they take stick you've got to look at them and look at the you know the design the aesthetic of these and realize actually there was a lot of thought going to it having a machine that was this small in comparison with something like the ms @atk that was there. you know there is a big difference, and there is a beauty to this this came before but this was been the sort of machine that people would recognize as a computer i think for for cried to come along and have a product that looked like this it was space-age at the time look at the manual the menu itself has got that kind of space-age representation on it and i think there a lot is to be said for the designers of these machines as much as they were built to that price point they were done in a way you know with a with a very pretty professionally plastic molded case, so i think a lot has to be created succinctly on that school and he had a history of it as well miniaturization to a fault in some cases you know he was making miniature tvs and little radios and this kind of stuff and the calculators that was making sometimes he was trying to get too much institute to smaller space and that caused heat problems and whatever, but you know to have successes. you've got our failures and in my mind, this is a huge huge success, and i think to a lot of people's minds a really really important machine the bbc put out to tender a project to create a machine that they could use for their television program so the government were very much pushing the idea of home computers and trying to get everybody involved with them and understand them what they were because there's a bit resistance. it's you know computers. they're gonna lose all their jobs at this time you know this is computers were the thing that were you know kind of feared ins in some respects so the government were pushing that kind of thing and the bbc we're going to make a programme about it they put out to tender for this this project they specification the bbc computer itself was pretty much spect up by the bbc they take a lot of credit for the way that machine turned out and anybody could come along and and produce that machine or perform plans to do it sinclair did and acorn, did apparently newbury computers newbury new brain and put forward something ultimately long story short i called got that tender you could argue. they didn't necessarily have the machine they were selling to the bbc at that time and but they had plans and they knew what they were gonna do to make it and sinclair just didn't get it now the whys and wherefores of that i don't know but bottom line is you lost that and he was really angry about it, and you know field microman connor puts that into into perspective but some but yeah, it was just one of those things his sort of specifications for the machine that he thought should be used didn't really match with what the bbc wanted, and you know you could argue that there were there were reasons why sinclair probably should have been yeah, the cost is a big deal the bbc micro is 399 pound and for a lot of people they use their bbc micros at school they typed in lines of code really really simple basic programs there's only kind of the higher end students that were that were getting in there and doing the clever stuff so you could argue actually the sinclair probably did have and i know actually was in schools anyway a place within when schools and within teaching because of the price point you know a lot more students would have been have it would've had access to it so yeah, i know schools had them anyway. you know they went out and bought it seemed closed because of that price programs on those tapes and load them in from tape so that was feasible we tended to spend ages just getting the volume exactly right
