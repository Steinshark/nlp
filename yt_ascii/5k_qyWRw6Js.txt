in a huge recent announcement microsoft has decided to abandon cn c++ and go full force on rust but why is microsoft adopting rust so aggressively and what does this mean for rust developers like you and me it means there will now be an there will be an increase in the market by 120% new available jobs we're literally going to go from 10 all the way up to 22 jobs i hope everybody is excited about this like man there's going to be rust jobs for every everybody that is part of that 12 new jobs recently created like we're going to i mean things are we're doubling we're d we're doubling this year rust jobs everybody get ready i'm excited you're excited let's do this ceo time thank you oprah over the last several years microsoft has been taking bigger and bigger steps towards making rust a critical part of its software stack i've heard this they're actually like trying to put it into places right you're addicted to rust yeah you're addicted to rust that's that's fair the thing the thing thing about rust is that uh it is addictive all of a sudden you'll find yourself talking to other developers about algebraic types when you use go you're going to be like there's no algebraic types like once you start once you start doing that you know things go wrong okay things go real wrong micro hard is better than micro macro hard is better than microsoft absolutely 2019 microsoft started experimenting with migrating low-level windows components from cnc plus plus in 2019 i didn't i wasn't ready to experiment with rust you know you know i know that you're supposed to you know experiment and really try to understand who you are i just wasn't ready then you know i i started in i think 2021 or something like that it was good al and stated that their early experiments were going well in 2021 the rust foundation was formed with microsoft being one of its founding members this completely explains everything it all the sudden makes so much sense every last part of this can't wait for trademark policy part two let's go we're ready committing to invest at least $1 million per year towards funding the russ project in 20122 the cto of azure mark verasovich posted a controversial i remember this one i like how he just like time to halt starting any new projects in c and c++ i feel like there could be some reasons to use c or c++ c is really nice for embedded programming i know people love rust for embedded programming and i think if it involved any form of moving items like a just anything that could hurt me i think i'd rather use rust just because if i'm going to get my hand squashed i'd rather get my hand squashed because of bad logic not because i acd divide it by zero or some nonsense not that rust actually protects you against that anyways but i do like this idea of yeah yeah the radiation therapy machine exactly but then there's also like game development like what are you going to do you going to just say that we shouldn't do game development anymore i mean it's a real thing that there's so much momentum and expertise you just go just use bevy it's like oh okay yeah just use bevy yeah sure sure yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hey hey everybody else you're gonna you're going to [ __ ] off because c++ doesn't exist anymore it's stupid we don't start new projects we're going to just use bevy yeah yeah we're going to just do that right now it's just like that's it's probably not going to happen you know what i mean tweet stating it's time to stop using can you explain the difference between gc and non-gc yeah gc keeps track of objects for you non gc you keep track of objects and you delete them when they're time to be deleted c and c++ for new projects and instead this guy possibly can't work for a living probably not when you're tweeting like this you probably don't work but don't worry he's a vp vp classic rust for projects where a non-garbage collected language is required during a conference talk mark confirmed that this is actually a policy at azure mark also mentioned that the azure team was looking at converting existing c projects to rust and in may of 2023 rust officially made its way into the linux kernel cementing its place in one of the most important codebases in the world but microsoft yeah that explains more about azure than anything else yeah azure asz you are everyone's favorite hosting platform is this why asz you are is impossible to use absolutely absolutely okay real talk let's get rusty just said that windows 11 is one of the most important code bases of all time how do you guys feel about that statement i'm seeing a lot of l's l take you know what i'm going to halt i'm going to halt you guys right there okay i'm going to halt you right there you know my young adolescent brain would never have been where i'm at right now if if it wasn't for windows okay i learned to love the computer because i played doom okay doom was so good it was so so good and then afterwards unreal came out with the unreal editor tell me for one moment that the unreal editor did not make you want to become a programmer id kfa ids pis pd we all know that okay if you're not down with the ids pis poopd you ain't down with nothing okay you're not down in this stream you're going to get banned most recent announcement is the single biggest step towards rust adoption we've seen and it's by far the most exciting dave weston the vice president of operating system security and enterprise at microsoft recently announced that microsoft is going to invest $10 million into developer tooling to make rust a first class language at microsoft it's okay so let's break that down for a second what does $10 million mean well first david you got to remember that you got to first pay up the chain right so the the vp is going to take a good percentage of that along with all the directors and managers so you got to fund all of that all the way up and down okay so now you got some hiring you got you got hiring you got all this okay so really they're like investing like $6 million into it okay of the $6 million you got to remember at least 2 million is going to be just purely spent on standups retros and post-mortems okay just nothing but but agile right it's just like the agile manifesto is going to happen okay so the remaining 3 million will hire two rust developers they're going to get two rust developers for approximately two years increasing again the job market by several percentages like i mean we're talking we're talking maybe even maybe even two-digit increase in the amount of rust developing jobs available so good yeah yeah how much of the i didn't even talk about marketing that was a good point i completely missed the whole marketing part no secret that memory bugs are a major security threat in microsoft products causing roughly 70% of all vulnerabilities that's why microsoft has been investing in a memory safe language like rust so heavily and it seems to be paying off because microsoft has decided to double down this investment is hold hold on hold on re re rewind that i think i must have heard that incorrectly because i knew microsoft was investing in something like rust but are they betting on rust or are they betting on a a separate thing like rust threat in microsoft products causing roughly 70% of all vulnerabilities that's why microsoft has been investing in a memory safe language like rust so heavily and it seems to be paying off because microsoft has decided to double down is it r sharp are we getting our sharp we're getting our sharp we're getting our sharp let's go our sharp we're going to do this dude i can't wait for rshp it's going to be so good it's going to be so good it's going to have every everything you've ever wanted crab sharp crystal net rshp yeah absolutely absolutely investment is a crystal clear signal of the company's commitment to the language it will open the door for rust to be used by the 100,000 plus developers employed by microsoft meaning more software will get built-in rust and more can hold rewind that what did i just hear mment to the language it will open the door for rust to be used by the 100,000 plus developers employed there's a 100,000 developers at windows or i mean at microsoft that's so many you know when you think about it it's just so many people i mean i know they make a lot of products it just feels like a lot 999,000 work at azuer that's why it's only semi- shitty classic classic semi- shitty each responsible for 10 lines of code i mean like really how many i mean excel is big obviously access the world's greatest database probably also garners many hundreds of developers they have a [ __ ] ton of divisions i know it's just crazy by meaning more software will get built in rust and more rust job opportunities will become available i'm incredibly happy to hear this news but let me know what you guys think about this latest development in the comment section below before you go make sure to get your free ri by heading over to let's ryi hope you've enjoyed the video and remember to stay rusty so hey to be fair i've actually never looked at let's get rusty uh.com cheat sheet let's look at it right now cheat sheet let's see what we got here oh you get a little you get a little newsletter you get a little you get a little newsletter you know what i'm going to sign up right here right now you know why because i don't got anything against you let's get rusty why don't you quit attacking me needlessly okay have you thought about that have you thought about that okay it's in the spam folder potentially but we got it we got that pdf the name is you should always watch the videos till the end and then hit the like button and make sure you're subscribed like i am okay that's what you do when you like somebody okay that's what you do do you guys do that and why is microsoft investing in rust i don't really quite get it i mean i get it for the whole windows thing but man $10 million you know when you really think about it that's not very very much i mean how much does microsoft spend on on on staff right now per year i bet you it's literally billions a couple billion dollars i don't think it's very much the name is about 350 a jen
