we've so far talked about the ibm 9020 which is this big beast up here and that really had two functions we've talked about flight data processing which is the information about what the aircraft intends to do but the other major facet of this is radar data processing so you can look at a point of view that the flight plan tells us what the aircraft intended to do the radar tells us what it's actually doing and they're not necessarily the same thing there's all sorts of reasons why the flight doesn't actually follow the original flight plan it can be due to weather it can be due to congestion there's all sorts of reasons this was the first time we were able to bring the two together flight and radar data processing but that was all this did it just did the processing somehow we have to display all of that a lot so we now total over here and this is an early example of a radar data processing system it's called the process radar display system and essentially what happened was that radar information which is pure this is a radar plot of this particular aircraft with no other real information associated with it would then be routed to this equipment which would then be responsible for determining which controller needed to see it so effectively doing the routing but then also down at the bottom here one of the world's earliest graphics cards a pdp 1134 which was just simply there in order to take the radar data and actually work out how to paint that onto the radar screen vector graphics drawn rather than raster drawn and a very early example of a graphics card and that in turn down a jolly great long cable would feed to this kind of a display here this is actually a slightly later display but it's the same sort of general type of display all that's in here is really the technology that's required to take the graphics generated positional data and actually paint it onto the screen these screens were outrageously expensive i think they're in the tens of thousands of pounds back in the 1970s and they were also rather easy to break as well so we're always very very careful with these these are all different radars that can feed in so you've actually got a switch up here that selects the different radars and because this could be running what's called bypass mode so the control is how he used to do in the old days the controller would select whichever radar gave him the best image for the area that he was trying to work on and those are the various on-route radars so you'd have at least two of these screens sometimes more of them for each sector so this is a sector display how big is a sect today a sector varies in size depending on what's going on there's some sectors like for example the london tma terminal moving area which is really quite small because there's an awful lot of stuff going on as you get further and further afield so the sectors get larger and larger the other thing that can happen is the sectors can change shape between different times of day and so on so for example at night there's much less air traffic and therefore controlling it is much easier so you can make the sectors bigger and then as the traffic starts building up in the early morning as the flights start coming across in the states you make the sectors back smaller again and that's something else which we were able to do as a result of introducing computers into it this idea of dynamic allocation of sector size which before then had been really quite difficult you might have heard of occasions when there's been a few hiccups with the air traffic control centers and usually it's to do with changing the size of the these sectors but again the code's been in there for a long time now i think we've got pretty well all the bugs out of it the controller would use this rollerball to for example highlight a particular aircraft and draw a vector to indicate how far away he would be in five minutes time or something like that this predates the mouse really but in fact in some respects it's probably a better system they are still using rollerball technology for radar display systems even to this day because it's in one place it never moves i was up at crestwood control center just about a year ago and watched them using this to work out so i've got a radar paint sort of showing that the aircraft is such and such and and we know what speed he's going at so we can then draw a vector which says that's where he's going to be in five minutes time which allows him to see whether he's got any issues with collision avoidance or anything like that and also to just get the timing sorted out these the controller is trying to vector this aircraft onto the instrument landing system so it's a useful idea if you can sort of say oh i'll be at such and such place in five minutes time or two minutes time whatever so this is a very early example of the of the radar display using the data from the ibm 1920. that sounds ever so easy there was actually lots and lots of steps along the way and in fact it took many years before the radar data was really being processed by the ibm 1920 and displayed in native form on this this type of display there was also bypass systems because like all of these things we don't want it failing so there's always there's always standby systems and standbys to the standby systems and so on and a lot of that had to be implemented for the for the raid artist side of things as well how was the sort of refresh on something like that how often would it be refresh well it's effectively refreshed all the time because it's a vector graphics drawn system but the radars typically rotate one rotation every four seconds so you're only going to get an update in terms of the radar data about every four seconds and what you actually see is like a little you see a blob where the aircraft is and coming off that there's a line and then a box and in that box you've got information about the aircraft it's altitude the aircraft call sign its type where it's going from where it's going to whether it's ascending or descending if you've looked at flight radar 24 they do a very similar thing that's using a thing called adsb which is a broadcast positional information system from commercial aircraft and effectively plotting that using servers and then you can pick that up on the internet so and what they've done is they more or less followed the same kind of radar display appearance as you would have at a control center going back to our early graphics card only how many of those would there be in the air traffic control i think it was something of the order of a hundred so it's quite a big investment and a lot of real estate as well how much were those sorts of things costing them i don't know to be honest i think they were probably in the quite a few thousand pounds each type of category so you know there would be there'd have been large chunks of million pounds worth of equipment there but back in those days hardware was very expensive safety first as well yes the whole idea was everything was resilient so and of course this wasn't the only place we were using computers the computers were coming into air traffic control in just about every every sort of capacity this is the kind of radar display that we have today and essentially all of the hardware that's required all the computing and all the processing that's required for this sector is actually built into the display now everything's connected together with fiber optic networking isn't a problem anymore so we can actually afford to have the the processing out in the display other than that it's more or less exactly the same type of display it's still a vector graphics display because that gives you a better quality of image and the screens are still outrageously expensive this is the sort of thing that they'll be sitting in front of at sonic there's also a brand new control center up at trestwick as well which does from 55 degrees north broadly speaking the scottish border what's interesting to note is as another example of resilience is that the press wick with a certain amount of hassle could do all the work that's being done at sonic and swan it could do all the work that's being done at presswick it would take a bit of doing but if for any reason one or other of the control centers was unable to function then the whole of the air traffic control in the uk could be run from one or from the other one of the things that i decided to try and do was to write a game where the computer played monopoly and you can see here the high-speed printers these printers would run at 600 lines per minute i wrote this whole thing in assembler the computer would make a move and it would then print the monopoly board so this thing was throwing up pages like mad and
