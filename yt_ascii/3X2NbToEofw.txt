hello everyone and welcome recently i attended northwest automotive press association's mudfest an event where i was able to try out 27 different all-wheel drive and 4x4 trucks and suvs now i conducted one test with every single vehicle there a 60 m per hour to 0o mph breaking test on pavement now if you haven't yet watched my video on the nissan titan and how it outbreak a mini cooper in that video i go into the details of how i perform this test and whether or not you can trust the data in this video we're just going to be analyzing the data not the test itself and so we're going to be answering three questions we're going to do this in slideshow form and i know slideshows are pretty much the worst thing ever but it's a great way to to show all of this data in a shorter amount of time realistically i'm not going to be putting you know plotting this on my whiteboard so we're going to be answering three questions in this video do heavy cars have less grip do wider tires have more grip and what's the most important factor for tire grip and so we're going to be answering this looking at the data from my test so here we have a plot of all the different cars there's 27 dots here on this screen weight on the left hand side from 3,000 lb to 7,000 lb stopping distance from0 ft 270 ft here on the right and so here are all of the different cars which i tested and as you can see it's a pretty random plot now just to kind of fill out which ones we've got here bmw x4 had the shortest stopping disc distance we'll get into why later on nissan armada for its weight did really well so a 6,000lb vehicle and it's stopping pretty much even with the mitsubishi outlander sport about a 3,250 lb vehicle also stopping at about 124 ft you know one of the better ones for sure but also very impressive that the nissan was right there with it and then the heaviest vehicle of our test stopping at a little over 163 162 ft was the ram power wagon weighing at about 7,000 lb now if we plot a trend line on this data we can determine whether or not there's actually a correlation and as you can see there's a slight linear positive correlation but the r value and basically this just tells us how relevant is this trend line one would be it's perfectly relevant zero would be it's completely meaningless and as you can see this is a very low r value so really this isn't a very meaningful trend line here and you know a big driving factor will be that outlier up there which you know stops very far and it has weighs quite a bit so there's not a real correlation between weight and stopping distance the only correlation is there is a slight correlation that as you increase in weight you will increase in stopping distance again that nissan armada kind of putting the myth to rest that you know you can't be heavy and have a good stopping distance it does it so moving on here we have stopping distance versus tire width so i took all of the different vehic vehicles tire widths versus their stopping distance and you know this is the plot you get and also interesting because it's quite scattered there doesn't seem to be a strong correlation between the tire width and how quickly it stopped the widest tires were on a jeep wrangler this actually had some aftermarket mud tires the ford raptor super wide tires on it but also not stopping all that great ram power wagon pretty wide tires third widest of the group and long long stopping distance but you know part of this there is a correlation because heavier cars are going to tend to have wider tires so it's somewhat similar of a plot as our weight versus versus just looking at width bmw is still doing the best even though its tires are somewhat in the middle of the group as far as the width there's plenty of cars with narrower tires that are stopping in a longer distance plenty of cars with wider tires stopping in a longer distance volkswagen track one of the you know narrowest tires here the only car with 205 tires on it doing a really nice job of stopping and this was actually one of the most fun cars to drive out there of the entire group this volkswagen all track is a blast to drive so i did want to kind of highlight that toyota highlander just one kind of sitting here in the middle of all this data just for reference and we will get into later in the video all of the numbers for all the different vehicles so here's our trend line for stopping distance versus tire width our value of .26 which again means not a strong correlation and actually what this correlation is telling us is that as tires get wider the stopping distance increases which you know intuitively we know pretty much isn't really true so is there a way you know we can manipulate the data to show for the fact that you know heavier cars tend have wider tires and yes of course there is so what i have done here and i know these units make no sense so just hear me out i am not the person that puts mim and in on tires someone decided that a long time ago so what's happening here is we're taking the weight per millimeter of tire per tire so for example this number five right here means that on the front left tire alone you're going to have five pounds of weight for every millimeter of that tire and so what that does is it kind of normalizes it for the weight so that we can discuss based on you know how much pressure is actually acting on the tire per its width so you would expect to see that tires with less weight on them for how wide they are would have better stopping distances and that is indeed what you see but with an extremely poor correlation 0137 r value meaning that there isn't really a strong correlation here with the data as far as you know that there being that trend that as there's less weight on the tire per its width the stopping distance is shorter so interesting to see that you know weight and width just based on all of this data doesn't doesn't show a strong correlation with stopping distance now if you were to take the same vehicle and increase its tire width or decrease its weight you would expect to see the stopping distance decrease and the reason why is something called tire load sensitivity which i will include a link to in the video description explaining the physics of why that happens so just looking at some of the different vehicles on this plot we've got here ram power wagon of course that outlier as as usual the jeep wrangler the reason i have the star here is because i don't actually think i i have an accurate weight for the jeep wrangler it had a ton of aftermarket parts on it and it had aftermarket tires on it big huge tires that i'm sure are very heavy so i don't think i have an accurate weight i don't think it's actually 3 lb per millimeter of width on the tire i think it's probably going to be floating up more in this range but i don't know what the weight is because we didn't have a scale out there to weigh all of these aftermarket parts mitsubishi outlander sport is the lightest vehicle of the group and there you can see stopping distance doing pretty well nissan armada again one of the heaviest vehicles in the group and here it is doing a pretty good job of stopping quite early okay so we've determined that tire width and tire weight the the amount of weight the vehicle weighs don't strongly correlate with stopping distance so now i split all of the vehicles up based on what kind of tire they had so if a vehicle had all season tires here we see that they stopped between about 123 ft 122 ft and 140 ft versus allterrain tires stopped from 133 is somewhere in there all the way to the 163 is which is that ram power wagon mud terrain the jeep wrangler was the only vehicle with that tire and then the only vehicle and the fastest stopping distance was that bmw x4 so the reason why this bmw beat everyone even though it doesn't have the widest tires or the least weight is because it was on summer tread and so you know destroyed the compet competition on road honda crv did the best of all the vehicles with the allseason tires stopping in at like 122 something jeep compass trailhawk and the lexus gx 460 are on allseason tires and those were stopping at about 140 ft the nissan titan really does an incredible job of stopping on road and that's why i made a separate video explaining how it did this how it's able to break out of this norm for allterrain tires and into this allseason territory and yet still do well off-road because it is an allterrain tire and then the jeep wrangler here in the mud terrain tire you know kind of performing like an allterrain tire as far as stopping distance so pretty interesting to see but you can see that there is a strong correlation between the tire type and you know where the stopping distance is so all season not quite as good as summer all terrain not quite as good as all season now here's where things get interesting because what i also did another test from 20 mph to zero offroad on a dirt path so this is just basically a straight dirt strip and i took all the cars accelerated above 20 mph and then did my same stopping distance and so what's interesting to see here these this is our same graph that we were just looking at two slides earlier it's just kind of condensed now and we're looking at 20 to z rather than 60 to z so here's all the all see se bunched up here's the old terrains mud terrain and the summer tire summer tire of course doing the best and then above that this is our off-road testing group so these are all the same cars but in two different groups on-road and off-road and so what's interesting to see here is that we basically flip the characteristics of the tires so the allterrain tires have great stopping distance off-road they don't have great stopping distance on road the allseason tires are kind of a mix between on and off-road but they do worse generally speaking than the allterrain tires the mud terrain tire not doing great onroad but doing fantastic off-road the summer tire doing you know the absolute best onroad and one of the worst off-roads so pretty interesting to see that you know everything pretty much flips when you go off-road versus onroad and we can plug in a few of these what was most interesting to me is that the ram power wagon had the absolute worst stopping distance on the road and the absolute best stopping distance offroad and then just another data point here the mitsubishi outlander sport really fought outside of its class the best allseason tire and it's the lightest vehicle so pretty interesting how well the mspi outlander sport did this is of course the bmw this is of course the jeep wrangler so why did the ram power wagon you know have that shortest stopping distance off-road but the longest distance on road so this is where i want to talk about the difference between allseason and allterrain tires i've got this amazing sketch that i did truly breathtaking imagery here so we have an allseason tire on the road and when it's on the road you've got less tread block movement you don't have these you know knobby patches here these knobby tread blocks you've got a large contact patch and you've got an onroad compound and so all of that adds up to a great stopping distance on road an alterrain tire on the other hand has this tread block movement you know you're going to have movement these tread blocks and that's not going to be as good for stopping on road you've got a smaller contact patch as a result of the style of the tread and you've got this off-road compound this compound that's better suited for off-road conditions versus once we go off-road the allseason tire isn't quite as able to dig in and so it's going to slide across the surface and you'll have you know abs try and minimize that slip but an interesting thing that abs does off-road is that it will try to allow for a bit more slip because by allowing for more slip what you do is you allow mud and dirt etc to pile up in front of the tire and so that kind of helps you slow down so if you just basically lock this tire up you'll actually do really well off-road whereas onroad if you were to just lock up you'll slide and you won't do as well so because it's got these you know knobby grooves in it it can help dig into that so that ramp power wagon's super heavy it's got these knobby tires it can dig into that dirt and when you lock it up it's going to shovel this you know mound in front of it so it can up in a in a nice short distance so it's interesting to see you know the difference there between the different tire types so what have we learned well we learned that tire width and tire load play a minimal role in grip versus tire type that's not to say that tire width and tire load aren't important they are but versus the tire type that's going to be your most critical component you know is it an all season is it a summer tire what's the compound made of that's what's going to determine really your stopping distance so if you want more grip you know if you're using this to modify your own car and you want more grip the best method is to try different tires first different tire compounds different tire types and then work with tire width or weight reduction you don't want to just say you know what i i don't have quite enough grip i'm going to buy my exact same tire and a wider tire unless you have the best tire out there on the market you're not going to improve your stopping distance that much versus if you were to just switch over to a better tire so focus on tire type first then tire width and weight reduction if you're trying to improve your tire grip so here is a list of all the different vehicles i tested and their stopping distance there's a couple things i do want to point out here if you see a star next to the data this means that i didn't actually i wasn't able to achieve a 60 to zer i was only able to achieve a 50 to zero so this number right here is extrapolated based on the 50 to zero data using an average of all the different cars 50 to zeros and then extrapolating that out to the 60 to z now i did a lot of playing around with the data and i am very conf confident in these numbers being accurate within a couple feet so you know know that this isn't the real number versus anything that doesn't have a star next to it but that it is going to be pretty close to the actual stopping distance based on its 50 to zero which gives you a good indication of its 60 to zero and you know as you can see here we've got summer at the top all season as we go through the one exception the nissan titan pro 4x which i have a separate video covering because it is pretty fascinating how they're able to do this the jeep wrangler sport with the mud terrain and then all of our allterrain tires another thing to note is that the jeep wrangler and the honda ridgeline were both on aftermarket tires these were on aftermarket tires this was you know a giant 315 or 317 bf goodrich mud trrain these are 37 inch tires and the honda ridg line was on these nitto ter grapplers aftermarket tires so you can see the honda ridgel line one of the best stopping distances in the dirt but one of the worst on the pavement that's a result of those aftermarket tires and another interesting thing i was told that for the off-road testing the ram power wagon did lower its pressure i believe it was 15 psi so traditionally this is at about 60 psi and they lowered that pressure to i believe 45 psi which definitely will help it you know kind of dig in give it more contact with the ground and give it a better stopping distance so not only did it have the right tires for it it had the right tire pressure which was critical i believe everything else was running at stock tire pressure so this one you know for the off-road portion did lower it but you know that's something if you're going to go offroad you you would want to do you would want to lower the pressure a bit you know not necessarily fair in the comparison because not everybody was doing that but impressive nonetheless you know it's not just the tire pressure that's the reason why this got to you know 22 feet and nothing else was there but interesting to see so you know you can look over this data enjoy you know looking at all the numbers here we've got weight tire width tire brand tire model so you can actually do some tire comparison here some of the cars do have the same tire for example the honda crv touring and the kia sportage sx turbo both on hand cook kenergy gts both with a very good 60 to z 122.5 versus you know 124.5 so both of them did really well it seems like a nice tire you know you can you can look at tire comparisons on here so thank you guys for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
