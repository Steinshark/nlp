hello everyone and welcome. in this video we're gonna be talking about a very cool type of combustion, which uses gasoline and diesel fuel in the same engine and in labs has been shown to achieve thermal efficiencies of 60%. so it's called rcci, reactivity controlled compression ignition, and that's what we're gonna be talking about in this video. i know this looks like a ton of information but it's gonna be a great general overview of how this engine works. a lot of the research for this engine has come out of the university of wisconsin, so shout out to the university of wisconsin for the work that they've done on this very cool stuff. so first we're gonna get into the engine, then we will talk about how combustion works. we'll get into some of the finer details about you know different loads, thermal efficiencies, air-to-fuel ratios, that kind of thing. then get into finally the pros and cons of the engine toward the end. so how does the engine work? well the whole idea is that you have two different types of fuel: one with a low reactivity and one with a high reactivity. so in this case we have a port injector which will be injecting gasoline (you can choose to use other different fuels, they've tested out natural gas and ethanol as the low reactivity fuel), and then you have direct injection of a high reactivity fuel, in this case diesel fuel. so diesel fuel has a short ignition delay: the time that it takes from when that fuel is injected to when it ignites. and it wants to ignite in those conditions versus the gasoline (which) doesn't want to ignite in those conditions it has a lower reactivity. and so that's the basic structure of the engine where you're going to have two different types of fuel: one with high reactivity one, with low reactivity. it doesn't have to be gasoline and diesel, but that's what in this video we're talking about, and that's what a lot of their testing involved was using gasoline and diesel fuel. okay so how does combustion occur within this engine? so we're gonna go through the steps that take place. of course the first one being you've got that port injector so during your intake stroke as that piston is moving down pulling in an air fuel mixture of gasoline and air. then it starts to compress and there are going to be two injections of diesel fuel. so the first one is injected before that air fuel mixture has gotten very hot so it's not hot enough to ignite that fuel. and it's going to start mixing that diesel fuel with the gasoline kind of creating this kind of layer, this area right here which is a mix of gasoline and diesel fuel, versus just gasoline which will be around the outside so that's going to start to mix in and then as that piston gets closer to the top then you're going to be injecting a little bit more diesel fuel which is used purely for ignition and you could inject a bit more actually for the air fuel ratio but you're doing that final injection to start combustion so what happens with that second injection is you have what is called a cool flame, so it's a diesel cool flame and it's just the diesel fuel that has been injected. that's starting to ignite not that you know mixture of gasoline and diesel fuel and so there's a little low reactive just on that very edge of that fuel that's injected in a very small you know cool flame is what it's called because there's not a lot of heat that comes out as a result of it but it's enough heat to start combustion and the rest of the chamber so once that cool flame has started that forces the diesel and gasoline mixture which is around it to then ignite and then once that diesel and gasoline mixture starts to ignite that of course causes the gasoline which is around the rest of the cylinder to ignite so that's kind of the three-step process you have that cool flame you have the mixture that ignites, and then you have the gasoline that ignites and so if you look at a pressure curve so here on the bottom. we've just got degrees of the crankshaft rotation so zero would be top dead center negative 10 will be 10 degrees before top dead center and so you can see first you've got that cool flame which causes a little pressure rise then you have that mixed area which starts to ignite? and then you have finally another pressure bump once that gasoline ignites, so that's the process of combustion and depending on how you change the ratio of diesel fuel to gasoline this curve will change pretty dramatically ok so now let's talk about some test results and some you know data surrounding real engines using this style of combustion so in this case we're gonna be talking about a 2.44 liter single cylinder. this is a heavy duty engine so it's just a single cylinder 2.44 liter caterpillar scot engine with a compression ratio of 16.1:1 operating at 1300 rpm they also did testing in a 1.9 liter gm four-cylinder engine just to prove that it can be used light duty and heavy duty applications but the results we're discussing here are from the single cylinder 2.44l and so we're gonna be talking about the gasoline percentage the air fuel ratio and the thermal efficiency and basically the way this test works is they hold the engine constant at 1300 rpm and then they vary the load, so essentially how much throttle it's getting so very low throttle to full throttle and measuring different points the gasoline percentage air fuel ratio and thermal efficiency at these different points and so of course you know what what you're doing essentially is you're taking that dyno and it's braking the engine as the load increases to make sure that the rpm stays at 1300 rpm but the load can vary and so starting off with the gasoline percentage at lower load you use less gasoline and part of this is because gasoline resists ignition at low loads it's one of the reasons why hcci engines which are kind of like the holy grail are so difficult is because they it's hard to have low load gasoline auto ignition versus you know in this engine you're using two different fuels and you're using diesel fuel as your ignition source so you can get away with using gasoline at low loads and things like that but essentially as you increase in load you increase the percentage of gasoline and that's not a perfect correlation there's kind of a sweet spot in there, and then it dips back down and comes back up but essentially at lower loads you're using less gasoline more diesel fuel at higher loads you're using as much as 90% gasoline with just 10% diesel fuel and most of the time you're going to be injecting most of the diesel fuel in that first injection so the one that mixes but some points you know in this load range you actually do inject more diesel fuel in that second injection so it's there's a lot going on control wise while this is happening while you're sweeping that range of the engine within that set rpm so the air fuel ratio as you might expect is very high at low load and then it gets lower so once you're getting to you know majority, gasoline of course you've got to get that air fuel ratio down much lower but when you've got that mix of diesel fuel and gasoline very cool you can actually operate at this forty five to one air/fuel ratio so at low load you can get you know super good fuel efficiency because you're using a really high air to fuel ratio and you know you're not using too much fuel of course because you're at low load your efficiency is still high so that's kind of what the coolest thing about this is is that the thermal efficiency worst case on this chart right here is 49% and of course you know this is a pretty efficient rpm as you get into higher rpm the efficiency will start to decrease but what's very cool is that across the entire load range your worst case scenario is 49% thermal efficiency and you know kind of peaks in the center here at 56% thermal efficiency so for context mazda's spcci engine which is super efficient, currently they're skyactiv x engine which is an on sale yet is peaking somewhere around you know forty three ish percent. they haven't released actual numbers, but they've said it's slightly better than the best that's out there. which is in the toyota prius which is around forty two percent now diesel engines will have better efficiency they'll tend to be you know in the forty eight close to 50 percent region but this is exceeding diesel efficiency so very cool what's possible using the combination the best of both worlds between gasoline and diesel. okay so that leads us to pros and cons and one of the things we haven't even discussed in this video is the huge benefit that this engine has which is emissions, and so it has very low nitrogen oxide emissions and very low particulate matter so soot and you know this is kind of a trouble, a burden on diesel engines but because this has very cool burning it doesn't produce the nitrogen oxides and because the diesel fuel has time to mix and because you're not using a lot of that diesel fuel most of your fuel is mixed well mixed and well mixed fuel doesn't tend to produce particulate matter it's where you have those rich pockets of fuel that produces particulate matter so particular matter and nitrogen oxide and ox emissions are very very low in this engine and so that's a huge benefit of it aside from the fact that it's extraordinarily efficient so super efficient ten to fifteen percent more efficient than you know some of the diesel engines out there and this is mainly as a result of having lower combustion temperatures and because of that less heat transfer within the cylinder so actually when they achieved in the lab the 60% thermal efficiency one of the things they did is they didn't have oil cooling for the piston because they found out that that oil cooling actually pulled out some of the work. that was being done you know from combustion so you know a you know a method that they used in order to slightly improve the efficiency there but they were able to achieve 60 percent thermal efficiency in lab testing so very cool to see eliminate exhaust after treatment, so that's a really cool thing that they were able to do based on 2010 epa requirements they were able to meet those requirements without any exhaust after treatment which of course everything that's diesel is using exhaust ever after treatments to take care of it if they're doing it correctly and so you know pretty interesting that there is a way that you could possibly get around that and if you could you could save a ton of money by not having all that expensive equipment in the exhaust required for diesel engines today so some of the disadvantages well two fuels obviously is an ideal for a consumer you don't want to have two separate tanks to fill up then you've got two separate fuel systems to worry about so that kind of is you know a disadvantage to think about also you know there are there are there is research occurring in which you're only using one fuel and then either treating it or kind of getting into some different methods at which you can use a single main fuel tank and either add additives or manipulate that fuel somehow so you can still have this kind of combustion method so perhaps i'll do a video later on talking about something like that and of course, this is a development engine, so there's plenty of kinks to work out. it's still being developed it's not mass-produced so it's not as simple and amazing as this you know short little whiteboard video makes it seem there are definitely challenges with it. i also think you know if you're going to have a peak efficiency without oil cooling that's probably not ideal unless you've got pistons that can somehow handle not having that oil cooling or that 60% thermal efficiency was achieved, but regardless you know they they are able to achieve 56% you know pretty easily so it's a truly and very cool efficient method of combustion if you guys found this interesting i will certainly include some related videos of other different styles of combustion and their benefits and also i will include some research which kind of shows you know behind you can go into the research that this video is based off of if you care to check that out the language will not be quite as nice as this video you're gonna get all kinds of crazy acronyms and that kind of thing, but if you'd like to check it out i'll certainly include links to it. so thank you all so much for watching, and if you would like to leave any
